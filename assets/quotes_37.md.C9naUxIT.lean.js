The region has the lowest altitude in India, and is one of the few places in the world where farming is carried on around below sea level. Kuttanadu is historically important in the ancient history of South India and is the major rice producer in the state. Farmers of Kuttanad are famous for Biosaline Farming. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has declared the Kuttanad Farming System as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS). Four of Kerala's major rivers, the Pamba, Meenachil, Achankovil and Manimala flow into the region. It is well known for its boat race in the Punnamada Backwaters, known in Malayalam as Vallamkalli.  History  This land had been the source of food to Changanacherry market. Later it had been allocated to Allapuzha district on the basis of landscape. The first recorded history on the origin of this land is obtained from Sangam period literature. Additionally the oral history among local people, transferred from generation to generation is a blend of myths and legends is a valuable resource. According to Sangam era documents, Uthiyan Cheralatan (Perum Chorru Udiyan Cheralathan, Athan I), or Udiyanjeral (AD first century.) is the first recorded Chera dynasty ruler of the Sangam period in ancient South India. He had his capital at a place called Kuzhumur in Kuttanad (central Kerala) and expanded the kingdom northward and eastward from his original homeland. His lifetime is broadly determined to be between first century BC and 2nd century AD. His queen was Veliyan Nallini, the daughter of Veliyan Venman. Uthiyan Cheralathan was a contemporary of the Chola ruler Karikala Chola. He is praised for his elephant corps and cavalry. Present day Changanacherry end of Kuttanad was the capital of the Chera dynasty king Uthiyan Cheralathan. His descendant was Senguttavan (Chenguttavan means \\"brave-hearted\\" in old Tamil and his name is carried by the next towns of Chenganacherri and Chengana to the present day). According to sangam literature, Cheralathan was defeated in the Battle of Venni with Karikala Chola and the capital was burnt down. Another local legend says Kuttanad was believed to be forest with dense tree growth. This forest was destroyed subsequently by a wild fire. It is a well known fact that burned black wooden logs were mined from paddy fields called as ‚ÄòKarinilam‚Äô(Black paddy fields) until the recent past. This fact throws some light on this theory of Chuttanad evolving to Kuttanad. In Kuttanad most of the place names end in kari (meaning burnt residue or charcoal). Some familiar place names are Ramankary, Puthukkary, Amichakary, Oorukkary, Mithrakary, Mampuzhakary, Kainakary, Kandanakary, Thayamkary, Chathenkary, Chathurthiakary and Chennamkary.  Divisions  The Kuttanad region is categorised into: * Lower Kuttanad * Upper Kuttanad * North Kuttanad Lower Kuttanadu comprises taluks of Ambalapuzha, Nedumudy, Kuttanadu (excluding Edathua, Thalavady, Kidangara and Muttar), and the northern half of Karthikapally taluk in Alappuzha district. Upper Kuttanad comprises Veeyapuram and Pallippad in Karthikapally taluk, Edathua, Thalavady, Kidangara and Muttar in Kuttanad taluk; Chennithala and Thripperumthura villages in Mavelikkara taluk; Mannar, Kuruttissery, Budhanoor, Ennakkad villages in Chengannur taluk of Alappuzha district; and Parumala, Kadapra, Niranam, Pulikeezhu, Nedumpuram, Chathenkary, Peringara, and Kavumbhagam villages in Pathanamthitta district. North Kuttanad comprises Vaikom taluk, western parts of Kottayam taluk, and western parts of Changanacherry taluk in Kottayam district.

Backwater paddy cultivation (Kayal cultivation)  Paddy fields in Kuttanad The major occupation in Kuttanadu is farming, with rice the most important agricultural product. This activity gives the area its moniker of \\"The Rice Bowl of Kerala\\". Large farming areas near Vembanad Lake were reclaimed from the lake. The history of paddy cultivation in Kuttanad can be traced back centuries. The evolution of paddy cultivation correlated with technological advancement and changes in the regulatory framework that existed during the 19th and 20th centuries. In earlier times, reclamation was carried out mainly from the shallow part of the Vembanad Lake or from the periphery of the Pamba River. These reclamations constituted small areas of paddy fields called padasekharams. Bailing out of water from the fields were done manually using water wheels called chakram. Gradually the manual method used for bailing out of water gave way to steam engines. There were robberies in Kuttanad in earlier days, which were prohibited by the Travancore Maharajah Moolam Thirunal. Three distinct stages can be identified in the reclamation of kayal lands from the lake. The first stage was carried out by private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the government. The Pattom Proclamation made by the Travencore Kingdom in 1865, gave a great fillip to reclamation activities between 1865 and 1888. During this period de-watering of the polders was done manually using chakram, which restricted large-scale reclamation. Only about 250 hectares of land were reclaimed during this period. Venadu kayal and Madathil Kayal were reclaimed during this period and are considered the first \\"Kayal Nilams\\" to be reclaimed from the Vembanad Lake. These pioneering reclamation activities in kayal cultivation were made by the two brothers Mathai Luka Pallithanam and Ouseph Luka Pallithanam from Kainady village in Kuttanadu. The second phase started during 1888. One of the reclamation during this period was undertaken by Chalayil Eravi Kesava Panicker. He chose to reclaim Vembanad kayal from the mouth of the Chennamkari river as it joins with the back waters. The reclaimed kayal was known as ‚Äò Attumuttu Kayal‚Äô. Other major reclamation on the same year was Seminary Kayal which was undertaken by Kottayam Orthodox Seminary. The introduction of kerosene engines for dewatering resulted in the reclamation of wider areas of the lake for cultivation. This made farmers consider venturing into the deeper parts of the lake. During the period between 1898 and 1903, reclamation activity was led by Pallithanam Luka Mathai (alias Pallithanathu Mathaichen) who reclaimed the Cherukara Kayal and Pallithanam Moovayiram Kayal. But the second phase (1890 to 1903) of reclamation activities came to a halt because of the ban on kayal reclamation imposed by the Madras Government in 1903. Cherukali Kayal, Rajapuram Kayal, Aarupanku Kayal, Pantharndu Panku kayal and Mathi Kayal were the other major reclamations during this period. In 1912, the Madras Government approved a proposal from the Travancore Government for further reclamations in three stages. Under this scheme kayal land was notified for reclamation in blocks each named with a letter of the English alphabet. Out of the total area of 19,500 acres of kayal land, 12,000 acres were reclaimed between 1913 and 1920. After the removal of the ban in 1913, Pallithanam Luca Matthai along with some other prominent families in Kuttanadu, reclaimed E-Block Kayal measuring a total area 2,400 acres. This is the biggest kayal nilam in Kuttanadu. C.J. Kurian, Ex MLC and Mr. John Illikalam were his main partners in this venture. The reclamations between 1914 and 1920, known as the new reclamations, were carried out in three periods. In the first period Blocks A to G measuring 6300 Acres were reclaimed. C Block, D Block(Attumukham Aarayiram (Attumuttu Kayal), Thekke Aarayiram and Vadakke Aarayiram) and E Block (Erupathinalayiram Kayal) F Block (Judge's Aarayiram Kayal) and G Block (Kochu Kayal) are the major Kayal nilams reclaimed during this period. During the second period of new reclamation, blocks H to N covering an area of 3600 acres were reclaimed under the leadership of Pallithanam Luca Matthai, Cunnumpurathu Kurien, Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Kunnathusseril Peious, Ettuparayil Xavier and Pattassery PP Mathai. During the third period of new reclamation, R Block Kayal covering 1,400 acres was reclaimed by the joint efforts of eight families led by then member of Sree Moolam Popular Assembly, Pallithanam Luca Matthai. His partners in the reclamation included Vachaparampil Mathen, Pazhayaparmpil Chacko, Ettuparayil Xavier, Pattassery PP Mathai, Kaarikkuzhi Ponnada Vaakkaal Mathulla Mappila (E & F block), Meledom, Paruthickal and Kandakudy. Once, while the king of travancore visited the Erupathinalayiram Kayal he was pleased and told Kaarikkuzhi Mathulla Mappila that he should have bought a Ponnada to honor him. Since he has not bought a Ponnada, he presented \\"Ponnada Vaakkaal\\" (Ponnada by word). Thereafter his house was known as Ponnada Vaakkaal. From 1920 to 1940 reclamation activity came to a halt because of a steep drop in the price of rice. Kuttanad beauty Farmers using traditional water turbines in a rice field Due to the steep decline in the price of rice between 1920 and 1940 reclamation activities slowed down, but they gained momentum again in the early 1940s. During this period, in order to increase agricultural output, a government initiated \\"Grow More Food\\" campaiagn and the provision of incentives encouraged new reclamations. The advent of electric motors made reclamation relatively easier, cheaper and less risky as compared to in earlier periods. The last tract of the reclamations namely Q, S and T block were made during this period by Thomman Joseph Murickummoottil (Muricken Outhachan) and his wife's family Puthanppura Panchara (Veliyanadu). Kuttanad Kerala As farming in the area increased, farmers felt themselves constrained by the two cycles a year for rice cultivation. The reason for which is the limited availability of potable water in Kuttanadu. During the monsoon seasons, the water from the mountains flow through the rivers to the sea, bringing potable water to Kuttanadu. But during summer, due to the low level of the region seawater enters Kuttanadu, significantly increasing the salinity of the water and making it unpotable. Also Kuttanad is recognised as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) by FAO  Thottappilli Spillway  This project was designed as a permanent solution to the flood situation in Kuttanad. This programme was envisaged in such a way that flood waters from Pamba, Manimalayar and Achankovil were diverted to the sea before it reached Vembanad lake. The construction of the Spillway ended by 1959. In 1968, the Government of India proposed that a bund (Dam) be made across the river so that seawater would not be allowed to come inside Kuttanad during summer, allowing farmers to cultivate an extra crop per year. The project was planned in three phases, the south side, the north side and another phase to join the two sections. The project was delayed and by the time the first two phases were complete the entire money allotted for the project ran out and left the final phase in limbo. The farmers who were expecting many financial benefits after the completion of the project decided to take matters into their own hands and one night in 1972, a large group of farmers filled the gap between the north and the south side with earth. To this day, the earth embankment between the two sections of the bund remains. With this, it was possible to close the regulator of shutters during December‚ÄìJune when the saline water enters, and then open it during monsoon. Once the Thanneermukkam bund and spillway became operational two crops were possible in Kuttanad. Even though the bund has improved the quality of life of the farmers, the bund is alleged to have caused severe environmental problems. The backwaters which were abundant with fish and part of the staple food of the people of the region require a small amount of salt water for its breeding. The bund has caused deterioration of fish varieties in the region and the fishermen opposed to the bund as of 2005. The bund has also disrupted the harmony of the sea with the backwaters and has caused problems not foreseen before the bund like the omniprescence of the water weeds. Earlier the salt water tends to cleanse the backwaters but this does not happen any more leading to the pollution of the backwaters and the entire land near by.

Metropolitan Wasyly (Vasylii) was born Vasyl' Fedak on November 1, 1909 in Kadubivtsi in Austrian-ruled northern Bukovyna (now Chernivtsi Oblast in Ukraine). Together with his parents and five siblings, he immigrated to Canada and settled in Sheho, Saskatchewan. In young adulthood, he became a teacher: a career that lasted 14 years. He then studied at a seminary of the UOCC from 1941 to 1944. He was ordained into the diaconate on September 27, 1944 and shortly thereafter into the priesthood on October 1. As a priest, he served parishes in Manitoba and Ontario. In 1951, he arrived in Hamilton, Ontario to serve the parish of St. Vladimir. He served this parish for 29 years, seeing the parish grow from 47 to 500 families. His wife, Paraskeviya Tymofij, whom he married in 1932, died in April 1976. Two years later, an Extraordinary Sobor (general council) of the UOCC elected him as its candidate for bishop. On July 16, 1978, he was consecrated as the Bishop of Saskatoon at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Winnipeg by Metropolitan Andrew (Metiuk)of Winnipeg, Archbishop Borys (Yakovkevych), and Bishop Mykolai (Debryn)]of Toronto. Following the death of then Archbishop Mykolai in 1981, Bishop Wasyly became the acting Bishop of the Eastern Eparchy. He was elevated to Archbishop of Toronto in 1983. Then in 1985, the 17th Sobor of the UOCC selected Wasyly to be its Metropolitan and Primate with the honorific \\"His Beatitude\\" (because he was the head of his own church. After the UOCC joined the Patriarchate of Constantinople, Metropolitans are now addressed as His Eminence), and he will be the last Hierarch (bishop) to hold that title in the UOCC, as decided by Patriarch Bartholemew I. As Primate, he was the spiritual leader of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada and Chancellor of its seminary, St. Andrew's College. Under the leadership of Metropolitan Wasyly, the UOCC came into full communion with the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1990. In 1993, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Metropolitan Wasyly reposed on January 10, 2005. His funeral took place on January 21‚Äì22 at Holy Trinity Metropolitan Cathedral in Winnipeg. He is buried at Glen Eden Cemetery. With his wife Parskeviya, he had three sons: Eugene (who has served on the church's Consistory board twice), Yaroslaw and Emil.

The title is the motto of the British Army‚Äôs elite Special Air Service (SAS). The plot is based largely on the Iranian Embassy siege of 1980, when a team from the SAS made a sudden assault on the building to rescue those being held hostage inside. As producer, Euan Lloyd was inspired to make the film by visiting the scene during the siege and watching live coverage of it on television, moving quickly to prevent someone else developing the same idea. An initial synopsis was created by George Markstein. This was then turned into a novel by James Follett, as The Tiptoe Boys, in 30 days. Meanwhile, chapter- by-chapter as the novel was completed, it was posted to Reginald Rose in Los Angeles, who wrote the final screenplay.James Follett, The Tiptoe Boys, foreword to the revised edition , 1999. The film was released in the United States as The Final Option. Plot A demonstration by unilateral nuclear disarmament protesters from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in London is interrupted when one of the protesters is violently killed. British security forces learn that a terrorist group attached to CND has been planning a significant act of terrorism for the near future. The person killed during the protest demonstration was an undercover intelligence officer who had infiltrated the terrorist group. The commanding officer of the Special Air Service, Colonel Hadley, suggests a new line of inquiry for the investigation. Two foreign officers arrive to train at the SAS's headquarters: Captain Hagen is a member of the US Army Rangers and Captain Freund is a member of the West German GSG 9. They are taken to the close quarter battle house and witness an SAS room entry assault. Colonel Hadley introduces them to the SAS man playing the hostage, Captain Peter Skellen, and informs them they will be with Skellen's troop, consisting of Baker, Dennis, and Williamson. During an exercise in the Brecon Beacons, Hadley and Major Steele discover Skellen's troop torturing Hagen and Freund. Skellen is dismissed from the Regiment. The torture and dismissal are a ruse to repaint Skellen as a disgraced former SAS operative, and Hagen and Freund as innocent victims in the scheme. Skellen's intelligence contact, Ryan, advises him to meet Frankie Leith and Rod Walker, the two people who lead the People's Lobby (PL), the terrorist group believed to be planning the act of terrorism. Skellen tells his wife that he will be going away for a while on a mission. A foreign man, Malik, arranges with a city banker for the distribution of large sums of money to various left organisations, including the PL. Skellen arranges to meet Leith at a bar frequented by PL members and initiates a romantic relationship with her, to the annoyance of Walker and his cohorts Helga and Mac. Leith takes Skellen to the organisation's offices and introduces him to the group. Leith appreciates Skellen's SAS background, and offers him a job as security consultant to the PL; she also allows him to move in with her. To strengthen Skellen's cover story, Hadley informs Hagen and Freund of Skellen's location; the wronged men attack Skellen at Leith's home and inflict a severe beating. As a result, Leith's few remaining doubts about Skellen vapourise, but Walker and his cronies still are not fully convinced. Helga observes Skellen meeting the same unknown individual (Ryan) in various locations. Their scrutiny intensifies when Walker and his associates witness Skellen's meeting with his wife and daughter. They use photos from their surveillance to convince Leith that Skellen is not all he seems. Walker orders Helga to kill Ryan, cutting Skellen's link to Hadley. Hadley has no choice but to trust Skellen's abilities to uncover the group's plans and escape alive. He orders police protection for Skellen's family. Despite his official advisory capacity, Skellen is denied details about the upcoming PL operation. On the day of the operation, Leith and Walker instruct Helga and Mac to take Skellen's family hostage. Leith uses this to blackmail Skellen into unconditional co-operation. The terrorists and Skellen arrive at the US Embassy in a hijacked coach. Wearing stolen US Air Force uniforms, they gain entry to the secure compound and take hostages of the US Ambassador, US Secretary of State, US Commander- in-Chief of Strategic Air Command, and British Foreign Secretary, along with their wives and the embassy staff. Hadley and his police counterpart, Commander Powell, arrive at the Embassy to receive the demands of the terrorists: unless a US nuclear missile is launched at Holy Loch naval base, all the hostages will be killed. Currie questions Leith's motivations, and Leith responds that her ultimate goal is the disarmament of the whole world. This opens a debate about method and political philosophy that only antagonizes the terrorists. Meanwhile, Dennis and three fellow SAS troopers arrive at Skellen's home. They set up in the attached house next door, using sensing devices to covertly observe Helga, Mac, and their captives through the wall. Skellen manages to separate himself from the group by feigning a need for the toilet. He uses a shaving mirror to heliograph floodlights and signal Hadley via Morse code, telling him to attack at 10 a.m. while Skellen creates a diversion. Hadley cannot get permission for an SAS attack because the British Home Secretary insists that Powell resolve the situation through negotiation. As the tension mounts inside the embassy, a mistake by one of the terrorists causes the death of the SAC C-in-C. This enables Powell and Hadley to get the permission for their assault. The SAS operatives in the house adjoining Skellen's remove a large area of the bricks separating the attached houses. Meanwhile, Helga's temper at the Skellen's crying baby escalates into a fight with Skellen's wife. The operatives work fast to attach a charge to the exposed wall, cut the lights and blow the wall so two SAS soldiers can shoot through the gap and kill both Helga and Mac. As the SAS mount an assault on the embassy, the terrorists panic. Skellen overpowers and kills three terrorists. The SAS, deploying from helicopters, force open doors and enter through windows. As they methodically clear the embassy, Skellen kills more terrorists including Walker. Skellen joins with Baker and his troop to search for Leith, as the other troopers bundle the hostages to safety. When Skellen hesitates to kill Leith on sight, Major Steele kills her before she can kill Skellen. The ambassador thanks the troopers as they leave the embassy. Skellen and his troop apologise to Hagen and Freund, explain the reason for their actions, and make peace. Skellen departs on one of the helicopters with his colleagues. In a government building, Sir Richard, a politician, complains to a colleague about the violent end to the siege. He then meets the financier Malik, and they discuss future similar actions. An on-screen list of notable terrorist incidents appears over the closing credits, accompanied by a rendition of The Red Flag.

Living just half a mile from the embassy, he visited it on multiple occasions during the four days it was occupied by terrorists, witnessing the dramatic ending to the siege in person. That same evening he called his lawyer in New York and asked him to register 5 titles with the Motion Picture Association of America, one of which was SAS: Who Dares Wins. In a slightly abbreviated form, this became the name of the film based on the incident which he then set out to make. \\"Since John Wayne and Jack Warner have left the scene its become unfashionable to wave the flag\\", said Lloyd. He hoped the film would counterbalance the anti-authority message of films like The China Syndrome, War Games, Missing and Gandhi. \\"I watched in awe at what these SAS men did, and truly I felt very proud\\", Lloyd said. \\"Terrorism worries me greatly, so here was an opportunity for me to say what I've felt for a long time.\\" Lloyd contacted friend, writer and former intelligence officer, George Markstein and commissioned a treatment. They decided to end the film with an embassy siege, but to make the film more relevant to US audiences they changed it to the US embassy. They also changed Iranian extremists to anti-nuclear protesters. Markstein wrote a treatment in a week, then Lloyd gave the job of writing a script to Reginald Rose. The budget was raised by pre-selling the film to various territories. Lloyd's investors were willing to go with a lesser name actor as star. The producer considered a number of options before going with Lewis Collins, then best known for The Professionals TV show.https://lewiscollins.info/Images/Gallery/WDW/Photoplay_November81_2.jpg Collins trained intensively for the part.https://lewiscollins.info/Images/Gallery/WDW/Jackie_31-7-82.jpg Judy Davis was cast on the strength of her performance in My Brilliant Career. She said she did not base her character on Patty Hearst as she felt Hearst was ultimately not serious about politics; she was inspired by Bommi Baumann and his book Terror or love?.\\"The Making of Who Dares Wins\\" at YouTube =Shooting= Filming began in September 1981. The film had a number of advisers who had worked in the SAS which led to some concerns from the Ministry of Defence that the film could breach the Official Secrets Act. However Lloyd says the ministry eventually gave its \\"tacit approval\\" to the film after two small changes to the story were made; \\"after that they opened the door quite widely and even provided three military helicopters\\", the producer said. According to the DVD commentary, the film was made with the help of the 22 SAS Regiment at Hereford, although their commanding officer Peter de la Billi√®re had initially refused to help in a pre-production meeting with Euan Lloyd. Director Ian Sharp, who was hired due to Lloyd's liking of his direction in the TV series The Professionals, was invited to SAS headquarters at Stirling Lines where he met some of the troops who assaulted the Iranian embassy. With the co-operation of the SAS achieved, production moved ahead swiftly. During one of his visits to Stirling Lines, Sharp had met a Fijian trooper who had a mishap during the Iranian embassy assault. The trooper told how he got caught up in his descent and his uniform caught fire due to the explosives used for their forced entry. Inspired by this, Sharp had a similar scene inserted. The first scenes were shot in Portobello Road market in January 1982. The concert, speech and subsequent fight were staged at the Union Chapel in Islington, London. Skellen's house and the hostage taking was shot in Kynance Mews in South Kensington.\\"Lurot Brand, Mews News, May 2003.\\" Accessed 26 July 2013 When it came time to shoot the SAS assault on the US embassy, the crew had prepared the helicopters and stuntmen but the SAS offered to do the scene instead. Sharp accepted as he thought the look they gave could not be replicated by the crew.

Filming wrapped after seven weeks.

The Guardian (1959‚Äì2003) The Washington Post enjoyed the final assault, describing it as \\"a pip\\", and praised the authenticity of the action sequences, but thought \\"an awful lot of talky, slack footage accumulates before this whirlwind payoff\\" and that the \\"storytelling rhythm is defective.\\"By, G. A. (11 October 1983). Ill-conceived 'option'. The Washington Post Within days of the film's release, producer Lloyd received a phone call from Stanley Kubrick saying how much he enjoyed the film, in particular the performance of Judy Davis. However, this praise has been disputed by Kubrick's assistant Anthony Frewin, saying that, \\"Lloyd, as the gunnery [sergeant] in Full Metal Jacket would say, is blowing smoke up our asses. That film is the antithesis of everything Stanley stood for and believed in.\\" =Reagan administration= Soon after the film was completed, copies of it were requested for viewing by the White House; it was seen by Ronald Reagan and his advisers at Camp David and they reportedly enjoyed the film. It was also enjoyed by Alexander Haig, Reagan's former Secretary of State, who had recently joined the board of MGM/UA. On his recommendation, MGM/UA bought the film for distribution in the US, retitling it The Final Option. In an interview, Haig praised the film as a \\"terribly exciting drama... a realistic portrayal of the world in which we live.\\" Proposed follow-up Euan Lloyd signed Lewis Collins to a three-picture contract on the basis of his performance. The films were to be The Wild Geese 2, Battle for the Falklands (about the Special Boat Service during the Falklands war) and Macau.

The river is located in northwest of Borneo. The river originates in the Iran Mountains, flows through Kapit, and then towards the South China Sea. At approximately of total length, it is the 4th longest river in Borneo, and the longest river in Malaysia.Rajang River Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. URL assessed on 2 September 2012 Some of the important tributaries are the Balui River, Katibas River, Ngemah River, Iran River, Pila River, Balleh River, Bangkit River and the Kanowit River. Malaysia's largest and tallest (160m) hydro electric project, Bakun Hydro Electric Dam Project, is located on narrow Bakun Fall of Balui River. Etymology In Sarawakian Malay, the main river is named Batang (meaning \\"trunk\\" or \\"tree\\" in Malay) as it is the main larger stream as they took \\"root\\" in from its tributary rivers which is known as Sungai (\\"river\\" proper in Sarawakian Malay) and branches out again at the delta. For example, Rajang River is known as Batang Rajang and Balleh River is known as Sungai Balleh in Malay.Richard C, 2010. Page 3 However, Standard Malay makes no differentiation in this regard. For upriver areas, such as the areas surrounding the headwaters, the place is named as \\"Ulu\\" (which means \\"upriver\\") or \\"Hulu\\" in Malay. For example, \\"Hulu Rajang\\" is the upriver part of the Rajang river. For bazaars along the river that are too small to call towns, they are named as \\"Nanga\\" in the Iban language, which is located at the point which the tributaries join the main river. Examples of Nangas are: Nanga Ngemah, Nanga Dap, and Nanga Poi.Richard C, 2010. Page 3 In Iban language, \\"Nanga\\" means \\"longhouse\\" and it is often followed by the name of the river that they are next to. There are also certain longhouses that use \\"Rumah\\" (meaning \\"house\\" in Malay). It often follows the name of the headman. If the headman changed, then the name of the longhouse also changed. \\"Long\\" meaning \\"confluence\\" is used by the Orang Ulu (upriver people). It is used to name the places located at the confluence between the smaller tributaries and the major river, same way as the Malay usage of the name \\"Kuala\\" (meaning river delta). Amongst the Chinese in Sibu, the Rajang River also nicknamed as the \\"Swan River\\" (ÈπÖÊ±ü). This came from a legend where famine in Sibu ended when a flock of swans flew through the skies of Sibu. There is another story where the Sibu Chinese immigrants regarded Sibu Melanau people as \\"Go\\" people because a staple food of Melanau staple food was \\"Sago\\". Coincidentally, \\"Go\\" pronunciation is similar to Hokkien pronunciation of \\"Swan\\". This reminded Sibu Chinese immigrants of \\"Swan River\\" back in Fuzhou, China. Course Sibu is located at 105 km from the river mouth The elongated Bruit Island is located at the mouth of the Rajang River The Rajang river is the longest river system in Malaysia, measuring . Its headwaters is located in the Nieuwenhuis mountains where it forms the political boundary between Malaysia and Indonesia. There is more than of rain fall each year on the Nieuwenhuis mountain range, which forms the headwaters of Rajang. The river flows from northeast to southwest. The Punan Bah people are staying at the headwaters of the Rajang. One of the Rajang tributaries, the Balui River, located at the north of Hose mountains,Hon Kah, 1996. Page 94 flows into the lands of the Kayan people and Kenyah people. There is also a great bend of the Rajang river in this region. At the western end of the great bend lies the Belaga District. Going further downstream is the Pelagus Rapids where the Iban people dominates.Richard C, 2010. Page 1 The Pelagus Rapids is located at from the Rajang river mouth. As Balleh River from the south of Hose mountainsHon Kah, 1996. Page 94 joins with the Balui river, the Rajang river become broader and deeper. The broader part of the Rajang river hosted about 25% of the people of Sarawak.Richard C, 2010. Page 2 It is also at this intersection point, about from the river mouth, the river started to flow from east to west. At this point, there is a town known as Kapit. Kapit is the last stop of express boats coming from Sibu. The town of Kapit is inhabited by the Chinese, Iban, and Kayan people.Richard C, 2010. Page 3 Kapit is the biggest town in the upper Rajang river.Hon Kah, 1996. Page 94 Further downriver are the smaller towns such as Song which is located at the mouth of the Katibas River. At about from the sea, there are Mixed Zone Lands. These lands can be owned both the Chinese and the Iban people. The lands are divided into parcels measuring several acres, where smallholders clear the land for agricultural activities.Richard C, 2010. Page 3 In the midst of these Mixed Zone Lands at miles from the sea, there is a town named Kanowit. The river near Kanowit is wide.Richard C, 2010. Page 5 The biggest town by the river is Sibu, some upriver from the mouth of the Rajang.Hon Kah, 1996. Page 93 It can be reached by ocean-going vessels. Sibu is the political, economic, cultural, and education centre of the central region of Sarawak.Richard C, 2010. Page 7 Other towns which are located further downriver are Sarikei [ from Rajang town] and Bintangor.[ from Sarikei].Hon Kah, 1996. Page 93 These two towns are mainly settled by the Chinese. Tanjung Manis District [ from river mouth]Hon Kah, 1996. Page 93 is located near the Rajang River delta where the Malay and Melanau people dominates.Richard C, 2010. Page 8 Bruit Island is situated inside the Rajang delta, with a light house at the Sirik Point. The Rajang delta is bounded between the Igan town in the north and the Rajang town [ from the river mouth] in the south.Hon Kah, 1996. Page 93 History A group a natives row their longboat against water current in the river near Pelagus in 1912. The population of the Rajang River was very low in the 19th century during the Bruneian Empire. The natives living along the river traded several forest products with Malay traders from Brunei. At that time, the Melanau, Kanowit, and Rajang ethnic groups were living downriver; Bhuket, Punan Bah, Lugat, Sihan, and Kejaman ethnic groups lived at the middle section of the river; and with Penan and Seping living in the upriver area. After the 19th century, the Kayan and Kenyah migrated to the Balui river from the present day Indonesian Kalimantan. Meanwhile, the Iban people migrated from the West Kalimantan to the lower Rajang valley while conducting shifting cultivation. With introduction of new tribes in the Rajang basin, inter-ethnic battles became rife. Some ethnic groups fled to Balingian and Tatau rivers to avoid the conflict. In the late 19th century, the Brooke government started to construct forts along the Rajang River in order to ensure political stability in the Rajang basin. The Chinese then started to move inland and settle near the forts and trade various forest products with the natives. In 1884, Belaga fort and trading market was constructed. It soon became the political and economic centre of the district. Subsequently, government offices, schools, a bank, a police station, a mosque, and churches were built around the fort. During the Brooke era, sago processing industry was an important economic activity amongst the Melanaus living along the coastal areas. It was also an important revenue for the Sarawak government. The Sago products were sent to Sibu before being exported to overseas due to better port facilities in Sibu. The Ibans in the Rajang basin exchanged jungle produce with Chinese and Malay businessmen for salt, beads, metal, porcelain utensils, earthen jars, and coins. Seeing the success of Chinese planting rubber trees and pepper vines, the Ibans also started to grow these cash crops. Later when the Chinese ventured into the logging industry, the Ibans left to work inside timber companies, thus leading to urban migration of the Ibans. Meanwhile, the Kayans and Kenyahs grew rice, cash crops such as rubber, coffee, and groundnuts, and collecting jungle produce. The Penans and Punans maintained their own nomadic way of life. They brought jungle produce, woven items, and handicrafts on certain market days for sale.Hon Kah, 1996. Page 191-195 During Sarawak Communist Insurgency, Sarawak government set up the \\"Rajang Special Security Area\\" on 25 March 1973. A day later, Rajang Security Command (RASCOM) was formed as a result of co- operation of civil, military, and police command headquarters. These measures were taken to clamp down communist activities in the Rajang delta. In 1997, Bakun Dam construction was started at the upper Balui River. Many longhouses and villages in this area was resettled at the Sungai Asap resettlement scheme. Sungai Asap is connected to Bakun Dam through the Bakun road. On 6 October 2010, heavy rain have caused a massive landslide that brought logs and debris down into the Balleh river, tributaries above Kapit, and then into the Rajang river. It was estimated that the volume of the logs and debris had exceeded 300, 000 m3. This logjam had also affected the Igan river. The log debris, stretching 50 km long, had reached Sibu on 8 October. The logjam had caused transportation difficulties for the people living alongside the river and dead fish were also seen on the river. As on 2 November 2012, Global Witness revealed that the logging operation of Interglobal Empire, a subsidiary of WTK group of companies, in the logging concession T/3476 was responsible for the landslide into Melatai River which subsequently blocked the Rajang River. Similar logjam recurred in early 2017 at the upper reaches of the Balui river. In September 2020, due to heavy rain in the upper tributaries of the Rajang river, there were flash floods at the low-lying areas in Kapit, Song, Kanowit and Sibu. Wildlife =Mammals= A total of 30 species of mammals are recorded along the Rajang basin in 2004. The mouth of the river is the only place where the dolphins can be sighted. Totally protected mammals include gibbon, langurs, black giant squirrel, slow loris, and tarsier. Civets, otters, bats, treeshrew, and primates are also included under Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998. Wild pigs and deers are the most frequently hunted animals by the locals while primates can be hunted incidentally. =Birds= 122 species of birds were sighted along the Rajang basin in 2004. 21 species were recorded along the mouth of the river while 96 species were recorded in Hose Mountains and 88 species at Lanjak Entimau which are located in the interior of Sarawak. The only endemic species of birds located at Rajang basin is Dusky munia which is found abundantly in paddy fields. Other species of birds which are commonly found along the Rajang basin are: Pacific swallow, Little spiderhunter, and Asian glossy starling. 20 species of birds (mainly eagles, egret, kingfishers, woodpeckers) are protected while 7 species of birds (mainly Hornbill and Pheasant) are totally protected under the Sarawak Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998. =Fish= A total of 164 fish species has been recorded at the Rajang basin in 2005. Empurau (Tor tambroides) and Semah (Tor douronensis) fish are considered popular fishes among the locals. Empurau fish is still found breeding near the upper tributaries of Rajang such as Balleh River and near the Bakun Dam. Economy The major economic activity in the upper reaches of the Rajang River is logging. Among the type of wood that are extracted for exports are: Ramin, plywood, Kapur, Meranti, Keruing, and Belian. Rice is the dominant crop among the middle part of the Rajang river. Trading of Engkabang fruits was prevalent in the 1970s. Other agricultural activities in the Rajang basin are: rubber and pepper cultivation, poultry domestication, and vegetables planting.Richard C, 2010. Page 13-15 =Trade= The Rajang Port Authority in Sibu Rajang Port Authority (RPA) is the main regulatory body to coordinate the trade activities of all the five river ports along the Rajang river. RPA serves to provide maintenance, adequate and efficient port services for all users of the ports. It is located at the Sibu port operation centre Sibu and Sungai Merah can be assessed via a shorter route through Paloh river where the distances from the mouth of the river can be shortened to 82 km and 92 km respectively. In the year 2012, RPA recorded a total revenue of RM 30.1 million although its total cargo throughput went down from 5.0 million to 3.2 million tonnes from the previous year. The 5 river ports along the Rajang river (arranged by their distances from the river mouth) are: *Tanjung Manis (30 km, maximum Gross tonnage (GT): 32,000, mainly for handling logs and timber products) *Sarikei (49 km, maximum GT: 3,000, mainly for handling agricultural products and consumer goods around Sarikei area) *Bintangor (66 km, maximum GT: 2,500) *Sibu (113 km, maximum GT: 10,000, mainly for handling timber and agricultural products) *Sungai Merah (Near Sibu, 116 km, maximum GT: 2,500, mainly for handling fuel oil products) =Tourism= View of Rajang river during sunset on the Lanang bridge in Sibu Pandaw River Cruise was started on 1 July 2009 in order to boost tourism activities along the Rajang River. It was a nine-day cruising starting from Express Wharf Terminal of Sibu to Pelagus Rapids Resort in Kapit. The tourists can go hiking and visiting long houses and towns during the ride. However, this programme has been terminated in March 2012 because of logistical and operational difficulties. During 2017 Visit Sibu Year, longhouse visits along the Rajang River was promoted as an ecotourism product. Crocodiles which are living by the river banks became the mascot for the event. Transportation Ferry crossing the Rajang River in Bintangor. Speedboats and longboats are common at Kapit wharf terminal. The town of Sibu can be assessed by oceangoing vessels for 80 miles (130 km) while an additional 100 miles (160 km) of the river can be assessed by shallow-draft craft. The remaining parts of the river which leads into the Sarawak interior can only be assessed by small canoes. Speedboats and longboats are the major form of transport between Kapit and Belaga. Transportation above Belaga to Balui River requires longboats. Rajang River also serves to transport logs down the river. Some areas in the interior are only accessible through river during the monsoon season. Meanwhile, for the towns located at the downriver, market merchants have to take care of their own belongings from being flooded.Richard C, 2010. Page 9 Water quality Logging operations are rampant on the upstream of Rajang river. A major study conducted along the Rajang river from May to December 2004 found out that the main channel of the Rajang river was turbid except for smaller tributaries. The water transparency was about 4 cm to 5 cm at that time. Based on Taxonomic richness index, the stretch of upstream river between Kanowit and Belaga river is recovering from logging 15 to 20 years ago with the exception of Penaan river because the local community uses toxic chemicals to capture fish. The stretch of river downstream from Lebaan to Selalang river is considered unclean.

It was one of the first TV outlets for alternative comedy and was broadcast by Channel 4 late at night in a first attempt at \\"Post-Pub television\\" (the opening title sequence shows a man staggering home from the pub to get to the television in time for the programme). It was eventually aired by the Playboy Channel in cable television outlets in the United States. The show's title is also the motto of the British Special Air Service regiment (see Who Dares Wins), whose badge, parodied to depict a flying pig, featured in the title sequence, and was often supplemented by a subtitle, e.g., \\"a week in Benidorm\\". Mulville, McGrath and Pope had all contributed material to Not the Nine O'Clock News. Other script material was provided by Not the Nine O'Clock News regulars Colin Bostock-Smith and Andy Hamilton as well as alternative comedy writer Tony Sarchet. The show was recorded at the former independent production facility Limehouse Studios, on a soundstage in front of a live audience. The programme sometimes satirised current events but the mainstay was simple observational comedy and frequently employed base humour (for example, the tracking camera shot in the title sequence showed a drunk who had urinated in his trousers). The show pioneered a sketch style involving a roaming camera - the camera would move from character to character as they delivered their lines. Notable sketches included: * \\"The Pandas\\" - a recurring sketch with two male giant pandas (Terry and Wang-Wang) in a zoo, discussing life and bamboo shoots. The animals were portrayed with the stereotype mannerisms, attitudes - and strong language - of contemporary young, working-class men; * Philip Pope singing a Barry Manilow-style song, initially praising a lost love, but realising how horrible she was and changing his lyrics accordingly; * Tony Robinson appearing in a sketch possibly inspired by The Emperor's New Clothes, as a man being sold \\"going naked\\" by a pair of tailors. The sketch involved Robinson actually appearing on stage totally naked... and then hanging around in later sketches, still naked, seemingly not knowing what to do with himself; * A parody of Channel 4's \\"red triangle\\". ( These were programmes with content regarded as \\"more explicit\\" than that normally shown on British TV, and were often foreign-language films. ) The parody showed clips from a supposed Eskimo pornographic film featuring \\"explicit nose rubbing\\" and \\"nose masturbation\\"; * A guest appearance by comedian Frankie Howerd playing a man who has never been on stage or TV, but just happens to look exactly like... Frankie Howerd ( \\"The resemblance is uncanny, isn't it ?\\" ); * A controversial sketch that parodied contemporary airline adverts by explicitly stating the air-hostesses were sexually available. Unfortunately, the name chosen for the fictional airline turned out to be the name of a real, lesser-known airline; * A sketch before the opening credits, filmed in the style of a soft-core pornographic film, featuring a young couple simulating sexual intercourse... which turns out to be a \\"language course\\" - they are conjugating the French verb venir (to come); Earlier series of the show were produced by Holmes AssociatesHolmes Associates, BFI, accessed 25 June 2014 for Channel 4 Television, and later ones by Who Dares Wins Productions.Who Dares Wins, BFI, accessed 25 June 2014 References External links  The Story of Limehouse Television Studios - Martin Hawkins * Category:1983 British television series debuts Category:1988 British television series endings Category:Channel 4 comedy Category:Channel 4 sketch shows Category:British television sketch shows ","title":"Who Dares Wins (TV series)"},{"id":"1924025","text":"The tench or doctor fish (Tinca tinca) is a fresh- and brackish-water fish of the cyprinid family found throughout Eurasia from Western Europe including the British Isles east into Asia as far as the Ob and Yenisei Rivers. It is also found in Lake Baikal. It normally inhabits slow-moving freshwater habitats, particularly lakes and lowland rivers.B. Whitton (1982). Rivers, Lakes and Marshes p 163. Hodder & Staughton, London. Ecology The tench is most often found in still waters with a clay or muddy substrate and abundant vegetation.A. F. Magri MacMahon (1946). Fishlore, pp 156-158. Pelican Books. This species is rare in clear waters across stony substrate, and is absent altogether from fast-flowing streams. It tolerates water with a low oxygen concentration, being found in waters where even the carp cannot survive. On Exhibition \\"Subaqueous Vltava\\", Prague Tench feed mostly at night with a preference for animals, such as chironomids, on the bottom of eutrophic waters and snails and pea clams in well-vegetated waters. Breeding takes place in shallow water usually among aquatic plants where the sticky green eggs can be deposited. Spawning usually occurs in summer, and as many as 300,000 eggs may be produced.A. Lawrence Wells (date unknown). Observer Book of Freshwater Fishes, pp 101-105. Frederick Warne & Co. Growth is rapid, and fish may reach a weight of 0.11 kg (0.25 lb) within the first year. Morphology Tench have a stocky, carp-like shape and olive-green skin, darker above and almost golden below. The tail fin is square in shape. The other fins are distinctly rounded in shape. The mouth is rather narrow and provided at each corner with a very small barbel. Maximum size is 70 cm, though most specimens are much smaller.G. Sterba (1962). Freshwater Fishes of the World pp 249-250. Vista Books, London. A record fish caught in 2001 in England had a weight of 15 lb 3 oz (6.89 kg). The eyes are small and red-orange in colour.Females can reach weights of around 7 kg, although 4 kg is considered large. Males rarely reach over 3 kg. Sexual dimorphism is absent or weak, limited to the adult females having a more convex ventral profile when compared with males. Males may also possess a very thick and flattened outer ray to the ventral fins. Males are generally smaller than females, but can be recognised by having more curved lower fins and noticeable muscles around the base of the fins generally absent in female. The tench has very small scales, which are deeply embedded in a thick skin, making it as slippery as an eel. Folklore has it that this slime cured any sick fish that rubbed against it, and from this belief arose the name doctor fish. Fossil Tinca Golden tench An artificially bred variety of tench called the golden tench is a popular ornamental fish for ponds. This form varies in colour from pale gold through to dark red, and some fish have black or red spots on the flanks and fins. Though somewhat similar to the goldfish, because these fish have such small scales, their quality is rather different. Economic significance Tench are edible, working well in recipes that would otherwise call for carp, but are rarely eaten these days. They are shoaling fish that are popular quarries for coarse angling in rivers, lakes and canals. Tench, particularly golden tench, are also kept as ornamental fish in ponds as they are bottom feeders that help to keep the waterways clean and healthy.Dick Mills (2000). Understanding Coldwater Fish, p 106. Interpet Publishing. Angling Large tench may be found in gravel pits or deep, slow-moving waters with a clayey or silty bottom and copious aquatic vegetation. The best methods and bait to catch tench are float fishing and ledgering with a swim feeder using maggots, sweetcorn, pellets, bread, and worms. Fish over 1 kg (2 lb) in weight are very strong fighters when caught on a rod.A. Lawrence Wells (date unknown). Observer Book of Freshwater Fishes, pp 101-103. Frederick Warne & Co.

Some are known to live on surface rocks, and make use of photosynthesis for energy. Those that live in deeper rocks cannot use photosynthesis to gather energy, but instead extract energy from minerals around them. They live in cracks in the rock where water seeps down. The water contains dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) which the organisms use for their carbon needs. They have been detected in rocks down to depths of nearly three km, where the temperature is approximately 75 ¬∞C. Terrestrial Lithophiles can be found in canyons primarily composed of granite, an igneous rock, and soils saturated with fractured rock. Organisms from the genus Elliptochloris, a subaerial photosynthetic green algae, demonstrate lithophilic preferences through colonization in granite cracks and in proximity to terrestrial lichens. Lithophilic lichens from the genus Collema form tight symbiotic relationships between fungi and photosynthetic algae such as Elliptochloris in order to produce necessary saturated fatty acid secondary metabolites. Lithophilic algal species colonizing fractured rock outcroppings individually exhibit coccal morphological shape while aggregating into an elliptical or globular arrangement during adulthood. Lithobiontic Ecological Niches further classify lithophiles into sub-categories determined by their spatial niche specificity. The term, Lithic, refers to an association with rock and can be further explained by the term, lithobiontic, regarded as organisms living both on, and within rock surfaces. Sub-surface rock organisms, endoliths, primarily exhibit niche preference within fissures, cavities, or tunnels of various rocks. While many endoliths degrade and effectively excavate the available carbonate rock surface, many are preyed upon by select gastropod, and echinoderm species. This habitat preference can be further threatened by suspension feeding organisms searching for acquired shelter.

(published 05-25-2019) (published 02-18-2019) SMIC is headquartered in Shanghai and incorporated in the Cayman Islands. It has wafer fabrication sites throughout mainland China, offices in the United States, Italy, Japan, and Taiwan, and a representative office in Hong Kong. It provides integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing services on 350 nm to 14 nm process technologies. State-owned civilian and military telecommunications equipment provider Datang Telecom Group as well as the China National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund are major shareholders of SMIC. Notable customers include Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments.  History  SMIC was founded on April 3, 2000 and is headquartered in Shanghai. It was incorporated in the Cayman Islands as a limited liability company. Harvard Business School did a case study on the school in the October 2012 edition by Willy Shih. (published 01-2009) In 2013, it established a joint venture in Beijing to fabricate using 40 nm and below technologies. On December 22, 2014, SilTech Shanghai, one of SMIC's indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries; JCET; and China IC Fund entered into a co-investment agreement to form a consortium regarding the proposed acquisition of STATS ChipPAC, a provider of advanced semiconductor packaging and test services incorporated in Singapore, shares of which were listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited before the acquisition. On June 18, 2015, according to the co-investment agreement, SilTech Shanghai invested US$102 million as a capital contribution for 19.6% ownership interest in Changjiang Xinke, a company incorporated in Jiangsu province, China, which is accounted as an associate of the Group. On June 23, 2015, Huawei, Qualcomm Global Trading Pte. Ltd., IMEC International, and SMIC announced the formation (published 06-23-2015) of the SMIC Advanced Technology Research & Development (Shanghai) Corporation, an equity joint venture company. The joint venture company's focus was to be the R&D; for the next generation CMOS logic technology and was designed to build China's most advanced integrated circuit (IC) development R&D; platform. SMIC Advanced Technology R&D; (Shanghai) Corporation is majority owned by SMIC, while Huawei, IMEC, and Qualcomm are minority shareholders. The focus of the joint venture company is on developing 14 nm logic technology. On June 24, 2016, SMIC. LFoundry Europe and Marsica entered into a sale and purchase agreement pursuant to which LFoundry Europe and Marsica agreed to sell and SMIC agreed to purchase 70% of the corporate capital of LFoundry S.r.l. for an aggregate cash consideration of EUR49 million subject to adjustment. The acquisition was completed as of July 29, 2016. On October 14, 2016, Ningbo Semiconductor International Corporation was jointly established by China IC Capital (the wholly owned investment fund of SMIC), Ningbo Senson Electronics Technology Co., Ltd, and Beijing Integrated Circuit Design and Testing Fund with a registered capital of RMB355 million, equal to US$52.8 million. SMIC holds 66.76% of the ownership interest. NSI will develop analog and specialty semiconductor process technology platforms in the areas of high-voltage analog, radio frequency, and optoelectronics. These developments will support customers in IC design and product development for applications in smart home, industrial, and automotive electronics, new generations of radio communications, augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, and other specialty systems. (published 2018) In 2018, SMIC had gross profits of $747 million and net profits of $149, with $3.6 billion in revenues. It apparently spend around $550 million on research and development, or about 16 percent of sales. (published 01-21-2019) On May 18, 2018, ground was broken on the manufacturing base for SMIC in Shaoxing. SMIC was building a plant that would be the first in China to use 14-nanometer production technology. (published 05-23-2019) The company said it would increase its investment capacity by 20% in February 2019. (published 02-15-2019) Current co-CEOs are Zhao Haijun and Mong Song Liang. Zixue Zhou serves as chairman of the board. In May 2019, it was said that SMIC's co-chiefs, Zhao Haijun and Liang Mong-song were at odds over how to focus the company. On May 24, 2019, SMIC announced it would voluntarily delist from the Nasdaq, citing low trade volumes. Along with low US trading volumes, the company named the high administrative cost of maintaining the NYSE listing.; it joined the exchange 14 years before. On May 25, 2019, it announced it would also delist from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) following Huawei blacklisting by the United States government amid the China‚ÄìUnited States Trade War. As of June 2019, SMIC instead became available for over-the-counter trading by American investors via the OTC Markets Group OTCQX Best Market under the stock symbol \\"SMICY\\". (published 06-14-2019) In 2019, Qualcomm, Huawei, and imec were still minority shareholders in SMIC's R&D; arm. In May 2020, in support of the country's Made in China 2025 program; the China National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund and the Shanghai Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund invested a combined US$2 billion, gaining, respectively, 23.08% and 11.54% ownership of SMIC. In July 2020 SMIC issued 1,685,620,000 shares at 27.46 yuan per share on the STAR Market of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, raising 46.28 billion yuan ($6.62 billion). In September 2020, the United States Department of Commerce declared SMIC a military end-user and required that American technology companies dealing with it obtain a license. The action elicited a rebuke from China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. On 4 October 2020, SMIC stated that the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security had informed some SMIC's suppliers that according to U.S. export control regulations they must apply for an export license in advance before supplying SMIC with some American equipment, accessories and original products. Processes =14 nm= On 14 November 2019, SMIC announced that volume production of 14 nm FinFET had begun. =N+1= N+1 is the follow-on to SMIC's 14 nm process, and is targeted for inexpensive chips. The modest improvements put N+1 capabilities between 14 nm and 7 nm. According to analysts, N+1 is equivalent to Samsung's 8 nm, which is slightly better than TSMC's 10 nm. Risk production is planned to begin in the fourth quarter of 2020. SMIC acquired an EUV step-and-scan system from ASML Holding for $120 million in 2018 but it was not used for either 14 nm or N+1. Litigation with TSMC The company was the target of a lawsuit brought by TSMC, accusing SMIC of misappropriating TSMC intellectual property. The first round of litigation ended in 2005 with a $175 million settlement. A second round was opened in 2006. The liability phase of the lawsuit began on September 9, 2009 in Oakland, California, and the jury found SMIC liable on 61 out of 65 claims. SMIC entered into a settlement agreement with TSMC to resolve all pending lawsuits between the parties, including the legal action filed by TSMC in California for which a verdict was returned by the jury against SMIC on November 4, 2009 and the legal action filed by SMIC in Beijing. SMIC and TSMC have entered into a settlement agreement on November 9, 2009 to settle and dismiss the California case, including all claims and defenses of SMIC yet to be decided in that case and SMIC's appeal in the Beijing case, thus concluding all pending court litigation between the parties. Key provisions of the settlement include a mutual release of all claims that were or could have been brought in the pending lawsuits; termination of SMIC's obligation to make remaining payments under the prior settlement agreement between the parties (approximately US$40 million); payment to TSMC of an aggregate of US$200 million; and a grant to TSMC of approximately 8% of SMIC's issued share capital and a warrant which would allow TSMC to obtain total ownership of approximately 10% of SMIC's issued share capital.

The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs is a constituent of the apocryphal scriptures connected with the Bible. It is believed to be a pseudepigraphical work comprising the dying commands of the twelve sons of Jacob. It is part of the Oskan Armenian Orthodox Bible of 1666. Fragments of similar writings were found at Qumran, but opinions are divided as to whether these are the same texts. It is generally considered apocalyptic literature. The Testaments were written in Hebrew or Greek, and reached their final form in the 2nd century CE. In the 13th century they were introduced into the Western world through the agency of Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, whose Latin translation of the work immediately became popular. He believed that it was a genuine work of the twelve sons of Jacob, and that the Christian interpolations were a genuine product of Jewish prophecy; he accused Jews of concealing the Testaments \\"on account of the prophecies of the Saviour contained in them.\\" With the critical methods of the 16th century, Grosseteste's view of the Testaments was rejected, and the book was disparaged as a mere Christian forgery for nearly four centuries. Presently, scholarly opinions are still divided as to whether it is an originally Jewish document that has been retouched by Christians, or a Christian document written originally in Greek but based on some earlier Semitic-language material.J. Davila. \\"A Difficult Case: The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs.\\" Summary of lecture delivered on Feb. 20, 1997. Accessed Mar. 10, 2008. Scholarship tends to focus on this book as a Christian work, whether or not it has a Jewish predecessor (Vorlage). Ethics Testaments are regarded as exhortatory writings; ethics therefore are fundamental to the text. The Testaments have many different ethical motifs, the foremost of which is adhering to God's commandments. In this regard, the ethics in the Testaments generally start out very precise; each testament discusses a certain vice or virtue. Usually this is then concluded with a very vague and general reference to God's law and commandments.See for example: TJu 26.1, TZ 10.5, TD 5.1, TD 6.10, TN 8.10, TG 3.1, TJo 19.6 Another theme that has been extensively discussed by HollanderHollander, H.W. Joseph as an Ethical Model in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs (Leiden, 1981). is the role that Joseph plays in the ethics. He is often the example of an ethical man, and the deeds of the patriarchs are often weighed against those of Joseph. = Charles's view on ethics = As argued by Robert Henry Charles, who studied and translated the Testaments in the beginning of the 20th century, > the main, the overwhelming value of the book lies ... in its ethical > teaching, which has achieved a real immortality by influencing the thoughts > and diction of the writers of the New Testament, and even those of our Lord. He writes that the Testaments help to \\"bridge the chasm that divides the ethics of the Old and New Testaments.\\" To a modern reader, the main value of the Testaments, is not in the ranting variations on biblical text, but in their ethical teachings, as amplified by the following citations: > *Love the Lord through all your life, and one another with a true heart > *Love yea one another from the heart; and if a man sin against thee, speak > peacefully to him, and in thy soul hold not guile; and if he repent and > confess, forgive him. But if he deny it, do not get into a passion with him, > lest catching the poison from thee he take to swearing, and so then sin > doubly ‚Ä¶ *Love the Lord and your neighbor. *Anger is blindness, and does not > suffer to see any man with truth *Hatred, therefore is evil; etc. (from The > Apocrypha in English. Edited by Rev. R. H. Charles.) Summary The work is divided into twelve books, each purporting to be the last exhortations of one of the twelve titular patriarchs. In each, the patriarch first narrates his own life, focusing on his strengths, virtues, or his sins, using biographical material from both the Hebrew Bible and Jewish tradition. Next he exhorts his listeners to emulate the one and to avoid the other. Most of the books conclude with prophetic visions. =Reuben= The Testament of Reuben is predominantly concerned with admonishing lust, and the sinfulness of Reuben in his having had sex with Bilhah, a concubine of his father. It is likely that the author wished to cover the topic of fornication anyway, and assigned it for Reuben to discuss due to Reuben's relationship with Bilhah being recounted in the canonical Bible. The Testament adds that Reuben spies Bilhah as she bathes in secret; and that when she later becomes drunk, Reuben rapes her. That trope derives from a reading of Genesis 49:4, \\"wanton as water\\", as \\"wanton in water\\", taken from the Book of Jubilees.James Kugel, The Ladder of Jacob (Princeton University Press: 2006), page 110 This theme is also in 2 Samuel 11:2's account of David and Bathsheba. The Testament portrays women as the cause of the downfall of the Watcher, and of man in general (excepting Bilhah, in accordance with Jubilees). Joseph is on the other hand portrayed as the ideal, for his resistance against Potiphar's wife. =Simeon= The Testament of Simeon is primarily a diatribe against envy. In the Genesis narrative, Simeon is portrayed as having been bound in chains by Joseph, and the author of the Testament argues that Simeon had wanted to kill Joseph due to jealousy, allowing the Testament to continue with a discourse about envy. The narrative of the Testament explains that it was Judah who had sold Joseph into slavery, and goes on to portray Joseph as the ideal of virtue and generosity. The Testament 5:4-6 in an aside attacks Simeon's children for the sin of miscegenation, Numbers 25. It does not mention the attack on Shechem, which in the Torah Simeon had mounted alongside brother Levi. Instead it posits that Simeon made war against Levi. Kugel concludes that the Testament agreed with Jubilees 30:23 in that the attack on Shechem was \\"righteous\\", and so the Testament suppressed the account to deny Simeon credit. =Levi= The Testament of Levi is an apocalyptic section. It is one of the longest of the Testaments, and is predominantly concerned with arrogance. Taking the theme of the Levite priesthood, the Testament explains how Levi's descendants corrupted the office by their arrogant disregard for the proper regulations. Chapter 2-8 involves Levi being taken to heaven and promised the priesthood forever, and then seven angels physically give him the insignia of the priesthood (as described in Exodus). This part parallels the beginning and end of a vision in the Aramaic Levi Document, whence the body of the vision is now lost; and is thought to preserve that part of the text. In chapters 14-18 Levi cites a \\"book of Enoch\\", describing the sins of his descendants, with the promise that at the end there will be a glorious priest who will restore the righteousness of his office. The tropes of Levi's \\"Book\\" match those of the \\"Apocalypse of Weeks\\" in 1 Enoch.John Joseph Collins, The apocalyptic imagination: an introduction to Jewish apocalyptic literature, 2nd ed. (Eerdmans: 1998); 137 n.85 The Testament has an account of the raid on Shechem. Its take is that Jacob proposed a marriage between Shechem and Dinah, sincerely offering Shechem the option of circumcision. Levi opposed the circumcision from the start. Unlike Jubilees and, if Kugel is right, the Testament of Simeon: to the Testament of Levi, intermarriage is lawful in principle between Israelites and converts. Shechem was excluded for its other crimes. Aramaic Levi Document One way in which this testament is distinguished from the others is by additional footnotes in a Greek version of the manuscript from Mount Athos. These footnotes were found to be translated from a non-apocalyptic precursor of the text in Aramaic, partially preserved in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The find consisted of six fragments in two manuscripts from cave 4 (4Q213-214). A small related fragment was also found in cave 1 (1Q21). According to some sources, these scrolls were dated by the Oriental Institute http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/scr/dss_chart.html to between 100-200 BC using Radiocarbon dating. According to James Kugel at Bar-Ilan University, Aramaic Levi is a composite of two documents. One source was \\"a wisdom apocalypse derived from the exegetical elaboration of Malachi 2:4-7\\". The other, based on the same exegesis, \\"described Levi's actual initiation into the priesthood by angels\\". The narrative frame is based from the Book of Jubilees. The compiler of Aramaic Levi added that the priests would be kings. It is a Hasmonean compilation, 133‚Äì100 BCE. =Judah= The Testament of Judah is primarily concerned with courage, monetary greed, and fornication. It begins by portraying Judah as idealistically courageous, involving bravery in front of wild beasts, as well as successful military expeditions, sometimes basing the narrative on acts that the canonical bible attributes to Jacob. However, it goes on to present a xenophobic focus, criticising his marriage to a non-Israelite, as well as his sexual activity with Tamar, his daughter-in-law who at that time was pretending to be a prostitute. The narrative argues that Judah had sex with Tamar and his wife due to drunkenness, and that he bribed his wife's father in order to be allowed to marry her. It then goes on to instruct that the role of a king is lesser than that of a priest, and that Levi is more important, clearly pointing to the theocratic attitude of the author. =Issachar= The Testament of Issachar predominantly concerns asceticism, which the text portrays as virtuous. The narrative however begins by retelling the biblical tale of Leah's purchase of Jacob's nocturnal services by the giving of mandrakes to Rachel. Rachel is portrayed as virtuous for being more celibate than the randy Leah. The remainder of the narrative portrays Issachar himself as leading a godly and simple agricultural life. This is based on Genesis 49:14-15: Issachar had loved the land such that he \\"bent his shoulder to the burden\\" and became a tiller for hire. The same exegesis is at work in the Septuagint and Samaritan Targum of Genesis. =Zebulun= Zebulun was the sixth son of Leah and Jacob. He is described as an inventor and philanthropist and the text relates what he learned as a result of the plot against Joseph. \\"The copy of the words of Zebulun, which he enjoined on his sons before he died in the hundred and fourteenth year of his life, two years after the death of Joseph. 2 And he said to them: Hearken to me, ye sons of Zebulun, attend to the words of your father. 3 I, Zebulun, was born a good gift to my parents. 4 For when I was born my father was increased very exceedingly, both in the flocks and herds, when with the straked rods he had his portion. 5 I am not conscious that I have sinned all my days, save in thought. 6 Nor yet do I remember that I have done any iniquity, except the sin of ignorance which I committed against Joseph; for I covenanted with my brethren, because they had all agreed that if any one should declare the secret, he should be slain.\\" =Dan= The Testament of Dan treats the topics of anger and lying. The main vice, however, is anger. Dan first explains his feelings of jealousy towards his brother Joseph. The spirit of anger tempted him towards murdering Joseph. Fortunately, the Lord did not deliver Joseph into Dan's hands. Dan then goes on to explain how the spirit of anger works. It covers your eyes, and distorts your vision. Through this you do not recognise people for who they really are. In the case of Joseph, Dan speaks from experience. Furthermore, it disturbs the mind so that the Lord departs from it and Beliar inhabits it. Therefore, Dan's children should keep the commandments of the Lord, and stay near to the Lord. Dan goes into more depth through a prediction about the future, including one SER (Sin-Exile-Return) and three LJ (Levi-Judah) passages. In this Dan talks of a saviour arising from Levi and Judah that will set the souls free from Beliar. Again, Dan reminds his sons to stay near to God, and also to his interceding angel, and the saviour of the Gentiles. If they listen to Dan's warning, then his children will be received by the saviour of the Gentiles and be saved. The testament ends with an apparent gloss (inasmuch as one can speak of a gloss in a pseudepigraph), which points out that the prophecies of Dan did indeed happen. =Naphtali= The Testament of Naphtali has apocalyptic elements in it. It opens with the genealogy of Bilhah, his mother, whose father is said to be Rotheus. His vision represents Levi seizing the sun and Judah the moon. The young man with the twelve palm branches seems to be a reference to the Apostles. Joseph seizes a bull and rides on it. He has a further dream in which he sees a storm at sea and the brethren being separated. Again there is a reference to the recurrent theme of sexual relation. A copy of the Testament of Naphtali was discovered at Qumran among the Dead Sea Scrolls taken from Cave 4 (4Q215). =Gad= The Testament of Gad begins with Gad's hatred for Joseph. Chapter 2 begins with Gad talking about loving one another. He says 'and now, my children, I exhort you, love ye each one his brother, and put away hatred from your hearts, love'. The moral of Gad is to not hate one another and love all your brethren. =Asher= The Testament of Asher is the shortest of the twelve and unlike the others does not begin with a deathbed scene. It is regarding the subject of the two ways to live. The main appeal in Asher is to follow truth with singleness of faith. =Joseph= The Testament of Joseph primarily concerns Chastity, and seems heavily to be based on Joseph's resistance against Potiphar's wife that the canonical bible portrays. The narrative contains a large expansion on the attempts of Potiphar's wife to seduce Joseph, portraying her as first threatening Joseph, then employing torture, then flattering Joseph, then plotting to kill her husband so that Joseph would be able to marry her without bigamy, then using love potions, and finally threatening suicide. =Benjamin= The Testament of Benjamin is very much an appendix to that of Joseph. It opens with the account Joseph gave Benjamin of how he was sold to the Ishmaelites. He exhorts his descendants against deceit, but, as all his brethren, he warns them against fornication. Prophecy The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs contain a substantial amount of prophecy concerning the coming of the Messiah. From a Christian perspective, a number of statements can be associated with events in the life of Jesus. Many consider this significant since several of the books are thought to predate Jesus. For example, compare the following passages from the Testament of Levi: > The heavens shall be opened, and from the temple of glory shall come upon > him sanctification, with the Father's voice as from Abraham to Isaac. And > the glory of the Most High shall be uttered over him, and the spirit of > understanding and sanctification shall rest upon him in the water. (Levi > 5:21-22) with this passage from the Gospel of Matthew > As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment > heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and > lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, \\"This is my Son, whom I love; > with him I am well pleased.\\" () Use of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs in the New Testament RH Charles called attention to the frequent use of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs by Paul and other writers of the New Testament.

Communities located along the Red Deer River include Sundre, Red Deer, Drumheller, and Empress, The city of Brooks, as well as Dinosaur Provincial Park, are also located in the Red Deer River Basin. A glacial flood about 18,000 years ago eroded out a portion of this basin and apparently all or most of the scenic badlands bearing the dinosaur and other Cretaceous fossils.  History  Joseph Tyrrell discovered a huge coal seam here in 1883, besides large dinosaur skeletons. = 2013 Alberta flood = In June 2013, Alberta, Canada, experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the Bow, Elbow, Highwood, Oldman, and Red Deer rivers and tributaries. Twenty-four municipalities declared local states of emergency as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated four people may have drowned near High River. Over 100,000 people have been displaced throughout the region. Course The Red Deer River (upper left) merging into the South Saskatchewan River east of Empress, Alberta The river originates on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rockies, in the Sawback Range near the Skoki Valley inside Banff National Park, and then flows east through the mountains and foothills region. It turns north-east before Sundre and flows to an artificial reservoir named Gleniffer Lake, created in 1983 by the Dickson Dam and keeps this heading to the city of Red Deer, where it turns east, and then south before Stettler. It flows south with its valley protected by provincial and regional parks such as Tolman Badlands Heritage Rangeland, Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park, Dry Island Corridor and Midland Provincial Park. At Drumheller it has a south-east direction, and while it flows through Dinosaur Provincial Park it turns east and flows to the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, which it crosses at Empress. It flows for through Saskatchewan before it merges into the South Saskatchewan River.

Pipelines cross under the river and there have been leaks disrupting access to potable water. Increased water flow of the Red Deer River system during heavy rainfall in June 2008 eroded supporting soil, freely exposing a section of Pembina Pipeline Corporation's Cremona crude oil pipeline to the Red Deer River currents. About 75 to 125 barrels of crude oil flowed upstream from the breakpoint under a Red Deer River channel, leaving an oily sheen on Gleniffer Reservoir and 6800 kilograms (15 000 lbs) of oil- soaked debris. The pipeline, leased to Pembina, was built in 1959. The remediation was not completed until 2011.

The name for the studios came from the nearby Eel Pie Island, which was known as a major jazz and blues venue in the 1960s. The building in Twickenham was originally a 1960s boathouse, and its riverside location allowed Pete Townshend to commute there by boat, having lost his driving licence.

Artists who recorded at Eel Pie Studios include Pete Townshend, The Who, A-ha, Rachel Fuller, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Thin Lizzy. In the 1990s, the studio was occupied by the band Cocteau Twins, who called it September Sound, and The Lightning Seeds. Pete Townshend sold the studios in 2008 and the building was converted into a private residence.

He is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers to play for Wales. Early life Jack Kelsey was born at 382 Jersey Road in the Llansamlet area of Swansea, the second of three children born to Alfred Kelsey and his wife Sarah Ann (n√©e Howe). His father hailed from London but had moved to South Wales in 1911 where he worked as a smelter furnaceman. Kelsey attended Cwm School but left at a young age to work alongside his father and qualified as a crane driver.  Club career  He was spotted by an ex-Arsenal player, Les Morris, whilst Kelsey was playing for his local side, Winch Wen, then in the Swansea & District League. Morris recommended Kelsey to Arsenal, who upon watching the goalkeeper for a few games, decided to sign him. Arsenal already had an established first-choice goalkeeper at this time, in George Swindin, so Kelsey could do nothing but wait for his chance to play for the first team. After two years in the reserves, Kelsey made his first-team debut against Charlton Athletic on 24 February 1951 at Highbury, after Swindin had received an injury; However, Kelsey's first start was not an auspicious one, as Arsenal lost 5‚Äì2, their heaviest defeat at home since November 1928. Kelsey made a total of four appearances that season, but was dropped once Swindin returned and did not feature in Arsenal's 1951‚Äì52 run to the FA Cup final.  Later career  After an entire season in the reserves, he returned to the side during the 1952‚Äì53 season, sharing goalkeeping duties with Swindin and Ted Platt; he made 29 appearances in a side that won the First Division title. With a rugged build and consistently solid catching, Kelsey managed to fully oust Swindin from the side (Swindin making only two appearances in 1953‚Äì54) and went on to be Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper for the next eight seasons; only a broken arm sustained in an FA Cup tie against Sheffield United in 1959 put Kelsey out of the Arsenal side for any considerable amount of time, with Jim Standen taking over in the meantime. Although his playing career coincided for the most part with a trophyless run for Arsenal ‚Äì their best finish being third in 1958‚Äì59 ‚Äì and thus he did not win further honours with them, he is still regarded by the club as one of their greatest-ever goalkeepers. He was also a runner-up in the first Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in 1958, playing for a London XI representative side against FC Barcelona. Kelsey also became a regular first choice keeper for Wales, making his debut in 1954, winning 41 caps in total. He was Wales's keeper in the 1958 World Cup, their only finals appearance to date. They were eventually knocked out 1‚Äì0 by winners Brazil in the quarter-finals. With the help of Kelsey, Wales did not concede a goal for 70 minutes against the Brazilians, until a shot by Pel√© deflected off Welsh player Stuart Williams managed to beat Kelsey. Kelsey also played for the Great Britain & Northern Ireland team against a Rest of Europe side in 1955.  Retirement and after  Kelsey's career was cut short after he sustained a back injury playing for Wales in a friendly against Brazil in May 1962, whilst trying to save at the feet of Vav√°; despite many attempts to rectify his injury, he was forced to retire a year later. He received around ¬£5,000 insurance money at the time. In all, he played 352 times for Arsenal, comprising 327 League matches, 24 in the FA Cup and 1 in the Charity Shield. After retiring as a player, Kelsey later worked for Arsenal as the club's commercial manager, finally retiring in 1989. He died in Friern Barnet London in 1992, at the age of 62. Kelsey is survived by his two sons, Paul John Kelsey (Born 1958), Peter John Kelsey (Born 1961).

For example, scholars have used the relationships between different myths to trace the development of religions and cultures, to propose common origins for myths from different cultures, and to support various psychological theories. Background Anthropologist C. Scott Littleton defines comparative mythology as \\"the systematic comparison of myths and mythic themes drawn from a wide variety of cultures\\". By comparing different cultures' mythologies, scholars try to identify underlying similarities and/or to reconstruct a \\"protomythology\\" from which those mythologies developed. To an extent, all theories about mythology follow a comparative approach‚Äîas scholar of religion Robert Segal notes, \\"by definition, all theorists seek similarities among myths\\".Segal, \\"The Romantic Appeal of Joseph Campbell\\" However, scholars of mythology can be roughly divided into particularists, who emphasize the differences between myths, and comparativists, who emphasize the similarities. Particularists tend to \\"maintain that the similarities deciphered by comparativists are vague and superficial\\", while comparativists tend to \\"contend that the differences etched by particularists are trivial and incidental\\".Segal, Theorizing About Myth, p. 148 Comparative approaches to mythology held great popularity among eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scholars. Many of these scholars believed that all myths showed signs of having evolved from a thought which interpreted nearly all myths as poetic descriptions of the sun's behavior. According to this theory, these poetic descriptions had become distorted over time into seemingly diverse stories about gods and heroes.Leonard However, modern-day scholars lean more toward particularism, feeling suspicious of broad statements about myths.Northup, p. 8 A recent exception is the historical approach followed in E.J. Michael Witzel's reconstruction of many subsequent layers of older myths.E.J.M. Witzel, \\"The Origins of the World's Mythologies, New York : OUP 2012 Approaches Comparative mythologists come from various fields, including folklore, anthropology, history, linguistics, and religious studies, and they have used a variety of methods to compare myths. =Linguistic= Some scholars look at the linguistic relationships between the myths of different cultures. For example, the similarities between the names of gods in different cultures. One particularly successful example of this approach is the study of Indo-European mythology. Scholars have found striking similarities between the mythological and religious terms used in different cultures of Europe and India. For example, the Greek sky-god Zeus Pater, the Roman sky-god Jupiter, and the Indian (Vedic) sky-god Dyau·π£ Pit·πõ have linguistically identical names. This suggests that the Greeks, Romans, and Indians originated from a common ancestral culture, and that the names Zeus, Jupiter, Dyaus and the Germanic Tiu (cf. English Tues-day) evolved from an older name, *Dyƒìus ph2ter, which referred to the sky-god or, to give an English cognate, the divine father in a Proto-Indo-European religion.Watkins 47‚Äì48 =Structural= Some scholars look for underlying structures shared by different myths. The folklorist Vladimir Propp proposed that many Russian fairy tales have a common plot structure, in which certain events happen in a predictable order.Propp, passim In contrast, the anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss examined the structure of a myth in terms of the abstract relationships between its elements, rather than their order in the plot. In particular, L√©vi-Strauss believed that the elements of a myth could be organized into binary oppositions (raw vs. cooked, nature vs. culture, etc.). He thought that the myth's purpose was to \\"mediate\\" these oppositions, thereby resolving basic tensions or contradictions found in human life or culture.L√©vi-Strauss, p. 224 =Psychological= Some scholars propose that myths from different cultures reveal the same, or similar, psychological forces at work in those cultures. Some Freudian thinkers have identified stories similar to the Greek story of Oedipus in many different cultures. They argue that these stories reflect the different expressions of the Oedipus complex in those cultures.Johnson and Price-Williams, passim Likewise, Jungians have identified images, themes, and patterns that appear in the myths of many different cultures. They believe that these similarities result from archetypes present in the unconscious levels of every person's mind.Graves, p. 251 =Michael Witzel's approach= An approach which is both historical and comparative has recently been proposed by E.J. Michael Witzel. He compares collections of mythologies and reconstructs increasingly older levels, parallel to but not necessarily dependent on language families. The most prominent common feature is a storyline that extends from the creation of the world and of humans to their end. This feature is found in the northern mythologies of Eurasia and the Americas (\\"Laurasia\\") while it is missing in the southern mythologies of Subsaharan Africa, New Guinea and Australia (\\"Gondwanaland\\")‚Äîthe latter being the older, going back to the dispersal of homo sapiens out of Africa, some 65,000 years ago. Based on these two reconstructions Witzel offers some suggestions about the tales of the \\"African Eve\\". Close attention is paid to the largely parallel developments in archaeology, paleontology, genetics and linguistics. He also makes some suggestions about the persistence of these Stone Age myths in current religions. =Phylogenetical= It is speculated that like genes, myths evolve by a process of descent with modification. The striking parallels between biological and mythological evolutiond'Huy 2012a, 2013a, b allow the use of computational statistics to infer evolutionary relatedness and to build the most likely phylogenetic tree for a mythological family. Mythological phylogenies constructed with mythemes clearly support low horizontal transmissions (borrowings), historical (sometimes pre-historic) diffusions and punctuated evolution.d'Huy 2012b, c; d'Huy 2013a, b, c, d Additionally, the protoversion could be statistically reconstructed. Mythological phylogenies also are a potentially powerful way to test hypotheses about cross-cultural relationships among folktalesRoss and al. 2013; Tehrani 2013. Mythological archetypes The Deluge, frontispiece to Gustave Dor√©'s illustrated edition of the Bible. Based on the story of Noah's Ark, this engraving shows humans and a tiger doomed by the flood futilely attempting to save their children and cubs. Comparative mythology has uncovered a number of parallels, or archetypes, between the myths of different cultures, including some very widespread recurring themes and plot elements.van der Sluijs (2011) provides a detailed listing of parallels, see van der Sluijs, Marinus Anthony: Traditional Cosmologies. The Global Mythology of Cosmic Creation and Destruction. 2011. London: All Round Publications (table of contents) =Creation of mankind from clay= The creation of man from clay is a theme that recurs throughout numerous world religions and mythologies. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Enkidu is created by the goddess Aruru out of clay. In Greek mythology, Prometheus molded men out of water and earth. Per the Hebrew Bible, (Genesis 2:7) \\"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul\\". In Hindu mythology the mother of Ganesh, Parvati, made Ganesh from clay and turned the clay into flesh and blood. And lastly, in Chinese mythology (see Chu Ci and Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era), N√ºwa molded figures from the yellow earth, giving them life and the ability to bear children. =Acquisition of fire for the benefit of humanity= The theft of fire for the benefit of humanity is a theme that recurs in many world mythologies. A few examples include: In Greek mythology, according to Hesiod, the Titan Prometheus steals the heavenly fire for humanity, enabling the progress of civilization. In the Book of Enoch, the fallen angels and Azazel teach early humanity to use tools and fire. Per the ancient Indian collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns, the Rigveda (3:9.5), speaks of a hero MƒÅtari≈õvan who recovered fire which had been hidden from humanity. =Flood myth= Cultures around the world tell stories about a great flood.Segal, untitled, p. 88 In many cases, the flood leaves only one survivor or group of survivors. For example, both the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh and the Hebrew Bible tell of a global flood that wiped out humanity and of a man who saved the Earth's species by taking them aboard a boat.Woolley, p. 52 Similar stories of a single flood survivor appear in Hindu mythologyDimmitt and van Buitenen, pp. 71‚Äì74 as well as Greek, Norse mythology and Aztec mythology.Urton, p. 36 =Dying god= Ancient Sumerian cylinder seal impression showing the god Dumuzid being tortured in the Underworld by galla demons Many myths feature a god who dies and often returns to life.Frankfort, passim; Tortchinov, passim Such myths are particularly common in Near Eastern mythologies.Campbell, The Masks of God, p. 44 The anthropologist Sir James Frazer compared these dying god myths in his multi-volume work The Golden Bough. The Egyptian god Osiris and the Mesopotamian god Tammuz are examples of the dying god, while the Greek myths of Adonis (though a mortal) has often been compared to Osiris and the myth of Dionysos also features death and rebirth.Frankfort, p. 141 Some scholars have noted similarities between polytheistic stories of dying gods and the Christian story of Jesus of Nazareth.Robertson, passim =Creative sacrifice= Many cultures have stories about divine figures whose death creates an essential part of reality.Eliade, Cosmos and History, p. 20Eliade, Myth and Reality, pp. 99‚Äì100 These myths seem especially common among cultures that grow crops, particularly tubers.Eliade, Myth and Reality, p. 100 One such myth from the Wemale people of Seram Island, Indonesia, tells of a miraculously-conceived girl named Hainuwele, whose murdered corpse sprouts into the people's staple food crops.Eliade, Myth and Reality, pp. 104‚Äì5 The Chinese myth of Pangu,Railsback, passim the Indian Vedic myth of Purusha,Rig Veda 10:90 and the Norse myth of Ymir all tell of a cosmic giant who is killed to create the world. =Axis mundi= Many mythologies mention a place that sits at the center of the world and acts as a point of contact between different levels of the universe.Eliade, Images and Symbols, p. 40 This axis mundi is often marked by a sacred tree or other mythical object. For example, many myths describe a great tree or pillar joining heaven, earth, and the underworld.Eliade, Shamanism, p. 259‚Äì260 Vedic India, ancient China, Mayans, Incas and the Germanic peoples all had myths featuring a Cosmic Tree whose branches reach heaven and whose roots reach hell.Eliade, Images and Symbols, p. 44 =Deus otiosus= Many cultures believe in a celestial supreme being who has cut off contact with humanity. Historian Mircea Eliade calls this supreme being a deus otiosus (an \\"idle god\\"),Eliade, Myth and Reality, p. 93 although this term is also used more broadly, to refer to any god who doesn't interact regularly with humans. In many myths, the Supreme Being withdraws into the heavens after the creation of the world.Eliade, Myth and Reality, p. 93‚Äì98 Baluba mythology features such a story, in which the supreme god withdraws from the earth, leaving man to search for him.Leslau, passim Similarly, the mythology of the Hereros tells of a sky god who has abandoned mankind to lesser divinities.Eliade, Myth and Reality, p. 94 In the mythologies of highly complex cultures, the supreme being tends to disappear completely, replaced by a strong polytheistic belief system.Eliade, Myths, Dreams and Mysteries, p. 138 =Titanomachy= The Fall of the Titans (1596‚Äì98) by Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem Many cultures have a creation myth in which a group of younger, more civilized gods conquers and/or struggles against a group of older gods who represent the forces of chaos. In Hindu mythology, the younger devas (gods) battle the older asuras (demons), though both are born from the same father, Kashyap, the grandson of Brahma.http://www.manuscrypts.com/myth/2011/06/21/kashyapa-1/ In the Greek myth of the Titanomachy, the Olympian gods defeat the Titans, an older and more primitive divine race, and establish cosmic order.Squire, p. 47Hesiod, especially pp. 64‚Äì87 Similarly, the Celtic gods of life and light struggle against the Fomorians, ancient gods of death and darkness. This myth of the gods conquering demons ‚Äì and order conquering chaos ‚Äì is especially common in Indo-European mythologies. Some scholars suggest that the myth reflects the ancient Indo-Europeans' conquest of native peoples during their expansion over Europe and India.Campbell, The Masks of God, pp. 21‚Äì22Squire, pp. 69‚Äì70 =Giants= Associated with many mythological hero stories, giants (from Latin and Ancient Greek: gigas, cognate giga-) are beings of human appearance, but of prodigious size and strength common in the mythology and legends of many different cultures. In various Indo-European mythologies, gigantic peoples are featured as primeval creatures associated with chaos and the wild nature, and they are frequently in conflict with the gods, be they Olympian, Celtic, Hindu or Norse. Giants also often play similar roles in the mythologies and folklore of other, non Indo-European peoples, such as in the Nartian traditions. There are also accounts of giants in the Old Testament. Some of these are called Nephilim, a word often translated as giant although this translation is not universally accepted. They include Og King of Bashan, the Nephilim, the Anakim, and the giants of Egypt mentioned in 1 Chronicles 11:23. The first mention of the Nephilim is found in Genesis 6:4; attributed to them are extraordinary strength and physical proportions. =Dragons and serpents= Usually large to gigantic, serpent-like legendary creatures that appear in the folklore of many cultures around the world. Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire. Whereas dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. Chaoskampf One on one epic battles between these beasts are noted through out many cultures. Typically they consist of a hero or god battling a single to polycephalic dragon. The motif of (; ) is ubiquitous in myth and legend, depicting a battle of a culture hero deity with a chaos monster, often in the shape of a sea serpent or dragon. A few notable examples include: Zeus vs. Typhon and Hercules vs. the Lernaean Hydra, both of which are from Greek mythology, Thor vs. J√∂rmungandr of Norse mythology, Indra vs. Vritra of Indian mythology, Ra vs. Apep of Egyptian mythology, and Yu the Great vs. Xiangliu. Many other examples exist worldwide. Ouroboros Originating in ancient Egyptian iconography, the Ouroboros or uroborus is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. The Ouroboros entered western tradition via Greek magical tradition. In Norse mythology, the Ouroboros appears as the serpent J√∂rmungandr, one of the three children of Loki and Angrboda, which grew so large that it could encircle the world and grasp its tail in its teeth. In the Aitareya Brahmana, a Vedic text of the early 1st millennium BCE, the nature of the Vedic rituals is compared to \\"a snake biting its own tail.\\" It is a common belief among indigenous people of the tropical lowlands of South America that waters at the edge of the world-disc are encircled by a snake, often an anaconda, biting its own tail. =Founding myths= Cathedral of Maria Saal showing the infant twins Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf Many cultures have myths describing the origin of their customs, rituals, and identity. In fact, ancient and traditional societies have often justified their customs by claiming that their gods or mythical heroes established those customs.Eliade, Cosmos and History, pp. 21‚Äì34Eliade, Myth and Reality, pp. 6‚Äì8 For example, according to the myths of the Australian Karajarri, the mythical Bagadjimbiri brothers established all of the Karadjeri's customs, including the position in which they stand while urinating.Eliade, Myth and Reality, p. 8 =Structure of hero narratives= A number of scholars, including Fitzroy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan and, more recently, Joseph Campbell, have suggested that hero stories from various cultures have the same underlying structure.Taylor, p. 118‚Äì19 Folklorists such as Antti Aarne (Aarne-Thompson classification systems) and Georges Polti (The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations) have created structured reference systems to identify connections between myths from different cultures and regions. Some comparative mythologists look for similarities only among hero stories within a specific geographical or ethnic range. For example, the Austrian scholar Johann Georg von Hahn tried to identify a common structure underlying Aryan hero stories.Segal, Hero Myths, p. 12 Others, such as Campbell, propose theories about hero stories in general. According to Campbell's monomyth hypothesis, hero stories from around the world share a common plot structure.Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, passim Because of its extremely comparative nature, the monomyth hypothesis is currently out of favor with some religious scholars such as Lesley Northup. =Human cannibalism= Human cannibalism features in the myths, folklore, and legends of many cultures and is most often attributed to evil characters or as extreme retribution for some wrongdoing. Examples include Lamia of Greek mythology, a woman who became a child-eating monster after her children were destroyed by Hera, upon learning of her husband Zeus' trysts. In Zuni mythology and religion, √Åtahsaia is a giant cannibalistic demon, feeding on fellow demons and humans alike. He is depicted as having unblinking bulging eyes, long talons, and yellow tusks that protruded past his lips. The myth of Baxbaxwalanuksiwe, in Hamatsa society of the Kwakwaka'wakw indigenous tribe, tells of a man-eating giant, who lives in a strange house with red smoke emanating from its roof.

Essentially an agricultural festival, the Thargelia included a purifying and expiatory ceremony. While the people offered the first-fruits of the earth to the god in token of thankfulness, it was at the same time necessary to propitiate him, lest he might ruin the harvest by excessive heat, possibly accompanied by pestilence. The purificatory preceded the thanksgiving service. On the 6th a sheep was sacrificed to Demeter Chloe on the Acropolis, and perhaps a swine to the Fates, but the most important ritual was the following. Two men, the ugliest that could be found (the Pharmakoi) were chosen to die, one for the men, the other (according to some, a woman) for the women. Hipponax of Colophon claims that on the day of the sacrifice they were led round with strings of figs on their necks, and whipped on the genitals with rods of figwood and squills. When they reached the place of sacrifice on the shore, they were stoned to death, their bodies burnt, and the ashes thrown into the sea (or over the land, to act as a fertilizing influence). However, it is unclear how accurate Hipponax's sixth-century, poetical account of the ceremony is, and there is much scholarly debate as to its reliability.Jan Bremmer, \\"Scapegoat Rituals in Ancient Greece,\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 87 (1983): 299‚Äì320. It is supposed that an actual human sacrifice took place on this occasion, replaced in later times by a milder form of expiation. Thus at Leucas a criminal was annually thrown from a rock into the sea as a scapegoat: but his fall was checked by live birds and feathers attached to his person, and men watched below in small boats, who caught him and escorted him beyond the boundary of the city. Nevertheless, many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the pharmakos (the iambic satirist Hipponax) shows the pharmakos being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes they weren't depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death. Similarly, at Massilia, on the occasion of some heavy calamity (plague or famine), one of the poorest inhabitants volunteered as a scapegoat. For a year he was fed up at the public expense, then clothed in sacred garments, led through the city amidst execrations, and cast out beyond the boundaries. The ceremony on the 7th was of a cheerful character. All kinds of first-fruits were carried in procession and offered to the god, and, as at the Pyanepsia (or Pyanopsia), branches of olive bound with wool, borne by children, were affixed by them to the doors of the houses. These branches, originally intended as a charm to avert failure of the crops, were afterwards regarded as forming part of a supplicatory service. On the second day choruses of men and boys took part in musical contests, the prize for which was a tripod. Further, on this day adopted persons were solemnly received into the genos and phratria of their adoptive parents.

Noon played on Def Leppard's The Def Leppard E.P. in 1978. About thirteen years later, he played in the band Roadhouse with Pete Willis, who was a member of Def Leppard when Noon performed with them. He played on Roadhouse's demo, but was replaced by drummer Trevor Brewis before the recording of Roadhouse's album. Noon also play drums for various other bands including Lionheart, Wild Fire, Wild Horses (not the same band that Johnny Edwards, Rick Steier and James Kottak were in), Stampede, Waysted, Di'anno, More and Crazy Lesbians. Noon was never an official member of Def Leppard. Although he was asked to join permanently, he declined the offer to stay with The Next Band.Some time during the week between Tony Kenning's dismissal and the recording of the EP, Elliott asked Noon if he would consider joining Def Leppard permanently. Noon declined, remaining faithful to the Next Band. Def Leppard, just recently booking studio time and very recently without a drummer, hired Noon to play. The studio was the only time they have ever played together. In February 2003, Noon joined the reformed Atomic Mass for a photo at the Hallam FM Arena.

Many ecosystems, particularly prairie, savanna, chaparral and coniferous forests, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to habitat vitality and renewal. Many plant species in fire-affected environments require fire to germinate, establish, or to reproduce. Wildfire suppression not only eliminates these species, but also the animals that depend upon them. Campaigns in the United States have historically molded public opinion to believe that wildfires are always harmful to nature. This view is based on the outdated beliefs that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance, such as fire, disrupts the harmony of nature. More recent ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and biodiversity of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire. More generally, fire is now regarded as a 'natural disturbance', similar to flooding, wind-storms, and landslides, that has driven the evolution of species and controls the characteristics of ecosystems. Fire suppression, in combination with other human-caused environmental changes, may have resulted in unforeseen consequences for natural ecosystems. Some large wildfires in the United States have been blamed on years of fire suppression and the continuing expansion of people into fire-adapted ecosystems, but climate change is more likely responsible. Land managers are faced with tough questions regarding how to restore a natural fire regime, but allowing wildfires to burn is the least expensive and likely most effective method. A combination of photos taken at a photo point at Florida Panther NWR. The photos are panoramic and cover a 360 degree view from a monitoring point. These photos range from pre-burn to 2 year post burn. Fire components A fire regime describes the characteristics of fire and how it interacts with a particular ecosystem. Its \\"severity\\" is a term that ecologists use to refer to the impact that a fire has on an ecosystem. Ecologists can define this in many ways, but one way is through an estimate of plant mortality. Fire can burn at three levels. Ground fires will burn through soil that is rich in organic matter. Surface fires will burn through dead plant material that is lying on the ground. Crown fires will burn in the tops of shrubs and trees. Ecosystems generally experience a mix of all three. Fires will often break out during a dry season, but in some areas wildfires may also commonly occur during a time of year when lightning is prevalent. The frequency over a span of years at which fire will occur at a particular location is a measure of how common wildfires are in a given ecosystem. It is either defined as the average interval between fires at a given site, or the average interval between fires in an equivalent specified area.Bond and Keeley 2005 Defined as the energy released per unit length of fireline (kW m‚àí1), wildfire intensity can be estimated either as * the product of **the linear spread rate (m s‚àí1), ** the low heat of combustion (kJ kg‚àí1), ** and the combusted fuel mass per unit area, *or it can be estimated from the flame length.Byram, 1959 Radiata pine plantation burnt during the 2003 Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires, Australia Abiotic responses Fires can affect soils through heating and combustion processes. Depending on the temperatures of the soils caused by the combustion processes, different effects will happen- from evaporation of water at the lower temperature ranges, to the combustion of soil organic matter and formation of pyrogenic organic matter, otherwise known as charcoal. Fires can cause changes in soil nutrients through a variety of mechanisms, which include oxidation, volatilization, erosion, and leaching by water, but the event must usually be of high temperatures in order of significant loss of nutrients to occur. However, quantity of nutrients available in soils are usually increased due to the ash that is generated, and this is made quickly available, as opposed to the slow release of nutrients by decomposition. Rock spalling (or thermal exfoliation) accelerates weathering of rock and potentially the release of some nutrients. Increase in the pH of the soil following a fire is commonly observed, most likely due to the formation of calcium carbonate, and the subsequent decomposition of this calcium carbonate to calcium oxide when temperatures get even higher. It could also be due to the increased cation content in the soil due to the ash, which temporarily increases soil pH. Microbial activity in the soil might also increase due to the heating of soil and increased nutrient content in the soil, though studies have also found complete loss of microbes on the top layer of soil after a fire. Overall, soils become more basic (higher pH) following fires because of acid combustion. By driving novel chemical reactions at high temperatures, fire can even alter the texture and structure of soils by affecting the clay content and the soil's porosity. Removal of vegetation following a fire can cause several effects on the soil, such as increasing the temperatures of the soil during the day due to increased solar radiation on the soil surface, and greater cooling due to loss of radiative heat at night. Fewer leaves to intercept rain will also cause more rain to reach the soil surface, and with fewer plants to absorb the water, the amount of water content in the soils might increase. However, it might be seen that ash can be water repellent when dry, and therefore water content and availability might not actually increase. Biotic responses and adaptations =Plants= Lodgepole pine cones Plants have evolved many adaptations to cope with fire. Of these adaptations, one of the best-known is likely pyriscence, where maturation and release of seeds is triggered, in whole or in part, by fire or smoke; this behaviour is often erroneously called serotiny, although this term truly denotes the much broader category of seed release activated by any stimulus. All pyriscent plants are serotinous, but not all serotinous plants are pyriscent (some are necriscent, hygriscent, xeriscent, soliscent, or some combination thereof). On the other hand, germination of seed activated by trigger is not to be confused with pyriscence; it is known as physiological dormancy. In chaparral communities in Southern California, for example, some plants have leaves coated in flammable oils that encourage an intense fire. This heat causes their fire-activated seeds to germinate (an example of dormancy) and the young plants can then capitalize on the lack of competition in a burnt landscape. Other plants have smoke-activated seeds, or fire- activated buds. The cones of the Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) are, conversely, pyriscent: they are sealed with a resin that a fire melts away, releasing the seeds.USDA Forest Service Many plant species, including the shade-intolerant giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), require fire to make gaps in the vegetation canopy that will let in light, allowing their seedlings to compete with the more shade-tolerant seedlings of other species, and so establish themselves.US National Park Service Because their stationary nature precludes any fire avoidance, plant species may only be fire- intolerant, fire-tolerant or fire-resistant.Kramp et al. 1986 Fire intolerance Fire-intolerant plant species tend to be highly flammable and are destroyed completely by fire. Some of these plants and their seeds may simply fade from the community after a fire and not return; others have adapted to ensure that their offspring survives into the next generation. \\"Obligate seeders\\" are plants with large, fire-activated seed banks that germinate, grow, and mature rapidly following a fire, in order to reproduce and renew the seed bank before the next fire.Knox and Clarke 2005 Seeds may contain the receptor protein KAI2, that is activated by the growth hormones karrikin released by the fire. Fire tolerance. Typical regrowth after an Australian bushfire Fire tolerance Fire-tolerant species are able to withstand a degree of burning and continue growing despite damage from fire. These plants are sometimes referred to as \\"resprouters.\\" Ecologists have shown that some species of resprouters store extra energy in their roots to aid recovery and re-growth following a fire. For example, after an Australian bushfire, the Mountain Grey Gum tree (Eucalyptus cypellocarpa) starts producing a mass of shoots of leaves from the base of the tree all the way up the trunk towards the top, making it look like a black stick completely covered with young, green leaves. Fire resistance Fire-resistant plants suffer little damage during a characteristic fire regime. These include large trees whose flammable parts are high above surface fires. Mature ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) is an example of a tree species that suffers virtually no crown damage under a naturally mild fire regime, because it sheds its lower, vulnerable branches as it matures.Pyne 2002 =Animals, birds and microbes= A mixed flock of hawks hunting in and around a bushfire Like plants, animals display a range of abilities to cope with fire, but they differ from most plants in that they must avoid the actual fire to survive. Although birds are vulnerable when nesting, they are generally able to escape a fire; indeed they often profit from being able to take prey fleeing from a fire and to recolonize burned areas quickly afterwards. Some anthropological and ethno-ornithological evidence suggests that certain species of fire- foraging raptors may engage in intentional fire propagation to flush out prey. Mammals are often capable of fleeing a fire, or seeking cover if they can burrow. Amphibians and reptiles may avoid flames by burrowing into the ground or using the burrows of other animals. Amphibians in particular are able to take refuge in water or very wet mud. Some arthropods also take shelter during a fire, although the heat and smoke may actually attract some of them, to their peril.DeBano et al. 1998 Microbial organisms in the soil vary in their heat tolerance but are more likely to be able to survive a fire the deeper they are in the soil. A low fire intensity, a quick passing of the flames and a dry soil will also help. An increase in available nutrients after the fire has passed may result in larger microbial communities than before the fire.Hart et al. 2005 The generally greater heat tolerance of bacteria relative to fungi makes it possible for soil microbial population diversity to change following a fire, depending on the severity of the fire, the depth of the microbes in the soil, and the presence of plant cover. Certain species of fungi, such as Cylindrocarpon destructans appear to be unaffected by combustion contaminants, which can inhibit re-population of burnt soil by other microorganisms, and therefore have a higher chance of surviving fire disturbance and then recolonizing and out-competing other fungal species afterwards. Fire and ecological succession Fire behavior is different in every ecosystem and the organisms in those ecosystems have adapted accordingly. One sweeping generality is that in all ecosystems, fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, with areas ranging from those having just been burned to those that have been untouched by fire for many years. This is a form of ecological succession in which a freshly burned site will progress through continuous and directional phases of colonization following the destruction caused by the fire.Begon et al. 1996, pg. 692 Ecologists usually characterize succession through the changes in vegetation that successively arise. After a fire, the first species to re-colonize will be those with seeds are already present in the soil, or those with seeds are able to travel into the burned area quickly. These are generally fast-growing herbaceous plants that require light and are intolerant of shading. As time passes, more slowly growing, shade-tolerant woody species will suppress some of the herbaceous plants.Begon et al. 1996, pg 700 Conifers are often early successional species, while broad leaf trees frequently replace them in the absence of fire. Hence, many conifer forests are themselves dependent upon recurring fire.Keddy 2007, Chapter 6 Different species of plants, animals, and microbes specialize in exploiting different stages in this process of succession, and by creating these different types of patches, fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape. Soil characteristics will be a factor in determining the specific nature of a fire-adapted ecosystem, as will climate and topography. Examples of fire in different ecosystems =Forests= Mild to moderate fires burn in the forest understory, removing small trees and herbaceous groundcover. High-severity fires will burn into the crowns of the trees and kill most of the dominant vegetation. Crown fires may require support from ground fuels to maintain the fire in the forest canopy (passive crown fires), or the fire may burn in the canopy independently of any ground fuel support (an active crown fire). High-severity fire creates complex early seral forest habitat, or snag forest with high levels of biodiversity. When a forest burns frequently and thus has less plant litter build-up, below-ground soil temperatures rise only slightly and will not be lethal to roots that lie deep in the soil. Although other characteristics of a forest will influence the impact of fire upon it, factors such as climate and topography play an important role in determining fire severity and fire extent.Beaty and Taylor (2001) Fires spread most widely during drought years, are most severe on upper slopes and are influenced by the type of vegetation that is growing. Forests in British Columbia In Canada, forests cover about 10% of the land area and yet harbor 70% of the country‚Äôs bird and terrestrial mammal species. Natural fire regimes are important in maintaining a diverse assemblage of vertebrate species in up to twelve different forest types in British Columbia.Bunnell (1995) Different species have adapted to exploit the different stages of succession, regrowth and habitat change that occurs following an episode of burning, such as downed trees and debris. The characteristics of the initial fire, such as its size and intensity, cause the habitat to evolve differentially afterwards and influence how vertebrate species are able to use the burned areas. =Shrublands= Lightning-sparked wildfires are frequent occurrences on shrublands and grasslands in Nevada. Shrub fires typically concentrate in the canopy and spread continuously if the shrubs are close enough together. Shrublands are typically dry and are prone to accumulations of highly volatile fuels, especially on hillsides. Fires will follow the path of least moisture and the greatest amount of dead fuel material. Surface and below-ground soil temperatures during a burn are generally higher than those of forest fires because the centers of combustion lie closer to the ground, although this can vary greatly. Common plants in shrubland or chaparral include manzanita, chamise and Coyote Brush. California shrublands California shrubland, commonly known as chaparral, is a widespread plant community of low growing species, typically on arid sloping areas of the California Coast Ranges or western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. There are a number of common shrubs and tree shrub forms in this association, including salal, toyon, coffeeberry and Western poison oak.C.Michael Hogan (2008) \\"Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum\\" , GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Str√∂mberg Regeneration following a fire is usually a major factor in the association of these species. South African Fynbos shrublands Fynbos shrublands occur in a small belt across South Africa. The plant species in this ecosystem are highly diverse, yet the majority of these species are obligate seeders, that is, a fire will cause germination of the seeds and the plants will begin a new life-cycle because of it. These plants may have coevolved into obligate seeders as a response to fire and nutrient-poor soils.Wisheu et al. (2000) Because fire is common in this ecosystem and the soil has limited nutrients, it is most efficient for plants to produce many seeds and then die in the next fire. Investing a lot of energy in roots to survive the next fire when those roots will be able to extract little extra benefit from the nutrient-poor soil would be less efficient. It is possible that the rapid generation time that these obligate seeders display has led to more rapid evolution and speciation in this ecosystem, resulting in its highly diverse plant community. =Grasslands= Grasslands burn more readily than forest and shrub ecosystems, with the fire moving through the stems and leaves of herbaceous plants and only lightly heating the underlying soil, even in cases of high intensity. In most grassland ecosystems, fire is the primary mode of decomposition, making it crucial in the recycling of nutrients. In some grassland systems, fire only became the primary mode of decomposition after the disappearance of large migratory herds of browsing or grazing megafauna driven by predator pressure. In the absence of functional communities of large migratory herds of herbivorous megafauna and attendant predators, overuse of fire to maintain grassland ecosystems may lead to excessive oxidation, loss of carbon, and desertification in susceptible climates. Some grassland ecosystems respond poorly to fire. North American grasslands In North America fire-adapted invasive grasses such as Bromus tectorum contribute to increased fire frequency which exerts selective pressure against native species. This is a concern for grasslands in the Western United States. In less arid grassland presettlement fires worked in concert with grazing to create a healthy grassland ecosystem as indicated by the accumulation of soil organic matter significantly altered by fire. The tallgrass prairie ecosystem in the Flint Hills of eastern Kansas and Oklahoma is responding positively to the current use of fire in combination with grazing. South African savanna In the savanna of South Africa, recently burned areas have new growth that provides palatable and nutritious forage compared to older, tougher grasses. This new forage attracts large herbivores from areas of unburned and grazed grassland that has been kept short by constant grazing. On these unburned \\"lawns\\", only those plant species adapted to heavy grazing are able to persist; but the distraction provided by the newly burned areas allows grazing-intolerant grasses to grow back into the lawns that have been temporarily abandoned, so allowing these species to persist within that ecosystem.Archibald et al. 2005 =Longleaf pine savannas= Yellow pitcher plant is dependent upon recurring fire in coastal plain savannas and flatwoods. Much of the southeastern United States was once open longleaf pine forest with a rich understory of grasses, sedges, carnivorous plants and orchids. The above maps shows that these ecosystems (coded as pale blue) had the highest fire frequency of any habitat, once per decade or less. Without fire, deciduous forest trees invade, and their shade eliminates both the pines and the understory. Some of the typical plants associated with fire include Yellow Pitcher Plant and Rose pogonia. The abundance and diversity of such plants is closely related to fire frequency. Rare animals such as gopher tortoises and indigo snakes also depend upon these open grasslands and flatwoods.Means, D. Bruce. 2006. Vertebrate faunal diversity in longleaf pine savannas. Pages 155-213 in S. Jose, E. Jokela and D. Miller (eds.) Longleaf Pine Ecosystems: Ecology, Management and Restoration. Springer, New York. xii + 438 pp. Hence, the restoration of fire is a priority to maintain species composition and biological diversity.Peet, R. K. and Allard, D. J. (1993). Longleaf pine vegetation of the southern Atlantic and eastern Gulf Coast regions: a preliminary classification. In The Longleaf Pine Ecosystem: Ecology, Restoration and Management, ed. S. M. Hermann, pp. 45‚Äì81. Tallahassee, FL: Tall Timbers Research Station. =Fire in wetlands= Although it may seem strange, many kinds of wetlands are also influenced by fire. This usually occurs during periods of drought. In landscapes with peat soils, such as bogs, the peat substrate itself may burn, leaving holes that refill with water as new ponds. Fires that are less intense will remove accumulated litter and allow other wetland plants to regenerate from buried seeds, or from rhizomes. Wetlands that are influenced by fire include coastal marshes, wet prairies, peat bogs, floodplains, prairie marshes and flatwoods. Keddy 2010, p. 114-120. Since wetlands can store large amounts of carbon in peat, the fire frequency of vast northern peatlands is linked to processes controlling the carbon dioxide levels of the atmosphere, and to the phenomenon of global warming. Vitt et al. 2005 Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is abundant in wetlands and plays a critical role in their ecology. In the Florida Everglades, a significant portion of the DOC is \\"dissolved charcoal\\" indicating that fire can play a critical role in wetland ecosystems. Fire suppression Fire serves many important functions within fire-adapted ecosystems. Fire plays an important role in nutrient cycling, diversity maintenance and habitat structure. The suppression of fire can lead to unforeseen changes in ecosystems that often adversely affect the plants, animals and humans that depend upon that habitat. Wildfires that deviate from a historical fire regime because of fire suppression are called \\"uncharacteristic fires\\". =Chaparral communities= In 2003, southern California witnessed powerful chaparral wildfires. Hundreds of homes and hundreds of thousands of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme fire weather (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of dead plant material from 8 years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads,Minnich 1983 a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this may not have been the case.Keeley et al. 1999 Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used to imply that the larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and is no longer supported by the majority of fire ecologists. One consequence of the fires in 2003 has been the increased density of invasive and non-native plant species that have quickly colonized burned areas, especially those that had already been burned in the previous 15 years. Because shrubs in these communities are adapted to a particular historical fire regime, altered fire regimes may change the selective pressures on plants and favor invasive and non-native species that are better able to exploit the novel post-fire conditions.Keeley et al. 2005 =Fish impacts= The Boise National Forest is a US national forest located north and east of the city of Boise, Idaho. Following several uncharacteristically large wildfires, an immediately negative impact on fish populations was observed, posing particular danger to small and isolated fish populations.Burton (2005) In the long term, however, fire appears to rejuvenate fish habitats by causing hydraulic changes that increase flooding and lead to silt removal and the deposition of a favorable habitat substrate. This leads to larger post-fire populations of the fish that are able to recolonize these improved areas. But although fire generally appears favorable for fish populations in these ecosystems, the more intense effects of uncharacteristic wildfires, in combination with the fragmentation of populations by human barriers to dispersal such as weirs and dams, will pose a threat to fish populations. Fire as a management tool Prescribed Burn in Oak Savannah in Iowa Restoration ecology is the name given to an attempt to reverse or mitigate some of the changes that humans have caused to an ecosystem. Controlled burning is one tool that is currently receiving considerable attention as a means of restoration and management. Applying fire to an ecosystem may create habitats for species that have been negatively impacted by fire suppression, or fire may be used as a way of controlling invasive species without resorting to herbicides or pesticides. However, there is debate as to what state managers should aim to restore their ecosystems to, especially as to whether \\"natural\\" means pre-human or pre-European. Native American use of fire, not natural fires, historically maintained the diversity of the savannas of North America.MacDougall et al. (2004) When, how, and where managers should use fire as a management tool is a subject of debate. =The Great Plains shortgrass prairie= A combination of heavy livestock grazing and fire-suppression has drastically altered the structure, composition, and diversity of the shortgrass prairie ecosystem on the Great Plains, allowing woody species to dominate many areas and promoting fire-intolerant invasive species. In semi-arid ecosystems where the decomposition of woody material is slow, fire is crucial for returning nutrients to the soil and allowing the grasslands to maintain their high productivity. Although fire can occur during the growing or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most effective at increasing the grass and forb cover, biodiversity and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies.Brockway et al. 2002 Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire if they want to restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because this is the time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.Emery and Gross (2005) =Mixed conifer forests in the US Sierra Nevada= Mixed conifer forests in the United States Sierra Nevada used to have fire return intervals that ranged from 5 years up to 300 years, depending on the local climate. Lower elevations had more frequent fire return intervals, whilst higher and wetter elevations saw much longer intervals between fires. Native Americans tended to set fires during fall and winter, and land at a higher elevation was generally occupied by Native Americans only during the summer. = Finnish boreal forests = The decline of habitat area and quality has caused many species populations to be red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to a study on forest management of Finnish boreal forests, improving the habitat quality of areas outside reserves can help in conservation efforts of endangered deadwood-dependent beetles. These beetles and various types of fungi both need dead trees in order to survive. Old growth forests can provide this particular habitat. However, most Fennoscandian boreal forested areas are used for timber and therefore are unprotected. The use of controlled burning and tree retention of a forested area with deadwood was studied and its effect on the endangered beetles. The study found that after the first year of management the number of species increased in abundance and richness compared to pre-fire treatment. The abundance of beetles continued to increase the following year in sites where tree retention was high and deadwood was abundant. The correlation between forest fire management and increased beetle populations shows a key to conserving these red-listed species. =Australian eucalypt forests= Much of the old growth eucalypt forest in Australia is designated for conservation. Management of these forests is important because species like Eucalyptus grandis rely on fire to survive. There are a few eucalypt species that do not have a lignotuber, a root swelling structure that contains buds where new shoots can then sprout. During a fire a lignotuber is helpful in the reestablishment of the plant. Because some eucalypts do not have this particular mechanism, forest fire management can be helpful by creating rich soil, killing competitors, and allowing seeds to be released. Management policies =United States= Fire policy in the United States involves the federal government, individual state governments, tribal governments, interest groups, and the general public. The new federal outlook on fire policy parallels advances in ecology and is moving towards the view that many ecosystems depend on disturbance for their diversity and for the proper maintenance of their natural processes. Although human safety is still the number one priority in fire management, new US government objectives include a long-term view of ecosystems. The newest policy allows managers to gauge the relative values of private property and resources in particular situations and to set their priorities accordingly. One of the primary goals in fire management is to improve public education in order to suppress the \\"Smokey Bear\\" fire-suppression mentality and introduce the public to the benefits of regular natural fires.

Screen burn-in, image burn-in, or ghost image, colloquially known as screen burn or ghosting, is a discoloration of areas on an electronic display such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) display or an old computer monitor or television set caused by cumulative non-uniform use of the pixels. Newer liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) may suffer from a phenomenon called image persistence instead, which is not permanent.  Causes of screen burn  With phosphor-based electronic displays (for example CRT-type computer monitors or plasma displays), non-uniform use of pixels, such as prolonged display of non- moving images (text or graphics), gaming, or certain broadcasts with tickers and flags, can create a permanent ghost-like image of these objects or otherwise degrade image quality. This is because the phosphor compounds which emit light to produce images lose their luminance with use. Uneven use results in uneven light output over time, and in severe cases can create a ghost image of previous content. Even if ghost images are not recognizable, the effects of screen burn are an immediate and continual degradation of image quality. The length of time required for noticeable screen burn to develop varies due to many factors, ranging from the quality of the phosphors employed, to the degree of non-uniformity of sub-pixel use. It can take as little as only a few weeks for noticeable ghosting to set in, especially if the screen displays a certain image (example: a menu bar at the top or bottom of the screen) constantly, and displays it continually over time. In the rare case when horizontal or vertical deflection circuits fail, all output energy is concentrated to a vertical or horizontal line on the display which causes almost instant screen burn. CRT Screen burn on an amber CRT computer monitor. Note that there are two separate burned-in images: one of a spreadsheet program, and another of an ASCII-art welcome screen. Phosphor burn-in is particularly prevalent with monochromatic CRT screens, such as the amber or green monochrome monitors common on older computer systems and dumb terminal stations. This is partly because those screens displayed mostly non- moving images, and at one intensity: fully on. Yellow screens are more susceptible than either green or white screens because the yellow phosphor is less efficient and thus requires a higher beam current. Color screens, by contrast, use three separate phosphors (red, green, and blue), mixed in varying intensities to achieve specific colors, and in typical usage patterns such as \\"traditional\\" TV viewing (non-gaming, non-converged TV usage, non- Internet browsing, broadcasts without tickers or flags, no prolonged or permanent letterboxing) are used for operations where colors and on-screen object placement approach uniformity. Modern CRT displays are less susceptible than older CRTs prior to the 1960s because they have a layer of aluminum behind the phosphor which offers some protection. The aluminum layer was provided to reflect more light from the phosphor towards the viewer. As a bonus, the aluminum layer also prevented ion burn of the phosphor and the ion trap, common to older monochrome televisions, was no longer required. Plasma, LCD, and OLED displays A nearly two-year-old LCD television showing extreme burn-in of CNN's circa 2008 digital on-screen graphic; this television is in a McDonald's restaurant where CNN is permanently turned on and displayed throughout the business day. Burn-in on a plasma screen at Dallas Fort-Worth airport Plasma displays were at one time highly susceptible to burn-in, while LCD-type displays are generally not affected. The wide variation in luminance degradation with RGB-based OLED will cause noticeable color drift over time (where one of the red-green-blue colors becomes more prominent). In the case of LCDs, the mechanics of burn-in are different than plasma and OLED, which develop burn-in from luminance degradation of the light-emitting pixels. For LCDs, burn-in develops in some cases because pixels permanently lose their ability to return to their relaxed state after a continued static use profile. In most typical usage profiles, this image persistence in LCD is only transient. Both plasma-type and LCD-type displays exhibit a similar phenomenon called transient image persistence, which is similar to screen burn but is not permanent. In the case of plasma-type displays, transient image persistence is caused by charge build-up in the pixel cells (not cumulative luminance degradation as with burn-in), which can be seen sometimes when a bright image that was set against a dark background is replaced by a dark background only; this image retention is usually released once a typical-brightness image is displayed and does not inhibit the display's typical viewing image quality. Mitigation Screensavers derive their name from their original purpose, which was an active method of attempting to stave off screen burn. By ensuring that no pixel or group of pixels was left displaying a static image for extended periods of time, phosphor luminosity was preserved. Modern screensavers can turn off the screen when not in use. In many cases, the use of a screensaver is impractical. Most plasma-type display manufacturers include methods for reducing the rate of burn-in by moving the image slightly, which does not eliminate screen burn, but can soften the edges of any ghost image that does develop. Similar techniques exist for modern OLED displays. For example, manufacturers of Android Wear watches with OLED displays can request that Android Wear enable \\"burn protection techniques\\" that periodically shift the contents of the screen by a few pixels. Other examples: Apple‚Äôs iPhone X and Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy series both mitigate or delay the onset of burn-in by shifting the pixels every minute or so and same for the battery, wifi, location, and service bars. Also, parallax scrolling may be enabled for the home screen to give icons a 3D-like effect, a setting Apple refers to as \\"perspective zoom\\". AG Neovo patented Anti-burn-in technology is also using pixel shifting to activate the pixels to move by the designed time interval to prevent burn in effect on LCD monitors. Google requests that when these techniques are enabled, watch face developers do not use large blocks of pixels so that different pixels are burned in with each shift, reducing the overall wear of the pixels. Some screensavers move around, such as those on DVD players, or those on some televisions that move around paused video after a long period of inactivity. Depending on the type of screen, it is sometimes possible to remedy screen burn-in through the use of remedial software and remedial devices. In the case of OLED screens on Android phones, burn-in reduction apps can display an inverted image of the navigation and status bars (which are constantly displayed and therefore the most likely elements to be burned in) to burn in opposite pattern, resulting in a screen whose sub-pixels have more even luminosity and therefore less visible burn-in artifacts. Historical notes The most prevalent burn-in image on early televisions was said to be that of the RCA Indian-head test pattern, which would often follow the formal television station sign-off. This was due to the viewer leaving the television set on at the end of the day, which was not recommended by the television manufacturers.

The player operates a business that owns stores and apartments in a city derived from the Monopoly board game. Instead of using dice, the game relies more on the speed and innovativeness of the players. In the standard mode, the user plays against the AI opponents. In the multiplayer version, players go against other online players in order to gain victory. There are various levels with varying difficulty. Some involve just financial prosperity of the businesses while others involve success in the political arena. But the primary objective of most levels is to accumulate the most wealth in the given time. Gameplay In Monopoly Tycoon, the player operates a business by owning businesses, apartments, and being landlord to blocks. The player earns income from selling products and services, housing people in apartments and hotels. Income is also generated from rent for any blocks that the player is landlord of, plus utilities and railroads. Monopoly Tycoon has the same set of blocks as the board game with an additional three. When a player is landlord of all blocks of the same color, they are able to build hotels. In addition, being landlord of any property allows the player to build park space. As in the board game, there are railroads and utilities blocks that players can become landlord of and receive income from. To become landlord, there is an auction among the players with the property going to the highest bidder. At the end of the day, the player is offered a mystery card similar to those from the board game. Some of the cards are a simple deposit or withdrawal of money from the player's account. Other cards allow the player to aid his businesses or harm the opponent, say by restocking one of his stores or giving an opponent block bad publicity. Monopoly Tycoon also includes support for multiplayer game play over a LAN or Internet connection. Additionally, there is support for finding live online opponents through the included GameSpy Arcade software.Examining the status of one of your businesses during a game. On the left side you have the summary of its income, profit, sales, etc. Music and sound effects The music of the game is lighthearted and changes as the game progresses through the different decades. For example, in the 1970s (1970 and 1975 Monopoly Tycoon years), music from the 1970s can be heard; in 1990 and 1995, 1990s music plays. This music will play until the year 2030 is reached (this year can only be reached in the \\"My Mega Metropolis\\" level, \\"Starting Out\\", \\"A Homely City\\", \\"Sell, Sell, Sell\\", and the \\"First to be Worth $20,000, $25,000, or $40,000\\" levels). At that point, music from the 1930s can be heard from then on. After every two days at midnight, the music from the previous decade becomes quieter and quickly fades away, while the music from the next decade starts at normal volume. For example, when midnight of 1960 occurs, the music from the 1950s fades away and the music from the 1960s plays at normal volume. Other sounds indicate the time of day. People, cars, and the wind all make noises, in varying degrees depending on the time of day. For example, during the morning, footsteps of people waking up and coming out of their apartments is played to signify the time the city wakes up. Throughout the game, also, the sound of coins falling can be heard when the player makes money. Enabling the music makes the game crash on Windows Vista and later. This is due to the usage of the DirectShow Windows Media Source Filter being used to stream .wma files directly, instead of from the CD. The filter is also utilized by Windows Media Player 6.4, which gets installed alongside the game. It was deprecated in favor of Media Foundation in Windows Vista, with higher quality streaming of .wma files. Only three games so far are known to use this filter. Reception Monopoly Tycoon was a commercial success, selling nearly 2 million copies by 2006. Lead designer Clive Robert explained that these sales \\"took years\\" to achieve, and that the game continued to sell as of 2006, after its release in September 2001. In the United States, Monopoly Tycoon sold 290,000 copies and earned $6.8 million by August 2006. Edge ranked it as the 66th best-selling computer game released in the country between January 2000 and August 2006. Monopoly Tycoon received generally positive reviews from critics. It received a 'great' score of 8.5/10 from GameSpot and a 'great' score from IGN of 8.2/10. Trey Walker at GameSpot said that \\"Monopoly Tycoon is the kind of game you might have imagined as a kid while you played the real board game.\\" The developers of the game, however, were critical of their work saying that \\"I don‚Äôt think we got it entirely right either.\\" The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated Monopoly Tycoon for its 2001 \\"Online Game Play of the Year\\" and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering\\" awards, which ultimately went to Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Grand Theft Auto III, respectively. Monopoly Tycoon was also a nominee for Computer Gaming Worlds 2001 \\"Best Strategy Game\\" award, although it lost to Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns. The editors presented Monopoly Tycoon with a special prize for the \\"Best Use of a License That Was Ignored\\", and wrote, \\"Blessed with great AI and gameplay, Monopoly Tycoon was probably the most pleasant surprise of the year.\\" Notes External links * *Monopoly Tycoon at GameSpot *Monopoly Tycoon Music Composers Category:Monopoly video games Category:Business simulation games Category:2001 video games Category:Infogrames games Category:Windows games Category:Mobile games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Lua (programming language)-scripted video games ","title":"Monopoly Tycoon"},{"id":"1924118","title":"Phoenix Stakes"},{"id":"1924132","text":"Greek Academy may refer to: * New Academy (Moscopole), an educational institution operating from 1743 to 1769 in Moscopole * Academy of Athens (modern), the national academy of Greece * Greek Army Academy, an educational institution in Greece founded in 1828 in Nafplio by Ioannis Kapodistrias * Greek Film Academy, a professional honorary organization in Greece for filmmakers ","title":"Greek Academy"},{"id":"1924137","text":"Location of Pun√° Parish Pun√° Island is an island off the coast of southern EcuadorPun√° Island, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica at approximately 80 degrees west longitude and 3 degrees south latitude.

He was the drummer for Iron Maiden from 1978 to 1979. Biography Prior to joining Iron Maiden, Sampson was a member of one of Steve Harris' previous groups, Smiler, along with Dennis Willcock, Mick Clee (born 1949) and Tony Clee (b. 1949) in 1975, after which he was asked to join Iron Maiden at their inception in the same year. He declined to join at the time as he was \\"a bit fed up with the whole rock band thing\\" because he was \\"completely skint,\\" but accepted a further invitation from Steve Harris at Dennis Willcock's last gig to replace Barry Purkis in 1978 after he had taken up drumming again in a Southern Rock group called Janski. Following a year of rehearsing the band began playing small pubs with the band, during which they gained a large following, a highlight being a gig at London's famous Marque club. Doug participated in the recording of Iron Maiden's demo, later released as The Soundhouse Tapes, on 31 December 1978, Prowler and other tracks from it appeared in the charts of Neal Kay's Heavy Metal Soundhouse club, published weekly in Sounds. Iron Maiden eventually signed to EMI in 1979, following up by recording further demos, one song from these sessions (\\"Burning Ambition\\") was included on the B-Side of \\"Running Free\\". Sampson also played on Iron Maiden's BBC Archives released in November 2002 as part of the Eddie's Archive box set. It is a collection of songs from three live shows and one live radio broadcast, recorded by the BBC between 1979 and 1988. Sampson can be found on the BBC Radio 1 Friday Rock Show, 14 November 1979 disc. Sampson eventually left the band on 22 December 1979, following health issues brought about by the band's extensive touring schedule driving up and down the country in vans at night in a hectic schedule freezing half to death in the van and a lack of sleep contributing to fatigue and illness. Although he calls leaving Maiden \\"a blow,\\" he states that \\"After leaving Iron Maiden he had a jam with Chop Pitman and Tony Hatton from EL34 and they formed a new band Airforce when joined by Sam Sampson, Doug's brother who was the vocalist from local legends Sam's Apple Pie. Airforce played heavily in the London circuit including nights including the Ruskin Arms and the Marque supporting Shy.\\" In 2015, Sampson was invited to be a guest at The Legacy Projects charity fund raising gig supported many former members of Iron Maiden. Sampson brought down his Smiler drum kit that he also used in Iron Maiden and was swamped for autographs and photos, Sampson's old band, Airforce performed a set and had also contributed a track (\\"War Games\\") to the \\"Origins of Iron\\" compilation, which featured nine tracks by former members of Iron Maiden. After seeing the response from fans, in 2016, Sampson rejoined Airforce after a 20-year absence. He recorded three new tracks with the band and released their career-retrospective album, Judgement Day on 15 July 2016 via, WatchOut Records. Sampson finally returned to the stage, in April 2017. At just his second show back with Airforce, the band headlined the inaugural \\"Burr Fest\\" event, at The Lounge, in London. The event raised money for the MS Action Fund, in memory of Sampson's Iron Maiden successor, Clive Burr. Airforce have recorded a new EP \\"The Black Box Recordings: Volume 1\\", which was released on 21 July 2017. The EP was the first material to feature the reunited trio of Chop Pitman, Tony Hatton, and Doug Sampson, with new vocalist Dilian Arnaudov. The band then recorded The Black Box Recordings: Volume 2, a Special Soundhouse Edition of the EP featuring a rough mix and featuring Sampson's old Iron Maiden bandmate Paul Di'Anno, as a special guest vocalist on the track \\"Sniper\\" got its first public airing at the Born Again Heavy Metal Sound House event on 22 December in London. Sampson and Airforce will be recording an as yet untitled album in 2018 and can be found performing home and abroad in 2018.

A slug is a large quantity of gas or liquid that exits in the pipeline.  Slugs  Pipelines that transport both gas and liquids together, known as two-phase flow, can operate in a flow regime known as slugging flow or slug flow. Under the influence of gravity, liquids will tend to settle on the bottom of the pipeline, while the gases occupy the top section of the pipeline. Under certain operating conditions gas and liquid are not evenly distributed throughout the pipeline, but travel as large plugs with mostly liquids or mostly gases through the pipeline. These large plugs are called slugs. Slugs exiting the pipeline can overload the gas/liquid handling capacity of the plant at the pipeline outlet, as they are often produced at a much larger rate than the equipment is designed for. Slugs can be generated by different mechanisms in a pipeline: * Terrain slugging is caused by the elevations in the pipeline, which follows the ground elevation or the sea bed. Liquid can accumulate at a low point of the pipeline until sufficient pressure builds up behind it. Once the liquid is pushed out of the low point, it can form a slug. * Hydrodynamic slugging is caused by gas flowing at a fast rate over a slower flowing liquid phase. The gas will form waves on the liquid surface, which may grow to bridge the whole cross-section of the line. This creates a blockage on the gas flow, which travels as a slug through the line. * Riser-based slugging, also known as severe slugging, is associated with the pipeline risers often found in offshore oil production facilities. Liquids accumulate at the bottom of the riser until sufficient pressure is generated behind it to push the liquids over the top of the riser, overcoming the static head. Behind this slug of liquid follows a slug of gas, until sufficient liquids have accumulated at the bottom to form a new liquid slug. * Pigging slugs are caused by pigging operations in the pipeline. The pig is designed to push all or most of the liquids contents of the pipeline to the outlet. This intentionally creates a liquid slug. Slugs formed by terrain slugging, hydrodynamic slugging or riser-based slugging are periodical in nature. Whether a slug is able to reach the outlet of the pipeline depends on the rate at which liquids are added to the slug at the front (i.e. in the direction of flow) and the rate at which liquids leave the slug at the back. Some slugs will grow as they travel the pipeline, while others are damped and disappear before reaching the outlet of the pipeline.  Purpose of the slug catcher  A slug catcher is a vessel with sufficient buffer volume to store the largest slugs expected from the upstream system. The slug catcher is located between the outlet of the pipeline and the processing equipment. The buffered liquids can be drained to the processing equipment at a much slower rate to prevent overloading the system. As slugs are a periodical phenomenon, the slug catcher should be emptied before the next slug arrives Slug catchers can be used continuously or on-demand. A slug catcher permanently connected to the pipeline will buffer all production, including the slugs, before it is sent to the gas and liquid handling facilities. This is used for difficult to predict slugging behaviour found in terrain slugging, hydrodynamic slugging or riser- based slugging. Alternatively, the slug catcher can be bypassed in normal operation and be brought online when a slug is expected, usually during pigging operations. An advantage of this set-up is that inspection and maintenance on the slug catcher can be done without interrupting the normal operation.  Slug catcher design  Finger type slug catcher at theQadirpur Gas Field Slug catchers are designed in different forms, * A vessel type slug catcher is essentially a conventional vessel. This type is simple in design and maintenance. * A finger type slug catcher consists of several long pieces of pipe ('fingers'), which together form the buffer volume. The advantage of this type of slug catcher is that pipe segments are simpler to design for high pressures, which are often encountered in pipeline systems, than a large vessel. A disadvantage is that its footprint can become excessively large. An example of a large finger-type slugcatcher can be seen in Den Helder, The Netherlands, using Google Maps. The incoming pipeline containing gas and liquid is routed to the inlet of the slug catcher. The inlet comprises a large diameter manifold and splitter section where the gas/liquid is divided into 2, 4, 6 or 8 horizontal pipes of 24, 30, 36, 42 or 48-inch diameter. Gas/liquid separation takes place in these pipes with the liquid dropping to the bottom of the pipes with the gas above. Liquid-free gas is drawn off at the far end of the separation pipes by risers at the top of the pipes. The risers are manifolded together and the gas is routed to further treatment. From the base of the separation pipes liquids flow through down-comers into a further, lower array of horizontal pipes. These pipes slope down away from the inlet, they can typically be 100 to 250 metres in length. The initial section of the lower pipes provides for further gas/liquid separation and the far end provides a buffer storage volume for the liquids which are drawn off at a steady rate for further treatment. The operating pressure in the slug catcher is maintained by a pressure controller and pressure control valve in the gas outlet. The liquid level in the storage end of the slugcatcher is controlled by a liquid level controller and level control valve in the liquid outlet. * A Parking Loop slug catcher combines features of the vessel and finger types. The Gas/Liquid Separation occurs in the Vessel, while the Liquid is stored in the parking loop shaped fingers. A basic slug catcher design contains the buffer volume for gas and liquid. A control system is used for controlled outflow of gas and liquid to the downstream processing facilities. The inlet section is designed to promote the separation of gas and liquids.

His most recent poetry has appeared in Blink and Light.  Life  William Harmon was born in Concord, North Carolina, a small cotton-mill town northeast of Charlotte. In 1954, at the age of sixteen, he entered the University of Chicago. He graduated in 1958. He was an officer on active duty with the United States Navy between 1960 and 1967, the last year of which was in Vietnam. As an adviser to the South Vietnamese Navy, he wrote its Standard Ship's Organization Manual. He continued as a Reserve officer until 1980, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. After returning to the United States, he pursued post-graduate work (focused predominantly on trans-Atlantic modernist poetry) at the University of Chicago, where he earned his master's degree in 1968; the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he earned an additional master's the same year; and the University of Cincinnati, where he earned his doctorate in 1970. His dissertation on Ezra Pound was published by the University of North Carolina Press in 1977. In 1970 he was hired by UNC Chapel Hill, where he remained on the faculty until 2008, when he retired. His first book of poetry, Treasury Holiday, was published in 1970 by Wesleyan University Press and became the Lamont Poetry Selection of the year. His most recent collection of poetry, Mutatis Mutandis: 27 Invoices, won the Poetry Society of America's William Carlos Williams Award in 1985.

For over five hundred years it was home to the Morgan family, later Lords Tredegar; one of the most powerful and influential families in the area. Described as \\"The grandest and most exuberant country house\\" in Monmouthshire and one of the \\"outstanding houses of the Restoration period in the whole of Britain\\", the mansion stands in a reduced landscaped garden of (0.14 of a square mile) forming the non-residential part of Tredegar Park. The property became a Grade I listed building on 3 March 1952http://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-2902-tredegar-house-coedkernew and has been under the care of the National Trust since March 2012.  History  The earliest surviving part of the building dates back to the late 15th century. The house was originally built of stone and had sufficient status to host Charles I. Between 1664 and 1672, however, William Morgan decided to rebuild the house on a larger scale from red brick, at that time a rare building material in Wales. The architect of the enlarged house is not known for certain, but Newman follows Howard Colvin's suggestion that the design was by Roger and William Hurlbutt, who had worked in a similar style at Ragley Hall and Warwick Castle. The architectural historian Peter Smith, writing in his work Houses of the Welsh Countryside, called Tredegar, \\"the most splendid brick house of the seventeenth century in Wales\\". In his 1882 publication, local historian Octavius Morgan provides a plan of an intricate garden maze which was in place prior to the 1660s improvements and which probably dated from the time of Queen Elizabeth I.Morgan, Octavius (1882), \\"Goldcliff and the Ancient Roman Inscribed Stone Found There 1878\\", Monmouthshire & Caerleon Antiquarian Association  The Tredegar Morgans 1402‚Äì1951  Tredegar's name came from Tredegar Fawr, the name of the mansion or seat of the old Morgans, who were descended from Cadifor the Great the son of Collwyn; and the owners of the land upon which Tredegar stands. The earliest record of someone with the name Morgan living at Tredegar is 1402: a Llewellyn Ap Morgan. Tredegar House, set in 90 acres which remains landscaped for ornamental purposes, with less agriculture than in previous centuries, is the finest Restoration house in Wales and for over five hundred years the estate (including Ruperra Castle) was home to the Morgan family, later Lords Tredegar; one of the most powerful and influential families in the area. John Morgan was created a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre (possibly c.1448). Later, when Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII it was of great benefit to the Morgans of Tredegar who were great supporters of Henry. Sir John received reward for his early support, and on 7 November 1485 he was appointed by the new king to the office of ‚ÄòSheriff of Wentloog and Newport‚Äô and made ‚ÄòSteward‚Äô of the Machen Commote. His elevation to officer of the Tudor crown placed Sir John Morgan's influence and power at a new height. Around 1490, he commissioned the building of a new house at Tredegar. A wing of Sir John's stone manor house still exists. It is now the oldest part of the present day Tredegar House. A cadet branch of the ‚ÄòTredegar Morgans‚Äô, probably nephews of Sir Thomas Morgan, included three brothers, Thomas, Robert and Edward. Thomas became Major-General Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet (1604‚Äì79), served in the Commonwealth forces during the English Civil War 1642-9, was made Governor of Gloucester in 1645, fought in Flanders, was wounded and in 1661 retired to his estate at Kinnersley, Herefordshire. Recalled in 1665 to become Governor of Jersey, he died at St Helier in April 1679. Married on 10 September 1632, he had nine sons, of whom the eldest, Sir John Morgan followed in his father's profession. Robert Morgan, (born circa 1615) became a farmer in Llanrumney, (Cardiff), not to be confused with Rhymney about 3 miles, from Tredegar, and was father of Henry Morgan (born in Llanrumney Hall, Cardiff, who would have a successful career in the Caribbean as a privateer, and pirate). Edward Morgan became Colonel Edward Morgan (born circa 1616 ‚Äì Colonel after 1665), a Royalist during English Civil War 1642‚Äì49 and Captain General of the Kings forces in South Wales. After the King's arrest and execution, he fled to the continent and married Anna Petronilla the daughter of Baron von P√∂llnitz from Westphalia (Governor of Lippstadt, east of Dortmund in Germany). They had six children, two sons and four daughters (including Anna Petronilla and Johanna). He was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica 1664‚Äì65. During the civil war after the Battle of Naseby, King Charles I visited Tredegar House in 1645. In 1661 William Morgan (d.1680) rebuilt the house on a very grand scale, with the help of the huge dowry of his wife, Blanche Morgan. Their fortunes continued to flourish down the generations, tremendously enhanced by the foresight and business enterprises of Sir Charles Gould throughout the 18th century. Following his father's financial successes, his son further expanded several commercial and industrial projects, and virtually established Newport as an important trade centre. Whilst consolidating their influence on the political and economic issues of the country, they secured a barontetcy in 1792, and a Barony in 1859. In 1854, Godfrey Morgan fought in, and survived, the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava. Godfrey was 22 and Captain in the 17th Lancers. His steed, Sir Briggs, also survived and lived at Tredegar House until the horse's death at the age of 28. The horse was buried with full military honours in the Cedar Garden at Tredegar House. The monument still stands there today. In 1905 Godfrey was created the first Viscount Tredegar. He never married and on his death the estate passed to his nephew Courtenay Morgan. In 1920, the Tredegar Park Polo Club was founded at Tredegar House.Horace A. Laffaye, Polo in Britain: A History, Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2012, p. 13 Later, extravagance, eccentricities, and weighty death duties seriously depleted the family's financial assets throughout the next three generations. John Morgan, 6th Baron Tredegar died childless in 1962 aged 54. His death signalled the end of the Morgans of Tredegar. In 1951, Tredegar House was stripped, the remaining contents were auctioned, and the estate was sold. Ownership Eastern entrance For over five hundred years it was home to one of the greatest of Welsh families, the Morgans (the same family as Captain Morgan) ‚Äì later the Lords Tredegar ‚Äì until they left in 1951. After 1951 the house was bought by the Catholic Church as a convent school with boarders, later St. Joseph's Roman Catholic School. It was bought by the Newport Corporation Council in 1974, giving rise to its then status as \\"the grandest council house in Britain\\". In December 2011 the National Trust signed an agreement with Newport City Council to take on the management of the building, as well as the 90 acres of gardens and parkland, on a 50-year lease from 2012. The Trust said that Tredegar House was of \\"great importance\\" as many similar properties had been lost in the past 100 years.\\"National Trust to take Tredegar to ‚Äònew stage in its long history\\" by Daniel Fisher at www.walesonline.co.uk The National Trust provide free-flow access to the house, but have closed parts of the upstairs to the public. Origin of the name The Welsh name of the house is nowadays \\"T≈∑ Tredegar\\", but this is somewhat unauthentic and is obviously a translation of \\"Tredegar House\\". The name is merely \\"Tredegar\\" historically, or to cite an earlier form (1550) \\"Tredegyr\\" (the form Tredegar shows the influence of the local Gwentian dialect of Welsh). A form more in keeping with Welsh naming practice, instead of t≈∑, would be Plas Tredegar or Plas Tredegyr but it does not seem that this was ever in use either. T≈∑ Tredegar, Plas Tredegar or Plas Tredegyr? Steffan Ellis. 29-11-2011./ Tredegyr is \\"farmstead of Tegyr\\" (tre, a form of tref = farmstead) + soft mutation (t > d) + Tegyr. A Brythonic form *Tecorix (fair king) might be supposed, as such a form would have resulted in Welsh \\"Tegyr\\" following normal processes in the development of Welsh from Brythonic. There is a similar name in Denbighshire ‚Äì Botegyr, meaning \\"Tegyr‚Äôs dwelling\\", < Bod Degyr < (bod = dwelling) + (soft mutation t > d) + (Tegyr). Some Place Names in South Wales. Monmouthshire. Deric John. Filming and Events The House has been used as a filming location on several occasions. In 2014 an episode of the Antiques Roadshow was filmed at the property and house's iconic red brick exterior now features in the programme's opening sequence. The television series Being Human, Da Vinci's Demons and The Hairy Bikers have all used the house as a location. Since the programme was revived in 2005, many episodes of Doctor Who have used Tredegar House for location filming, including the 2008 Christmas special \\"The Next Doctor\\" and the 2009/2010 Christmas/New Year special \\"The End of Time\\". The House plays host to many events throughout the year, including a Cadbury's Easter Egg Hunt, Pirate's Day, August Bank Holiday 1930s Garden Party, Halloween and Christmas, which is themed around Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol. There are also daily talks, activities and special tours for visitors. An annual Folk Festival is held in May The House is approved for marriages and civil ceremonies and the Morgan Room may be hired for private functions. For many years an annual vintage car rally was held in the grounds in order to raise funds for Leukaemia Research. The first rally was held in October 1980 and raised ¬£635. The 34th and final rally was held in September 2014 and raised ¬£80,000, bringing the total amount raised since 1980 to ¬£868,000.https://leukaemialymphomaresearch.org.uk/event/local-events/34th-and- final-vintage-and-specialist-rally-2014 Notes See also * Ruperra Castle * Evan Morgan, 2nd Viscount Tredegar * Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar * Tredegar Square, London E3 * Sir Charles Gould Morgan, 2nd Baron Tredegar References External links *Official site *Tredegar House ‚Äì City of Newport site *Friends of Tredegar House *Tredegar House Vintage Car Rally *BBC Wales panoramic view of Tredegar House ?? *Doctor Who at Tredegar House *Tredegar House Folk Festival * *Video: Katie Derham visits Tredegar House, for BBC Radio Three Category:Music venues in Newport, Wales Category:Newport, Wales Category:Culture in Newport, Wales Category:Grade I listed buildings in Newport, Wales Category:History of Newport, Wales Category:Houses in Newport, Wales Category:Landmarks in Newport, Wales Category:Museums in Newport, Wales Category:Country houses in Wales Category:Historic house museums in Wales Category:Grade I listed houses Category:1672 establishments in Wales ","title":"Tredegar House"},{"id":"1924162","text":"Princess Deokhye of Korea (25 May 191221 April 1989) was the last princess of the Korean Empire. She was born on 25 May 1912 at Changdeok Palace in Seoul. She was the youngest daughter of Emperor Gojong and his concubine, then known as Yang Gui-in. Then, Emperor Gojong bestowed a royal title, Boknyeong,http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/archive/program/program_trendkorea.htm?no=10025082 to Yang when she gave birth to Princess Deokhye. Princess Deokhye was not formally recognized as a princess by Japan until 1917, because she was not a daughter of the queen. In 1917, her name was formally entered into the Imperial Family's registry. Her father, Emperor Gojong, loved her greatly and established the Deoksu Palace (ÎçïÏàòÍ∂Å) Kindergarten for her in Junmyungdang (Ï§ÄÎ™ÖÎãπ), Hamnyeong hall. Girls her age from noble families attended the kindergarten. Princess Deokhye is called Deokhye Ongju in Korea, not Gongju. Gongju refers to the daughters of the queen, and Ongju refers to the daughters of concubines. Birth and early life She was born without a name but was given the name of Princess Seunghee on 25 May 1912, a daughter of Yang Gwi-in (later Lady Boknyeong) and Emperor Gojong when he was 60 years old. Upon having no given name, she was ignored and was treated like she did not exist. She was then nicknamed \\"BoknyeongDang\\". In 1917, Emperor Gojong persuaded Terauchi Masatake, the then-ruling Governor General of Korea to enter her name into the registry of the imperial family, offering her legitimacy and granting her the title of princess. In 1919, Emperor Gojong planned the secret engagement between Princess Deokhye and Kim Jang-han, a nephew of Kim Hwangjin, a court chamberlain. Emperor Gojong had sought to protect his daughter from Japan through this engagement, but the engagement failed due to Japan's intervention. After the failed engagement, Kim Hwangjin was not permitted to enter Deoksu Palace and Emperor Gojong died suddenly on 21 January 1919. In 1921, Princess Deokhye went to Hinodae elementary school in Seoul. Life in Japan and arranged marriage Takeyuki S≈ç and Deokhye (1931) In 1925, she was taken to Japan under the pretense of continuing her studies. Like her brothers, she attended the Gakushuin. She was described as silent, isolated and weak. Upon the news of her mother's death in 1929, she was finally given permission to visit Korea temporarily to attend her mother's funeral in 1930. However, she was not allowed to wear the proper clothing. In the Spring of 1930, upon the onset of psychological condition (manifested by sleepwalking), she moved to King Lee's Palace, her brother Crown Prince Eun's house in Tokyo. During this period, she often forgot to eat and drink. Her physician diagnosed her illness as precocious dementia, but by the following year, her condition seemed to have improved. This may be attributed to her upbringing. In May 1931, after \\"matchmaking\\" by Empress Teimei, the consort of Emperor Taish≈ç of Japan, she married Count S≈ç Takeyuki (Ê≠¶Âøó; 1908-1985), a Japanese aristocrat. The marriage had in fact been decided in 1930; her brother had protested it, and it had been postponed because of her condition, but when she recovered, she was immediately given instructions that the marriage was to take place. She gave birth to a daughter, Masae (), or Jeonghye () in Korea, on 14 August 1932. In 1933, Deokhye was again afflicted with mental illness, and after this, she spent many years in various mental health clinics. With the defeat of Japan in World War II, Korea once again became independent and her husband lost his nobility title, as the peerage was abolished. The arranged marriage no longer made sense, and they became increasingly detached from one another, until they finally divorced in 1953. Takeyuki So is known to have remarried in 1955 to Japanese Yoshie Katsumura. Having suffered an unhappy marriage, Deokhye's grief was compounded by the loss of her only daughter who disappeared in 1956, reportedly committing suicide due to the stress of her parents' divorce. As a result, Deokhye's condition deteriorated at a slow yet considerable pace. Return to Korea She returned to Korea at the invitation of the South Korean government on 26 January 1962, after 37 years. At first, the Korean government refused to allow the return of the last royal bloodline, because president Lee Seung Man wanted to avoid political chaos. However, reporter Kim Eul Han found the princess and persuaded the Korean government to allow her return. She cried while approaching her motherland, and despite her mental state, accurately remembered the court manners. She lived in Nakseon Hall, Changdeok Palace, with Crown Prince and Princess Eun, their son Prince Gu, his wife Julia Mullock, and Mrs Byeon Bokdong, her lady-in-waiting. She died on 21 April 1989 at Sugang Hall, Changdeok Palace, and was buried at Hongryureung in Namyangju, near Seoul.

Sir Gaston Maspero, K.C.M.G.', Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, July 1917, pp. 629‚Äì631. (23 June 1846 ‚Äì 30 June 1916) was a French Egyptologist known for popularizing the term \\"Sea Peoples\\" in an 1881 paper. Maspero's son, Henri Maspero, became a notable sinologist and scholar of East Asia. Life Gaston Maspero was born in Paris in 1846 to parents of Italian origin. While at school he showed a special taste for history, and by the age of fourteen he was already interested in hieroglyphic writing. It was not until his second year at the √âcole normale in 1867 that Maspero met fellow Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, who was in Paris as commissioner for the Egyptian section of the Exposition universelle. Mariette gave him two newly discovered hieroglyphic texts of considerable difficulty to study, and the young self-taught scholar produced translations of them in less than a fortnight, a great feat in those days when Egyptology was still almost in its infancy. The publication of these texts in the same year established his academic reputation. A short time was spent in assisting a gentleman in Peru who was seeking to prove an Aryan affinity for the dialects spoken by the Quechua of that country to publish his research, but in 1868 Maspero was back in France at more profitable work. In 1869 he became a teacher (r√©p√©titeur) of Egyptian language and archeology at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, and in 1874 he was appointed to the chair of Champollion at the Coll√®ge de France, succeeding Emmanuel de Roug√©.: \\"Le travail fourni par ce groupe fut tres considerable des le debut, et devint plus considerable encore lorsque M. Maspero eut succede a E. de Rouge dans la chaire de Champollion, comme charge de cours (1873), et presque aussitot apres comme professeur titulaire (1874).\\" Maspero, 1883 In November 1880 Professor Maspero went to Egypt as head of an archeological mission sent there by the French government, which ultimately developed into the well-equipped Institut fran√ßais d'arch√©ologie orientale. This occurred a few months before the death of Mariette, whom Maspero then succeeded as director-general of excavations and of the antiquities of Egypt. Aware that his reputation was then more as a linguist than an archaeologist, Maspero's first work in the post was to build on Mariette's achievements at Saqqara. He expanded their scope from the early Old Kingdom to the later, with particular interest in tombs with long and complete hieroglyphic inscriptions that could help illustrate the development of the Egyptian language. Selecting five later Old Kingdom tombs, he was successful in that aim, finding over 4,000 lines of hieroglyphics which were then sketched and photographed. As an aspect of his attempt to curtail the rampant illegal export of Egyptian antiquities by tourists, collectors and agents for the major European and American museums, Maspero arrested the Abd al-Russul brothers from the notorious treasure-hunting village of Gorna, who confessed under torture to having found the great cache of royal mummies at Deir el-Bahri in July 1881. The cache was moved to Cairo as soon as possible to keep it safe from robbers. In 1886, he resumed work begun by Mariette to uncover the Sphinx, removing more than of sand and seeking tombs below it. He also introduced admission charges for Egyptian sites to the increasing number of tourists to pay for their upkeep and maintenance. In spite of the brutality towards the Abd al-Russul brothers, Maspero was popular with museum keepers and collectors because he was known to be a \\"pragmatic\\" director of the Service of Antiquities, one who would allow them to remove from the country what he did not want for the Bulak Museum in Cairo. Maspero did not attempt to halt all collecting, but rather sought to control what went out of the country and to gain the confidence of those who were regular collectors. When Maspero left his position in 1886 and was replaced by a series of other directors who attempted to halt the trade in antiquities, his absence was much lamented. Maspero resumed his professorial duties in Paris from June 1886 until 1899, when, at 53, he returned to Egypt in his old capacity as director-general of the department of antiquities. On October 3 that year an earthquake at Karnak collapsed 11 columns and left the main hall in ruins. Maspero had already made some repairs and clearances there (continued in his absence by unofficial but authorized explorers of many nationalities) in his previous tenure of office, and now he set up a team of workmen under French Egyptologists and regularly visited to oversee its reconstruction work, opposing some Romantics who wished the ruins left as they were. In 1903 an alabaster pavement was found in the court of the 7th Pylon, and beneath it a shaft leading to a large hoard of almost 17,000 statues, with every part of the dig drawn, recorded and photographed. On his arrival in 1899 he found the collections in the Bulak Museum enormously increased, and while working to expand them further he superintended their removal from Gizeh to the new quarters at Qasr El Nil in 1902. The vast catalogue of the collections made rapid progress under Maspero's direction. Twenty-four volumes or sections were already published in 1909. This work and the increasing workload of the Antiquities Service led to an expansion of staff at the museum, including the 17-year-old Howard Carter. It was Maspero who recommended Carter to George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon in 1907, when the Earl approached him to seek advice for the use of an expert to head his planned archaeological expedition to the Valley of the Kings. He also set up a network of local museums throughout Egypt, including a new larger Cairo facility, to encourage the Egyptians to take greater responsibility for the maintenance of their own heritage by increasing public awareness of it. In 1912 he also succeeded where his predecessors had failed in the introduction of a series of anti-looting laws, before retiring in 1914. Maspero died on 30 June 1916 and was interred in the Cimeti√®re du Montparnasse in Paris. Works Among his best-known publications are the large Histoire ancienne des peuples de l'Orient classique (3 vols., Paris, 1895‚Äì1897, translated into English by Mrs McClure for the S.P.C.K.), displaying the history of the whole of the nearer East from the beginnings to the conquest by Alexander; a smaller Histoire des peuples de l'Orient, 1 vol., of the same scope, which passed through six editions from 1875 to 1904; Etudes de mythologie et d'arch√©ologie √©gyptiennes (Paris, 1893, etc.), a collection of reviews and essays originally published in various journals, and especially important as contributions to the study of Ancient Egyptian religion; L'Arch√©ologie √©gyptienne (1907), of which several editions have been published in English. He also established the journal Recueil de travaux relatifs √† la philologie et √† l'arch√©ologie √©gyptiennes et assyriennes; the Biblioth√®que √©gyptologique, in which the scattered essays of the French Egyptologists are collected, with biographies, etc.; and the Annales du service des antiquit√©s de l'Egypte, a repository for reports on official excavations, etc. Maspero also wrote: Les inscriptions des pyramides de Saqqarah (Paris, 1894); Les momies royales de Deir el-Bahari (Paris, 1889); Les contes populaires de l'Egypte ancienne (3rd ed., Paris, 1906); and Causeries d'Egypte (1907), translated by Elizabeth Lee as New Light on Ancient Egypt (1908). Gaston Maspero was also the one to find Amenemhat's pyramid, located at Lisht. The pyramid was already eroded at the time of his discovery. Some public domain e-books by Maspero: * Art in Egypt (1912) * The Dawn of Civilization: Egypt and Chald√¶a (1894) * Egyptian arch√¶ology 1892 * Guide to the Cairo Museum (1905) * Life in Ancient Egypt and Assyria (1892) * The Passing of the Empires: 850 B.C. to 330 B.C. (1900) * Popular Stories of Ancient Egypt (1915) * The Struggle of the Nations: Egypt, Syria and Assyria (1897)  Legacy The radio and TV building in Cairo, Egypt was named after Maspero in honor of his contributions to the study and preservation of ancient Egyptian monuments.

It is typically based on a seasoned dough usually made from peeled black gram flour (urad flour), either fried or cooked with dry heat (usually flipping it over an open flame). Flours made from other sources such as lentils, chickpeas, rice, tapioca, certain millets or potato can be used. Papadums are typically served as an accompaniment to a meal in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka or as an appetizer or snack, sometimes with toppings such as chopped onions, chopped carrots, chutneys or other dips, and condiments. In Pakistan, these are made of rice and often used as a snack or meal accompaniment. In certain parts of India, papadums which have been dried, but not cooked, are used in curries and vegetable dishes. Papadums have been a part of the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent for generations and are an intrinsic part of everyday meals. Papadums are called appalam in Tamil Nadu, pappadam in Kerala, appadam in Andhra/Telangana, happala in Karnataka, papad in Punjab and Gujarat, and pampada in Odisha . They are mainly made in Punjab, Rajasthan in the north, Maharastra, and Gujarat in the west. In the south, Kerala, Madurai district in Tamil Nadu, Kanchipuram, and Chennai are major manufacturers. Etymology Papadum is derived from the Sanskrit word parpa·π≠a (‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§ü), meaning a flattened disc. Regional variations alt= alt= Papadum recipes vary from region to region and from family to family. They are typically made from flour or paste derived from either lentils, chickpeas, black gram, rice, or potato. Salt and peanut oil are added to make a dough, which can be flavored with seasonings such as chili, cumin, garlic, or black pepper. Sometimes, baking soda or slaked lime is also added. The dough is shaped into a thin, round flatbread and then dried (traditionally in the sun), and can be cooked by deep frying, roasting over an open flame, toasting, or microwaving, depending on the desired texture. Bikaner is the hub of chickpea and green gram papadam manufacturing. Potato papadam is made in Varanasi. Most sweet- and snack-selling national companies are also involved in this business. In the north, papads made in the city of Amritsar and its surrounds (Amritsari Papar Warian) are especially famous. The Lijjat Papad company (Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad), headquartered in Mumbai, is a major manufacturer, and is often cited as an exemplar of the women's empowerment movement in India, as it is run entirely by women. In most Indian restaurants around the world, they are served as an appetizer with dips, which often include mango chutney, lime pickle, onion chutney, and raita. Masala Papad with sev, onion, tomato, coriander leaves toppings, is one of the best selling appetizers in India. Ingredients and preparation Papadum can be prepared from different ingredients and methods. Arguably, the most popular recipe uses flour ground from hulled split black gram mixed with black pepper, salt, and a small amount of vegetable oil and a food-grade alkali, and the mixture is kneaded. A well-kneaded dough is then flattened into very thin rounds and then dried and stored for later preparation and consumption. It may also contain rice, Jackfruit, Sabudana, etc., as main ingredients. Cracked black pepper, red chili powder, Asafoetida, or cumin or sesame seeds are often used as flavoring agents. Papad or Happala is also made from Rice flakes, Ragi and Horsegram also. Business Papadum is often associated with the empowerment of women in India. Many individual and organized businesses run by women produce papad, pickles, and other snacks. This provides them regular income from minimal financial investments. Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad is an organization (owned and run solely by women) which produces large quantities of papadums on the open market, which started as a small business in the late 1950s, with an annual income in 2005 of about . However, with the recent growth of modern trade in India and the growing consumer awareness, other brands have been gaining in popularity within this category. Spelling and pronunciation Some divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the Hindi/Urdu word pƒÅpa·πõ. The sound is the retroflex flap , which is written in Hindi with the Devanagari letter ‡§°‡§º, and in Urdu script with the Perso-Arabic letter ⁄ë. Although in IAST the Hindi letter ‡§°‡§º is transliterated as <·πõ>, popular or nonstandard transliterations of Hindi use for this sound, because etymologically it derives from ‡§° . The occurrence of this consonant in the word pƒÅpa·πõ has given rise to two alternative spellings in English: papad, which reflects its etymology, and papar (anglicized as \\"popper\\"), which reflects its phonology.

Rampage is a 1987 American crime drama film written, produced and directed by William Friedkin. The film stars Michael Biehn, Alex McArthur, and Nicholas Campbell. In retrospect William Friedkin said: \\"There are a lot of people who love Rampage, but I don‚Äôt think I hit my own mark with that\\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/05/william-friedkin-interview.html Plot Charles Reece is a serial killer who commits a number of brutal mutilation- slayings in order to drink blood as a result of paranoid delusions. Reece is soon captured. Most of the film revolves around the trial and the prosecutor's attempts to have Reece found sane and given the death penalty. Defense lawyers, meanwhile, argue that the defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity. The prosecutor, Anthony Fraser, was previously against capital punishment, but he seeks such a penalty in the face of Reece's brutal crimes after meeting one victim's grieving family. In the end, Reece is found sane and given the death penalty, but Fraser's internal debate about capital punishment is rendered academic when Reece is found to be insane by a scanning of his brain for mental illness. In the ending of the original version of the film, Reece is found dead in his cell, having overdosed himself on antipsychotics he had been stockpiling. In the ending of the revised version, Reece is sent to a state mental hospital, and in a chilling coda, he sends a letter to a person whose wife and child he has killed, asking the man to come and visit him. A final title card reveals that Reece is scheduled for a parole hearing in six months.

Additionally, Reece escapes at one point‚Äîwhich Chase did not do‚Äîmurdering two guards and later a priest. However, Reece and Chase similarly had a history of mental illness and an obsession with drinking blood. Unlike Reece, Chase was sentenced to death, but he was found dead in his prison cell, an apparent suicide, before the sentence could be carried out.https://web.archive.org/web/20090228111245/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/chase/demise_8.htmlFriedkin p 396-401 Soundtrack The film's score was composed, orchestrated, arranged and conducted by Ennio Morricone and was released on vinyl LP, cassette and compact disc by Virgin Records. Release Rampage was filmed in 1986 in Stockton, California. It played at the Boston Film Festival in September 1987, and ran theatrically in some European countries in the late 1980s. Plans for the film's theatrical release in America were shelved when production studio DEG, the distributor of Rampage, went bankrupt. The film was unreleased in North America for five years. During that time, director Friedkin reedited the film, and changed the ending (with Reece no longer committing suicide in jail) before its US release in October 1992.Friedkin p 400-401 The European video versions usually feature the film's original ending. In retrospect, William Friedkin said: \\"At the time we made Rampage, [producer] Dino De Laurentiis was running out of money. He finally went bankrupt, after a long career as a producer. He was doing just scores of films and was unable to give any of them his real support and effort. And so literally by the time it came to release Rampage, he didn‚Äôt have the money to do it. And he was not only the financier, but the distributor. His company went bankrupt, and the film went to black for about five years. Eventually, the Weinsteins‚Äô company Miramax took it out of bankruptcy and rereleased it. But this was among the lowest points in my career.\\"https://www.vulture.com/2013/05/william-friedkin-interview.html Reception In his review, film critic Roger Ebert gave Rampage three stars out of four saying, \\"This is not a movie about murder so much as a movie about insanity‚Äîas it applies to murder in modern American criminal courts...Friedkin['s] message is clear: Those who commit heinous crimes should pay for them, sane or insane. You kill somebody, you fry‚Äîunless the verdict is murky or there were extenuating circumstances.\\" Home media As of 2010, the film has been released on DVD only in Poland, by SPI International.

At her birth in 1915 her mother was still married to the British pharmaceuticals magnate Henry Wellcome, whom she divorced before remarrying to Somerset Maugham in 1917. In his 1962 memoir Looking Back, Somerset Maugham, a homosexual, denied paternity of Liza. Around the same time, he attempted to have her disinherited in order to adopt his male secretary, suggesting that she was actually the child of Syrie by either Henry Wellcome, Gordon Selfridge or an unknown lover. The subsequent 21-month court case, fought in British and French courts, determined that Maugham was her biological father, and the author was legally barred from his adoption plans. Maugham's daughter was awarded approximately $1,400,000 in damages, comprising $280,000 in a cash settlement to compensate her for paintings originally willed to her, along with royalties to some of his books, and the controlling interest in his French villa.Somerset Maugham is Liza's father, TIME.com; accessed 21 February 2016.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 2, 1997. It was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Pete Michels. In the episode, Homer purchases a gun to protect his family, of which Marge disapproves. Homer begins to show extremely careless gun usage causing Marge to leave him when she catches Bart using the gun without their permission. The episode was intended to show guns in a neutral way, and faced some problems with the censors because of the subject matter. Critical reaction was mostly positive. Plot A riot breaks out in Springfield after a boring soccer match between Mexico and Portugal. Fearing for her family's safety, Marge tells Homer to buy a Home Security System, but after learning it would cost $500, he buys a handgun instead. After a five-day waiting period per the Brady Act, Homer shows his firearm to Marge, who is horrified and demands he get rid of it. Homer brings her to a local National Rifle Association meeting hoping to change her mind, but she remains unconvinced. After a near accident at the dinner table, Marge again begs Homer to get rid of the gun. He promises to, but later, Bart and Milhouse find it in the refrigerator's vegetable crisper. Marge discovers this and berates Homer, then leaves with the children and checks into a motel. That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house, but the other members kick him out of the association after seeing how recklessly he uses his pistol. Realizing what his behavior has cost him, Homer goes to the motel and tells Marge he got rid of the gun. While leaving, Snake arrives to rob the desk clerk. Homer pulls out his gun and Marge is angry he lied again, but as he tries to apologize, Snake snatches the gun. The other NRA members arrive and foil Snake, who escapes. Homer then says he does not trust himself and asks Marge to throw the gun away herself. However, Marge sees a reflection of herself holding it in the trash can and decides to keep it. Production John Swartzwelder wrote this episode. This was the first episode to air which was executive produced by Mike Scully. Sam Simon pitched an episode for one of the first seasons which saw Homer getting a gun and nobody wanting him to have it. The episode concluded with Homer foiling a robbery and stating that although guns bring destruction, it worked for him. However, this episode was pitched by Scully for either season seven or eight, before being used for season nine. This provided the basic outline, and John Swartzwelder wrote the script. A lot of lines in the episode put guns in a positive light, as the staff felt that they could not just make an episode about how bad they were. Several of the staff, including Swartzwelder, are \\"pro gun\\", although others, such as Matt Groening, are completely against them. The episode was designed to be non-biased and to portray each side of the argument equally. Scully noted that if there is any message in the episode it is that a man like Homer should not own a gun. The censors were nervous about some of the episode's subject matter, such as Homer pointing the gun in Marge's face, and Bart aiming the gun at Milhouse with the apple in his mouth, but ultimately let it go. The opening sequence where soccer is portrayed as the most boring sport imaginable was intended to show that soccer was more boring on television than live, but both Michels and Groening enjoy the game. The referee at the game is a caricature of the janitor at Film Roman, who supplied director Pete Michels with every piece of soccer information he needed to design the episode. Pel√© also makes an appearance at the match, although he is voiced by Hank Azaria. The episode closes with music from The Avengers. After the music had been recorded, Scully felt that it did not suit the ending and so wished to change it to something else. However, it was too late in production to get the full orchestra back to do a recording, and union rules meant that previous recordings could not be reused. Cultural references The chalkboard gag references the Richard Gere gerbil urban legend. The gun shop is based on the shop that the Los Angeles Police Department went to during the North Hollywood bank robbery to acquire more ammunition. The title of this episode is a play on the name of 1970s television series The Partridge Family. The end music is the theme to the 1960s British tv series The Avengers, and the song playing when Homer is sitting and watching things go by while he is waiting five days for his gun is \\"The Waiting\\" by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Petty rarely let his music be used on television, but, being a fan of The Simpsons, he allowed them to use it. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"The Cartridge Family\\" finished 26th in ratings for the week of October 27 ‚Äì November 2, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 10.5, equivalent to approximately 10.3 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network, following The X-Files and King of the Hill. The episode received several positive reviews, being included in the Herald Sun's list of the top twenty The Simpsons episodes.\\"The Simpsons Top 20\\". Herald Sun. 21 April 2007. pg. w09. It was also named the fifth best episode in the show's history in an article by The Florida Times-Union.Nancy McAlister. \\"A sassy 'Simpsons' celebration; Fox hits a Homer as it broadcasts the 300th episode of the animated sitcom tonight\\". The Florida Times Union. 16 February 2003. pg. D1. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also praised the episode, calling The Simpsons \\"the only sitcom in memory to treat gun control with any fairness\\".Jonah Goldberg. \\"The Simpsons: Bedrock American Values\\". Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 14 May 2000. pg. E1. On the other hand, the episode has been criticized by several outlets. Although the fictionalized NRA stresses the importance of responsible gun ownership, the staff nonetheless received several complaints from the real National Rifle Association about the portrayal of the organization in the episode. Ian Jones and Steve Williams criticized the episode, calling it \\"a messy, unfocused lampooning of gun culture\\". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, found that it was \\"one of the most politically unambiguous episodes ever\\", but that \\"[it] is very dull and the plot isn't sustainable\\". Anna Leszkiewicz in the New Statesman later pinpointed it as the moment Marge should have left Homer, saying \\"Homer has proved himself to be a violent, unstable, controlling, reckless husband\\".https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2017/10/marge-should- have-left-homer-simpsons The episode was not initially aired on the United Kingdom satellite channel Sky1 due to scenes of flagrant gun misuse, yet was aired several times on BBC Two in an earlier evening timeslot. The episode has since been aired in daytime slots on all channels, albeit with partial editing. The episode was also included on the Too Hot for TV VHS and DVD, along with \\"Treehouse of Horror IX\\", \\"Natural Born Kissers\\", and \\"Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\\".

He was credited with the design of the first British 4-6-0, which was strongly influenced by the Scottish locomotive design for Indian Railways. The 4-6-0 wheel arrangement that appeared in 1894, quickly became the most common locomotive for main line passenger and mixed traffic work in Britain. Although Jones was a fervent disciple of Alexander Allan, Jones' new designs tended to break away from the Allan tradition, which had lasted so long in Scotland. One Allan feature that Jones did not perpetuate in his 4-6-0s was double framing around the outside cylinders. Allan's straight- link valve gear was, however, retained; this was basically similar to the corresponding Stephenson gear, but the link was easier and therefore cheaper to make and imparted a constant lead irrespective of cut-off. The \\"Drummond\\" Castle class was, mechanically, Jones‚Äô personal design, although the Drummond stamp of chimney, cab and 'water-cart' bogie tender was unmistakable. A dubious asset, without which none of the younger Drummond's locomotives was complete, was the provision of steam reverse, a troublesome mechanism if it were not well maintained. With the introduction of the 4-6-0, Highland Railway had thus obviated the 0-6-0 type employed by practically every other British railway, except its most intense competitor, the Great North of Scotland Railway. A 0-6-0, however, would have meant a crank axle, and crank axles did not have a place in Jones' designs. Jones‚Äô new designs also tended to break away from the Allan tradition, although he continued to use the Allan link valve gear. Jones locomotive designs *F class 4-4-0 of 1874‚Äì1888 *Two 2-4-0 locomotives built at Inverness in 1877. These had 6' 3\\" driving wheels, 16\\" by 22\\" outside cylinders and 4' 1\\" diameter boilers with a working pressure of 140psi. Originally numbered 1 'Raigmore' and 3 'Ballindalloch', they were renumbered 29 and 30 in 1898, and were withdrawn in 1910 and 1912 respectively. *O class 2-4-0T of 1878‚Äì79 *L class 4-4-0 of 1882‚Äì1901 *E class 4-4-0 of 1886 *One 0-4-4 saddle-tank was built at Inverness in 1890 for service on the Strathpeffer branch. Originally numbered 13 and named 'Strathpeffer', it had 4' 3\\" coupled wheels, 14\\" by 20\\" inside cylinders, a 3' 6.5\\" diameter boiler, and a weight in working order of 32 tons. In 1901 the locomotive was rebuilt by Drummond as a side-tank engine, in which form it was renumbered 53. In 1903 it was renamed 'Lybster' and transferred to that branch.It passed to the LMS in 1923. *Strath class 4-4-0 of 1892 *P class 4-4-0T of 1893 *Jones Goods 4-6-0 of 1894. *Loch class 4-4-0 of 1896‚Äì1917 had a very high power/weight ratio and was among the several classes carrying his special louvered chimney. This invention involved the division of the chimney into a central exhaust tube and an outer concentric ring into which air was projected through the louver slits down the front of the chimney casing. The increase in air resistance was induced by deflector plates. By this means, a draught was supplied when the engine was running with its steam cut off, as happened for long stretches on the hilly Highland line. Other Jones era locomotives Yankee tanks In 1892 the opportunity was taken to purchase two 4-4-0T engines which had been built by D√ºbs and Company for the Uruguay Eastern Railway but not delivered due to a financial hitch. These were known as the Yankee tanks. Dunrobin When the Far North Line opened to Golspie in 1871, the 3rd Duke of Sutherland had purchased a small 2-4-0T from Kitson and Company for his private train. Named Dunrobin, it had 4' driving wheels, 10\\" by 18\\" outside cylinders, and weighed 21 tons in working order. On his succession, the 4th Duke decided to have a new locomotive built, and the original Dunrobin was sold to the Highland Railway in 1895. It was rebuilt in 1896 with a larger boiler and cylinders. The Highland Railway numbered it 118 and named it Gordon Castle' for use on the Fochabers branch. Later it was renamed Invergordon and used as a shunter in that town, where it survived until just after the Grouping. The Duke's new locomotive was an 0-4-4T designed by Jones and built by Sharp, Stewart and Company in 1895. Also named Dunrobin, it had 4' 6\\" driving wheels and 13\\" by 18\\" inside cylinders.

Founded by Loi Ah Koon in 1944, Ya Kun remained a small family-run stall for decades, but has expanded rapidly since Loi's youngest son headed the business in 1999. The chain has over fifty outlets, mostly franchised, across 14 countries, and is a Singaporean cultural icon, known for its traditional brand identity and conservative, people-centric corporate culture. History In 1926, Loi Ah Koon (Èªé‰∫öÂù§) emigrated from Hainan to Singapore, where he worked as a coffee-stall assistant. He later went on to start his own business with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers and toast at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his two partners later dropped out, leaving him to run the stall alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting each slice of bread into half and combining the toast with her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya toast. Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall (Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin),Tan Yi Hui, \\"Toast to sweet success\\", The Straits Times, 9 March 2009. the stall gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya toast and friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three-storey shophouse across the road, where the Hong Leong Building now stands.\\"Ya Kun wants to keep the old charm\\", The Business Times, 5 July 2002. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal-grill the bread and eventually, manage the stall. Ya Kun Coffeestall moved to Lau Pa Sat in 1972, but high rents and renovation of Lau Pa Sat in 1984 sparked a return to the Telok Ayer Market; nevertheless, the stall continued to attract \\"customers who came every day, some from as far as Jurong or Woodlands\\". In 1998, the market closed down, so the stall relocated to Far East Square and was renamed Ya Kun Kaya Toast; the following year, Ah Koon died and his youngest son, Loi Boon Sim Adrin (ÈªéÊñáÊ∑±), took over the business, determined \\"to keep his father's legacy going\\". Realising that Ya Kun had a lot of goodwill and potential, Adrin decided to expand the business, the family opened a second store at Tanjong Pagar and, in 2000, began franchising the brand. Ya Kun were incorporated in 2001, and they launched their first overseas outlet (in Indonesia)Low Shi Ping, \\"A toast to expansion in Asean\\", The Edge Singapore, 3 December 2007. in 2002 and expanded their menu (adding ice cream toast and the Toastwich), they have won the 2004 and 2005 Superbrands Award, the 2005 to 2007 SIFST Product Award and the 2008 SPBA-CitiBusiness Regional Brands Award. Products and stores Kaya toast with boiled eggs and coffee is the signature dish of Ya Kun Kaya Toast. Ya Kun Kaya Toast has over forty Singaporean outlets,\\" about half of which are franchised, and over thirty overseas outlets, all franchised, across seven countries (China, Indonesia, Japan, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines and United Arab Emirates); they plan to expand to Brunei, India, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Thailand in future. The stores have a retro ambiance,Chen Junwei, \\"ÂíñÊ§∞ÂêêÂè∏ÊúâÂøÉ [Toast with a heart]\\", Ming Pao, 18 September 2008. with wooden tables and stools, a Chinese calligraphy of the company name, posters about their history, and traditional methods of preparing food and customer service reflecting Chinese family values. Unlike their main competitors, they have a limited menu that revolves around their core product, kaya toast, with cheese, peanut butter and ice cream as alternative spreads for their thin, brown, crispy bread. To appeal to a wider demographic, Ya Kun also sells French toast and Toastwiches (their Asian alternative to sandwiches). Prices at local Ya Kun stores are slightly higher than those at kopitiams, but lower than prices of comparable products at Western coffeehouse chains operating in Singapore, while food at overseas Ya Kun outlets is relatively expensive. All outlets obtain their ingredients from the same suppliers and some ingredients, notably the kaya and coffee powder, are made at the Ya Kun factory in Bedok,Sandra Leong, \\"Toast to toast\\", The Straits Times, 16 April 2006. using recipes that only a few of the Loi family know. The chain are \\"widely regarded as an institution of good kaya toast\\" and \\"a Singaporean cultural icon\\" that the Singapore Tourism Board has promoted as a tourist attraction. A Ming Pao review praised the \\"crispy but not hard, fragrant but not burnt\\" toast and fresh kaya, while a Straits Times review described the toast as \\"evenly sliced\\" and of \\"the right texture\\", the eggs as \\"cooked to perfection\\" and the teh tarik as \\"not too milky and not overpoweringly sweet either\\". Management Adrin has an 80 percent share of Ya Kun Singapore and his younger brother, Algie, has a 20 percent share, with other members of the Loi family actively involved in daily activities, while Ya Kun International is fully owned by Adrin Loi.

Although Ya Kun do not publicly disclose their financial figures, a 2009 Lianhe Zaobao article estimated that the company had an annual revenue of S$8 million, while a 2012 article in The Star stated they had 300 employees.

A crystalline powder introduced medically in the late 19th century as Atoxyl, its sodium salt was used by injection in the early 20th century as the first organic arsenical drug, but it was soon found prohibitively toxic for human use. Arsanilic acid saw long use as a veterinary feed additive promoting growth and to prevent or treat dysentery in poultry and swine. In 2013, its approval by US government as an animal drug was voluntarily withdrawn by its sponsors. Still sometimes used in laboratories, arsanilic acid's legacy is principally through its influence on Paul Ehrlich in launching the chemotherapeutic approach to treating infectious diseases of humans.Patrick J Collard, The Development of Microbiology (Cambridge, London, New York, Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 1976), pp 53‚Äì4. Chemistry Synthesis was first reported in 1863 by Antoine B√©champ and became the basis of the Bechamp reaction. The process involves the reaction of aniline and arsenic acid via an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. :C6H5NH2 \\\\+ H3AsO4 ‚Üí H2O3AsC6H4NH2 \\\\+ H2O Arsanilic acid occurs as a zwitterion, H3N+C6H4AsO3H‚àí, yet is typically represented with the non-zwitterionic formula H2NC6H4AsO3H2. History =Roots and synthesis= Since at least 2000 BC, arsenic and inorganic arsenical compounds were both medicine and poison. In the 19th century, inorganic arsenicals became the preeminent medicines, for instance Fowler's solution, against diverse diseases. In 1859, in France, while developing aniline dyes, Antoine B√©champ synthesized a chemical that he identified, if incorrectly, as arsenic acid anilide. Also biologist, physician, and pharmacist, B√©champ reported it 40 to 50 times less toxic as a drug than arsenic acid, and named it Atoxyl, the first organic arsenical drug. =Medical influence= In 1905, in Britain, H W Thomas and A Breinl reported successful treatment of trypanosomiasis in animals by Atoxyl, and recommended high doses, given continuously, for human trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). By 1907, more successful and less toxic than inorganic arsenicals, Atoxyl was expected to greatly aid expansion of British colonization of Africa and stem loss of cattle in Africa and India. (So socioeconomically valuable was colonial medicine *Nadav Davidovitch & Zalman Greenberg, \\"Public health, culture, and colonial medicine: Smallpox and variolation in Palestine during the British Mandate\\", Public Health Reports (Washington DC 1974), 2007 May‚ÄìJun;122(3):398‚Äì406, ¬ß \\"Colonial medicine in context\\". *Anna Crozier, Practising Colonial Medicine: The Colonial Medical Service in British East Africa (New York: I.B. Tauris & Co Ltd, 2007). *Deborah Neill, Networks in Tropical Medicine: Internationalism, Colonialism, and the Rise of a Medical Specialty, 1890‚Äì1930 (Stanford CA: Stanford University Press, 2012). that in 1922, German company Bayer offered to reveal the formula of Bayer 205‚Äîdeveloped in 1917 and showing success on sleeping sickness in British and Belgian Africa‚Äîto the British government for return of German colonies lost via World War I.) Soon, however, Robert Koch found through an Atoxyl trial in German East Africa that some 2% of patients were blinded via atrophy of the optic nerve. In Germany, Paul Ehrlich inferred B√©champ's report of Atoxyl's structure incorrect, and Ehrlich with his chief organic chemist Alfred Bertheim found its correct structure‚Äîaminophenyl arsenic acid or aminophenyl arsonic acid‚Äîwhich suggested possible derivatives. Ehrlich asked Bertheim to synthesize two types of Atoxyl derivatives: arsenoxides and arsenobenzenes. Ehrlich and Bertheim's 606th arsenobenzene, synthesized in 1907, was arsphenamine, found ineffective against trypanosomes, but found in 1909 by Ehrlich and bacteriologist Sahachiro Hata effective against the microorganism involved in syphilis, a disease roughly equivalent then to today's AIDS. The company Farbwerke Hoechst marketed arsphenamine as the drug Salvarsan, \\"the arsenic that saves\\". Its specificity of action fit Ehrlich's silver bullet or magic bullet paradigm of treatment, and Ehrlich won international fame while Salvarsan's success‚Äîthe first particularly effective syphilis treatment‚Äîestablished the chemotherapy enterprise. In the late 1940s, Salvarsan was replaced in most regions by penicillin, yet organic arsenicals remained in use for trypanosomiasis. =Contemporary usage= Arsanilic acid gained use as a feed additive for poultry and swine to promote growth and prevent or treat dysentery. For poultry and swine, arsanilic acid was among four arsenical veterinary drugs, along with carbarsone, nitarsone, roxarsone, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 2013, the FDA denied petitions by the Center for Food Safety and by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy seeking revocation of approvals of the arsenical animal drugs, but the drugs' sponsors voluntarily requested the FDA to withdraw approvals of three, including arsanilic acid, leaving only nitarsone approved. In 2015, the FDA withdrew nitarsone's approval. Arsanilic acid is still used in the laboratory, for instance in recent modification of nanoparticles.

It is the smallest of the three palaces built by King Ludwig II of Bavaria and the only one which he lived to see completed. Development Stone facade Ludwig already knew the area around Linderhof from his youth when he had accompanied his father King Maximilian II of Bavaria on his hunting trips in the Bavarian Alps. When Ludwig II became King in 1864, he inherited the so-called K√∂nigsh√§uschen from his father, and in 1869 began enlarging the building. In 1874, he decided to tear down the K√∂nigsh√§uschen and rebuild it on its present-day location in the park. At the same time three new rooms and the staircase were added to the remaining U-shaped complex, and the previous wooden exterior was clad with stone fa√ßades. The building was designed in the style of the second rococo-period. Between 1863 and 1886, a total of 8,460,937 marks was spent constructing Linderhof. Symbolic background Although Linderhof is much smaller than Versailles, it is evident that the palace of the French Sun-King Louis XIV (who was an idol for Ludwig) was its inspiration. The staircase, for example, is a reduction of the famous Ambassador's staircase in Versailles, which would be copied in full in Herrenchiemsee. Stylistically, however, the building and its decor take their cues from the mid-18th century Rococo of Louis XV, and the small palace in the Graswang was more directly based on that king's Petit Trianon on the Versailles grounds. The symbol of the sun that can be found everywhere in the decoration of the rooms represents the French notion of absolutism that, for Ludwig, was the perfect incorporation of his ideal of a God-given monarchy with total royal power. Such a monarchy could no longer be realised in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century. The bedroom was important to the ceremonial life of an absolute monarch; Louis XIV of France used to give his first (lever) and last audience (coucher) of the day in his bedchamber. In imitation of Versailles, the bedroom is the largest chamber of Linderhof Palace. By facing north, however, the Linderhof bedroom inverts the symbolism of its Versailles counterpart, showing Ludwig's self- image as a \\"Night-King.\\" The location of the palace near Ettal Abbey again presents another interesting point. Because of its architecture Ludwig saw the church of the monastery as the room where the holy grail was preserved. This fact connects the idea of a baroque palace to the one of a \\"medieval\\" castle such as Neuschwanstein and reminds of the operas of Richard Wagner whose patron Ludwig was. Ludwig was also not unaware that the abbey had been founded by his ancestor and namesake, Emperor Ludwig IV. The rooms Linderhof, in comparison to other palaces, has a rather private atmosphere. In fact, there are only four rooms that have a real function. =Hall of Mirrors= This room was used by the king as some kind of living room. He enjoyed sitting in the niche, sometimes reading there the whole night. Because Ludwig II used to sleep in the daytime and stay awake in the night, the mirrors created an unimaginable effect for him when they reflected the light of the candles a thousand times. The parallel placement of some mirrors evoke the illusion of a never ending avenue. Appointments: The middle table has a top with lapis- lazuli, amethyst and chalcedony inlay work and shows the Bavarian coat of arms in glass mosaic. A carpet made of ostrich plumes. An ivory candelabra in the alcove with 16 branches. Two mantelpieces clad with lapis-lazuli and decorated with gilded bronze ornaments. =Eastern and Western Tapestry Chambers= The two tapestry chambers are almost identical and have no specific function. The western one is sometimes called \\"Music Room\\" because of the aeolodion (an instrument combining piano and harmonium) in it. Only the curtains and the coverings on the furniture are real products of the Parisian Gobelin Manufactory. The scenes on the walls are painted on rough canvas in order to imitate real tapestries. =Audience Chamber= The audience chamber is located to the west of the palace and is flanked by the yellow and lilac cabinets. The cabinets were only used as antechambers to the larger rooms. Ludwig II never used this room to hold an audience. This would have been against the private character of Linderhof and the chamber would have been much too small for it. He rather used it as a study where he thought about new building projects. That there is an audience chamber in Linderhof, however, reminds us of the demand of the king on an absolute monarchy. Appointments: Two round tables with malachite tops, gift of Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia to King Ludwig II. Throne baldachin with ostrich feather bunches (as an oriental symbol of royal power). =Dining Room= This room is located to the east and is flanked by the pink and blue cabinets. The pink cabinet, unlike the other cabinets, had a real function. The king used it as a robing room. The dining room is famous for its disappearing dumb-waiter called \\"Tischlein deck dich\\". This table was installed so that Ludwig could dine alone here. Yet the staff had to lay the table for at least four persons because it is said that the king used to talk to imaginary people like Louis XV, Mme de Pompadour or Marie Antoinette while he was eating. For Ludwig II enjoyed the company of those people and admired them. You can find portraits of them in the cabinets, and scenes of their lives everywhere in the palace's rooms. Appointments: Meissen porcelain centrepiece with china flowers. =Bedchamber= The model for this room was not Louis XIV's bedchamber in Versailles but the bedroom of the Rich Rooms in Munich Residence. This room was completely rebuilt in 1884 and could not be totally finished until the king's death two years later. The position of the bed itself on steps in the alcove that is closed off by a gilded balustrade gives it the appearance of an altar and thereby glorifies Ludwig II as he slept during the day. Appointments: A glass candelabra with 108 candles. Two console tables of Meissen porcelain (which was the king's favorite china) The park The gardens surrounding Linderhof Palace are considered one of the most beautiful creations of historicist garden design, designed by Court Garden Director Carl von Effner. The park combines elements of Renaissance and Baroque formal gardens with landscaped sections that are similar to the English landscape garden. =Linderhof's Linden or The Old \\"K√∂nigslinde\\"= Deriving from the romantic image of animated nature Ludwig was fascinated by trees. For this reason a tall, 300-year-old linden tree was allowed to remain in the formal gardens although disturbing its symmetry. Historic pictures show a seat in it, where Ludwig used to take his \\"breakfast\\" at sunset hidden from view amongst the branches. Contrary to common understanding the tree did not give the palace its name. It came from a family called \\"Linder\\" that used to cultivate the farm (in German \\"Hof\\" = farm) that over centuries had been in the place where now Linderhof palace is. =Formal gardens= The palace is surrounded by formal gardens that are subdivided into five sections that are decorated with allegoric sculptures of the continents, the seasons and the elements: Music Pavilion The northern part is characterized by a cascade of thirty marble steps. The bottom end of the cascade is formed by the Neptune fountain and at the top there is a Music Pavilion. The centre of the western parterre is formed by basin with the gilt figure of \\"Fama\\". In the west there is a pavilion with the bust of Louis XIV. In front of it you see a fountain with the gilt sculpture \\"Amor with dolphins\\". The garden is decorated with four majolica vases. The crowning of the eastern parterre is a wooden pavilion containing the bust of Louis XVI. Twenty-four steps below it there is a fountain basin with a gilt sculpture \\"Amor shooting an arrow\\". A sculpture of \\"Venus and Adonis\\" is placed between the basin and the palace. Gilt fountain The water parterre in front of the palace is dominated by a large basin with the gilt fountain group \\"Flora and puttos\\". The fountain's water jet itself is nearly 25 meters high. The terrace gardens form the southern part of the park and correspond to the cascade in the north. On the landing of the first flight there is the \\"Naiad fountain\\" consisting of three basins and the sculptures of water nymphs. In the middle arch of the niche you see the bust of Marie Antoinette of France. These gardens are crowned by a round temple with a statue of Venus formed after a painting by Antoine Watteau (The Embarkation for Cythera). =Landscape garden and structures in the park= The landscape garden covers an area of about 50 hectares (125 acres) and is perfectly integrated in the surrounding natural alpine landscape. There are several buildings of different appearance located in the park. Venus Grotto ;Venus Grotto The building is wholly artificial and was built for the king as an illustration of the First Act of Wagner's Tannh√§user. Ludwig liked to be rowed over the lake in his golden swan-boat but at the same time he wanted his own blue grotto of Capri. Therefore, 24 dynamos had been installed and so already in the time of Ludwig II it was possible to illuminate the grotto in changing colours. The grotto is closed to visitors through 2024 for reconstruction and restoration. ;Hunding's Hut This hut was inspired by Richard Wagner's directions for the First Act of the Die Walk√ºre. Ludwig used to celebrate Germanic feasts in this house. ;Gurnemanz Hermitage Ludwig came here for contemplation every year on Good Friday. For this day he wanted a flowering meadow. If there was no such meadow because there was still snow lying, the garden director had to plant one for the king. These three structures, the \\"Venus Grotto\\", \\"Hunding's Hut\\" and \\"Gurnemanz Hermitage\\" remind us another time of the operas of Richard Wagner. But besides that and the baroque architecture Ludwig was also interested in the oriental world. The Moorish kiosk ;Moorish Kiosk This building was designed by the Berliner architect Karl von Diebitsch for the International Exhibition in Paris 1867. Ludwig II wanted to buy it but was forestalled by the railroad king Bethel Henry Strousberg. Ludwig bought the pavilion after the bankruptcy of Strousberg. The most notable piece of furniture of this building is the peacock throne. Moroccan House ;Moroccan House This house was actually built in Morocco for the International Exhibition in Vienna 1873. The king bought it in 1878 and redecorated it in a more royal way.

Biography  Noriega was born in Cajamarca in 1900 as the son of Wenceslao Noriega and Mar√≠a del Carmen Ag√ºero. He served as Manuel A. Odr√≠a's deputy since Odr√≠a took power in a military coup in 1948. On June 1, 1950, Odr√≠a formally stepped down as president in order to pursue his candidacy in a presidential election in which he would be the only candidate. Noriega became president of the Junta until July 28, when Odr√≠a resumed power. Political historians concede that Noriega did not rule on his own, but followed Odr√≠a's commands. He was immediately appointed Prime Minister by Odr√≠a, and served in that position until August 1954. Already enshrined as constitutional president Odr√≠a after a questionable election, Noriega continued to serve as Minister of War and President of the Council of Ministers. He was promoted to Major General in 1953. Shortly after he was accused of organizing a plot to depose Odr√≠a, he was sent into exile aboard one of the navy ships (August 1954). It was said the conspiracy involved important people, being a symptom of the degree of decomposition in the Odriist regime. Noriega went to Argentina, where he was received by President Juan Domingo Per√≥n. Two years later he returned to Peru and retired to private life. He died in 1957.

Biography Haim Laskov was born in Barysaw in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (present-day Belarus). He immigrated to Palestine with his family in 1925. The family settled in Haifa, where they lived in dire poverty. Laskov joined the Haganah as a teenager, and served in various units, including Orde Wingate's Special Night Squads. He also served as a personal messenger for Yaakov Dori, who would later become the first Chief of Staff. In 1940, Laskov joined the British Army so that he could participate in World War II. He served in various capacities, and was a commander of the Jewish Brigade which saw action on the Italian front, eventually reaching the rank of major. After the war, he remained in Europe to participate in the Aliyah Bet illegal immigration effort to bring refugee Jews to Palestine. He also took part in various illicit acts of vengeance against the Nazis and their collaborators. Upon eventually returning to Palestine, he rejoined the Haganah, while also working as chief of security for the electric company. Military career When the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War erupted in 1948, Laskov assumed responsibility for preparing the framework in which new recruits would be trained. He organized the first officers' course, and formed the graduates into a brigade that fought at Latrun during Operation Nahshon. One month later, in May 1948, he returned to Latrun as commander of Israel's first armored battalion, which fought alongside the 7th Brigade. He commanded the entire brigade during Operation Dekel and Operation Hiram, and participated in the many battles over control of the Galilee. In July, he finally returned to training new recruits, now with the rank of major general. Although he had never been a pilot, Laskov was appointed commander of the Israeli Air Force in 1951. During his tenure, the air force prepared to incorporate its first jet fighter, the Meteor. Upon completing his tenure in 1953, Laskov left the army to study philosophy, economics, and political science (PPE) in the United Kingdom. He also obtained additional military training there. In 1955, he returned to Israel, where he was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff and Senior Staff Officer, however, after a series of professional disputes with Moshe Dayan, he was demoted to Commander of the Armored Corps. During the 1956 Sinai Campaign, he commanded the 77th Division, which operated on the Rafah‚Äìel-Arish‚ÄìKantara front. Upon the death of Asaf Simchoni, Chief of the Southern Command, in a plane crash, Laskov assumed his position, and oversaw the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Sinai Peninsula. Chief of General Staff (1958‚Äì61) Chaim Laskov in 1952 :1958 In 1958, Laskov was appointed Chief of General Staff, replacing Moshe Dayan. His appointment took place against the backdrop of the unification of Egypt and Syria as the United Arab Republic on January 31 of that year and the potential threat this posed to the security of Israel. Just two months later, on March 30, Israel and Syria exchanged heavy artillery fire across the Sea of Galilee. The clashes lasted for two days, until a ceasefire was finally achieved. On April 24, Laskov presided over a huge military parade in Jerusalem to mark the tenth anniversary of Israel's independence. This took place despite warnings by Jordan that such a parade would be considered an act of aggression. During the parade, Laskov displayed Israel's latest military hardware, including weapons captured from Egypt in the Sinai and from Syria during clashes in the Hula Valley. On November 6, Syria resumed its artillery bombardment of the Galilee, while Israeli workers were involved in a massive project draining Lake Huleh to obtain more agricultural land for the country. Under Laskov's orders, the IDF returned fire. :1959 One of the great scandals that occurred during Laskov's tenure, was a surprise exercise to test the mobilization of the reserves, on April 1, 1959. Known as the \\"Night of the Ducks\\" (one of the coded call-up signals broadcast over the radio was \\"Water Fowl\\"), the event caused panic throughout the country, and put the armies of the neighboring Arab states on high alert. A commission of inquiry which investigated the matter found Major General Meir Zorea, Senior Staff Officer, and Major General Yehoshafat Harkabi, Chief of Military Intelligence, responsible for the fiasco, and the two resigned their posts. :1960 Tensions between Israel and Syria continued over the following months. On January 31, Israel attacked the Syrian village of Tawfik, overlooking the Sea of Galilee, claiming that it had been used by the Syrian army to bombard Israeli villages in the Galilee. Three Israeli soldiers were killed in the operation. The raid led to the outbreak of the Rotem Crisis, during which Egypt had deployed its armed forces on Israel's undefended southern border, catching Israel off guard. On March 9, Egyptian forces started to withdraw. Laskov later described the crisis as the most dramatic of his tenure as IDF Chief of the General Staff. :Legacy Laskov resigned his position of Chief of General Staff in 1961 after a relatively peaceful tenure, marred only by clashes with the Syrians. During his term, he focused on building the strength of the IDF: Israel acquired its first submarine and its Super Myst√®re jets. Just before he left office, prime minister David Ben-Gurion also announced that the country had built a nuclear reactor outside the desert town of Dimona. The reactor, he claimed, was built for peaceful purposes. Laskov established Israel's National Defense College to promote IDF generals' fluency in strategic concepts. Civilian career In 1961, Laskov was appointed director general of the Ports Authority, and it was during his tenure that the port of Ashdod, now Israel's major port, was constructed. He also continued to write military training manuals and submitted numerous articles to military journals. In 1972, Laskov became the country's first Soldier's Ombudsman, a post he held for ten years, until his death. After the Yom Kippur War in 1973, he served on the Agranat Commission, which investigated the fiascos that led to the war.

Despite worldwide condemnation and the existence of treaty provisions that forbid it, some countries still use it. The ethical assertion that torture is a tool is at question. Premise The basic ethical debate is often presented as a matter of deontological versus utilitarian viewpoint. A utilitarian thinker may believe, when the overall outcome of lives saved due to torture are positive, torture can be justified; the intended outcome of an action is held as the primary factor in determining its merit or morality. The opposite view is the deontological, from Greek deon (duty), which proposes general rules and values that are to be respected regardless of outcome. However, if the outcome of policies allowing torture are uncertain (or if the outcome can not be definitely traced back to the use of torture) then there can be a utilitarian view that torture is wrong (see issues related to the ends justifying the means in analysis of the ticking time bomb scenario). It has been suggested that one of the reasons torture endures is that torture indeed works in some instances to extract information/confession if those who are being tortured are indeed guilty. Richard Posner, a highly influential judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, argued that \\"If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary to prevent the detonation of a nuclear bomb in Times Square, torture should be used‚Äîand will be used‚Äîto obtain the information. ... No one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility.\\" However, some experienced intelligence officers have more recently come forward claiming that not only does torture not work, it can result in false information since people undergoing torture will say anything just to make the torture stop. Some people also point to neuroscience to demonstrate that torture may further impair a person's ability to tell the truth. A utilitarian argument against torture is that the majority of tortures are employed not as a method of extracting information, but as a method of terrorizing and subjugating the population, enabling state forces to dispense with ordinary means of establishing innocence or guilt and with the whole legal apparatus altogether. Therefore, it is better that a few individuals be killed by bombers than a much greater number‚Äîpossibly thousands of innocent people‚Äîbe tortured and murdered and legal and constitutional provisions destroyed. During the investigation of Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro's kidnapping, General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa reportedly responded to a member of the security services who suggested torture against a suspect, \\"Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture.\\"Report of Conadep (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons): Prologue ‚Äì 1984Quoted in History Historically, torture has been reviled as an idea, yet employed as a tool and defended by its wielders, often in direct contradiction to their own averred beliefs. Judicial torture was a common feature of the legal systems of many countries including all civil law countries in Europe until the Enlightenment era. A papal bull forbade the practice of torture in Roman Catholic countries in 1816. This was part of ancient Greek and Roman law theory that remained valid in Europe. Roman law assumed, for example, that slaves would not tell the truth in a legal court as they were always vulnerable to threats from their owners. Their testimony could only be of value if it were extracted by a greater fear of torture. Legal scholars were well aware of the problems of false testimony produced by the threat of torture. In theory torture was not meant to produce a confession as such, but rather details of the crime or crime scene which only the guilty party would know. The Spanish Inquisition is probably the most infamous example in which torture was used to extract information regarding allegations of heresy. In early modern times under certain conditions, torture was used in England. For example, the confession of Marc Smeaton at the trial of Anne Boleyn was presented in written form only, either to hide from the court that Smeaton had been tortured on the rack for four hours, or because Thomas Cromwell was worried that he would recant his confession if cross-examined. When Guy Fawkes was arrested for his role in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 he was tortured until he revealed all he knew about the plot. This was not so much to extract a confession, which was not needed to prove his guilt, but to extract from him the names of his fellow conspirators. By this time torture was not routine in England and a special warrant from King James I was needed before he could be tortured. The wording of the warrant shows some concerns for humanitarian considerations; the severity of the methods of interrogation were to be increased gradually until the interrogators were sure that Fawkes had told all he knew. In the end this did not help Fawkes much as he was broken on the only rack in England, which was in the Tower of London. Torture was abolished in England around 1640 (except peine forte et dure, whose aim was to force a defendant not to confess but to plead, which was abolished in 1772). The use of torture in Europe came under attack during the Enlightenment. Cesare Beccaria's On Crimes and Punishments (1764) denounced the use of torture as cruel and contrary to reason. The French Revolution abolished the use of torture in France and the French Armies carried abolition to most of the rest of Europe. The last European jurisdictions to abolish legal torture were Portugal (1828) and the canton of Glarus in Switzerland (1851). Under codified legal systems such as France, torture was superseded with a legal system that is highly dependent on investigating magistrates and the confession remains \\"The Queen of Proofs\\". Such magistrates are often under pressure to produce results. It is alleged that in many cases police violence towards suspects has been ignored by the magistrates. In the adversarial system of common law used throughout the English-speaking world, the experience is a different one. As the two parties have to convince a jury whether the defendant in a case is guilty or innocent of a crime, if the defence can persuade a jury that reasonable doubt exists over the credibility of a confession, then the jury is likely to disregard the confession. If the defence can show that the confession was made under such duress that most people would make such a confession, then the jury is likely to question the confession's credibility. Usually the more duress that can be shown to have been used by law enforcement by the defence, the less weight most juries will place on confessions. In Britain, partly to protect the individual against police brutality and partly to make confessions credible to a jury, all interviews with a suspect are audio taped on a machine which make two simultaneous copies, one for the police and one for the defendant. In Northern Ireland, where society is more polarised than in the rest of the United Kingdom, which means that allegations of police brutality are perceived by sections of the community to carry more credence, interviews are video taped. It has been alleged that in certain circumstances torture, even though it is illegal, may have been used by some European countries. In \\"anti-terrorist\\" campaigns where information is needed for intelligence purposes, and not to obtain a confession for use in court, there is a temptation by the security forces, whether authorised by governments or not, to extract intelligence from alleged terrorists using any means available including the use of torture. Where there is a time component to a crime, for example in a kidnapping case, there is also a temptation for the police to try to extract information by methods which would make the evidence inadmissible in court. Debate =Proponents= Some scholars have argued that the need for information outweighs the moral and ethical arguments against torture. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, in an opinion article work=The Independent date=23 May 2005}} Includes commentary on how some Americans have changed their attitudes to torture. published in The Independent on 23 May 2005, wrote: Two academics at Deakin University in Victoria, Australia, Professor Mirko Bagaric, a Croatian-born Australian based author and lawyer, who is the head of Deakin University's Law School, and a fellow Deakin law lecturer, Julie Clarke, published a paper in the University of San Francisco Law Review arguing that when many lives are in imminent danger, \\"all forms of harm\\" may be inflicted on a suspect, even if this might result in \\"annihilation\\". The reasoning behind the proposal to legalise torture is that: It was observed that Bagaric \\"was not the author of what he wrote, all he did was reintroducing Alan M. Dershowitz' thesis, Sharon‚Äôs [Israeli] government legal adviser and the theorist of the legal torture\\".\\"Torture: the visible part of the iceberg\\". Voltaire Network (20 May 2005). It was also observed that Bagaric has written many pieces calling for men to be sentenced more than women for the same crime. This calls into question his ability to deal impartially with regard to crime and torture, which is mainly committed against men. When reviewing Alan Dershowitz's book Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge, Richard Posner, a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, wrote: On December 20, 2005, Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, addressed the problem of whether torture should be used by American military forces in order to gain important information from terrorist suspects. Although he spoke out against any form of legal codification, he did state the following: =Opponents= Many experts argue that torture is an unreliable means of obtaining useful information. However, many states have used torture not to extract information, but as a means of terrorising their populations or specific communities. Frantz Fanon, in The Wretched of the Earth, reports the French in Algeria using \\"preventative torture\\" on entirely innocent people to stop them doing anything in future. In most countries torture is illegal, and this being so, outside the normal framework for establishing guilt or innocence. Therefore, an abnormally large proportion of torture victims are either innocent (apart from membership of target communities) or of mistaken identity. For example, Khalid el-Masri, an innocent German citizen, was kidnapped and tortured, having been mistaken for Al-Qaida chief Khalid al-Masri. The Red Cross in Iraq estimated that 80% of detainees at Abu Ghraib were the \\"wrong people\\". In response to the article by Professor Bagaric and Mrs Clarke, Amnesty International spokeswoman Nicole Bieske, who is also a lawyer, was stunned by the idea of regulating torture: \\"It's astonishing and appalling that somebody would hold this opinion in relation to such a fundamental issue as torture, and to be justifying it on moral as well as pragmatic grounds\\".Minchin, Liz. Make torture legal, say two academics. The Age, 17 May 2005 Professor Bagaric and Mrs Clarke submitted the paper to an American law journal because of \\"the kind of emotive comments that I've had here in Australia, saying that this view is horrendous, unthinking, and irresponsible\\". Joe Navarro, one of the F.B.I.‚Äôs top experts in questioning techniques, told The New Yorker, \\"Only a psychopath can torture and be unaffected. You don't want people like that in your organization. They are untrustworthy, and tend to have grotesque other problems.\\" Toleration of torture and arbitrary detention has been likened to a \\"cancer of democracy\\" in a book of the same title by Pierre Vidal-Naquet, which begins to undermine all other aspects of a state's legitimacy. On the 20th anniversary of the coming into force of the United Nations Convention against Torture, Philip Hensher writes \\"Civilization is at once compromised if, in defense of other freedoms, it decides to regress, to accept the possibility of torture as it is seen in the movies.\\". Ticking time bomb scenario In law enforcement, one perceived argument is the necessity of force to extract information from a suspect when regular interrogation yields no results and time is of the essence, as can be seen in the most frequently cited theoretical example is the \\"ticking time bomb\\" scenario, where a known terrorist has planted a nuclear bomb. In such circumstances, it has been argued, that not to use torture would be wrong, and by others that using torture would change society in a manner which would be worse. The obvious rebuttal to this stance is that no such scenario has ever existed. In addition, those situations resembling such a case were resolved without the need to torture any suspect. Furthermore, it is asked whether torture would be limited to suspects, or whether one could torture the family and friends of this detainee to make him compliant. Supporters cite cases where torture has worked: In the case of Magnus G√§fgen, who was suspected of kidnapping 11-year-old Jakob von Metzler and arrested in October 2002 by German police, police surveillance had observed G√§fgen pick up a ‚Ç¨1 million ransom demanded from the von Metzler family and proceed to go on a spending spree. After the ransom was paid, the boy was not released. Fearing for the boy's safety Frankfurt's deputy police chief, Wolfgang Daschner, had G√§fgen arrested and when he would not talk threatened to cause G√§fgen severe pain. G√§fgen told police where he had hidden von Metzler's body. In this case torture was threatened, but not used, to extract information that, in other circumstances, could have saved a boy's life. The ethical question is whether this can ever be justified. Wolfgang Daschner felt that in the circumstances it was justified. German Chancellor Merkel, in an interview on January 9, 2006 in reference to the Metzler case stated \\"The public debate showed that the overwhelming majority of citizens believed that even in such a case, the end does not justify the means. That is also my position.\\" Opponents, on the other hand, cite cases of rampant abuse: for example, in Chile and Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s thousands of people \\"disappeared\\" and were tortured or killed or both. Beyond that, another reason is that torture fails to elicit the expected information because the subject is saying anything interrogators want to hear to stop the ordeal (or deliberately lies to waste the interrogators' time and make it more likely the bomb will go off), or worse: the detainee is innocent. By adopting a \\"the ends justifies the means\\" approach this would allow nine innocent people to be tortured as long as the tenth offered a full confession. It has been estimated that as few as two dozen of the 600 detainees at Guantanamo had any potential intelligence value, even if it could be obtained from them.

The aim of Key Skills is to encourage learners to develop and demonstrate their skills as well as learn how to select and apply skills in ways that are appropriate to their particular context. It is generally available in secondary schools (alongside GCSEs, A-levels or other qualifications), Further Education colleges (alongside NVQ, as part of Apprenticeship training or other equivalent vocational or academic courses) and other places of learning (sometimes alongside other qualifications and sometimes independently). The qualifications can be taken at levels 1-4. The Department for Children, Schools and Families in England and the Department for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills in Wales define Key Skills as \\"a range of essential skills that underpin success in education, employment, lifelong learning and personal development\\". The DfES website states that the Key Skills Qualification is offered as a response to concern from employers about lack of essential skills in young recruits and as part of the response to the 1996 Dearing Report. Key Skills qualifications at levels 2-4 attract UCAS Tariff points for University admissions. The UCAS tariff is a points system used to report achievement for entry to higher education (HE) in a numerical format.  Subjects  Key Skills Qualifications are offered in six areas: *Communication : speaking, listening, reading and writing skills *Application of Number : interpreting information involving numbers, carrying out calculations, interpreting results and presenting findings *Information Communication Technology : finding, exploring, developing and presenting information including text, images and numbers *Working with others : includes process and interpersonal skills to support working cooperatively with others to achieve shared objectives, work cooperatively and have regard for others *Improving own learning and performance : developing independent learners who are clearly focused on what they want to achieve and able to work towards targets that will improve the quality of their learning and performance. The standards include process skills, e.g., target-setting, planning, learning, reviewing and interpersonal skills, e.g., communicating own needs, accepting constructive feedback, negotiating learning opportunities and support *Problem solving : encouraging learners to develop and demonstrate their ability to tackle problems systematically, for the purpose of working towards their solution and learning from this process. Three types or combinations of problems are dealt with: diagnostic problems that depend primarily on analysis to arrive at conclusions, design problems that depend mainly on synthesis to create a product or process, and contingency problems that typically involve resource allocation and gaining the cooperation of others, e.g. when organising an event The first three Key Skills are sometimes referred to as the 'main' Key Skills. They incorporate the basic skills of literacy and numeracy. The remaining three are often referred to as the 'wider' or 'soft' Key Skills. Assessment arrangements for Key Skills vary between England, Wales and Northern Ireland (see below). Key Skills may be examined in a variety of ways including internal, external or set tasks. Internal assessment means the production of a portfolio of work demonstrating satisfaction of the Key Skills targets. The Internal assessment (portfolio) must be internally verified and externally moderated. External assessment consists of a test or examination in the subject, often in formal examination conditions. Set tasks are similar to portfolios without the flexibility of the latter.  Levels and progression  The Qualifications are offered over four levels: level one, two, three and four. These levels correspond to the levels used for other qualifications within the national qualifications framework. Progression to a higher level is characterised by: \\\\- greater autonomy from the individual in deciding how they will apply their skills to suit different tasks and problems \\\\- greater demands made by the situation in which the skills are applied \\\\- use of a wider range and more complex techniques. Key Skills Level 1 helps candidates to develop the basic skills that are important for key skills competence, and recognises their ability to apply these skills in meeting given purposes within routine situations. Level 1 is broadly related in terms of level of demand, to GCSE grades D-G or National Curriculum level 5. Key Skills Level 2 builds on level 1 by requiring candidates to extend their basic skills. It recognises their ability to take responsibility for some decisions about how they select and apply these skills to meet the demands of largely straightforward tasks. Level 2 can be broadly related, in terms of level of demand, to GCSE grades A*‚ÄìC. Key Skills Level 3 marks a shift from straightforward tasks to being capable of responding to the demands of more complex activities. Candidates need to demonstrate more explicit reasoning ability and personal responsibility in making decisions about how tasks are organised. Level 3 can be broadly related, in terms of level of demand, to an A grade at A level The higher levels, levels 4 and 5, describe those skills relevant to technical and professional situations and higher level study. Key Skills Level 4 requires candidates to have substantial autonomy and responsibility for managing activities and for identifying how the key skills relate to their situation. It recognises ability to develop a strategy for using key skills over an extended period of time, monitor and critically reflect on progress and adapt strategy, as necessary, to achieve the quality of outcomes required. At Key Skill Level 5, there is a single standard (personal skills development). This standard requires candidates to apply their key skills in communication, working with others and problem solving, in an integrated way, in order to improve their own learning and performance in managing professionally challenging work. Source: QCA (Qualifications and Curriculum Authority) The Key Skills Qualifications Standards and Guidance, 2004.  Key Skills Awards  According to the UK National Statistics office, up to September 2006, almost 2.2 million Key Skills qualifications had been awarded. There were 692 thousand awards of Key Skills qualifications in 2005/06 alone. 522 thousand of all Key Skills qualifications were for main Key Skills, up 19 per cent on the previous year. 170 thousand of all Key Skills qualifications were for wider Key Skills, up 61 per cent on the previous year. The most popular key skills continue to be communication awards (206 thousand awards in 2005/06 compared to 150 thousand ICT awards. Application of Number is still the fastest growing main Key Skill qualification, up by 27 per cent on the previous year to 166 thousand Since their introduction as a Qualification in 2004, the wider key skills continue to grow. Between 2004/05 and 2005/06, there was an increase of at least 60 per cent in the number of awards for each of the wider Key Skills such that wider Key Skills accounted for almost a quarter of awards of all Key Skills qualifications in 2005/06, compared with around a fifth in 2004/05.

England  Schools generally determine the level of entrance dependent on past achievement. Those who achieved under grade C at GCSE in the corresponding subject (English, Mathematics or Information Technology respectively) are asked to take the corresponding level two Qualification. Those who achieved over grade C at GCSE are recommended to take level three or four. Those who take the corresponding subjects at AS/A-level (or equivalent) are generally excluded from the external assessment in that subject, as the completion of the corresponding subject certifies the academic achievement required. By 2010 the main three key skills will be replaced by Functional Skills in England, which will form part of the new Specialised Diploma Framework. The wider key skills will continue to be accredited. =Proxy= Students with a GCSE (or equiv.) up to grade D in the subject associated to the Key Skill (i.e. IT, English or Maths) are exempt from taking the test for level 1 and can be entered for a proxy, this means that only the portfolio need be completed. The same applies to level 2 Key Skills if the student has a GCSE (or equiv.) grade C or above. The exception to this is Key Skills ICT where a proxy makes the student exempt from both the test AND the portfolio. It is important to establish the correct level to be aimed for initially, especially when it comes to ICT.  Wales  In Wales Key Skills have been replaced with Essential Skills Wales (ESW) (as of September 2010.) Essential Skills Wales is the suite of skills qualifications which replaced the previous Key Skills of Communication, Application of Number and ICT, and the Basic Skills of Adult Literacy, Adult Numeracy and Skills for Life ICT. These skills can be achieved through the medium of Welsh or English.  Scotland  Scotland has a separate Core Skills qualification. One of the main aims of Higher Still qualifications in Scotland is to develop the capabilities people need to be responsible members of society. All students at all levels must obtain qualifications in all five Core Skills if they wish to obtain a Scottish Group Award. The Core skills enable people to put their knowledge and understanding into action. The Five Core Skills are: *Communication : Oral and Written Communication *Numeracy : Using Graphical Information, Using Number *Information Technology : Using Information Technology *Problem Solving : Critical Thinking, Planning and Organising, Reviewing and Evaluating *Working With Others : Working With Others  See also  * Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification * Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning  References   External links  *Directgov: Key Skills qualifications * Edexcel: Key Skills * Welsh Baccaluareate and Essential Skills Wales site Category:Standardised tests in England Category:Standardised tests in Wales Category:Standardised tests in Northern Ireland ","title":"Key Skills Qualification"},{"id":"1924244","text":"Micha≈Ç Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski after arrest by NKVD 1940 General Micha≈Ç Tadeusz Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski, Coat of arms of TrƒÖby pseudonym Doktor, Stolarski, TorwidJozef Garlinski Poland in the Second World War, Page 40 (b. 5 January 1893 in Lemberg ‚Äì 22 May 1964 in Casablanca, Morocco) was a Polish general, founder of the resistance movement \\"Polish Victory Service\\".

The title is a phrase (see ghost in the machine) coined by the Oxford philosopher Gilbert Ryle to describe the Cartesian dualist account of the mind‚Äìbody relationship. Koestler shares with Ryle the view that the mind of a person is not an independent non-material entity, temporarily inhabiting and governing the body. The work attempts to explain humanity's self-destructive tendency in terms of individual and collective functioning, philosophy, and overarching, cyclical political‚Äìhistorical dynamics, peaking in the nuclear weapons arena. Overview In an attempt to explain human violence, Koestler criticizes the dominant conceptions of psychology of his time (behaviorism) that postulate that human behaviors are subject to the selection of the fittest. For him this theory echoed the Darwinian conceptions of the evolution of species. The book contributes also to the longstanding debate surrounding the mind‚Äìbody problem and focusing in particular on Ren√© Descartes's dualism, in the form elucidated by Ryle. Koestler's materialistic account argues that the personal experience of duality arises from what Koestler calls a holon. The notion of a holon emerges from the observation that everything in the nature is both a whole and a part. It is true for atoms who are a whole in themselves, but also a part of a molecule, of molecules who could be a whole and part of cell, of cells who are both an autonomous unity and part of an organism. It is also true for human beings who have an independent life and are part of social systems. Every holon is willing to express two contradictory tendencies : to express himself, and to disappear in something greater. For humans, those tendencies lead to an error in development: we create collective units that are based on the oppression of some individuals and on the inflated egos of others. This is for Koestler an error of transcendence that is reflected in a poor integration of our reptilian brain and cognitive brain. A superposition of forces manifests, at each bodily holon, as the outcome of an entire hierarchy of forces‚Äîontogenetic, habitual, linguistic prescriptive, and social science‚Äîoperating in a continuum of independent feedback and feedforward streams of a body extended to its larger environment. The streams are fed by the life signals of each and every group member, and this fully participative medley is the spirit of life one senses as a ghost; but this spirit is just a simplified output of a complex knowledge set; it is emergent from the complexity of the group's rules and strategies. He contrasts his basic approach to the mind‚Äìbody problem with behaviorism's basic approach to the problem.The book is vehemently critical of B. F. Skinner's Behaviorist theory of psychology. Following the holon of humanity down to its roots, the work explains humanity's tendency toward self-destruction in terms of brain structure, philosophies, and its overarching, cyclical political‚Äìhistorical dynamics, reaching the height of its potential in the nuclear arms arena. One of the book's central concepts is that as the human triune brain has evolved, it has retained and built upon earlier, more primitive brain structures. The head portion of the \\"ghost in the machine\\" has, as a consequence of poor, inadequate connections, a rich potential for conflict. The primitive layers can, and may, together, overpower rational logic's hold. This explains a person's hate, anger and other such emotional distress. In Janus: A Summing Up (1978) Koestler continues the theories developed in The Ghost in the Machine and further elaborates on the concept of holarchy.

His catalogue of old master prints is the foundation of print history, and he was himself a printmaker practicing engraving and etching. Bartsch was born and died in Vienna. He joined the staff of the Royal Court Library in Vienna in 1777, after studying engraving at the Vienna Kupferstecheracademie, and became Head curator of the print collection in 1791. He was also an advisor to Duke Albert of Saxe-Teschen, who founded the collection of the Albertina, Vienna, then as now the world's finest collection of old master prints. In the twentieth century the two collections were merged in the Albertina. \\"Le Peintre Graveur\\" Between 1803 and his death in 1821 Bartsch published in French in 21 volumes Le Peintre Graveur, a pioneering catalogue of old master prints by Dutch, Flemish, German, and Italian painter-engravers from the 15th to the 17th century. References to \\"Bartsch\\" normally mean this work. It has been reprinted five times, most recently in 1982. In 1821 he also published the Kupferstichkunde (The Art of Engraving) in German. \\"The Illustrated Bartsch\\" \\"The Illustrated Bartsch\\" (Abaris Books, New York) is an English language illustrated version of \\"Le Peintre Graveur.\\" (The original \\"Le Peintre Graveur\\" was unillustrated by technological necessity.) The \\"Illustrated Bartsch\\" General Editor was Walter L. Strauss. The project has been underway since 1978, and is projected to include at least 164 volumes. Most of the picture volumes are published; the accompanying text volumes, in effect complete new catalogue raisonn√©s, are taking longer. In fact only Bartsch's numbering is retained in full, although his original is often quoted. All the prints known to Bartsch are illustrated in the first 50 volumes. Prints not known to Bartsch, not listed by him or new attributions are listed in the companion and later volumes. It is often abbreviated to \\"TIB\\" in references. It (currently the images only) is available online to colleges and other institutions subscribing to ARTstor- essentially in US & Canada only. Legacy Bartsch established what has become the definitive numbering system, bearing his name (e.g. \\"Bartsch 17\\" or \\"B17\\"), for Rembrandt etchings and the prints of many other artists, which is still used or at least referred to most subsequent and standard works in this field. His numbers list the works by category, roughly following the contemporary hierarchy of genres, except that self-portraits come first, followed by biblical subjects, then subjects of saints, allegories, and so on. In his lifetime, Bartsch executed over 500 plates from his own designs and from those of other masters. Many are attractive but he is not a major artist. His term peintre-graveur or painter- engraver is also still in use to distinguish original from reproductive printmakers, especially in the period of the old master print (to about 1830).

Stalag is a contraction of \\"Stammlager\\", itself short for Kriegsgefangenen-Mannschaftsstammlager, a literal translation of which is \\"War-caught\\" (i.e. POW) \\"team\\" \\"main camp\\"). Therefore, technically \\"stalag\\" simply means \\"main camp\\".  Legal definitions  According to the Third Geneva Convention of 1929 and its predecessor, the Hague Convention of 1907, Section IV, Chapter 2,http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm#iart4 these camps were only for prisoners of war, not civilians. Stalags were operated in both World War I and World War II and were intended to be used for non-commissioned personnel (enlisted ranks in the US Army and other ranks in British Commonwealth forces). Officers were held in separate camps called Oflag. During World War II, the Luftwaffe (German air force) operated Stalag Luft in which flying personnel, both officers and non-commissioned officers, were held. The Kriegsmarine (German navy) operated Marlag for Navy personnel and Milag for Merchant Navy personnel. Civilians who were officially attached to military units, such as war correspondents, were provided the same treatment as military personnel by the Conventions. The Third Geneva Convention, Section III, Article 49, permits non-commissioned personnel of lower ranks to be used for work in agriculture and industry, but not in any industry producing war material. Further articles of Section III detail conditions under which they should work, be housed and paid. During World War II these latter provisions were consistently breached, in particular for Russian, Polish, and Yugoslav prisoners. According to Nazi ideology, Slavic people were regarded as rassisch minderwertig (\\"racially inferior\\"). Starvation was a deliberate policy in the St√§llags, particularly with regard to Soviet prisoners of war. The camps consisted of a field with barbed wire around it, in which thousands of people were crammed together. There was usually no room to sit or lie down. Also, there was often no shelter from the weather, which could be very cold in the Polish and Belarusian winter. The food provided was too little to keep the prisoners alive. In the Soviet Stalags, the death rate during the entire war was 57.5 percent, although during the last months of 1941 this rate must have been much higher. In comparison, the mortality rate for Stalags for Western Allies was below 5 percent. More Soviet prisoners of war died every day in Nazi camps during the Autumn of 1941 than the total number of Western Allied POWs in the entire war.Timothy Snyder, Bloodlands, Europe between Hitler and Stalin (London 2010) 175-182 Prisoners of various nationalities were generally separated from each other by barbed-wire fences subdividing each stalag into sections. Frequently prisoners speaking the same language, for example British Commonwealth soldiers, were permitted to intermingle.  Arbeitskommandos  At each stalag the German Army set up sub-camps called Arbeitskommando to hold prisoners in the vicinity of specific work locations, whether factories, coal-mines, quarries, farms or railroad maintenance. These sub-camps sometimes held more than 1,000 prisoners, separated by nationality.Stalag VII A: Kommandos at Moosburg Online, updated 27 June 2011 The sub-camps were administered by the parent stalag, which maintained personnel records and collected mail and International Red Cross packages and then delivered them to the individual Arbeitskommando. Any individuals who were injured in work, or became ill, were returned to the Lazarett (medical care facilities) at the parent stalag.  Notable stalags  Stalag Luft III, a large prisoner of war camp near Sagan, Silesia, Germany (now ≈ªaga≈Ñ, Poland), was the site of an escape attempt (later filmed as The Great Escape). On 24 March 1944, 76 Allied prisoners escaped through a 110 m (approximately 360 feet) long tunnel. Of these, 73 were recaptured within two weeks, and 50 of them were executed by order of Hitler in the Stalag Luft III murders. The largest German World War II prisoner of war camp was Stalag VII-A at Moosburg, Germany. Over 130,000 Allied soldiers were imprisoned there. It was liberated by the U.S. 14th Armored Division following a short battle with SS soldiers of the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division on 29 April 1945. Stalag III-C is notable for the escape of US paratrooper Joseph Beyrle, who subsequently joined a Soviet tank battalion commanded by Aleksandra Samusenko, which returned to liberate the camp. In popular culture The airmen in the show Hogan's Heroes were imprisoned in fictitious \\"Luft Stalag 13\\" near Hammelburg. The World War II play Stalag 17, which was made into the 1953 movie Stalag 17, was set in Stalag XVII-B, located near Krems, Austria. The movie Hart's War was set in Stalag VI-A, near Hemer/Iserlohn in Military District VI. In Israel of the 1950s‚Äì1960s, \\"stalag\\" was a generic term for pornographic material with a theme of sadistic sexual activity between female SS officers and prisoners of war. In 2007, Ari Libsker made a film on this topic, entitled Stalags. In 1993, the British TV movie Stalag Luft, starring Stephen Fry, featured a prisoner of war camp in which the German guards have abandoned the prisoners.

They are found in the rivers, lakes and swamps of New Zealand, to which they are endemic. Kokopu are galaxiids and like others members of that family lacks scales and has a thick, leathery skin covered with mucus. Kokopu inhabit streams with plenty of cover (e.g. logs and overhanging boulders) but can also be found in swamps and larger waterways. They mostly feed on invertebrates that live in the stream beds but also eat insects that fall into the water and will move into the open at night for feeding. There are three known species of Kokopu in New Zealand: *Giant k≈çkopu, Galaxias argenteus * Banded kokopu, Galaxias fasciatus * Shortjaw kokopu, Galaxias postvectis Kokopu live for between 5 and 10 years but can reach in excess of 21 years. They spawn in leaf debris in stream beds or during spring tides and the eggs hatch about 30 days after being laid. The hatchlings are carried downstream where they spend a short period of time in the sea and return to streams after four to five months. Kokopu sprats are keenly sought by fishers as whitebait for consumption as a delicacy and are caught in fine meshed nets. Kokopu depend on the natural environment, principally in forested environments, and so have become less common as New Zealand has been cleared of much of its native forest and swampland as a result of colonisation and farming development since the late 19th century. Nevertheless, recognition of the value of biodiversity and the preservation of natural areas in National Parks and reserved conservation areas promises to maintain the species. Kokopu suffer from the introduction of trout species that were introduced into New Zealand for sport fishing purposes during the first half of the 20th century by various acclimatisation societies. Research has indicated that where trout have become established then kokopu are unlikely to be found. Nevertheless, since the kokopu, on average, is smaller in size than trout then where stream and swamp environments cannot support trout and are still in forested areas, kokopu are likely to be found.

The battle was fought near the village of »òelimbƒÉr (in Hungarian: Sellenberk) close to Sibiu (in German: Hermannstadt, in Hungarian: Nagyszeben). Background Michael the Brave marched into Transylvania to fight against the Ottomans. The neighboring rulers Andrew B√°thory in Transylvania and Ieremia MovilƒÉ in Moldavia were friendly towards Poland. In 1598, Michael signed a treaty of peace with the Ottomans, however both sides knew that the issue was far from settled. When Transylvania fell under the influence of Poland, which preserved friendly relations with the Ottomans, a hostile ring closed around Wallachia. Only the Habsburgs were prepared to ally themselves with Michael. The treaty, signed in Prague on 9 June 1598, made Wallachia a vassal state; in exchange, the emperor undertook to cover the cost of providing 5.000 mercenaries to the principality. The voivode wanted to secure a land link to his ally. With Emperor Rudolph's assent, he launched an attack on Transylvania. He informed the Sz√©kelys that he was attacking Transylvania on behalf of the Emperor Rudolf and, if they join him, their traditional freedoms will be restored. At this the Sz√©kelys joined the forces of Michael en masse so that Sz√©kelys comprised one third of his army of 36,000 soldiers. Michael entered Transylvania through BuzƒÉu Pass. Another Wallachian army corp, composed of 6,000 warriors from Oltenia, led by Radu Buzescu and the Ban Udrea, crossed the Transylvanian Alps through Turnu Ro≈üu Pass. The junction was made on October 16. The battle Michael had approximately 40,000 men at his command. Many of them did not fight, however, preferring instead to remain in the camp and protect the women and children of the boyars who had joined them in this campaign out of the fear of possible Tatar attacks in Wallachia. The army of Andrew B√°thory numbered approximately 30,000 men, but during the battle many defected to Michael's army, including the Sz√©kely Hungarians who despised the ruling B√°thory family. The Wallachians gained the upper hand at the beginning of the battle, but were pushed back quickly by the charge of the Hungarian Hussars. The Transylvanians then had the opportunity to win the battle, but Andrew B√°thory refused to commit his rearguard to battle, giving the Wallachians a chance to regroup. The resulting charge against the Transylvanian army was a success, Andrew B√°thory fled the field (only to be later assassinated), and Michael headed with his victorious army to the city of Alba Iulia (Gyulafeh√©rv√°r), as the Diet recognised him as voivode and imperial governor. Casualties were at least 1,200 to 1,500 on the Transylvanian side, and 200 to 1,000 men killed on the Wallachian side. The inhabitants of Sibiu (Hermannstadt, Nagyszeben) buried the bodies in a mass grave known today as Michael the Brave's Knoll. Aftermath Michael's victory resulted in the first instance when the principalities of Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania were united under a Romanian ruler. It has to be said, however, that the governments of Wallachia and Transylvania remained separate, and Michael never attempted to connect Transylvania to Wallachia, nor interfere in Transylvania's system of government (by the Estates). What is more he also invited some Sz√©kelys and other Transylvanian Hungarians to assist in the administration of Wallachia, where he wished to transplant Transylvania's far more advanced feudal system. Especially during the period of the Romanian national awakening, his victories were interpreted as the first unification of the Romanian people, and Michael remains a Romanian national hero.

It is the second installment in the Dino Crisis series. After the events of the previous game, unsafe research into time-distorting Third Energy has resulted in an entire research base, military institution, and fictional metropolis of Edward City to be transported to another time; along with all of its inhabitants. Secret Operations Raid Team operative Regina returns as one of the main playable characters, sent along as an adviser to the rescue team that travels through time to find survivors of the time displacement and recover data on the Third Energy experiments. Dylan Morton, the rescue team leader, is the second playable character. Despite Dylan and Regina initially going their separate ways, they end up joining forces to find a way back to the present. The player switches between controlling Regina and Dylan at specific points during the story. Gameplay Dylan firing on a Velociraptor. Dino Crisis 2 is an action-adventure game that uses predetermined camera angles. Capcom Production Studio 4 changed the series' focus from the survival horror of the first Dino Crisis by creating a more action-packed arcade-style experience that featured more open areas, greater varieties of weapons and enemies and less emphasis on puzzles. As players kill dinosaurs in succession, countering attacks and avoiding damage in areas, they can earn \\"Extinction Points\\" a form of in-game currency that tally up as player moves between locations. Throughout the game, the player can locate and use computer stations that act as a save point where players can save and load games. They can also spend Extinction Points on new weapons, upgrades, health packs and ammunition. There are also bandages (used to stem bleeding). This type of injury occurs when a player takes damage from certain attacks, and it results in slow draining of the health bar. There are two forms of weapons in the game, main and sub-weapons; the player can only equip one of each at a time. Main weapons provide the most damage and are used for the majority of attacks, for example shotguns, flamethrowers and rifles whereas sub-weapons are used to get past obstacles, like the machete for cutting plant vines and the firewall gun that creates a temporary wall of fire against foes. Over the course of the game players switch roles between Regina and Dylan, the two have different weapons, making some passages blocked for one but accessible for the other. Among the action-adventure gameplay are sections of on rails shooting, such as a chase where the player shoots at dinosaurs that are chasing an automatically driven vehicle and, like the previous game, several puzzles. Throughout the game, the player finds data files and documents that progress the story and give details of certain areas. Hidden \\"Dino Files\\" can also be found; these go into detail about each dinosaur in the game. Upon collecting all the available Dino Files, the player is granted unlimited ammunition for weapons on the next play through. =Extra Crisis= Upon completion of the main game, there is an unlockable mode known as Extra Crisis with two gameplay modes: \\"Dino Colosseum\\" and \\"Dino Duel\\". Colosseum is a survival mode where a chosen character with their own pre-set weapons fight off series of attacks by certain dinosaurs, the larger and more deadly being the latter. Upon completion the player is graded and awarded a trophy on how well they performed. Dino Duel is a mode that allows the player to take control of a dinosaur and battle another in the style of a fighting game. Completion of the game on harder difficulties allows more characters and dinosaurs to become available for purchase, using the final Extinction Points gathered from that play through. These include Gail and Rick, two characters from the first game. Dinosaurs can also be used in Dino Colosseum, however, they must be unlocked by completing the game in normal or hard mode. Characters *Regina (Stephanie Morgenstern) - A member of Secret Operations Raid Team (SORT), Regina is the only returning character from Dino Crisis that features in the main story. She is extremely intelligent, and is skeptical of Dylan's abilities at the outset, calling him \\"Mr. Barbarian,\\" before going it alone. *Dylan Morton (Gabriel Hogan) - Part of the Tactical Reconnaissance and Acquisition Team (TRAT), an off-record covert group of shady characters recruited from the United States Army Special Forces. They focus on subversive activities, e.g. jailbreaks and insurgency. *Paula Morton (Lisa Yamanaka) - A recurring character. This teenage girl is part of a helmeted syndicate that is hostile towards Regina and Dylan. She appears childlike and is unable to form complete sentences. Paula shares a special connection with Dylan. *David Fork (Eric Hempsall) - Another prominent TRAT member, David is a heavy weapons specialist and Dylan's friend. He is separated from the others during the opening cinematic. David is boastful, loyal, and can fly a helicopter. *Colonel Dylan Morton - Appearing as a hologram at the end of the game, Colonel Morton plays an important role in the story. He reveals the truth about the helmeted attackers and what went wrong with the experiment. Plot On May 10, 2010, the United States Army's TRAT unit is deployed to investigate the disappearance of Edward City and its surrounding countryside. Their mission: Travel through the Time Gate, locate 1300 survivors and collect data remnants on the Third Energy Project. Intelligence operative Regina is brought along as an adviser due to her past experiences. During insertion, the team's camp is attacked by a pack of Velociraptor, leaving Lieutenant Dylan Morton, Regina and TRAT operative David as the only survivors. The velociraptors flee when a Tyrannosaurus rex attacks the group. David damages the tyrannosaur's eye with a rocket-propelled grenade to ensure Dylan and Regina's escape. Regina returns to the transport ship while Dylan heads into the jungle, spotting a mysterious helmeted figure while investigating a military facility. Upon arrival, he is confronted by the wounded T. rex. While escaping to the barracks, he is shot at by helmeted attackers. Later, he attempts to retrieve a key card, triggering a security alert that imprisons him. Regina receives Dylan's distress call and rescues him. While rescuing Dylan, Regina captures one of the mysterious attackers, a blonde teenage girl who is unable to speak. When they return to their ship, they find the engine room ransacked, stranding the heroes in the past, while the teenage girl exhibits a familiar connection to Dylan. At the Research Facility, Dylan discovers human containment chambers and a starter battery for the ship in order to get it mobile. Dylan returns to find the girl has escaped, and theorizes that the helmeted attackers could be from a different time period. They use the repaired ship to reach the offshore Third Energy facility. Regina uses a diving suit at the facility to investigate the underwater reactor. Once topside, she and Dylan receive a distress call from David, who has found survivors at Edward City. However, Dylan and Regina arrive too late. Upon splitting up, Dylan engages the T. rex with a tank before being jumped by another helmeted figure. The blonde girl saves Dylan and runs away. Deciding they have no business at Edward City anymore, Regina heads to a missile silo in the jungle. Regina discovers the Third Energy data at the silo, but is confronted by the Tyrannosaurus. Her savior is a Giganotosaurus that kills it. The Gigantosaurus follows Regina inside the missile silo, causing damage that triggers a countdown to launch. Regina ignites gas vents to incinerate the Giganotosaurus's head, rendering it comatose. Regina stops the countdown, but the beast awakens and smashes the missile to the ground, destroying the base. While evacuating Regina, Dylan is attacked and injured by an Allosaurus. In order to save him, David sacrifices himself by throwing Dylan into the river before getting eaten. Dylan arrives at another research facility and encounters the blonde-haired girl. Inside, she plays a hologram recording of an elderly Dylan from 2055 and learns the origins of the disaster. The overload in 2009 caused time alterations to the Cretaceous Era, affected earth's history dramatically, creating an alternate timeline where humanity did not exist. To fix this, an international organization enacted the \\"Noah's Ark Plan\\": utilizing the Timegate technology, they would transport the living organisms of the Cretaceous to a different time period, three million years in the future, with similar environments, where they could thrive unaffected by the alterations. With the distortions prevented, the organisms would then be returned to their original time period. However, when the Noah's Ark team attempted to return, the gate overloaded and was destroyed, stranding both the dinosaurs and humans in the future. The helmeted attackers are revealed to be the only remaining children of the survivors, who were brought to the safety of a facility and placed in special life support chambers for growth and learning. The side-effects of the chambers cost the children's ability to speak and allowed them to co-exist with the dinosaurs, attacking anyone who threatened them. Dylan also learns at this point that the blonde girl is his future daughter, Paula. The hologram instructs Dylan there is a basic gate they can use to go home, but it will work only once, asking Dylan take Paula with him. The facility's self destruct system is activated by the sole surviving helmeted figure, causing the Giganotosaurus to appear. The helmeted figure is killed, while Dylan incinerates the Giganotosaurus with an orbital laser. While attempting to evacuate with Regina, an earth tremor leaves Paula trapped by falling equipment. Unable to free her and with the building ready to explode, Dylan stays with his daughter, telling Regina to return home with the Third Energy data and save them at an earlier time period. Reception Dino Crisis 2 was met with Mostly positive reviews, with an average score of 80.70% based on 22 reviews for the PlayStation version and an average score of 57.33% based on 3 reviews for the PC version at GameRankings and an 86/100 based on 13 reviews for the PlayStation version at Metacritic. In their review, GameSpot commented that the first Dino Crisis was as if Capcom \\"replaced the zombies with carnivorous dinosaurs\\" for a Resident Evil spin-off. However, they found Dino Crisis 2 \\"an original, enjoyable experience that can no longer be considered just another entry into the survival-horror genre\\", as it \\"avoids the stereotypes of the genre and delivers one of the most refreshing takes on the action-adventure genre to date.\\" IGN concurred that the game had been \\"stripped of its slow-paced Resident Evil shell and its haunting, creepy shockeroo tricks\\". They had even more praise for the game: \\"the creatures and the design are both excellent, and the jungle backgrounds, and especially the underwater environments, are simply top-notch.\\" GamePro's review commented that, \\"Sound is solid, with an unobtrusive musical score that blends well with gaming effects, i.e. the telltale rustle of foliage preceding a raptor's leap for your throat isn't drowned out by J-pop.\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer gave the game four stars out of five, stating that, \\"overall, Dino Crisis 2 is a fantastic sequel that delivers more adrenaline-pumping action, beautiful scenery and a hearty dose of terror.\\" However, the newspaper added that \\"tasks such as running around looking for keys can be tedious. And some of the action portions of the game can get repetitive, too.\\" Game Revolution felt the \\"arcade-like\\" gameplay \\"detracts a bit from the whole survival-horror theme\\". They also noted that \\"the back and forth gameplay gets tired after a while,\\" and that it can be \\"very easy to get distracted from the storyline and get sucked into the process of amassing an arsenal.\\" Greg Orlando reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Beautiful graphics, solid control, and furious action still can't overcome the dull protagonists and severely foreshortened running time.\\" Like its predecessor, Dino Crisis 2 was a commercial success, with the PlayStation version selling 1.19 million copies worldwide. Capcom would later re-release the game for PC, and bring it to PlayStation Network in the US and Japan.

During his tenure, he presided over the IDF withdrawal in Lebanon in 1985 and oversaw the redeployment of Israeli troops and the creation of the security zone in South Lebanon. Levy helped to found the IDF ground forces branch. He created two new brigades: the Nahal and Givati brigades.Former IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Levy hospitalized Yediot Ahronoth, 1 January 2008 While serving as Chief of Staff and after retiring from the army, Levy lived on Kibbutz Beit Alfa in northern Israel. In his last years, he was the founding chairperson of the supervisory board of Highway 6, also known as the Trans-Israel Highway. Levy was married twice and was survived by five children and five grandchildren. On January 1, 2008, Levy suffered a massive stroke, his second, and died eight days later of a brain aneurysm at HaEmek Medical Center in Afula. He was buried Wednesday in Kibbutz Beit Alpha, with eight generals carrying his body, top government officials, and hundreds who knew and worked with him in attendance.

It was the first publication about body piercing. Ward pioneered the field of body piercing and operated The Gauntlet, which was the first commercial establishment to offer the service in the United States. History and profile The first issue of the magazine appeared in October 1977. The first 14 issues of PFIQ were in black and white with single-color highlights in a few issues. From issue #15 on, the covers and centerfolds were in full color. The first issue was 16 pages long; by issue #31, PFIQ had grown to 32 pages. Page count continued to gradually increase. Issue #50, the final issue, contained 64 pages. All issues were 8¬Ω√ó11\\" in size. Only the first five issues were dated on the cover, though most of them included a copyright year. However, every issue was independently numbered. In spite of calling itself a quarterly, the publication was chronically late and the average number of issues per year, over the lifetime of PFIQ, was about 3. Issues #1 and #3 were reprinted in the 1980s. The reprints are not hard to distinguish from the originals. The original issue #1 was black and white with two spot colors; the reprint has only the purple on the cover. Issue #3 was a complete redesign and bears the words \\"Revised Edition\\" on the cover. Tattoo Samy appeared in PFIQ #18 (1983) and #19 as the magazine‚Äôs first documented tongue piercing. PFIQ contained a wide variety of material, mostly about body piercing, but occasionally about other forms of body art and body modification. A long series of articles by Jim Ward, \\"Pierce with a Pro,\\" gave detailed information on how to perform many different piercings. Gauntlet also produced three \\"how- to\\" videos under the same title. Part 1 on male piercings appeared in 1988; part 2 covering female and unisex piercings was issued in 1994; part 3, an update of the first video came out in 1996. The magazine contents also included interviews, accounts of piercings, letters from readers, book and video reviews, photographs, artwork, and fiction. PFIQ also contained advertising from a few businesses in closely related fields. Subscribers also received Pin Pals, a sheet of classified ads created to enable people with body piercings to meet each other.  Reception  PFIQ was a controversial publication, due to its graphic portrayal of nudity and the piercing process. In some countries it was considered obscene, and confiscated by postal customs officials. It ceased publication in 1997 when Jim Ward sold Gauntlet. (Gauntlet failed under its new owner and closed in 1998.)

In plug flow, the velocity of the fluid is assumed to be constant across any cross-section of the pipe perpendicular to the axis of the pipe. The plug flow model assumes there is no boundary layer adjacent to the inner wall of the pipe. The plug flow model has many practical applications. One example is in the design of chemical reactors. Essentially no back mixing is assumed with \\"plugs\\" of fluid passing through the reactor. This results in differential equations that need to be integrated to find the reactor conversion and outlet temperatures. Other simplifications used are perfect radial mixing and a homogeneous bed structure. An advantage of the plug flow model is that no part of the solution of the problem can be perpetuated \\"upstream\\". This allows one to calculate the exact solution to the differential equation knowing only the initial conditions. No further iteration is required. Each \\"plug\\" can be solved independently provided the previous plug's state is known. :Image:Plugflow.jpg The flow model in which the velocity profile consists of the fully developed boundary layer is known as pipe flow. In laminar pipe flow, the velocity profile is parabolic.  Determination  For flows in pipes, if flow is turbulent then the laminar sublayer caused by the pipe wall is so thin that it is negligible.

It is native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa, like Drosera capensis, the cape sundew, and is one of the most common sundews in cultivation. The plant forms small, tight rosettes of wedge-shaped leaves, up to 5 cm in diameter. Under conditions of good lighting, the insect-snagging tentacles will become deeply coloured with anthocyanin pigments, which probably aid in its attraction of insect prey. The plant is relatively easy to grow, and produces attractive scapes of pink flowers, which are held about 30 cm away from the carnivorous leaves, so as to prevent pollinators from becoming ensnared. D. aliciae is very similar in form to a number of other closely related species such as D. slackii, and D. dielsiana: the former is rather larger (8 cm diameter); the latter rather smaller (3 cm diameter).

Because of its size, easy to grow nature, and the copious amounts of seed it produces, it has become one of the most common sundews in cultivation, and thus, one of the most frequently introduced and naturalised invasive Drosera species. Description Drosera capensis 'Alba' D. capensis produces strap-like leaves, up to long (not including the petiole) and wide,Slack, Adrian. 2000. Carnivorous Plants. Revised edition. MIT Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts. pp. 136. which, as in all sundews, are covered in brightly coloured tentacles which secrete a sticky mucilage that traps arthropods. It is a perennial, herbaceous plant that forms a rosette with a diameter of 18 to 25 cm and is characterized by numerous, reddish glandular erosions on 7 cm long and 5 mm wide, elongated leaves. The plant flowers in summer (December and January in its native habitat in South Africa) with up to 50 pale-violet, more than 2 cm large flowers sitting on up to 35 cm high racemose inflorescences. The flowers can self-pollinate upon closing and produce copious quantities of very small, spindle-shaped seeds, which are released from the capsules that form when the flowers have died. The plant thrives in full sun locations on nutrient-poor, waterlogged and lime-free soils. Prey catching 260px When insects are first trapped, the leaves roll lengthwise by thigmotropism toward the center. This aids digestion by bringing more digestive glands in contact with the prey. The plant leaf surrounds the prey within an hour while tentacles continue to move to further trap the prey. Digestion takes well over 6 hours after a prey's original ensnarement. The plant has a tendency to retain the dead leaves of previous seasons, and the main stem of the plant can become quite long and woody with time. The plant captures their prey by luring it through the dazzling digestive secretions produced on the tentacles of the leaves. The secretion acts on the one hand as a visual signal, as it shines in the sun and shines through the red tentacle tip, on the other hand, it is also a chemical attractant that attracts insects. If a victim has been caught in the secretion of the tentacles, then all the tentacles near the victim align themselves on this, until at some point the whole leaf has wrapped around the animal. With the help of the digestive secretions the insect is now decomposed until only the chitin armor remains. The absorption of nutrients takes place via the red tentacle tips, where the secretion itself is produced. If the victim is decomposed enough that the plant can not gain further nutrients, the leaf and the tentacles return to their original position.Pavloviƒç1 A Krausko million Libiakov√° Adamec M & L (2013) Feeding is prey Increases photosynthetic efficiency in the carnivorous sundew Drosera capensis ; Oxford Journals / Life Sciences / Annals of Botany, Volume 113, n o 1, p. 69-78 A fly 12 hours into being trapped by a cape sundew. The sundew secretes mucin to trap prey items ‚Äì often insects and arthropods. The mucin is approximately 4% of an acidic polysaccharide in an aqueous solution with a pH of approximately 4. Fresh mucin can be stretched up to a meter in length thread. The mucin secretions of Drosera capensis has a high viscosity - this suggests that the mucin contains a predominant composition of acidic polysaccharide that interact extensively and are highly hydrated. Drosera capensis has two color forms; red and white. When fruit flies were introduced to the two differently colored plants, there was no difference between the means of the flies captured. Fruit flies seemed to have no preference over the color of the plant. Increased photosynthesis was observed when fed with fruit flies. Previously, it has been hypothesized that plant coloration has been used to attract prey items along with olfactory signals. This hypothesis has been disproven in Drosera capensis white and red forms as coloration is due to anthocyanin - or the lack of ‚Äì and does not affect the UV coloration of the plant which, along with olfactory signals, attracts prey items. Reproduction In early summer or late spring, D. capensis produces multiple, small, five-petaled pink flowers at the end of scapes which can be up to tall. Flowers individually open in the morning and close by mid afternoon, lasting just one day each with the next one up the scape opening the following day; the lower ones on the scape can thus be open or \\"past\\" while the ones at the top are still forming. Under horticultural conditions, carnivorous plant enthusiasts find that these seeds have a tendency to find their way into neighbouring plant pots where they germinate readily, giving D. capensis a reputation as a weed. Cultivation Drosera capensis uses its sticky tentacles to attract and catch flies and other insects. Contact triggers a curling reaction, where the plant wraps up its prey and eventually digests and absorbs the victim's nutrients. This scene is about 4 hours in real-time. Inflorescence of Drosera capensis Drosera capensis has several forms or varieties, including the \\"typical\\", \\"wide-leaved\\", \\"narrow-leaved\\" and \\"red\\" forms and the cultivar Drosera 'Albino'.Cape Sundews, \\"The Savage Garden: Cultivating Carnivorous Plants\\", Peter D'Amato, 1998 The typical form is noted for wider leaves and the gradual production of a scrambling stem as it grows. The \\"wide-leaved\\" form is similar to the \\"typical\\" variety, but produces leaves at least 50% wider than the typical variety. The narrow-leaved form differs from the typical form in that it rarely produces tall stems; has thinner, longer leaves and less hair on the plant. Drosera capensis 'Albino', is also similar in shape to the \\"typical\\" form, but lacks most of the red pigmentation of the typical or narrow forms, with clear or pink trichomes and white flowers. There is also the \\"red\\" form that turns blood red in full sunlight, and is also similar physically to the narrow-leaved form. These varieties are commercially available. Drosera capensis \\"narrow-leaved\\" has won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Drosera capensis can be easily propagated through a variety of methods including seed, leaf cuttings, and root cuttings. It is not easily killed by temperature extremes of a short duration, and is generally a forgiving plant to grow. Additionally, D. capensis does not undergo dormancy like some sundews. It is among the easiest of carnivorous plants to keep indoors. It grows very well in open air, on a sunny windowsill, as long as it is kept in an inch or two of mineral-free water. It does not require a terrarium although it can benefit from one. The ideal substrate is composed of 70% of blonde peat and 30% of non-calcareous sand. The ideal temperature varies between 5 and 15 ¬∞C in winter and between 20 and 40 ¬∞C in summer, for a hygrometry of 40 to 80%. Moist soil must be maintained year-round by the presence of a saucer under the pot, but watering must be reduced and the saucer removed in winter. High ambient humidity allows the preservation of mucilage. An exposure in full sun suits it perfectly, although a place a little less sunny may be suitable. Invasive species Drosera capensis is listed on the New Zealand National Pest Plant Accord due to it being classified as an invasive species in that country, where they cannot be bought at plant retailers and should not be traded by carnivorous plant partisans. They have been planted in the wild or unintentionally introduced through soil contaminated by seeds with plantings of pitcher plants and water lilies. They are now beginning to spread on their own, potentially with help from water birds.Carnivorous weeds in Auckland Drosera capensis have also been found in Australia. Currently it has only been found in New South Wales but understanding the species distribution is essential to managing the species in the future. It has also been found in the state of California and classified as a naturalized weed. Alongside Australia, California and New Zealand, Drosera capensis have also been found in peat bogs in South America. It is currently classified as an invasive species.

Calumet is located in the heart of the Bluegrass, a well-known horse breeding region. Calumet Farm has a record history of Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown winners and throughout its history of over 87 years, it has produced some of the greatest Thoroughbred horses of all time. History Though Calumet was initially based in Libertyville, Illinois, the more favorable climate of Kentucky made it a better place for a horse farm and led to W. M. Wright acquiring the land and relocating his Standardbred breeding operation. At a time in American history when harness racing was the most popular type of horse racing, in 1931 the farm's trotter \\"Calumet Butler\\" won the most prestigious event of the day, the Hambletonian. Following the death of W. M. Wright, in 1932 his son Warren Wright, Sr. took over the business and began converting it to Thoroughbred breeding and training. His acquisition of quality breeding stock saw Calumet Farm develop into one of North America's most successful stables in Thoroughbred racing history. Calumet Farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. The Pennsylvania Railroad named its baggage car #5868 the \\"Calumet Farm\\".June 27, 1948 Milwaukee Journal article on Calumet Farm The farm's breeding success was notably anchored by a part ownership in Blenheim, a stallion imported from England, and its Foundation Sire, Bull Lea. Calumet Farm has produced eight Kentucky Derby winners, more than any other operation in U.S. racing history. As well, Calumet Farm is both the leading breeder and owner of Preakness Stakes winners with seven each. From the farm's many great foals, two colts also won the U.S. Triple Crown and three females won the Triple Crown for fillies. Under Warren Wright, Sr. and his wife Lucille Parker Wright who inherited the property on his death in 1950, Calumet was the number one money-earning farm in racing for twelve years. Among the farm's best-known horses are Nellie Flag, Armed, Two Lea, Mar-Kell, A Gleam, Twilight Tear, Mark-Ye-Well, A Glitter, Bewitch, Coaltown, Real Delight, Bardstown, Our Mims, Davona Dale, Alydar, and Before Dawn. Gate at Calumet Farm The names of the Calumet Farm official winners of the Kentucky Derby, and the years they won, are: Whirlaway (1941), Pensive (1944), Citation (1948), Ponder (sired by Pensive - 1949), Hill Gail (1952), Iron Liege (1957), Tim Tam (1958), Forward Pass (1968 by DQ). Two of these greats, (Whirlaway (1941) and Citation (1948)) are the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing champions. In all, the farm produced eleven horses that have been inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Lucille Wright died in 1982 and according to the terms of her husband's will, the farm went to the heirs of their only child Warren Wright, Jr. (1920‚Äì1978). Son-in-law John Thomas Lundy (J.T.), married to Lucille \\"Cindy\\" Wright, took over as head of operations and president. Calumet Farm won the 1990 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder. In November of that year, details surrounding the death of 15-year-old Alydar - America's leading sire of the time - and the collection of a $36 million insurance policy brought a cloud of suspicion over the business. Under Calumet president J.T. Lundy, mismanagement and fraud had left the farm with a massive debt load that led Calumet Farms to file for bankruptcy protection in 1991 as they were losing one million dollars a month. After years of legal proceedings, in 2000, J.T. Lundy along with Gary Matthews, the farm's former attorney and chief financial officer, were convicted of fraud and bribery and sent to prison.June 2001 Texas Monthly article titled The Killing of Alydar by Skip Hollandsworth In 1992, a trust established by Henryk de Kwiatkowski, a Polish-born Canadian citizen, purchased Calumet Farm, saving it from possible liquidation. Since 1992, the farm has been fully restored to its former beauty. In 2012, the Calumet Investment Group bought Calumet Farm from the de Kwiatkowski Trust for over $36 million. Calumet Investment Group in turn leased it to Brad M. Kelley, believed to be a member of the investment group. Kelley's horses race under the name of Calumet Farm, but they carry Kelley's black and gold racing colors, as the original \\"Devil's Red and Blue\\" silks of Calumet had been sold to a Brazilian investment group. The win of Oxbow in the 2013 Preakness Stakes marked the return of Calumet to the winner's circle of a Triple Crown race for the first time since 1968.

Biography  She was born Sofia Petrovna Soymonova (sometimes So√Ømonov or Soymanof) on 22 November 1782 in Moscow, the daughter of Secretary of State Peter Alexandrovich Soimonov (1734‚Äì1801) and his wife, Catherine Boltin (1756‚Äì1790). She spent her early years at the court of Empress Catherine the Great, as her father was one of the empress's closest advisors. She was given a good education, learned to speak several European languages and was popular at court. In 1797, she was made lady-in-waiting to Empress Maria Fedorovna. In 1799, Sophie married General Nicholas Sergeyevich Swetchine. Even though he was his wife's senior by 25 years, their relationship was described by contemporaries as a good one, though the couple did not have children, which is said to have caused her suffering. It was perhaps also in part the reason for her turning to religion, which was to play a great part in her life. Coming from Russian Orthodoxy, in 1815 she became a Catholic, largely as the result of reading the writings of Joseph de Maistre, though she had also been under the influence of the Jesuits. Russian law did not permit members of the Russian nobility who had converted from the Orthodox religion to continue living in Russia, and so Sophie was forced to live in exile, choosing Paris as her new home. There she settled with her husband the following year and there she was to spend the rest of her life. From 1826 until her death in 1856, she kept a salon at number 71, Rue Saint-Dominique. It became famous and was considered remarkable for its high level of courtesy and for its intellectual level. At it she often received Russian exiles, but her guests, who included Victor Cousin and Alexis de Tocqueville, were generally drawn from various sectors of French literary, political and ecclesiastical high society, but with a special interest in the Church. Hence among her guests were prominent Catholics such as the Archbishop of Paris, Hyacinthe-Louis de Qu√©len, the abb√© F√©lix Dupanloup, later Bishop of Orleans, and Prosper Gu√©ranger, the founder of the Abbey of Solesmes. A prominent note was what has been spoken of as liberal Catholicism, and she accorded a particularly warm welcome to Charles de Montalembert, Armand de Melun, Augustin Cochin and especially Alfred de Falloux and Henri Lacordaire, who was to refound the Dominican Order in France. With the latter two she maintained a close lifelong friendship. Through her many contacts, she is regarded as having exercised an influence on French Catholicism.  Works  Her Life and Works (the best known of the latter being \\"Old Age\\" and \\"Resignation\\") were published by her friend Falloux (2 vols, 1860), as were her Letters (2 vols., 1861).  Quotes  Madame Swetchine is noted for the quotation: \\"How easy to be amiable in the midst of happiness and success.\\" She was reported to have said that \\"Travel is the frivolous part of serious lives and the serious part of frivolous lives.\\"  References  * Sainte-Beuve, Nouveaux lundis, vol. i. * E Scherer, Etudes sur la litt√©rature contemporaine, vol. i. * ** Maturin M Ballou, \\"Travels Under the Southern Cross\\" Houghton Mifflin, NY, 1894 * File:http://www.tocqueville.culture.fr/en/portraits/p_amis-swetchine.html  External links  * Category:1782 births Category:1857 deaths Category:19th- century Russian people Category:19th-century Christian mystics Category:Roman Catholic mystics Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy Category:Former Russian Orthodox Christians Category:Russian Roman Catholics Category:Imperial Russian Roman Catholics Category:Russian ladies-in-waiting Category:Russian salon-holders ","title":"Sophie Swetchine"},{"id":"1924362","title":"Lujo Tonƒçiƒá-Sorinj"},{"id":"1924377","text":"Eduard Bass, born Eduard Schmidt, (1 January 1888, in Prague ‚Äì 2 October 1946, in Prague) was a Czech prose writer, journalist, singer, and actor.

The stadium served as the main stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as being the venue for track and field events at the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Japan national football team's home matches and major football club cup finals were held at the stadium. The stadium's official capacity was 57,363, but the seating capacity was only 48,000 seats. Demolition was completed in May 2015, and the site will be redeveloped with a new larger- capacity Olympic Stadium. The new stadium is set to be the main venue for the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. The original plans for the new stadium were scrapped in July 2015 by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, who announced a rebid after a public outcry because of increased building costs. As a result, the new design was not ready for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, as originally intended. A new design created by architect Kengo Kuma was chosen in December 2015 to replace the original design and was completed in November 2019. History The stadium was completed in 1958 as the Japanese National Stadium on the site of the former Meiji Shrine Outer Park Stadium. Its first major event was the 1958 Asian Games. The venue was unscathed by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. Yasuhiro Nakamori, international relations director for the Japanese Olympic Committee, told Around the Rings he attributed the lack of damage to Japan's stringent building codes. The National Stadium has also held a few number of music concerts in the past: The Three Tenors (Luciano Pavarotti, Pl√°cido Domingo, and Jose Carreras) in 1996, SMAP in 2005, Dreams Come True in 2007, Arashi (15 concerts between 2008 and 2013), L'Arc-en-Ciel in 2012, Momoiro Clover Z in 2014, AKB48 in 2014, and finally, the Joint concert \\"Sayonara National Stadium Final Week Japan Night\\" on May 28 & 29, 2014, which served as final goodbye to the stadium before being demolished, with artists such as Ikimono-gakari, Gospellers, Sukima Switch, Naoto Inti Raymi, Funky Kato, Sekai no Owari, Perfume, Man with a Mission, L'Arc-en-Ciel, among others.

The band's lineup is front man Schuylar Croom, guitarist Adam Tanbouz, bassist Matt Williams, and drummer Jesse Shelley.  History  =Formation and beginnings= The band's roots reach back into the late 1990s when Adam Tanbouz, Steven Bache, Matt Williams, and vocalist Schuylar Croom began writing and performing around Wilmington, NC while still in high school. In 2003, having previously played under the names of Stronghold, No One Wins, and The Uriah Omen, the name He Is Legend was adopted by members Tanbouz, Bache, Bell, Croom, and Williams. The name He Is Legend is an adaptation of the 1954 book I am Legend by Richard Matheson. After releasing their first EP in June 2004 entitled 91025, the band signed on with Solid State Records and released their first full-length album in November, I Am Hollywood, which was followed by almost two years of extensive touring in the United States and Europe, the band temporarily relocated to California to record their next release. However, the release almost never saw the light of day as the group would almost break up right after they had finished recording. Suck Out the Poison was released on October 3, 2006. =Departure of McKenzie Bell, Mitchell Marlow, and Worth Weaver= Soon after the release of Suck Out the Poison, guitarist McKenzie Bell left the band. He was replaced by guitarist Mitch Marlow (previously of Classic Case). During their tour with Chimaira, DragonForce, and Killswitch Engage in spring of 2007, the first few weeks were played as a 4-piece without Marlow. During the Peanut Butt Tour '07, a different second guitarist, Worth Weaver, was seen playing in Marlow's spot. At their show at the School of Rock in New Jersey, Bache stated that Marlow had accidentally booked himself to produce a record for another band back in North Carolina. The dates of recording coincided with much of the tour, so he was not able to tour with the band. Worth stepped in and was, by the account of Bache, excellent in his performance. At their final show before beginning their tour in Australia, Marlow performed with the band, confirming that at the time he was still a member of He Is Legend. The band's performances throughout the 2009 SXSW festival featured them as a four-piece once again. After a Plano, Texas performance on March 17, Tanbouz stated that Weaver, not performing with the band that evening, is planning on getting married soon and he would be focusing more on his solo musical career with his personal studio and music. Worth Weaver had begun standing in on the 2007 \\"Peanut Butt Tour\\" with the band. =It Hates You (2008‚Äì2009)= According to a recent blog, He Is Legend announced that they will be taking a musical sabbatical in the forest surrounding North Carolina recording studio, Warrior Sound Studio. The blog continues, saying that the material written during this hiatus will be used to create a record \\"literally made of solid gold (figuratively speaking).\\" On April 24, 2008, He Is Legend posted four demo songs from their sabbatical, entitled \\"Decisions Decisions Decisions\\", \\"Stranger Danger\\", \\"Don't Touch That Dial\\", and \\"Everyone I Know Has Fangs\\" from the upcoming record. On April 16, 2009, the band confirmed that their newest album, It Hates You was being released through Tragic Hero records on July 21, 2009. (Originally set to be released on June 23). On May 27, 2009, the band posted \\"The Primarily Blues\\" and in early July \\"China White III\\", and \\"Future's Bright, Man\\" on their Myspace. It Hates You was released on July 21, 2009 and produced by Mitchell Marlow and Allen Jacob at Warrior Sound in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, with additional production by Kit Walters. =Hiatus and new projects= In September 2009, it was announced that He Is Legend is taking an \\"indefinite hiatus,\\" although the band itself made no public announcement of their hiatus. From September 2009 until February 2010, frontman Schuylar Croom filled in on vocals for Dallas Taylor with Maylene and the Sons of Disaster. =Reunion= On December 29, 2010, the band did a reunion show in Wilmington, NC. On October 16, 2011, it was announced that He Is Legend will be playing their first show since taking an indefinite hiatus in 2009. The show took place on October 31, 2011, at the Satellite Bar and Lounge in Wilmington, North Carolina. On December 22, 2011, frontman Schuylar Croom announced that there would be a new He Is Legend album released in 2012. In January 2012 the band played two more shows in the North Carolina area, and in March, the band embarked on a 3-date tour of the east coast, playing in Baltimore, Maryland, Jermyn, Pennsylvania, and New York City. The band toured once more throughout November-December 2012, but no other news regarding the promised new album were announced. =Heavy Fruit (2013‚Äì2015)= On June 1, 2013, He Is Legend stated on their Facebook page, that Steve Bache had left the band, on good terms, after moving to a new city to pursue a higher education which would allow him a career in life. They compared finding a new drummer to \\"trying to find a kick ass drumming needle in a hay stack.\\" Luckily, they came upon an acquaintance, Sam Huff, whom had previously played in a band with friends of theirs. He Is Legend stated that \\"within 15 minutes of rehearsing one of our newer ideas with Sam we realized that he was the perfect person for the position.\\" On July 14, 2013, the band announced 6 new tour dates, and stated it will be the band's last tour before entering the studio to record their fourth album. On August 27, 2013, it was announced that He Is Legend had officially begun working on their fourth studio album, with producer Mitch Marlow (Filter, A Skylit Drive), who was also the band's former rhythm guitarist. In September, the band announced a full US tour for October- November 2013, while taking a break from recording the album. On January 29, 2014, the band announced new material via Twitter with the following statement, \\"Dudes and dude babes, we will be premiering our first song from our new album on Friday. Spread the word.\\" The band's new single, \\"Something Witchy\\", premiered on February 2, 2014, on YouTube. On February 19, 2014, the band announced on their official Facebook page that they had finished recording their new album. Though no release date was announced, it will be released through Tragic Hero Records. On June 10, 2014, the band announced on their official Facebook page that they will be touring North America with Maylene and the Sons of Disaster and Wilson. The band also announced August 23, 2014 as the release party for their new album at Ziggy's By The Sea in Wilmington, NC. On June 17, 2014, He Is Legend announced on their official Facebook page that their new album, entitled Heavy Fruit, will be released August 19, 2014. They also premiered a new single, \\"Miserable Company.\\" =Few (2015‚Äì2018)= On November 2, 2015, He Is Legend announced on their official Facebook page that they are launching a crowdfunding campaign to fund their upcoming record. The crowdfunding proved successful, closing on December 2, 2015, having raised 124% of the stated goal, recording of the album would begin soon thereafter. On March 28, 2017, He Is Legend premiered the music video for \\"Air Raid\\" on Loudwire =White Bat (2019)= On October 31, 2018, He Is Legend released the single \\"White Bat\\". Schuylar Croom wrote, \\"We are so stoked to finally be able to let you know we have a new record coming next year. Stay tuned for Preorder info... But for now enjoy the first single and title track White Bat\\". On April 25, 2019, the band revealed the track listing for White Bat, along with the second single \\"Boogiewoman\\".

He also was the son-in-law of Benjamin Franklin. Early life Bache was born on September 12, 1737 in Settle, North Yorkshire, the youngest child of William Bache, a tax collector, and Mary (n√©e Blechynden) Bache, who were married around 1720. His older brother was Theophylact Bache, who married Ann Dorothea Barclay (a daughter of Andrew Barclay and Helena (n√©e Roosevelt) Barclay). In 1751, his elder brother Theophylact arrived in New York City, where he was taken under the wing of Paul Richard, a successful merchant and former mayor, whose wife was a Bache relative. Career Bache immigrated as a young man in 1760 to New York to join his brother Theophylact in a dry goods and marine insurance business. After a couple of years, he went to Philadelphia, where he prospered for several years. He was among nearly 30 young men who in October 1766 met at the city's London Coffee House to found the Gloucester Fox Hunting Club (GFHC), the first in America, to take up a pursuit closely associated with becoming \\"true Englishmen.\\"Doreen Skala, \\"Fox Hunting and Anglicization in Eighteenth- Century Philadelphia\\", in Locating the English Diaspora, 1500‚Äì2010, edited by Tanja Bueltmann, Liverpool University Press, 2012, pp. 61‚Äì62, accessed 5 November 2012 In 1767, Bache suffered financial problems when debts contracted by him were repudiated by his London associate, Edward Green. =Later years= During the American Revolution, Bache served on the Board of War, which was a special standing committee to oversee the Continental Army's administration and to make recommendations regarding the army to Congress. His wife, Sally, was widely known for her patriotism and charitable activities. Franklin later arranged an appointment for Bache as the US Postmaster General (1776‚Äì1782), to succeed him. After Franklin's death in 1790, Bache and Sally lived off her inheritance from Franklin, moving their family to the Vandegrift residence in 1794, along the Delaware River north of Philadelphia. Personal life Bache's wife, Sarah Franklin, painted by John Hoppner (1793) Bache's eldest son, Benjamin Franklin Bache. In 1767, Bache had proposed to Sarah Franklin (1743‚Äì1808), known as Sally, the only daughter of Benjamin Franklin and Deborah Read. They objected, given his precarious finances and rumors that Bache was a fortune hunter. Although Franklin and his wife Deborah Read never formally approved, they acquiesced to the marriage in 1767. Bache and Sally had eight children together, including: * Benjamin Franklin Bache (1769‚Äì1798), who became a journalist and publisher, founding a newspaper.

Released in 1997 with original members Chuck Billy (Vocals) and Eric Peterson (Guitar), the record also features artists Derrick Ramirez (Bass), Gene Hoglan (Drums) and Glen Alvelais (Guitar). Ramirez was previously the band's first guitarist (although here he is performing on bass guitar), and Alvelais had previously performed with Testament on the 1993 live album, Return to the Apocalyptic City. Artwork The album cover art for Demonic was done by Dave McKean who also did the cover art for the prior Testament studio album, Low and would go on to do their next, The Gathering. In a 1999 interview while supporting the release of The Gathering, Peterson described how the image depicts a type of African exorcism where a wooden mask is made to represent the possessed victim. Nails are then driven into it cleansing the afflicted person of the evil spirit. McKean gets double duty from the cover's pentagram graphic using the style depiction from the Legacy (band) logo, the band name Testament released a 1985 demo under, as both a nod to longtime fans and as the spirit being driven forth. The center skull art without the pentagram enclosure can be seen on the album cover of Testament's first studio album, The Legacy. Release Demonic features eleven tracks, marking a deviation from previous albums to a much darker death metal sound mirroring the album's exorcism theme.

Traditionally, Israel conducted regular call-up exercises for its reserve troops by public radio. Units were given code words, which, if broadcast over the radio, meant that the troops were to assemble at predetermined meeting points. Though intended for emergency use, exercises were conducted to ensure that the troops arrived at their appointed places within a reasonable amount of time. Because of the tense situation along the country's borders, drills were announced publicly well in advance, and people expecting to be called up waited at home for the announcements to be made. By the late 1950s, however, tensions had been increasing along Israel's frontiers, not least because of the perceived threat posed by the political unification of the country's two major adversaries, Egypt and Syria, as the United Arab Republic on January 31, 1958. As a result, it was decided by the IDF's General Staff to test the readiness of its reserve troops under actual emergency conditions. A call-up exercise would be conducted, but unlike previous exercises, there would be no prior announcement and no warning given. On April 1, a popular radio program on Kol Israel was interrupted by a message requesting listeners to stay close to their radios and wait for an important announcement. At 9:00 PM, Kol Israel's main radio program opened with an announcement of a general call-up of the reserves, and all reservists whose units were announced were requested to report to their bases the following day. The message was concluded with three military code words, which signaled units to report at their predetermined meeting points. The message was delivered in nine languages.Yinon Royhman, War that wasn‚Äôt: 'Night of the Ducks', Ynetnews Intended to simulate genuine emergency conditions, the call- up announcement threw the country into a panic. People believed that the call- up was in response to a genuine emergency, and that the country was under attack. In the following hours, Israelis spread rumors and guesses, and checked their personal ammunition supply. In the Knesset, members received the news during a vote on the state budget, and quickly abandoned the proceedings and ran to their cars to listen to the radio. Less than a quarter of an hour after the broadcast, radio programs from all over the world began announcing that Israel was mobilizing its army. Urgent messages were sent to foreign reporters in Israel, most of whom were attending a festival at Tel Aviv's Cultural Center celebrating a state visit to Israel by Queen Elisabeth of Belgium. IDF Chief of Staff Haim Laskov and Chief of Reserves Meir Zorea were also attending. Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion had been entertaining Queen Elisabeth when the crisis began. Similarly, the neighboring Arab states, which monitored Israeli radio, believed that Israel was preparing to launch a surprise attack on them, and began to ready their own troops. Syria began moving troops to the Israeli border to prepare for an IDF attack. It took considerable efforts by the government to calm the civilian population, and international efforts to mollify the neighboring states and convince them that Israel was not preparing for war. At 11:00 PM, Kol Israel finally announced that the call-up had been just an exercise, but people in Israel and abroad began forming conspiracy theories. For example, Soviet media claimed that the mobilization was possibly \\"to divert the workers' attention and to allow the government to insert into the defense clause of the budget 420 million Lirot, more than the previous year\\". In the following days, the local press responded bitterly to the event, referring to it as the \\"Night of the Ducks\\", since one of the call-up codes repeated on the radio was \\"Waterfowl\\", which in Hebrew translates as \\"water ducks\\". An official Commission of Inquiry was organized to investigate the decisions leading up to the event. Although the Chief of Staff, Haim Laskov, was absolved, two leading generals, Major General Meir Zorea, who served as Chief of Reserves, and Major General Yehoshafat Harkabi, who served as Chief of Military Intelligence, were forced to step down.

For example, an animal might first learn to associate a bell with food (first-order conditioning), but then learn to associate a light with the bell (second-order conditioning). Honeybees show second-order conditioning during proboscis extension reflex conditioning.Bitterman et al. 1983. Classical Conditioning of Proboscis Extension in Honeybees (Apis mellifera). J. Comp. Psych. 97: 107-119. Three phases in second-order conditioning In the SOC procedure, there are three phases. In the first training phase, a conditioned stimulus, (CS1) is followed by an unconditioned stimulus (US). In the second phase, a second-order conditioned stimulus (CS2) is presented along with CS1. Finally, in the test phase, CS2 is presented alone to the subjects while their responses are recorded.Jara, E., Vila, J., & Maldonado, A. (2006, August). Second-order conditioning of human causal learning. Learning and Motivation, 37(3), 230-246 . Retrieved from UTSC Library database. Models of second-order conditioning Theoretical models for how second-order conditioning (SOC) works have a basis in associative learning theories. There are four broad models based on the associations formed during SOC. The first model suggests that the second-order stimulus (CS2) and the conditioned response (CR) form a direct link which is strengthened by the presence of the first-order stimulus (CS1). The second model suggests that in successful SOC an associative representation of each stimulus is created. The presentation of the CS2 would evoke a representation of the CS1, which would evoke a representation of the unconditioned stimulus (US), thus leading to the CR. The third model suggests a direct link between the CS2 and a representation of the US which leads to the CR. The fourth model suggests that the CS2 elicits a CR through a CS1 representation because a connection exists between the CS2 and the CS1 representation. Second- Order conditioning helps explain why some people desire money to the point that they hoard it and value it even more than the objects it purchases. Money is initially used to purchase objects that produce gratifying outcomes, such as an expensive car. Although money is not directly associated with the thrill of a drive in a new sports car, though second- order conditioning, money can become linked with this type of desirable quality. In fear conditioning It has been demonstrated in an associative fear conditioning chain, such as CS2 \\\\--> CS1 \\\\--> US, that extinction of freezing responses to the first-order stimulus (CS1) leads to responding impairments in CS2, but extinction of the second-order stimulus (CS2), does not have any effect on CS1 (Debiec et al.). In the same study, the effect of activation (memory retrieval) on such an associative chain has been examined. Results demonstrated that protein synthesis inhibition after exposure to a single CS1 impairs responses to both CS1 and CS2, but protein synthesis inhibition after exposure to a single CS2, only disrupts CS2 and leaves CS1 freezing intact. Therefore, it is believed that when the first- order association is directly activated, it is placed into a labile state (as we would expect from reconsolidation research) which may affect dependent associations. However, when the first-order association is only indirectly activated (through the associative chain), it appears that there is not sufficient stimulation to kick off cellular processes which would place it in a labile state, so it remains fixed.Debiec, J., Doyere, V., Nader, K., LeDoux, J.E.

Amable Guillaume Prosper Brugi√®re, baron de Barante (June 10, 1782November 22, 1866) was a French statesman and historian. Associated with the center-left, he was described in France as the first man to call himself, \\"without any embarrassment or restriction, a Liberal.\\" Life Barante was born at Riom, Puy-de-D√¥me, the son of an advocate. At the age of sixteen he entered the √âcole Polytechnique at Paris, and at twenty obtained his first appointment in the civil service. His abilities secured him rapid promotion, and in 1806 he obtained the post of auditor to the council of state. After being employed in several political missions in Germany, Poland, and Spain, during the next two years, he became prefect of Vend√©e. At the time of the return of Napoleon I he held the prefecture of Nantes, and this post he immediately resigned. On the second restoration of the Bourbons he was made councillor of state and secretary- general of the ministry of the interior. After filling for several years the post of director-general of indirect taxes, he was created in 1819 as a peer of France and was prominent among the Liberals. After the revolution of July 1830, Barante was appointed ambassador to Turin, and five years later to St Petersburg. Throughout the reign of Louis Philippe he remained a supporter of the government; and after the fall of the monarchy, in February 1848, he withdrew from political affairs and retired to his country seat in Auvergne. Shortly before his retirement he had been made grand cross of the Legion of Honour. He died at the Castle of Barante, near Thiers, in 1866. Works Barante in his later years. Barante's Histoire des ducs de Bourgogne de la maison de Valois, which appeared in a series of volumes between 1824 and 1828, procured him immediate admission to the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise.

History The village is named after the Goff family, who owned much of the land in the area, and symbolised by the original Old Oak, said to be several hundred years old before it fell in the 1950s. Its replacement fell itself after severe damage during the storm of 1987. The village centre is marked by a War Memorial which was unveiled on 20 December 1920. It is inscribed with the names of 32 men from the village who were killed in the First World War. A further three names were added following the Second World War. The houses north-east of the memorial were originally the police station. Next to the police station was a civil defence siren which was regularly tested through the 1960s, as part of the national defence at the height of the Cold War. The siren could be heard across the whole village area. Goffs Oak has been used as a film location. In the 1970s, Timeslip, a popular children's science fiction series, was filmed at Burnt Farm Army Camp in Silver Street. Gerry Anderson's The Protectors, filmed in the 1970s and starring Robert Vaughn also used the former army camp as a location.

When the filesystem is idle for a few seconds, it marks these as \\"safe points\\". The product allows the disk drive to be restored to any point within the available history. It also allows older versions of files to be restored, and previous versions of the whole disk to be browsed. Depending on disk activity, the typical history might cover a few hours to a few days. Operation GoBack replaces the master boot record, and also replaces the partition table with a single partition. This allows a hard drive to be changed back, even in the event that the operating system is unable to boot, while also protecting the filesystem from alteration so that the revert information remains correct. GoBack is compatible with hardware RAID drives. Incompatible products Due to the changes made to the partition table, this can cause problems when dual booting other operating systems on the same hard disk. It is possible to retain dual-boot compatibility, but can involve saving the partition table before enabling GoBack, and after enabling GoBack, re- writing the partition table back to the disk (after booting from a different device, such as a Live CD). It may also be necessary to disable GoBack prior to using certain low level disk utilities, such as formatting software. Such low level utilities which do not first check for the presence of GoBack can (in combination with GoBack) cause data to become corrupted. Another example of an incompatible program is the Windows version of True Image For Windows. GoBack is also incompatible with products such as Drive Vaccine PC Restore and RollBack Rx - as these products require access to the master boot record.

It has an area of 0.3 km2 (0.12 mi2). Known to Eskimo natives of the Bering Strait region in prehistory, Fairway was documented by James Cook in 1778 and named by Frederick Beechey in 1826. Although uninhabited, the island is a nesting site for seabirds ‚Äî most notably the least and crested auklet ‚Äî which prompt egg-collecting visits from local indigenous peoples. The United States Navy placed radioisotope thermoelectric generator-powered environmental monitoring equipment on the island from the 1960s through the 1990s. Geography The granite mass that is now Fairway Rock, like the larger nearby Diomede Islands, is the remnant of an earlier era of glaciation. Fairway Rock is situated 12 mi (19 km) SSE of Little Diomede Island and 20 mi (32 km) W of Cape Prince of Wales, at . The island is variously reported as from 300 m to 1.5 km in length. Rising steeply from the surrounding waters to above sea level, Fairway Rock can be easily seen from the mainland coast of Alaska at Cape Prince of Wales. Because of its steep cliffs, it poses no additional maritime hazard. The Bering Strait around Fairway Rock is relatively shallow ‚Äî about 50 m in depth ‚Äî and oceanographic transects show the island to lie near a current velocity minimum for the strait. Ocean currents north of Fairway Rock are occasionally studied as an example of a real-world system where a Von K√°rm√°n vortex street is generated. Politically, Fairway Rock is part of the U.S. state of Alaska and lies inside Alaska's Nome Census Area and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Wildlife Conservation Unit 22E. It is conveyed to Inalik Native Corporation. Fairway Rock appears on USGS topographic maps in the Teller Quadrangle. Flora and fauna Sparse vegetation atop the granite island seen during a U.S. Navy visit to Fairway Rock The island's bold cliffs are a haven for many migratory birds. The indigenous peoples who have lived nearby for thousands of years come to the island to gather bird eggs in the spring. and have continued to do so as recently as the 1990s. The island supports a breeding colony of about 35,000 seabirds, including some 25,000 least auklets and crested auklets. In 1925, the tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata), horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata), parakeet auklets (Aethia psittacula), and Pallas' murre (Uria lomvia arra) were reported at Fairway Rock, nesting in the crevices of the island's cliffs. A 1960 account reports that Eskimo inhabitants of Little Diomede reported a glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) colony on Fairway Rock larger than that on Little Diomede. The Steller sea lion may also breed on Fairway Rock. History =Discovery and establishment of outpost= Fairway Rock was sighted by Captain James Cook on August 8, 1778. It was named by the English naval officer and geographer Frederick William Beechey upon sighting the island in July 1826. Unlike the names he gave to the Diomede Islands, the name \\"Fairway\\" has persisted. Fairway Rock was passed and mentioned within the accounts of John Muir's voyage aboard the Corwin in 1881 and Roald Amundsen aboard the Gj√∏a in 1906. What is considered the last offensive action of the American Civil War happened in this area: the CSS Shenandoah fell upon a fleet of whalers working the waters near Alaska's Little Diomede Island and sank more than two dozen ships on June 22, 1865. This is chronicled in the book The Last Shot. In 1964, the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker USCGC Northwind (WAGB-282) visited the rock, and installed an unmanned, propane-powered oceanographic station in order to measure water flows across the Bering Strait. Northwinds crew continued to help maintain the station until its closure.Welcome Aboard USCGC Northwind. Pamphlet. 1968. U.S.C.G, Thirteenth District, Seattle, WA. Retrieved: 15 April 2014. =The radioisotope thermoelectric generator= U.S. military perform maintenance on one of the radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) left atop Fairway to power environmental monitoring equipment. On August 11, 1966, the US Navy placed a strontium-powered radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) atop Fairway Rock for \\"powering environmental instruments\\". At this time Commander John C. LeDoux was in charge of NavFac's shore based nuclear power program, whose over 200 trained men only had one power plant to run. With a new NavFac Chief taking over soon, Commander LeDoux feared the program might be cancelled if it had no other applications. In his memoir LeDoux writes that, \\"like good marketers we produced a catalog of what was available and sent it to all Navy commands.\\" Within two weeks they received an urgent request for a generator at Fairway Rock. Fairway Rock's then-current generator was propane fueled and could not operate in the winter months. Since the generator powered \\"detectors on the ocean floor for submarine traffic heading North\\" it was considered essential that it be replaced rapidly. However, moving the new generator from Baltimore to Alaska to Fairway Rock would be a complicated process and LeDoux suspected that \\"red tape\\" would delay the operation for a long time. Commander LeDoux was able to use contacts in the AEC to get approval to move the generator in only 4 days, which he considered \\"a miracle in itself.\\" A weekly Air Force flight to Vietnam was able to take it to Alaska. Getting the generator onto the island itself proved more difficult, since there were no Navy helicopters in the area. A bush pilot was contracted, two refueling locations were set up by the Army Corps of Engineers, and a Coast Guard escort (USCGC Northwind (WAGB-282)) was assigned, allowing the journey over the Bering Strait to be made safely. In the end, the project only took 10 days and \\"was done with no money or paperwork ‚Äì mostly phone calls and personal visits.\\" LeDoux was impressed that a project involving so many disparate military and non-military parties could be carried off in such a short span of time. The device, developed by Martin Marietta, was the first commercially developed instrument of its kind deployed for unattended field use by the U.S. government. This use was cited in 1978 congressional hearings on potential uses for nuclear waste. In 1981 two additional RTGs were added. All three RTGs were removed from the rock in 1995 in a joint Army/Navy operation with Chinook helicopters from B Company, 4th Battalion, 123rd Aviation Regiment, the \\"Sugar Bears\\"B Company,\\"Sugar Bears\\", 4th BN, 123rd AVN REGT History, 1995.

Working mainly in free jazz, he was an innovator in multiphonics. Early life Mangelsdorff was born in Frankfurt on September 5, 1928. He was given violin lessons as a child and was self-taught on guitar in addition to knowing trombone. His brother, Emil Mangelsdorff, had a jazz record collection, but during the Nazi period Albert's enthusiasm for the music had to be restrained. Later life and career Mangelsdorff performing in 1987 Albert Mangelsdorff performing in 1992 Mangelsdorff made his recording debut in 1952, playing with Hans Koller. In the same decade, he also worked with small groups and the Dance Hesse Radio Orchestra throughout the decade. As the German representative for the Newport Jazz Festival International Band in 1958, he collaborated with the American musicians Gerry Mulligan and Louis Armstrong. Mangelsdorff recorded prolifically in the 1960s, including sessions with his own quintet, his brother, and with pianist John Lewis. By the time of his solo performance at the Munich Olympic Games in 1972, he was playing more free jazz. \\"He made solo trombone ‚Äì a heretofore unknown concept in jazz ‚Äì a reality via multiphonics, the physically and technically demanding simultaneous blowing and singing of notes into his horn; the method opened vast new dimensions like harmonies and chords\\". He later worked with the NDR Big Band, Old Friends (led by Manfred Schoof), and the United Jazz + Rock Ensemble. He died in Frankfurt on July 25, 2005.

Like all the Sarraceniaceae, it is native to the New World. Its range extends from southern Alabama, through Florida and Georgia, to the coastal plains of southern Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Populations also exist in the Piedmont and mountains of North Carolina. Like other members of the genus Sarracenia, the yellow pitcher plant traps insects using a rolled leaf, which in this species is a vibrant yellow in color, and up to over a meter (3') in heightGraham, D.L. 1997. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 26(4): 118‚Äì120. (although 50 cm, 20\\" is more typical). The uppermost part of the leaf is flared into a lid (the operculum), which prevents excess rain from entering the pitcher and diluting the digestive secretions within. The upper regions of the pitcher are covered in short, stiff, downwards-pointing hairs, which serve to guide insects alighting on the upper portions of the leaf towards the opening of the pitcher tube. The upper regions are also brightly patterned with flower-like anthocyanin markings, particularly in the varieties S. flava var. rugelii and S. flava var. ornata: these markings also serve to attract insect prey. The opening of the pitcher tube is retroflexed into a 'nectar roll' or peristome, whose surface is studded with nectar-secreting glands. The nectar contains not only sugars, but also the alkaloid coniine (a toxin also found in hemlock), which probably intoxicates the prey. Prey entering the tube find that their footing is made extremely uncertain by the smooth, waxy secretions found on the surfaces of the upper portion of the tube. Insects losing their footing on this surface plummet to the bottom of the tube, where a combination of digestive fluid, wetting agents and inward-pointing hairs prevent their escape. Some large insects (such as wasps) have been reported to escape from the pitchers on occasion, by chewing their way out through the wall of the tube. Red Sarracenia flava In spring, the plant produces large flowers with 5-fold symmetry. The yellow petals are long and strap-like, and dangle over the umbrella-like style of the flower, which is held upside down at the end of a 50 cm, 20\\" long scape. The stigma of the flower are found at the tips of the 'spokes' of this umbrella. Pollinating insects generally enter the flower from above, forcing their way into the cavity between the petals and umbrella, and depositing any pollen they are carrying on the stigmata as they enter. The pollinators generally exit the flower, having been dusted with the plant's own pollen, by lifting a petal. This one-way system helps to ensure cross pollination. In late summer and autumn, the plant stops producing carnivorous leaves, and instead produces flat, non-carnivorous phyllodia. This is probably an adaptation to low light levels and insect scarcity during the winter months, and shows clearly the cost of carnivory. The yellow pitcher plant is easy to cultivate, and is one of the most popular carnivorous plants in horticulture. The yellow pitcher plant readily hybridises with other members of the genus Sarracenia: the hybrids S. x catesbaei (S. flava √ó S. purpurea) and S. moorei (S. flava √ó S. leucophylla) are found in the wild, and are also popular amongst collectors.

Other contributions From 1990 to 2005, in addition to his on and off air roles with Artist Services, Vizard pursued a number of other business interests and public service roles. In 1996, was appointed a director of the telecommunications company Telstra Corporation Limited, a position he held until his decision to retire from 17 September 2000 and not stand for re-election to the board. As President of the Screen Producers Association of Australia from 1995 to 1997, Vizard was an advocate for the establishment by the Australian Government of the Australian Commercial Television Production Fund to produce high quality Australian television drama telemovies and series. Vizard subsequently served on the Board of the ACTPF from 1995 to 1998. Vizard has been an advocate for promoting Australian-made content on Australian television, radio and media. In delivering his 1999 Andrew Olle Media Lecture, Vizard advocated the need to maintain Australian quotas for all Australian commercial television networks as well as proposing that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation should be more fully funded and should commission and broadcast exclusively Australian content. In 1998, Vizard was elected as a delegate for his home state of Victoria to the 1998 Australian Constitutional Convention in Canberra, representing the Australian Republican Movement. After the constitutional convention, Vizard wrote the book Two Weeks in Lilliput: Bear Baiting and Backbiting at the Constitutional Convention (). The book became a best seller and was a prescribed text on the NSW HSC syllabus. From 1998 to 2005, Vizard was the President of the Council of Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria. Under Vizard's presidency, the Gallery commenced and completed two extensive building programs: the $150 million renovation of the International Gallery to house the International collection; and the $400 million construction and opening of the new Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia, the only major public art gallery in the world dedicated to Australian art. From 2001 to 2005, Vizard was Chairman of the Victorian Major Events Company which attracts major sporting, arts and cultural events to Victoria and Australia. During Vizard's chairmanship events won by VMEC for Australia included the World Cycling Championships, World Gymnastics Championships, World Cup Soccer Qualifiers, International Rugby Tests, the renewal of the Australian Formula One Grand Prix, World Superbike Championships, World Swimming Championships, Mercedes Australian Fashion Week, and others. In February 2002 Vizard was the Convenor with the Premier of Victoria of a National Population Summit at which 50 of Australia's most prominent leaders spoke to over 1,000 delegates in a bipartisan debate about all aspects of Australia's population. The bipartisan resolutions from the Summit and the speeches were edited by Vizard and published by Penguin in Australia's Population Debate. Other organisations with which he has acted as a Director or a Trustee include Film Australia, Australian Children's Television Foundation and the Transport Accident Corporation. From 1997 to 2005, Vizard served as a member of the committee of the Melbourne Cricket Club. Writing and publications In addition to writing for theatre, television and film, Vizard has written and edited several books, including a 2008 biography of Graham Kennedy, Graham Kennedy Treasures: Friends Remember the King (Melbourne University Publishing, 2008, ) which he co-wrote with Mike McColl-Jones. Other books include Best Australian Humorous Writing (with Andrew O'Keefe, MUP, 2008), Australia's Population Challenge (with Hugh J. Martin and Tim Watts, Penguin, 2003, ); Two Weeks in Lilliput (Penguin, 1998, ), an account of Vizard's experiences attending the 1998 Australian Constitutional Convention; Fast forward, the book: the complete guide to 3000 years of television (); and The Top seven lists from 'Tonight live with Steven Vizard' (). Vizard's one man play Coles Funny Picture Man, based on the life of the eccentric Victorian bookseller Edward William Cole, was performed by AFI award-winning actor Norman Kaye. Vizard wrote with composer Paul Grabowsky, a substantial new theatre work with music, Last Man Standing, for the Melbourne Theatre Company as their production for the Anzac and Gallipoli commemorations in 2015. Also with Grabowsky he wrote the song cycle The Space Between for soprano Emma Matthews in 2018.Limelight, September 2018, p. 22 Vizard has been the recipient of an Australia Council grant for Poetry and a University of Melbourne Writers Fellowship. He was nominated for a Writers Guild Award for Best Feature Film Screenplay in 1985; and won (as a co-writer) Writers Guild Awards for Best Comedy Television in 1989, 1990, 1992 and 1993. Legal proceedings In the early 2000s, Vizard became involved in three separate legal proceedings, primarily related to the activities of the Vizard family's former bookkeeper, Roy Hilliard. In 2001 the Vizard family reported to the police money missing from their family accounts, and Hilliard was subsequently charged with stealing and falsifying the accounts of the Vizard family companies, and in 2005 Hilliard was convicted of falsifying accounts. This led to Hilliard's conviction and sentence to three years jail.Bedwell, S: \\"Vizard Uncut: The Full Story\\", Melbourne University Press, (2007), () In the second legal proceedings, Hilliard faced civil action related to the allegations of misappropriating money from the Vizard companies, with Vizard's bank Westpac commencing civil proceedings against Hilliard in 2001. Westpac had conducted an investigation of the fraud and paid out to Vizard's companies some of the money the bookkeeper had taken, and then sued the bookkeeper to recover some of the payout. Vizard was a witness in Westpac's action. In December 2006, the Supreme Court of Victoria found in favour of Westpac and ordered Hilliard to repay over $2 million in funds misappropriated from the Vizards to the bank, plus interest. The judge also rejected claims Hilliard had made against Vizard relating to the use of overseas tax havens and that Hilliard had returned the stolen moneys to Vizard. In September 2009, an appeal by Hilliard against the judgement against him was rejected by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria, which affirmed that Hilliard had misappropriated over $3 million from Vizard, rejected Hilliard's claims against Vizard, and ordered Hilliard to repay the missing moneys and costs. The third legal action involved Vizard directly and arose out of allegations made by Hilliard in 2003 at the criminal trial of his former bookkeeper. Hilliard alleged that Vizard had insider traded while a director of Telstra. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) followed-up the allegations with an 18-month investigation, including searching Vizard's home and office in December 2003. ASIC then formally advised that it would not continue the investigation, as it had no evidence sufficient to prosecute Vizard for inside trading or any other crime. On 28 July 2005, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions formally announced that they had no provable evidence to proceed with any criminal case against Vizard. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions Damian Bugg QC along with ASIC Chairman Jeff Lucy vigorously denied assertions by some sections of the media that they had \\"gone soft\\" on Vizard. ASIC Chairman Lucy made clear to the Parliament in his report of 13 September 2005 that there had never been any provable criminal case against Vizard despite the most vigorous examination by ASIC, and that this lack of any criminal case against Vizard was a view shared by both ASIC and the Attorney General: \\"In this case, criminal charges were not pursued against Mr. Vizard because the DPP was not satisfied that there was admissible, substantial and reliable evidence of the offence and therefore there were not reasonable prospects of securing a conviction‚Ä¶Whilst this was a decision for the DPP, it was also consistent with senior counsel advice that ASIC had independently received....When ASIC announced on 4 July that we were pursuing civil penalties against Mr. Vizard, there were some suggestions in the press that we had gone soft or that we had somehow been nobbled by government. I have unequivocally rejected those suggestions. They are entirely without foundation.\\" One of the key issues in the case was that the trades in question had not been made by Vizard, but instead by a company called CTI, of which Vizard's accountant Gregory Lay was the sole shareholder and director. A Vizard family company lent CTI money to invest and had an agreement to receive back proceeds (less a management fee). Lay gave detailed statements to ASIC but none which supported any case against Vizard nor connected Vizard to the trades Lay had made. Separately, later in 2005 ASIC said it would commence civil proceedings against Vizard for breaching his director's duties. ASIC's case was that Vizard had breached Sections 183 and 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 (C'th). Vizard and ASIC settled the civil proceedings in 2005 on the basis that Vizard would not contest them, that ASIC made no allegations of dishonesty against Vizard, that a fine of $390,000 be imposed and Vizard agree to be disqualified from acting as a company director for between 3 and 5 years. That settlement took the form of an \\"agreed statement of facts\\" jointly presented to the Federal Court by Vizard's and ASIC's lawyers, and Vizard agreeing the court should impose penalties for a breach of his duties as a director. In his judgement handed down on 28 July 2005, Justice Raymond Finkelstein accepted that Vizard had breached Sections 183 and 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 (C'lth) through his activities.[2005] FCA 1037 Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Vizard ASIC proposed a $130,000 fine per offence and 5 years disqualification. Justice Finkelstein disregarded the agreement reached between ASIC and Vizard and instead ordered a disqualification of 10 years. The head of ASIC, Jeff Lucy, conceded that there was never a criminal case, or any case involving dishonesty, against Vizard and that the media outrage was largely caused by ASIC's failure to properly communicate the full facts to the media. Philanthropic activities In 1991, Vizard and his family founded the Vizard Foundation, which established Vizard House, a refuge for people in need. Since its establishment in 1991, Vizard House has provided over 100,000-room nights free accommodation for needy people visiting inner Melbourne hospitals. From 1992 to 2002, the Foundation worked with The Ian Potter Museum of Art, University of Melbourne to support Australian artists. The collection of Australian art is permanently housed at the University of Melbourne.University of Melbourne. \\"Vizard Foundation ‚Äì Collection of Antiquities\\" . Retrieved 2007-06-12 On 27 April 1994, the Vizard Foundation purchased 45 antiquities from an auction held by Christie's of London. These items are on permanent loan to the Ian Potter Museum of Art at the University of Melbourne. In 1991, Vizard purchased from Lord Alistair McAlpine the iconic Australian painting First Class Marksman by Sidney Nolan, the only painting of the original 1945 Ned Kelly Series not owned and on public display in the National Gallery of Australia. Vizard donated the painting to the Vizard Foundation and the painting was on public display in the National Gallery of Victoria. In 2010, the Vizard Foundation sold the work for an Australian record of $5.4 million and committed the proceeds for charitable purposes, including indigenous scholarships. In 1997, Vizard was a founding trustee with Walter Mikac of the Alannah and Madeleine Foundation, to assist in education against violence to children. In 1997, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia, for service to the community, particularly through the Vizard Foundation, and to the arts.Government of Australia. \\"Australian Honours Database, Steve William VIZARD\\".

Earlier in 2006, Vizard chased three burglars who had broken into his Orrong Rd Toorak mansion. Vizard was awakened at 3am by his 16-year-old daughter who had seen an intruder in her room, and Vizard pursued the intruders into the street in the nude where he was nearly driven over by the getaway Alfa Romeo. The robber, Richard Lovett who had 93 prior convictions, was arrested later that day after becoming involved in a fight in which he stabbed a man in the chest, puncturing his lung, and was subsequently sentenced for the robbery to four years by the County Court of Victoria.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/vizard-mansion-thief-get- two-years/story-e6frf7kx-1111115112401 Vizard's younger brother, Andrew Vizard, is Professor of Veterinary Science at the University of Melbourne and served on numerous boards including Animal Health Australia Ltd, The Zoological Parks and Gardens of Victoria, and the Australian Wool Corporation.

The author of numerous novels and autobiographical studies, he played a considerable role in changing French public attitudes to AIDS. He was a close friend of Michel Foucault. Early life and career Guibert was born in Saint-Cloud, Hauts-de-Seine, to a middle-class family and spent his early years in Paris, moving to La Rochelle from 1970 to 1973. After working as a filmmaker and actor, he turned to photography and journalism. In 1978, he successfully applied for a job at France's prestigious evening paper Le Monde and published his second book, Les Aventures singuli√®res (published by √âditions de Minuit). In 1984, Guibert shared a C√©sar Award for best screenplay with Patrice Ch√©reau for L'homme bless√©. Guibert had met Ch√©reau in the 1970s during his theatrical years. He won a scholarship between 1987 and 1989 at Villa Medicis in Rome with his friend, writer Mathieu Lindon. He described these years in L'Incognito, published in 1989. Guibert's writing style was inspired by the French writer Jean Genet and, later, by the work of Austrian writer Thomas Bernhard. Three of his lovers occupied an important place in his life and work: Thierry Jouno, director of an institute for the blind whom he met in 1976; Michel Foucault, whom he met in 1977; and Vincent Marmousez, a teenager of fifteen who inspired his novel Fou de Vincent (published in English as Crazy for Vincent). For a time in the 1980s Guibert was a reader at the institute for young blind in Paris, Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles, which led to his novel Des aveugles (published in English as Blindsight). In January 1988 Guibert was diagnosed with AIDS. From then on, he worked at recording what was left of his life. In June the following year, he married Christine, the partner of Thierry Jouno, so that his royalty income would eventually pass to her and her two children. In 1990, Guibert publicly revealed his HIV status in his roman √† clef √Ä l'ami qui ne m'a pas sauv√© la vie (published in English as To the Friend Who Did Not Save My Life). Guibert immediately found himself the focus of media attention, featured in newspapers and appearing on several television talk shows. Two more books also detailing the progress of his illness followed: Le Protocole compassionnel (published in English as The Compassionate Protocol) and L'Homme au chapeau rouge (published in English as The Man In The Red Hat), which was released posthumously in January 1992, the same month French television screened La Pudeur ou l'impudeur, a home-made film by Guibert of his last year as he lost his battle against AIDS. Almost blind as a result of disease, he attempted to end his life just before his 36th birthday, and died two weeks later. Bibliography * La Mort propagande, R.

Feist, the sequel to Magician. Released in 1985, it was followed by A Darkness at Sethanon, the final book in The Riftwar Saga. Plot A year after his brother Lyam's coronation as king, Arutha returns to his city as the new Prince of Krondor, to begin plans for his wedding. Jimmy the Hand, a young thief, foils an assassination attempt on the prince by a fellow thief, and feeling loyalty toward the prince from previously aiding his escape from the city with Princess Anita (in Magician), he chooses to warn the prince of the attempt on his life instead of reporting the traitor to the Mockers, Krondor's powerful and highly organized guild of thieves. Arutha seeks the Mockers' cooperation to obtain more information on the assassins, and at their request, makes Jimmy a squire of his court. Setting a trap, they capture two agents, who are revealed to be operating out of the temple of Lims-Kragma, Goddess of Death, one of whom is a moredhel whose appearance has been altered. During interrogation, both prisoners will themselves to death rather than divulge their plans. As the High Priestess of Lims-Kragma seeks the truth by bringing them back from beyond the grave, one of the prisoners rises by the power of an unknown enemy, and attacks his captors, slaughtering many royal guards, and addressing Arutha as \\"Lord of the West\\" before being destroyed by Father Nathan, a priest of Sung. Injured in the attack, the High Priestess warns Arutha that the forces which opposed him were so powerful that they held the gods in contempt. Arutha leads a strike on the assassins' hideout in Krondor, but even as the assault appears to be going in their favor, the assassins begin rising from the dead and renewing their attack. Many of Arutha's men are slain, and the Black Slayers are only defeated when the entire building is burned to the ground. Believing the threat to be over for the time being, Arutha proceeds with his wedding. Just before the ceremony, Jimmy senses something is wrong, and finds the same assassin from the first attempt on Arutha's life hiding on the roof. He manages to disrupt the assassin just as he is firing at Arutha, but the poisoned bolt strikes Anita instead. The assassin is interrogated, and reveals the enemy to be Murmandamus, a moredhel chieftain and powerful sorcerer. According to a prophecy, Arutha is the only force that stands in the way of Murmandamus's total destruction of the Kingdom and domination over the realm. The assassin also reveals that the poison was given to him by a moredhel agent, who called it \\"silverthorn\\". Pug is able to keep Anita under a spell that slows the passage of time, giving Arutha time to search for an antidote. With scant clues, he secretly leads a party to the one place most likely to have the answer to any question, the great library at Sarth Abbey. All along his journey, he is tracked by Murad, one of Murmandamus's top generals. They manage to reach the abbey, but their enemies strike again with powerful sorcery, both attacks barely repulsed by the mighty defenses of Sarth Abbey and its priests. From information gathered at the abbey, Arutha's quest turns to the elves of Elvandar for more information. Meanwhile, Pug returns to Stardock to seek the aid of a scryer, whose vision of the future reveals a dark force behind Murmandamus, a powerful enemy speaking in ancient Tsurani, who is even capable of perceiving the scryer past the barriers of time and probability. Believing the threat therefore to be a danger to both worlds, Pug seeks more information from the Tsurani Assembly of magicians, and with the help of research from the books of Macros, creates a new rift to Kelewan and returns to his old estate with two companions, posing as priests. In Elvandar, Arutha is told that the silverthorn plant can also serve as the cure, and grows only around the lake Moraelin, in moredhel-held territory, surrounded by a barrier the elves are unable to pass. He and his band set out for Moraelin. In Kelewan, Pug arrives to find himself removed from the Assembly and declared an outlaw. His old friend and fellow Great One Hochopepa is willing to aid him, but they are captured by a Great One loyal to the current Warlord, who seeks to gain control of the Empire. Tortured by the Warlord and his inquisitors, and with his Greater Path magic neutralized, Pug turns to the Lesser Path, becoming the second magician ever to master both paths after Macros the Black. He is able to overcome his captors, and explains his reasons for returning to the Emperor, who grants him reprieve to continue his search in the Assembly's vast libraries. He arrives at the conclusion that the ancient Tsurani enemy has returned, posing a grave threat to both worlds. Pug is reinstated by the Assembly, and following a clue, travels to the northern polar wastelands of Kelewan, discovering a lost race of elves living in a forest under the ice, twin to Elvandar on Midkemia. Their leader, Acaila, offers to instruct Pug in magic over the course of the following year, in order to better face the coming trials. Meanwhile, Arutha and his band manage to sneak past the moredhel sentries, and discover several silverthorn shrubs in the lake, and make their escape back towards Elvandar. Just as they are about to reach the safety of the Elven forest, they are overtaken by Murad and a band of black slayers. With the help of Tomas, they manage to defeat their enemies and return safely to Elvandar. With the antidote made by the elven Spellweavers, Anita is saved, and Arutha's enemies set back by the death of one of their generals. But Murmandamus vows to regather his armies the next year, when the long-awaited invasion into the Kingdom will commence.

He was born in Merced, California, United States, the son of Herman Arceneaux from Ascension Parish, Louisiana and Virginia Grant of Waushara County, Wisconsin. His father was of Acadian (Cajun) descent, while on his mother's side his ancestry included English, Norwegian, Scottish, German, Dutch, Welsh, and Native American (Mohawk). Also on his mother's side he was a direct descendant of accused Salem witch Sarah Cloyce. He spent some of his preteen/early teens in France where his Air Force father was stationed for three years. He spent some of his childhood in the French countryside. Arceneaux took his stage name from a Louisiana legend, in which a naughty child called Coco Robicheaux is abducted by a werewolf (Loup Garou or Rougarou). The name 'Coco Robicheaux' is repeated in the song \\"I Walk on Gilded Splinters\\" from Dr. John the Night Tripper's 1968 album, Gris-Gris. Robicheaux claimed that he played regularly with Mac Rebennack (Dr. John) in the early 1960s, and said: \\"Many times I gone and played with him, all around the world, different places. Dr. John, he was very much interested in metaphysics. We had this little place on St. Philip Street. In voodoo they call the gilded splinters the points of a planet. Mystically they appear like little gilded splinters, like little gold, like fire that holds still. They‚Äôre different strengths at different times. I guess it ties in with astrology, and influence the energy. That‚Äôs what that‚Äôs about.\\" Robicheaux appeared in the episode \\"Hotshots\\", of the USA Network series The Big Easy, playing a New Orleans musician named \\"Coco\\", who had sold his soul to the devil. Two of Robicheaux's songs were also featured in the episode, \\"Broken String\\" and \\"Spiritland\\".

She was named for Justice William Henry Moody. Construction and commissioning Moody was laid down on 9 December 1918 at Squantum Victory Yard of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation at Quincy, Massachusetts, and launched on 28 June 1919. She was commissioned on 10 December 1919 with Commander James D. Wilson in command. Operational history Assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet, Moody departed Boston, Massachusetts, on 9 February 1920, loaded torpedoes and ammunition at Newport, Rhode Island, and steamed via New York City, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal to the United States West Coast, arriving at San Diego, California, on the 31st. She operated along the California coast through June 1920, and then departed San Francisco, California, on 1 July 1920 for Washington, where on 10 July 1920 she joined the cruise of United States Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, United States Secretary of the Interior John B. Payne, and Admiral Hugh Rodman, Commander of the Pacific Fleet, to Alaska. On an inspection tour of Alaskan coal and oil fields and looking for possible fleet anchorages, the cruise touched at nine ports including Sitka, Duncan Day, and Juneau, and lasted for nearly a month. Moody returned to San Diego on 31 August 1920 to operate off the California coast in training and in battle exercises for two months. She put into San Diego on 10 October 1920, remaining there and decommissioning on 15 June 1922. Moody recommissioned on 27 September 1923 with Lieutenant E. A. Zehner in command. Assigned to Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Fleet, the ship operated along the U.S. West Coast for the next 19 months, and then on 27 May 1925 departed Bremerton, Washington, for fleet exercises in the Hawaiian Islands. After operating from Pearl Harbor on Oahu and Lahaina Roads off Maui for a month, she departed Pearl Harbor on 1 July 1925 for the South Pacific Ocean, stopped at Pago Pago, American Samoa, and then made good will visits to Melbourne, Australia, and Dunedin and Wellington, New Zealand. Returning via Honolulu, Hawaii, to San Diego on 26 September 1925, Moody resumed operations along the U.S. West Coast operations into 1927, and made a voyage to Panama between February and April 1926. On 17 February 1927, Moody departed San Diego for tactical maneuvers with the United States Fleet in the Caribbean. Proceeding through the Panama Canal on 4 March 1927, she arrived at Guantanamo Bay on 18 March 1927 and operated out of that port and Gona√Øves, Haiti, on Fleet Problem VII, a naval exercise involving the defense of the Panama Canal, until 22 April 1927. She then proceeded to New York City for repairs. She departed New York City on 16 May 1927 and arrived at San Diego on 25 June 1927. Moody remained in service with the Battle Fleet through mid-1929. From April to June 1928, she made another cruise to Hawaii with the fleet for the extensive exercises of Fleet Problem VIII, a naval exercise held between California and Hawaii. She steamed to Mexico and Panama in early 1929 and then in July 1929 cruised to the Pacific Northwest, traveling as far north as Ketchikan, Alaska. Fate Moody decommissioned at San Diego on 2 June 1930 and was towed to Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, arriving there on 8 June 1930. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 3 November 1930 in accordance with naval arms limitations imposed under the London Naval Treaty. Most of Moody‚Ä≤s superstructure was sold as scrap metal on 10 June 1931. The rest of the ship was sold to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for about US$35,000 for use in filming the 1933 World War I submarine movie Hell Below. The movie studio altered her appearance to resemble that of a World War I Imperial German Navy destroyer and hired the marine salvage and construction firm Merritt-Chapman & Scott to place charges of dynamite aboard her at carefully planned locations. Moody was towed to a point in the Pacific Ocean off San Pedro, California, and on the afternoon of 21 February 1933, the first charge was detonated, splitting Moody between two watertight compartments so she continued to float after breaking up. Then two other detonations breached the watertight bulkheads, sinking her later that evening.

Biography Vukov was born in ≈†ibenik. In 1959, he achieved instant fame by winning the Opatija Music Festival in his singing debut, with the song \\"Mirno teku rijeke\\".http://mok.hr/nostalgija/item/18959-vice- vukov-3-08-1936-24-09-2008-neka-ti-mirno-teku-nebeske-rijeke-nas- vicehttp://www.jutarnji.hr/komentari/mirno-teku-rijeke-jedna-pjesma-za-dva- pjevaca/5911996/ During the 1960s, he was one of the most popular singers in Yugoslavia, appearing at the Eurovision Song Contest 1963 with the song \\"Brodovi\\" and at the Eurovision Song Contest 1965 with the song \\"ƒåe≈ænja\\". In the aftermath of the Croatian Spring movement, he was branded a Croatian nationalist by Yugoslav authorities and had his apartment searched by the police during the 1972 wave of arrests of Croatian Spring leaders. Vukov was on an Australian tour at that time. His wife warned him not to return because he could be arrested too, so instead he went to live in France, returning to Yugoslavia in 1976. By that time, the authorities had lost interest in his case, but his singing career was effectively over; he was blacklisted, barred from performing publicly and all his records were pulled out of stores. In 1989 an album of his new songs, albeit without his name on the cover, reappeared in Croatian music stores, signalling the political change. Later that same year, Vukov made a public comeback with a series of 14 sold-out concerts at Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall. Vice Vukov performed some of the most noteworthy Croatian patriotic songs, including \\"Zvona moga grada,\\" \\"Hrvatski kraj\\" and \\"Tvoja zemlja\\". After the introduction of democracy to Croatia, Vice Vukov became a prominent supporter of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia. He ran several times for a seat in the Croatian Sabor, finally succeeding as an independent candidate on the SDP's electoral list in 2003. In 2001 he was suggested as ambassador to Switzerland. On 17 November 2005, while descending the stairs in the Parliament building, Vukov slipped and fell, sustaining a serious head injury. He was hospitalised and underwent surgery, but fell into a coma shortly afterwards. In March 2006, according to his doctors, he was in a persistent vegetative state with no chance of recovery. However, in November 2007, Vukov was reported as being conscious at times, aware of his surroundings, and his condition was described as stable. He died in Zagreb aged 72 the following year.

He lived during the time of the Tuglaq dynasty and that of Sultan Ahmed Shah of Gujarat, and was married to the Sultan's sister. He is widely acknowledged for his scholarly treatises, liberal views and humanist ideals. Mahimi was born into a family of Arab travelers from Iraq who had settled down on the island of Mahimknown as nawayath, one of the seven islands that later formed the city of Bombay (now Mumbai). Not much is known of his early childhood. He later became the disciple of Mohiuddin Ibne Arabi, a Spanish Muslim saint. Mahimi's reputation grew after the Sultan of Gujarat, Ahmed Shah of the Muzaffarid dynasty, chose him to be the town's Qazi (the Head Muslim Judge/cleric of a town). Mahimi was the first Indian scholar to write an exegesis on the Qur'an, which gained critical acclimation from numerous Islamic scholars including Shah Waliullah Dehlavi. Authoring more than 100 books but we only know name of 21 books from which only 10 books are available in different libraries in India, he was given the moniker Qutub-e -Kokan (Kokan's Pole Star). He was the first commentator of the Quran in India . His commentary is called \\"Tafsirur Rahman.\\" It is available in Al Azhar University, Cairo and Ummul-Qura University, Makkah. Mahimi is revered by both the Muslims and Hindus, all Muslim sects hold him in high esteem. After his death in 1431, he was buried in Mahim. The site later became a Dargah (shrine) for devotees. Urs festival During the annual ten-day Urs festival celebrated on the 13th day of Shawwal as per the Muslim calendar, millions of devotees visit his dargah. The highlight of this is a procession of around eight thousand begins at the Mahim Police Station, believed to be the site of his residence. Two police officers from each of the eighty four city police stations represent the police whose association with the saint dates back to the saint's era. A representative of the Mumbai police who is the first to offer the \\"chaddar\\" (shawl) at the tomb on the first day of the festival. Legend has it that it was a police constable who gave water to the dying saint from his cap. Another story points to some miraculous assistance police officers once received from an old man, whom they believed was the saint, in fighting smugglers. A room adjacent to the office of the senior inspector of police station contains a steel cupboard that houses the saint's preserved belongings such as his chair, a pair of sandals and his hand-written Qur'an which is considered to be a calligraphic work of art. The room is opened once every year to the public. In 1920 the cupboard was purchased by a senior British police inspector, Raymond Esquire as a tribute to the saint he revered. On 2005-05-21, the government of Maharashtra named the JJ Flyover after the saint as a tribute to the saint. The 2.1 kilometre flyover is the longest viaduct in the country.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from - for the Baltimore Orioles (1987‚Äì92, '96), Texas Rangers (1993‚Äì94, '97), Cleveland Indians (1995), and Detroit Tigers (1998). During his career, he batted and threw right-handed. He is the younger brother of Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr.. He currently serves as a radio host for XM Satellite Radio and a studio analyst for MLB Network. Born in Maryland, Ripken grew up traveling around the United States as his father, Cal Ripken Sr., was a player and coach in the Orioles' organization. After attending Aberdeen High School, Ripken was drafted by the Orioles in the 11th round of the 1982 MLB draft. He reached the MLB in 1987, creating the first situation in baseball history that a father had managed two sons on the same team, as his brother played for the Orioles and his father, Cal Ripken Sr., managed the team. Ripken was a light hitter better known for his fielding skills, although he led the Orioles in batting average with a .291 mark in 1990. He served as their starting second baseman most of his first stint with the team. After the Orioles released him following the 1992 campaign, he played with four other teams (including the Orioles in 1996), serving mostly as a utility infielder and never holding a starting role for very long. He played his final game in 1998 for the Detroit Tigers. Early life Ripken was born to Cal, Sr. and Violet \\"Vi\\" Ripken in Havre de Grace, Maryland. Though the Ripkens called Aberdeen, Maryland, their home, they were often on the move because of Cal, Sr.'s coaching duties with the Baltimore Orioles organization.Rosenfeld, p. 2 This gave Bill the chance to be around his father's teams.Rosenfeld, p. 6 He attended Aberdeen High School,Rosenfeld, pp. 10, 60 where he played baseball.Rosenfeld, p. 12 Over his final two seasons, he did not lose a single game as a pitcher, but the infield was where he planned to spend his career.Rosenfeld, p. 60 Minor league career Before the 1982 Major League Baseball draft, Cal, Jr., Bill's brother who was on his way to winning the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award with the Orioles, remarked, \\"Billy might go pretty high in the draft. I'd love for the Orioles to take him. That would be okay, wouldn't it? Having your father and brother with the same team?\\" The Orioles would wind up selecting Bill in the 11th round of the draft. Ripken began his professional career that same year with the Rookie League Bluefield Orioles, where he played mostly shortstop and third base. In 27 games, in which he only totaled 45 at bats, Ripken posted a batting average of .244 with 11 hits and four runs batted in. Next season, Ripken remained at Bluefield and was used almost exclusively as a shortstop, although he also pitched the final of a game, allowing no runs. He batted .217 with 33 hits and 13 RBI in 48 games. In 1984, he was promoted to the Hagerstown Suns of the Class A Carolina League, where he appeared in 115 games. He batted .230 with 94 hits, the first two home runs of his career, and 40 RBI while posting a .948 fielding percentage at shortstop. Ripken's 1985 season would be split between three teams. He spent the bulk of the year with the Daytona Beach Admirals of the Class A Florida State League, batting .230 with 51 hits and 18 RBI. He also appeared in 14 games with Hagerstown and 18 games with the Double-A Charlotte O's of the Southern League, batting .255 and .137, respectively, with those teams. He did not hit a home run in 1985. He played the whole 1986 season for Charlotte, batting .268 with 142 hits, 20 doubles, three triples, five home runs, and 62 RBI in 141 games. In addition, he led the Southern League in four fielding categories.Rosenfeld, p. 124 In 1987, he was called up to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings of the International League, where he played 74 games, batting .286. Major League Baseball career =Baltimore Orioles (1987-92)= In July 1987, the Orioles released Rick Burleson and called Ripken up to replace him.Rosenfeld, p. 128 He debuted on July 11, creating the first instance in baseball history in which a father managed two sons on the same major league team, as his father was the Orioles' manager and his brother was their shortstop. While with the Orioles, Ripken played alongside his brother, Cal Ripken, Jr.; he was managed by his father, Cal, Sr., from 1987-1988. Billy did not have a hit in his debut but picked up his first hit as one of two against Charlie Leibrandt of the Kansas City Royals on July 16. Three days later, Ripken hit his first home run against Bud Black, helping the Orioles defeat Kansas City 5-1.Rosenfeld, p. 129 Expected to be more of a fielder than a hitter, Ripken finished his inaugural season with a .308 batting average, two home runs, and 72 hits in 58 games. Billy was given the Orioles' second base role in 1988; with his brother, Cal, Jr., at shortstop, the pair formed the Orioles' double play combination.Rosenfeld, p. 136 Six games into the season, Cal, Sr., was fired as the Orioles' manager, the quickest managerial firing in major league history. Immediately after, Billy switched his uniform number from 3 to his father's 7, saying, \\"I just didn't want to see anybody else wear it.\\"Rosenfeld, p. 142 The Orioles lost their first 21 games of the season en route to a 54-107 finish. A picture of Billy appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated on May 2, 1988, used in an emblematic fashion to symbolize frustration at the team's struggles. In his rookie season, Billy played a career-high 150 games, batting .207 with 106 hits, two home runs, 34 RBI, and a .984 fielding percentage. A broken hand caused Ripken to miss the first two weeks of 1989, but he took over the job again on April 19, holding it until a strained right shoulder sidelined him in late August. Though Ripken returned from the injury on September 7, he did not see much playing time for the rest of the season. On August 7, in a 9-8 win over the Boston Red Sox, Billy and Cal Combined for seven hits, the American League (AL) record for brothers in the same game.Rosenfeld, p. 157 In 115 games, Ripken batted .239 with 76 hits, two home runs, 26 RBI, and a .981 fielding percentage, which was third in the AL. In 1990, Ripken had perhaps his most successful campaign offensively. The Orioles' second baseman with the exception of a stretch in August in which he was hurt, he batted .291, the highest total of his career and a mark which would lead the Orioles in 1990. He also tied with his brother for the team lead in doubles (28)Rosenfeld, p. 174 Defensively, Ripken finished fifth among AL second basemen with a .987 fielding percentage and led AL hitters with 17 sacrifice hits. Billy and Cal committed a total of 11 errors, the fewest in major league history among second baseman-shortstop combinations that appeared in at least two-thirds of their team's games at their respective positions. Between July 14 and August 17, Ripken missed several games in 1991 with an injury. His batting average dropped to .216 that year, and he had 62 hits, no home runs, and 14 RBI in 104 games. He had a .986 fielding percentage, but that did not qualify him for a spot in the top five in the AL. He, Tim Hulett, and Juan Bell combined for the lowest on-base percentage in the major leagues at any position (.240) and became the subject of trade rumors after the season.Rosenfeld, p. 194 While his brother won the Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award, the Orioles finished an awful sixth.Rosenfeld, p. 188 Mark McLemore shared second base with Ripken in 1992.Rosenfeld, p. 218 Ripken hit what would be a career-high four home runs, batting .230 with 76 hits and 36 RBI in 111 games. He had a .993 fielding percentage. After the 1992 season, the Orioles acquired Harold Reynolds, which signaled the end of Ripken's days with the team. The Orioles officially ended his tenure by releasing him after the season.Rosenfeld, p. 219 1989 baseball card Detail on Billy Ripken's 1989 baseball card. In 1989, Ripken's Fleer card showed him holding a bat with the expletive \\"FUCK FACE\\" written in plain view on the knob of the bat. Fleer subsequently rushed to correct the error, and in their haste, released versions in which the text was scrawled over with a marker, whited out with correction fluid, and also airbrushed. On the final, corrected version, Fleer obscured the offensive words with a black box (this was the version included in all factory sets). Both the original card and many of the corrected versions have become collector's items as a result. There are at least ten different variations of this card. Once news got out, the original card's price went up to several hundred dollars. Years later, Ripken admitted to having written the expletive on the bat; however, he claimed he did it to distinguish it as a batting practice bat, and did not intend to use it for the card. He went on to say, \\"I can't believe the people at Fleer couldn't catch that. I mean, they certainly have to have enough proofreaders to see it. I think not only did they see it, they enhanced it. That writing on that bat is way too clear. I don't write that neat. I think they knew that once they saw it, they could use the card to create an awful lot of stir.\\" Some collectors list the card as the \\"Rick Face\\" card, as they claim that the proximity between the letters appears to make the word \\"FUCK\\" look similar to \\"RICK\\". =Texas Rangers (1993‚Äì1994)= The Texas Rangers signed Ripken in 1993 to play second base after Jeff Frye severely injured his knee. He began the season as their second baseman, but after batting .204 to open the year, he lost the role in May to Doug Strange. On June 4, he returned to the starting lineup when he took over the position of shortstop from Jeff Huson. However, he suffered a pulled left hamstring on June 20, an injury which would keep him out for the rest of the season except for a few games in September. In 50 games, he batted what would be a career-low .189, with 25 hits, four extra- base hits (all doubles), and 11 RBI. Ripken became a free agent after the season but re-signed with the Rangers on December 18. He batted .309 for them but was used sparingly as a utility player, making only 32 appearances. After the season, he again became a free agent. =Cleveland Indians (1995)= Billy Ripken holding a ticket to see his brother Cal break a record Ripken signed with the Cleveland Indians for 1995 but spent nearly the entire season with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons of the American Association; the Indians had told him he was just around for insurance in case one of their infielders was injured. At Buffalo, Ripken made the American Association All-Star team and ranked among league leaders in games (130; fifth), hits (131; eighth), and doubles (34; third, behind John Marzano's 41 and Tracy Woodson's 35). He was called up in September and batted .412 in eight games for the Indians before becoming a free agent after the season. =Baltimore Orioles (1996)= In 1996, Ripken was reunited with his brother when the Orioles signed him once again. Initially signed to a minor league contract, he made the team and spent the full season on the Orioles' roster, filling in at third base for the injured B. J. Surhoff from May 21 through June 6. He appeared in 57 games for the Orioles, batting .230 with 31 hits, two home runs, and 12 RBI. Defensively, he did not make a single error at third base. The Orioles reached the playoffs that year, but Ripken was left off the playoff roster. After the season, he became a free agent. =Texas Rangers (1997)= Ripken again returned to a team in 1997 when he signed with the Rangers. Initially used as a utility man, he took over at shortstop from Benji Gil on June 12 after batting .314 to start the season. That same day, he had the first RBI in interleague history, a single against Mark Gardner in a 4-3 loss to the San Francisco Giants. His stay as starter did not last long, though; he suffered a herniated disk in his back on June 17. Though he would return to play several more games that season for the Rangers, he failed to remain the starting shortstop. In 71 games, he batted .276 with 56 hits, three home runs, and 24 RBI. After the season, he again became a free agent. =Detroit Tigers (1997‚Äì1998)= The Detroit Tigers signed Ripken in December, 1997 and gave him the starting shortstop job to begin the 1998 season due to a broken ankle suffered by Deivi Cruz in the offseason. However, after 27 games, in which he hit .276, Ripken was placed on the disabled list with a knee injury. He went on a rehab assignment in June, but the Tigers opted to release him instead of reinstating him from the disabled list. This would be Ripken's last major league tenure; he chose to retire. =Legacy= While Cal, Jr., set a major league record by playing in 2,632 consecutive games, Billy often found himself on the disabled list in his career. This, however, was due to his all-out style of play. Jimmy Keenan of the Society for American Baseball Research wrote, \\"Infielder Billy Ripken attacked the game of baseball with reckless abandon and paid the price, sustaining an inordinate number of injuries during his career. He never changed his all-out, hustling style of play, earning the reputation of a player who left it all on the field.\\" Billy and Cal Ripken are one of only four brother combinations in major league history to play second base and shortstop on the same club. The others are Garvin and Granny Hamner, for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1945; the twins Eddie and Johnny O'Brien, with the Pittsburgh Pirates in the mid-1950s, and Frank and Milt Bolling, for the Detroit Tigers in 1958. Billy also holds some records of his own. In addition to having the first RBI in interleague history, he has the 27th-best all-time fielding percentage of major league second basemen, at .987. Personal life and post-MLB career On February 13, 1989, Ripken married Candace Cauffman. They live in Fallston, Maryland, and have two daughters, named Miranda and Anna, and two sons, named Reese and Jack.Bill Ripken  Aberdeen IronBirds Community Retrieved 2014-10-26. Ripken is currently a studio analyst for MLB Network and a radio personality for SiriusXM. After retiring from baseball, he partnered with Cal to form Ripken Baseball, which owns three minor league teams, the Aberdeen IronBirds, Augusta Greenjackets, and Charlotte Stone Crabs.Official Charlotte Stone Crabs website. milb.com. Retrieved November 21, 2013 Ripken Baseball and MLB.com, the official website of Major League Baseball, launched GetGreat.com on March 6, 2009. GetGreat.com is a youth baseball instructional site. Billy has taken part in the writing of several books relating to the development of young baseball players. In 2005, he and Cal wrote Play Baseball the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals, and co-authored by Larry Burke. Working with Rick Wolff, the brothers released the book Parenting Young Athletes the Ripken Way in 2006 in response to Cal seeing too many young athletes who he felt were being pressured unnecessarily by their parents. He said, \\"I was thinking, \`This just creates too much pressure on kids.' They need to find an environment in which they can explore their game ... without all these kinds of pressures being brought to bear. Once I started thinking about it, I saw we had more than enough to fill a book.\\" They also wrote Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way, co-written with Scott Lowe and published in 2007. Along with his brother, Billy formed the Cal Ripken, Sr., Foundation in 2001 to give underprivileged children the opportunity to attend baseball camps around the country and learn the game. The Foundation is a branch of Ripken Baseball. In addition to controlling these camps and Ripken's minor league teams, Ripken Baseball operates for-profit camps and designs ballfields for youth, college, and professional teams. During the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Ripken served as a first base coach for the United States national team. The United States advanced to the semifinals in the tournament. Ripken's mother, Violet Ripken, was kidnapped at gunpoint and safely returned on July 24, 2012. She was gone for 12 hours before her disappearance was reported to authorities. On October 15, 2013, she was approached by a man with a handgun in a parking lot at the NBRS Bank in Aberdeen, Maryland. The man demanded her car, but she activated a key alarm and he fled. She was unharmed. Lt. Frederick Bundick, spokesman for the Aberdeen Police, said the two incidents appeared unrelated. He is currently the national spokesman for Blue Coast Savings, a management consulting group.

It is located in the Galloway Hills, around north-east of St. John's Town of Dalry. The loch formerly had an island on which stood Lochinvar Castle, seat of the Gordon family. In the 20th century the loch was dammed to form a reservoir, raising the water level and submerging the island with the ruins of the castle. The loch is used for trout fishing. The name Lochinvar is from Scots Gaelic Loch a' bharra (older Gaelic Loch an bharra, the genitive of barr = summit) meaning \\"Loch on the hilltop\\". Consequently it is stressed on the last syllable (unlike Lochinver). Gordons of Lochinvar The Gordon family arrived at Lochinvar from Berwickshire in 1297. They established a castle, but the date of the ruins on the former island is not known. John Gordon of Lochinvar was a supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots. His son, Sir Robert Gordon of Lochinvar (c.1565‚Äì1628) was one of the first to embark in the scheme for the establishment of colonies in North America. He obtained a charter of what was called the barony of Galloway in Nova Scotia on 8 November 1621.

Sir James Balfour Paul. On 12 July 1626 he was appointed a member of the council of war for Scotland and a Commissioner for the Middle Shires, residing at Greenlaw, Crossmichael Parish, Kirkcudbrightshire. His second son, Robert Gordon of Gelston, joined with his father in the plantation of America in the grant of the barony of Galloway in Nova Scotia in 1621. His eldest son, Sir John Gordon of Lochinvar, 2nd baronet, was a supporter of Charles I and a notable Protestant.

The generally accepted legend gave the following account of her: Life Marguerite- √âl√©onore Clotilde de Vallon-Chalys, dame de Surville, was born in the early years of the 15th century at Vallon. In 1421 she married Berenger de Surville, who was killed at the Siege of Orl√©ans in 1428. Her husband's absence at the war inspired her heroic verses and his death her elegiac poems. The last of her poems is a chant royal addressed to Charles VIII. In 1803 Charles Vanderbourg published as the Po√©sies de Clotilde some forty poems dealing with love and war. The history given in the introduction of the discovery of the manuscript was evidently a fable, and the poems were set down by most authorities as forgeries, especially as they contained many anachronisms and were written in accordance with modern laws of prosody. The manuscript had been in the possession of Jean Fran√ßois Marie, marquis de Surville, an √âmigr√© who returned to France in 1798 to raise an insurrection in Provence, and had paid the penalty with his life. In 1863 Antonin Mace made further inquiries on the subject and discovered letters from Vanderbourg to Surville's widow. This correspondence makes it clear that Vanderbourg was innocent of forgery and believed that the poems were of 15th century date, and that the anachronisms of matter and form were due to retouching by Surville. But the researches of Mace interested local antiquarians, and documentary evidence was produced that the wife of Berenger de Surville was Marguerite Chalis, not Clotilde, and that the marriage dated only from 1428. Moreover, Berenger, whose death at the siege of Orl√©ans was one of the leading motives of the book, lived for twenty years after that date. Friends of M. de Surville also disclosed the fact that the marquis had contributed archaic poetry to a Lausanne journal.

Barrett was a speaker and editor of the All The Way monthly newsletter. He was general counsel of the Nationalist Movement, which he founded in Mississippi. Early life Barrett was born in New York City, and according to his biography, his family moved away to avoid the influx of Jewish and Puerto Rican immigrants. He graduated from Rutgers University, later returning his diploma to a then-Marxist professor, Eugene Genovese, following infantry service in the Vietnam War. He graduated from Memphis State University Law School in 1974. Political career In 1968, Barrett served as executive director of the South Carolina branch of the American Independent Party, on behalf of George C. Wallace's presidential bid. He organized and chaired Youth for Wallace and in 1969, he organized and chaired the National Youth Alliance (which later transformed into the National Alliance). In 1976, he was chairman of Democrats for Reagan and in 1977, he served as judge-advocate of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Writings and activities In 1982, Barrett published The Commission, a memoir advocating the resettlement of \\"those who were once citizens\\" to \\"Puerto Rico, Mexico, Israel, the Orient, and Africa.\\" Contending that non-whites, especially blacks, were inferior: \\"The Negro race... possess[es] no creativity of its own [and] pulls the vitality away from civilization.\\" He advocated sterilization and abortions of the \\"unfit\\". In 1989, Barrett visited England. He attended the Annual General Meeting of the National Front political party where he signed \\"The New Atlantic Charter\\" pledging solidarity between the party and the Nationalist Movement.The New Atlantic Charter on the Nationalist Movement website There he linked up with Alan Harvey to support apartheid in South Africa. The following year, Barrett played host to Nick Griffin.The American friends' fiasco (photo on right) Crosstar 2001 In 1992, Barrett argued the case of Forsyth County, Georgia v. The Nationalist Movement before the United States Supreme Court. In 2004, Barrett organized a booth at the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi for the public to shake hands with Edgar Ray Killen and sign a petition of support. Killen, who did not appear at the aforementioned event, was later convicted of manslaughter for his role in the 1964 Ku Klux Klan-led murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. In an interview, Barrett predicted that the nation would rally around Killen. Barrett represented Tennessee activist James L. Hart in 2006, when Hart was removed from the ballot by the GOP on the grounds of not being a bona fide member of the party due to his promotion of eugenics.\\"Lawyer says Hart could challenge disqualification - Law state used wasn't 'prequalified,' he says;\\" Bartholomew Sullivan. The Commercial Appeal. Memphis, Tenn.: April 20, 2006. p. B11. Barrett's efforts were not successful, and Hart was forced to run as a write-in candidate. Death On Thursday April 22, 2010, a neighbor called 9-1-1 at around 8:00 AM and reported seeing smoke coming from inside Barrett's home. Firefighters arrived and found Barrett's corpse near the back door of the house, which was unlocked. He had been beaten and stabbed to death by a 23-year-old black male, Vincent Justin McGee. After stealing a wallet and a gun from the victim, McGee set fire to the corpse and was apprehended within hours. At trial, McGee claimed that Barrett had dropped his pants and asked McGee to perform a sexual act on him, sending McGee into a panic. An autopsy revealed that Barrett suffered multiple stab wounds to his neck area, blunt force trauma to the head, and fractured ribs. He had been stabbed a total of 35 times. McGee was on probation after having been released in February from the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman) in Sunflower County. He had been serving a six-year sentence for assault and grand larceny and had been eligible for release in December 2010, but was released early due to overcrowding in the prison. He was staying at his mother's house three doors down from the Barrett residence at the time of the murder. After being apprehended, McGee provided the police with information which led to the arrests of three more suspects. Michael Dent, Vicky Dent, and Albert Lewis were each charged with accessory after the fact and arson. McGee pleaded guilty to manslaughter, arson, and burglary on July 28, 2011. He was sentenced to 20 years on the manslaughter charge, 20 years on the arson charge, and 25 years on the burglary charge - 65 years in total. Jerry Mitchell, the famed investigative reporter noted for his coverage of Civil Rights-era murders and injustices that had long been disregarded, including the murder of Medgar Evers, covered Barrett's political activities at length. Though an ardent opponent of Barrett's political positions, Mitchell called Barrett a \\"victim of hate\\" and noted, \\"No one deserves to be beaten and stabbed 35 times before being set on fire.

Numerous cultures believe that cheek dimples are a good luck charm that entices people who think they are physically attractive, but they are also associated with heroism and innocence, which has been included in literature for many centuries. Medical research debates whether cheek dimples can be inherited or which type of allele they are, but it is certain that humans with cheek dimples are more likely to have them in both cheeks. Depth and length appearances are affected by the shape of the skull and dimples can appear and disappear due to age. There are four types of facial dimples, including cheek, and the cleft chin (sometimes nicknamed a \\"chin dimple\\"). Overview Cheek dimples when present, show up when a person makes a facial expression, such as smiling, whereas a chin dimple is a small line on the chin that stays on the chin without making any specific facial expressions. Dimples may appear and disappear over an extended period; a baby born with dimples in their cheeks may lose them as they grow into a child due to their diminishing baby fat. Anatomy Dimples are usually located on mobile tissue, and are possibly caused by variations in the structure of the facial muscle known as zygomaticus major. Specifically, the presence of a double or bifid zygomaticus major muscle may explain the formation of cheek dimples. This bifid variation of the muscle originates as a single structure from the zygomatic bone. As it travels anteriorly, it then divides with a superior bundle that inserts in the typical position above the corner of the mouth. An inferior bundle inserts below the corner of the mouth. Cheek dimples can occur in any person, but some studies have suggested that dimples (both cheek and chin) are more common in females.: \\"Among the 120 individuals with bilateral dimples, 99 (82.5%) were female and 21 (17.5%) were male. Regarding the 96 participants with unilateral dimples, 72 (75%) were female and 24 (25%) were male.\\": \\"7.2% of the [Nigerian] population studied had both cheek dimples and chin dimple, as it was found to be present in a total of 36 out of 500 south-western Nigerians. The incidence was higher in females (n=22; 4.4%) than males (n=14; 2.8%).\\" They can be either permanent, or transient (aging makes dimples appear/disappear due to facial development and muscle growth): a Greek study spanning almost 20 years concluded that 34% of Greek adults had dimples whereas 13% of Greek youths (between 7 and 15 years old) had dimples as well, which might suggest that transient dimples are more common than permanent. Professor John McDonald, citing limited research, concluded that dimples have been mislabeled as genetically inherited and as a dominant trait. It is believed that cheek dimple genes occur on the 16th chromosome, whereas cleft chin genes occur on the 5th. However, the University of Utah considers dimples an \\"irregular\\" dominant trait that is probably controlled mostly by one gene but is influenced by other genes. Characteristics Having bilateral dimples (dimples in both cheeks) is the most common form of cheek dimples. In a 2018 study of 216 people aged 18‚Äì42 with both unilateral (one dimple) and bilateral, 120 (55.6%) had dimples in both of their cheeks. It was originally concluded that 60% of people with one dimple likely have it in their left cheek, but later research concluded that 53% were on the right, however, this may be due to differing cultures. Dimples are analogous and how they form in cheeks varies from person to person. Dimple depth and size can also vary; unilateral dimples are usually large,: \\"If it is a single dimple, then the big one is more common.\\" and a possible 12.8% of bilateral people have dimples positioned asymmetrically. They are not linked with a dimpled chin: a study from 2010 by the University of Ilorin examined 500 Yoruban Nigerians with both uni- and bilateral cheek dimples, discovering that only 36 (7.2%) had a cleft chin as well. The shape of a person's face can affect the look and form as well: leptoprosopic (long and narrow) faces have long and narrow dimples, and euryprosopic (short and broad) faces have short, circular dimples. People with a mesoprosopic face are more likely to have dimples in their cheeks than any other face shape.: \\"Most of the people included in this study had the mesoprosopic facial form (132 (61.1%)...\\" Singaporean plastic surgeon Khoo Boo-Chai (1929‚Äì2012) determined that a cheek dimple occurs on the intersecting line between the corner of the mouth and the outer canthi of the eye,: \\"Bisection of perpendicular line dropped from external canthus...\\" (nicknamed the \\"KBC point\\" in dimple surgery) but people with natural dimples do not always have their dimples on the KBC point.: \\"We found that 54.8 percent of the total dimples [out of 336 individual dimples] were not positioned on the KBC point. [...] We observed a higher prevalence of dimples among the mesoprosopic group, compared to the other two groups, with no unilateral or bilateral .\\" The other common type of facial dimple form near the mouth in three types: lower para-angle (underneath the mouth and lips), para-angle (\\"around the mouth angle\\"), and upper para-angle (above the mouth and lips).;  Society and culture  Cheek dimples are often associated with youth and beauty and are seen as an attractive quality in a person's face, accentuating smiles and making the smile look more cheerful and memorable.: \\"Some believe that dimples make a person‚Äôs smile more memorable and distinct, associating it with cheerfulness.\\" Throughout numerous cultures and history, there have been superstitions based on dimples: Chinese culture believes that cheek dimples are a good luck charm: \\"...it has come to be accepted [in Chinese culture] that a dimpled wife is one who brings happiness and good luck to the family.\\" (particularly, children born with them are seen as pleasant, polite and enthusiastic), but can lead to complicated romantic relationships; and a proverb (often incorrectly credited to Pope Paul VI) argues \\"A dimple in your cheek/Many hearts you'll seek/A dimple in your chin/The devil within\\". According to Candy Bites: The Science of Sweets, the dent in Junior Mints is based on this belief, arguing that a unilateral dimple is more attractive than bilateral. Richard Steele wrote that a dimpled laugh \\"is practised to give to the features, and is frequently made a bait to entangle a gazing lover; this was called by the ancients the Chian laugh.\\" He added: \\"The prude hath a wonderful esteem for the Chian laugh or dimple [...] and is never seen upon the most extravagant jests to disorder her countenance with the ruffle of a smile [but] very rarely takes the freedom to sink her cheek into a dimple\\" implying that dimples are alluring due to demure women that have them. Isabelle Gilbert's (not pictured) Dimple Maker claimed to make permanent cheek dimples for women who desired them. The Englishwoman's Magazine from 1866 featured an article named \\"The Human Form Divine: Dimples and Wrinkles\\", which associated cheek dimples with youth. On transient dimples, it wrote: \\"But generally, dimples mark the departure of youth, and fade away at the approach of crow's feet\\"; \\"Did you ever see a pretty child's face without dimples in it? Dimples in the cheek‚Äîtemping dimples‚Äîand a dimple in the chin that gave a roguish smartness to the face?\\" British boxer-turned-Hollywood actor Reginald Denny had his cheek dimples gushed about in a Photoplay article, which Professor Michael Williams inferred that \\"dimples might also provide a humanizing touch\\" in the handsome Denny who had \\"dimples in conjunction with the physique of a young Greek god[.]\\" Women without dimples are said to envy the women that have them because dimples are \\"pitfalls for the men\\" that \\"[are] something purely natural and unattainable by art\\". This has led to artificial attempts to create them: the Ohio-based Dolly Dimpler company advertized in Photoplay about a device that created dimples in customers' cheeks; in 1936, Isabella Gilbert invented the Dimple Maker, a face-fitting brace which pushed dents into the cheeks to emulate dimples, but it is unknown whether the artificial dimples could last this way (the American Medical Association argued that frequent users could develop cancer); and in the 21st century, people undergo dimple surgery. =In fiction= The sentiments appear in fiction: authors have described dimples in their characters for centuries to show beauty, especially in women, which has been seen as part of their sex appeal. This is possibly why cheek dimples have been identified with female characters: Anne from Anne of Green Gables envied other female characters' dimples, whereas Wives and Daughters featured a paragraph about Molly wondering whether she was beautiful as she looked in her mirror, which was followed by: \\"She would have been sure if, instead of inspecting herself with such solemnity, she had smiled her own sweet merry smile, and called out the gleam of her teeth, and the charm of her dimples.\\" Scarlett O'Hara exploited her cheek dimples in Gone with the Wind when she was flirting to get her own way,: But she smiled when she spoke, consciously deepening her dimple and fluttering her bristly black lashes as swiftly as butterflies' wings. The boys were enchanted, as she had intended them to be, and they hastened to apologize for boring her.: [Scarlett's] spirits rose, as always at the sight of her white skin and slanting green eyes, and she smiled to bring out her dimples. to the point where Rhett is implied to be aware of what she is doing.: \\"Better stick to your own weapons‚Äîdimples, vases, and the like.\\" Shakespeare often acknowledged cheek dimples, usually on children, such as \\"the pretty dimples of [the baby boy's] chin and cheek\\" in The Winter's Tale or the \\"pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids\\" from Antony and Cleopatra; however, Adonis' in Venus and Adonis are mentioned from the point of view of the flirting Venus.

Froben commissioned many book illustrations from Holbein. Printer's device of Johann Froben, by Hans Holbein the Younger, c. 1523 Johann Froben, in Latin: Johannes Frobenius (and combinations), (c. 1460 ‚Äì 27 October 1527) was a famous printer, publisher and learned Renaissance humanist in Basel. He was a close friend of Erasmus and cooperated closely with Hans Holbein the Younger. He made Basel one of the world's leading centres of the book trade. He passed his printing business on to his son, Hieronymus, and grandson, Ambrosius Frobenius. Biography Froben was born in Hammelburg, Franconia. After completing his university career at Basel, where he made the acquaintance of the famous printer Johann Amerbach (c. 1440 ‚Äî 1513), Froben established a printing house in that city about 1491, and this soon attained a European reputation for accuracy and taste. In 1500, he married the daughter of the bookseller Wolfgang Lachner, who entered into a partnership with him. Froben was friends with Erasmus, who lived in his house when in Basel, and not only had his own works printed by him from 1514, but superintended Froben's editions of Jerome, Cyprian, Tertullian, Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose. His printing of Erasmus' Novum Testamentum (1516) was used by Martin Luther for his translation. Froben employed Hans Holbein the Younger to illustrate his texts as It was part of Froben's plan to print editions of the Greek Fathers. He also employed the formschneiders Jakob Faber (the \\"Master IF\\") and Hans L√ºtzelburger. Holbein painted a portrait of Froben (c. 1522‚Äì1523), probably as a pair with one of Erasmus; the original has not survived but a number of copies have. Dying in October 1527, Froben did not, however, live to carry out this work, but it was very creditably executed by his son Hieronymus Froben and his son-in-law Nikolaus Episcopius. Froben died in October 1527 in Basel. His Hebrew ‚Äì Greek ‚Äì Latin tombstone is located in the Basel Peterskirche Peterskirche (Basel) which has been used as a reformed church since 1529. Froben is, through his descendant Anna Catharina Bischoff a direct ancestor of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Legacy Froben's work in Basel made that city in the 16th century the leading center of the Swiss book trade. An existing letter of Erasmus, written in the year of Froben's death, gives an idea of his life and an estimate of his character; and in it Erasmus mentions that his grief for the death of his friend was far more distressing than that which he had felt for the loss of his own brother, adding that \\"all the apostles of science ought to wear mourning\\". The epistle concludes with an epitaph in Greek and Latin.

A scholar and friend of Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion, he is regarded as the founder of Egyptology in Italy., p. 253 Biography He was born in Pisa, eldest son of a family originally from Pescia. After studying Hebrew and graduating in theology at the University of Pisa in 1821, Rosellini studied oriental languages under Giuseppe Mezzofanti at Bologna until 1824, when he became professor of the same subject at the University of Pisa. He was the first disciple, a great friend and an associate of Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion. They met in Florence in August 1825, during Champollion's journey to study the important Egyptological collections in Turin, Rome and Florence. In 1827, he went to Paris for a year in order to improve his knowledge of the method of decipherment proposed by Champollion. Here, he met and then married Zenobia, daughter of the Italian composer Luigi Cherubini. A year later, Rosellini accompanied Champollion in the latter's Egyptian exploration also known as the Franco-Tuscan expedition, as the leader of the Tuscan group (1828-29). The expedition was financed by the Grand-duke of Tuscany, Leopold II, and King Charles X of France. Page from I Monumenti dell'Egitto e della Nubia showing depictions of kings of Egypt, from an original at the Bodleian Libraries Champollion's sudden death in 1832 left to the saddened Rosellini the whole responsibility of publishing the report of the expedition: between 1832 and 1843 he exposed the results in his most famous work, I Monumenti dell'Egitto e della Nubia, composed of three parts and nine volumes for a total of 3,300 text pages and 395 illustrated plates. Since 1836, Rosellini's health started to decline possibly due to malaria, which ultimately led to his death on 4 June 1843 in Pisa.Bardelli 1843, pp. 32-38 All his papers were donated to the library of the University of Pisa, while the last volume of the Monumenti was published posthumously in 1844.

Boardman is one of two major retail hubs in the Mahoning Valley. The population of the CDP was 35,376 at the 2010 census.  History  Boardman was founded by Elijah Boardman in the late 1780s. Though the CDP of Boardman consists of suburban spillover from Youngstown, Boardman was traditionally an agricultural community with grain crops and apple orchards. Around the turn of the century, the railroad led to Southern Park, a horse racing facility on Washington Boulevard, making the area an early draw for Youngstown urbanites. Because of its proximity to Youngstown, Boardman was ripe for strip development starting as early as 1950.  Geography  Boardman is located at (41.038958, ‚àí80.665395). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.12%, is water.  Demographics  As of the census of 2000, there were 37,215 people, 15,955 households, and 10,211 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 2,335.8 people per square mile (902.0/km2). There were 16,801 housing units at an average density of 1,054.5/sq mi (407.2/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 95.25% White, 2.56% African American, 0.09% Native American, 0.81% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.42% from other races, and 0.85% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.80% of the population. There were 15,955 households, out of which 25.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.6% were married couples living together, 9.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.0% were non-families. 32.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.30 and the average family size was 2.94. In the CDP the population was spread out, with 20.7% under the age of 18, 7.9% from 18 to 24, 26.3% from 25 to 44, 24.8% from 45 to 64, and 20.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females there were 88.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.9 males. The median income for a household in the CDP was $40,935, and the median income for a family was $52,709. Males had a median income of $39,826 versus $25,575 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $22,757. About 3.6% of families and 5.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 6.6% of those under the age of 18 and 5.2% of those 65 and older.  Notable developments  Edward DeBartolo, Sr., a shopping mall developer, began his company in Boardman. Boardman Plaza on U.S. Route 224 (west of Market Street) was one of the first strip malls in the country. Established in 1950 by DeBartolo, the plaza had three full-service grocery stores within a few hundred feet of each other. Today one must travel at least to get the same food service. Later, circa 1970, DeBartolo opened the more contemporary Southern Park Mall, near the intersection of US 224 and Market Street. The fast food chain Arby's opened its first location in Boardman in 1964. The original Arby's store‚Äîwith the distinctive round roof architecture‚Äîremains open as a bird seed store, with a new Arby's right across the street on Route 224 near the Southern Park Mall, owned and operated by the now internationally-known chain. Also around 1950, the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, one of the great steel makers in the country, opened a modern new suburban headquarters in Boardman (right across Market Street from the DeBartolo Corporation). Here, a whole new \\"suburban\\" work environment was started; with a white shirt dress code, it was antiseptic and wholly removed from the dirt and grit of the Mahoning Valley farther north. When the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company closed in 1977, a large campus was left for others to develop. Today, the former headquarters is the center of many medical offices, a Dunkin Donuts and a branch of Youngstown State University.  Commerce  Boardman is a large, sprawling suburb. It is a busy community south of Youngstown composed of many chain restaurants. It is one of the main shopping and retail centers for the greater Youngstown area. Its main competitor is the northern 422 \\"Strip\\" in Niles, Ohio (a similar suburb of Warren, Ohio). While much development is centered on the 224 corridor, a new area of development (even further south) is surging along the South Avenue artery which parallels the southern extension of Interstate 680 between its Midlothian and Western Reserve Road exits. Boardman abuts one of the Youngstown area's most popular attractions, Mill Creek Park. Within the park grounds, there is an rose garden, several small waterfalls, a lily pond with geese and turtles, marshlands, and Lanterman's Mill, where grain is ground daily. In addition, there is a 36-hole golf course.  Education  Public education is provided by the Boardman Local School District. Boardman High School is the only public high school in Boardman. The first high school, located on Market Street, became the Boardman Center Middle School (grades 5‚Äì8) in 1969, when the new high school was built on Glenwood Avenue. Boardman Center Middle School changed again to Boardman Center Intermediate School (grades 4-6). The district operates six schools: Boardman High School, Glenwood Junior High School, Center Intermediate School, and Robinwood Lane, Stadium Drive, and West Boulevard Elementary Schools. Boardman has a public library, a branch of the Public Library of Youngstown and Mahoning County.

To grasp the inner truth of biblical religion, or the \\"Love of the Holy Spirit\\" as Teshima puts it, and to extol this existential love by embodying it and living accordingly is the essence of the Makuyas' religious life. \\"Makuya\\" is the Japanese equivalent for the Hebrew word ◊û◊©◊õ◊ü mishkan, which refers to the Holy Tabernacle, the portable shrine where God and man encounter (Exodus 29:42‚Äì43). This name aptly captures the basic religious orientation of the Makuyas, who emphasize the significance of the personal, ineffable encounter with the divine presence in everyday life. This experience, according to them, must not, and indeed cannot, be substituted by a dogmatic belief in creeds or a stabilization of a religious institution; hence, the idea of the \\"portable\\" shrine, the Holy Tabernacle. Beliefs and tenets The Makuyas stress \\"a return to the dynamic faith of the original Gospel of early Hebraic Christianity, as opposed to the dogmatic, institutionalized, European- dominated churches.\\" In their view, when Biblical religion was introduced to the Hellenistic world, its lively spirit was interpreted within Greek logic and eventually replaced by a set of theological creeds. The Makuyas, thus, seek to restore this original spirit by returning to its Hebrew roots, and learning the Bible accordingly. The Makuyas are concerned not only about individual salvation but also the spiritual restoration, or enhancement, of each nation and social group. For example, they regard the contemporary value system of Japanese society as existentially deteriorated, overtly self- centered, with little consideration of fundamental moral virtues, traditional heritage, or common and public good of the society as a whole. Unlike nearly all other Christians in Japan, the Makuyas, rather, respect their cultural heritage and seek to inspire, or \\"re-awaken\\" as they put it, the \\"existential spirit of the Japanese people.\\" In this respect, many Japanese Shintoists and Buddhists who share the same concern support Makuya's cause. Further, the Makuyas do not seek to proselytize to such believers of other religions, nor urge them to become Makuya members, for the Makuyas believe in religious pluralism, tolerance, and coexistence. In this sense, Makuya is best viewed, as they themselves see it, not as a \\"sect\\" but as a \\"movement,\\" not as an \\"exclusive\\" but an \\"inclusive\\" group. Unlike other Christians, which use the cross as their symbol, the Makuyas take the seven-armed Jewish menorah as their religious emblem, and display it on their badge or pendant. They prefer the menorah to the cross, viewing the latter as a symbol of \\"suffering\\" while the former, of \\"hope.\\" The Makuyas have developed, or incorporated, a number of religious observances, customs and rituals. They also engage in convocations, marriage ceremonies, and pilgrimages. Today, the Makuya movement has about a hundred branches all over the world, including Japan, Israel, the United States, Canada, Denmark, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, Paraguay, China, Taiwan, South Korea, India and Indonesia. Following, in part, the biblical tradition (2 Samuel 24), the movement does not conduct any census; hence, the exact number of its members remains unknown. It is known, however, that about 300,000 copies of its major magazine, The Light of Life, are being subscribed to and issued every month. For those who live in Japan, more concretely, Teshima outlined a small number of tenets called \\"Our Beliefs\\" intended to define the core beliefs of the Makuya: * We lament over the spiritual deterioration of Japan and wish for the awakening of . * We wish for the revival of religion in the hearts of the Japanese and pray for the restoration of the Original Gospel. * We stand on the basis of the Non-Church spirit; therefore, we neither belong to nor create any churches or denominations. We solely learn from the Old and New Testaments. * We wish for the purification of Christianity, however we also cherish other religions of Japan and respect the personalities of their masters. * Rising above the differences of political beliefs, we intend to sanctify Japanese society. We proclaim social justice and humanity with divine love, goodwill, and peace. Christ said, \\"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\\" (Matthew 11:28) Makuya and Israel Makuya is a group of fervent lovers of Israel and Jewish people. It sends young members to a number of kibbutzim in Israel, and makes pilgrimages to Jerusalem. \\"Over [900] Makuya students have been sent to Israeli kibbutzim to work together with the people of the Bible, and to study Hebrew and the biblical background. Some of them continue their academic studies in universities.\\" The primary kibbutz the Makuya students stay at is Heftziba. Makuya has also appeared in front of the United Nations on at least two occasions, speaking on behalf of Israel. In 1967, when the Six-Day War broke out, Teshima wrote a telegram to the Makuya students in Israel: \\"Stay as long as you can and help Israel.\\" The students, accordingly, volunteered to aid Israel during the war. In 1973, when the Yom Kippur War broke out, the State of Japan supported Arab countries, caving in to an Arab oil embargo. This diplomatic policy frustrated Teshima. Despite his serious illness (terminal cirrhosis), Teshima, then, organized, with 3,000 of his adherents, a campaign for Israel in front of the National Diet Building in Tokyo. It was the first pro-Israel demonstration ever held in Japan. The campaign received wide coverage in the press, radio, and television. However, it also worsened Teshima's illness and he died three weeks later on Christmas Day 1973. \\"Makuya Forest\\" sign Teshima's name was inscribed twice on the Golden Book of the Jewish National Fund; once in September, 1967 in honor of his staunch support for Israel during the Six-Day War and once in January, 1974 honoring his passing. His unconditional love, devotion, and support for Israel that stemmed from his biblical faith is, to this day, carried on by the members of the Makuya movement. The Jewish National Fund had planted a forest in memory of Teshima, located in the Lower Galilee. It was named \\"Makuya Forest\\". Origin Teshima was influenced by the writings of Uchimura Kanz≈ç, studying under his disciple Tsukamoto Toraji and joining the Non-church movement. Other religious figures that made a great impact upon Teshima's belief and religiosity include Toyohiko Kagawa, Sadhu Sundar Singh, and Martin Buber. In 1947, Teshima was accused of obstructing a municipal plan to destroy a local school in Kumamoto, Kumamoto Prefecture, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Teshima fled to Mount Aso in central Kyushu where he stayed in an inn for several weeks, where he claims to have had a face-to-face encounter with God. Teshima returned home and discovered the warrant had been retracted. His experience at Mt. Aso compelled him to begin a life of ministry. He set up a Bible study group which quickly grew into a movement known as Genshi Fukuin Undo (lit., Original Gospel Movement), and then as Makuya. As expounded upon in his book, The God of Uzumasa: Hachiman Worship and Nestorian Christianity, Teshima's nationalistic-Zionist beliefs were firmly rooted in the Japanese- Jewish common ancestry theory. The sympathizers of this movement include such religious thinkers and scholars as Otto A. Piper, Martin Buber, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Zalman Shazar, Hugo Bergmann, Zvi Yehuda Kook, Andr√© Chouraqui, and Yisrael Meir Lau.

A large section of the highway between Carthage and Halltown served as part of U.S. Route 66 (US 66) and is currently marked as Historic Route 66\\\\. The road was numbered due to its being an extension of K-96 and its eastern terminus was in Carthage. When US 66 was deleted east of Joplin, Route 96 was extended to replace US 66\\\\. Route 96 was redesignated as Route YY west of Route 171 when Kansas deleted the eastern part of K-96. Route description Route 96 exit from I-44 Route 96 begins at a partial interchange with Interstate 44 (I-44) just west of Halltown (there is no access to westbound I-44 or from eastbound I-44). The highway is a two-lane road and is relatively straight all the way to Carthage. Approximately west of I-44 is the western terminus of Route 266\\\\. Approximately further west, Route 96 is joined by Historic Route 66\\\\. At Albatross, is an intersection with Route 39\\\\. Approximately further west is an intersection with Route 97\\\\. At Avilla, there is a concurrency with Route 37\\\\. As the road approaches Carthage, the highway curves south, then curves west again to become Central Street. At Garrison Avenue, the highway begins a concurrency with Route 571 and the road becomes a wide boulevard. west of Garrison Avenue is an interchange with I-49/US 71\\\\. At this point, Route 571 ends and Route 171 and Business I-49, both of which join Route 96 and the road is a freeway. The first exit west of I-49/US 71, Route 96 turns off and becomes a two-lane road again. North of Joplin, Route 96 intersects Route 43\\\\. Approximately further west, Route 96 ends at Route 171\\\\. History Originally, Route 96 continued across Route 171 and turned south, curving around the west side of Carl Junction. The road then traveled further west and crossed the Kansas state line.

In the 1960s Slabinac was a member of several rock'n'roll bands. He then opted for a solo career as a pop singer and moved to Zagreb. While performing in a club, he was noticed by Nikica Kalogjera, who gave him a chance to appear as a newcomer at the 1969 Split Festival.

Feist, the third and final book in The Riftwar Saga, the first series of novels in The Riftwar Cycle . It describes how Murmandamus, a new prince of the Dark Brotherhood, marshals the forces of the Moredhel and invades the kingdom, with the intent of finding the Lifestone, a powerful relic with which he will be able to destroy every living thing in the world, so as to resurrect the Valheru Lords of old. Only Pug and Tomas can stop this new evil, thereby ending the Riftwar. Plot summary Arutha, Prince of Krondor, uses an attempted assassination as a ruse to fake his own death so that he may travel north to confront Murmandamus. In his travels to the Northlands, Arutha finds his father's former enemy, Guy du Bas-Tyra, as the Protector of the city Armengar, the first location to be invaded by the dark army under Murmandamus. In an attempt to destroy a majority of the army, Guy orders the evacuation of the city, and ignites the naphtha mines below the city. Murmandamus escapes unscathed, and the army marches towards the border of the Kingdom of the Isles. Meanwhile, Pug and Tomas begin searching the world, and eventually beyond, for the famed sorcerer Macros the Black, thought killed when he helped to destroy the rift (at the end of Magician). Macros reveals that he had put into motion a grand plot to instill Tomas with the powers of the Valheru, Ashen-Shugar, in order to turn the tides of the coming battle in their favour. Murmandamus, having successfully overrun the border city of Highcastle, marches towards his final objective: the town of Sethanon, which lies above an ancient ruins containing an artifact of power known as the Lifestone. Murmandamus lays siege to Sethanon, causing wholesale slaughter regardless of his own soldiers, in order to draw his necromantic power from their deaths. Steeped in power, he descends into the chamber of the Lifestone, and is confronted by Arutha, where they begin to duel. A rift begins to form within the chamber, held closed only by the magical efforts of Pug and Macros. Arutha manages to kill Murmandamus, revealing his true form as a Pantathian impersonating a moredhel. With his death, the escaped magical energy causes the rift to open briefly, releasing a Valheru, and a life-stealing Dreadlord. Tomas, now fully embracing his Valheru heritage, battles his ancient kin, while his dragon mount fights the Dreadlord. At the climax of the battle, Tomas stabs his sword through his enemy, and into the Lifestone, inadvertently releasing the spirits of all other Dragonlords. Their combined might, however, is no match for the Lifestone, the nexus of all life on Midkemia. They are drawn into the Lifestone and trapped for all eternity. The invasion is over. Afterwards, Macros entrusts the guardianship of the world to Pug and Tomas, saying that his task to protect Midkemia is finished, and disappears.

He was best known as the lead vocalist of the Chicago-based vocal group The Chi-Lites during the 1960s and 1970s and 1980s. He also wrote and produced many of the group's hits in the 1970s on Brunswick Records, as well as writing and producing for other acts. Record had international hits with: \\"Oh Girl,\\" \\"Have You Seen Her,\\" \\"Soulful Strut,\\" and \\"(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People\\". Biography Born in Chicago, Illinois, United States, to Booker and Bernice Record, Record was drawn to music through his older sister's involvement as a pianist. He learned to play the guitar and formed his first group while at high school with Robert Lester, who stayed on when they joined up with two members of another local group to form The Hi-Lites and eventually changing the name to The Chi-Lites. After a few unsuccessful singles, the group was signed by Brunswick Records production chief in Chicago, Carl Davis. Record wrote or co-wrote (often with singer Barbara Acklin) a long series of hits for the group, including million-sellers \\"Have You Seen Her\\" and \\"Oh Girl\\", as well as major hits, such as \\"Homely Girl\\" and \\"Give More Power To The People\\". He also wrote and produced for other artists, mostly on Brunswick, including Acklin, Jackie Wilson, The Lost Generation, Otis Leavill, and later, The Dells and The Impressions. When Brunswick began to falter due to legal and financial issues in the mid-1970s, Record decided to go solo and released three albums (entitled The Eugene Record, Trying to Get to You, and Welcome to My Fantasy) in the late 1970s on Warner Music Group without major success, before re- joining The Chi-Lites in 1980. As well as returning to sing with the group, he teamed up again with Carl Davis, formerly his mentor at Brunswick, to produce and take on executive duties for Davis' Chi-Sound Records label. Record stayed with The Chi-Lites until the mid-1980s for several albums on various labels before leaving again. Becoming a born-again Christian, he produced a gospel album on his own Evergreen label. He also continued to make occasional guest appearances with the group. In 1978, he appeared on Saturday Night Live with Michael Palin. He performed \\"Have You Seen Her\\" and \\"Trying to Get to You\\". In 1979 he recorded his only track which ventured onto the disco scene called, \\"Magnetism\\". The record was released on 12\\" single and, despite being played regularly in local clubs, did not become a hit.'Magnetism' Eugene Record www.discogs.com His 1977 track entitled \\"Overdose of Joy\\" has had a resurgence of interest.  Personal life  Eugene Record was married twice. He first married his high school sweetheart, Sandra Scott, about whom the hit, Have You Seen Her, was written. He later married his second wife, Jacqueline. Record has been erroneously reported to have married Barbara Acklin. They were never married.  Discography (1980-1985)  Record had several hits after rejoining the Chilites in the early 1980s. With Linda F. Williams, writing under the name L. F. Butler and L. Frances Butler had three releases by the Chilites: * You Take the Cake on the Changing For You album released by the Chilites in 1982. * Do What You Want on the Steppin' Out album released by the Chilites in 1984, and * Hard Act to Follow, a single released by the Chilites in the United Kingdom in 1985. This song was also recorded and released by Dutch artist, Nancy Boyd (aka: Nancy Bruinooge) in 1985 and again in 1992 on the You Can Always Count on Me album.  Discography (2000-2005)  He is a co-writer of the 2003 Beyonc√© hit record \\"Crazy in Love\\", thanks to its sampling of The Chi-Lites' \\"Are You My Woman (Tell Me So)\\". His writing contribution earned him a Grammy Award. He died on July 22, 2005, in Chicago, after a long battle with cancer. He was 64.

PragVEC played concerts during 1978 and 1979, opening for bands such as Cabaret Voltaire, Scritti Politti, the Psychedelic Furs, the Monochrome Set, Au Pairs, Magazine, Chelsea, Stiff Little Fingers and the Teardrop Explodes. During their short existence, they also recorded a total of three sessions for the John Peel programme.\\"Pragvec\\", Keeping It Peel, BBC, retrieved 2011-12-19 The last of these showed them moving away from the guitar-based sound of the first EP towards the use of the Wasp, a battery-powered portable synthesizer with a built-in speaker. Two of the songs, \\"Rural Erotic\\" and \\"Third Person\\", were re-recorded for the No-Cowboys album, released in December 1980. Packaged in a polythene bag, the record was presented as a compilation by various bands, although all of the material was recorded by PragVEC. The band split in 1981, with Cash joining Fad Gadget and the Lines. Gogan joined the Atoms. Jim Thirlwell, who had contributed Wasp synth to No-Cowboys, went on to form Foetus. Studholme, who had co-written many of the band's songs with Gogan, died in November 2005 after a long illness. Around the time of his death, he, Gogan and Cash had been working with Mute Records to compile a reissue of PragVEC material.

In shape analysis, skeleton (or topological skeleton) of a shape is a thin version of that shape that is equidistant to its boundaries. The skeleton usually emphasizes geometrical and topological properties of the shape, such as its connectivity, topology, length, direction, and width. Together with the distance of its points to the shape boundary, the skeleton can also serve as a representation of the shape (they contain all the information necessary to reconstruct the shape). Skeletons have several different mathematical definitions in the technical literature, and there are many different algorithms for computing them. Various different variants of skeleton can also be found, including straight skeletons, morphological skeletons, etc. In the technical literature, the concepts of skeleton and medial axis are used interchangeably by some authors,, Section 2.5.10, p. 55., Section 11.1.5, p. 650http://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/papers/skeletons_cvpr00.pdf.. while some other authors, Section 9.9, p. 382.., Section 17.5.2, p. 234. regard them as related, but not the same. Similarly, the concepts of skeletonization and thinning are also regarded as identical by some, and not by others. Skeletons are widely used in computer vision, image analysis, pattern recognition and digital image processing for purposes such as optical character recognition, fingerprint recognition, visual inspection or compression. Within the life sciences skeletons found extensive use to characterize protein folding and plant morphology on various biological scales. Mathematical definitions Skeletons have several different mathematical definitions in the technical literature; most of them lead to similar results in continuous spaces, but usually yield different results in discrete spaces. =Quench points of the fire propagation model= In his seminal paper, Harry Blum of the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories at Hanscom Air Force Base, in Bedford, Massachusetts, defined a medial axis for computing a skeleton of a shape, using an intuitive model of fire propagation on a grass field, where the field has the form of the given shape. If one \\"sets fire\\" at all points on the boundary of that grass field simultaneously, then the skeleton is the set of quench points, i.e., those points where two or more wavefronts meet. This intuitive description is the starting point for a number of more precise definitions. =Centers of maximal disks (or balls)= A disk (or ball) B is said to be maximal in a set A if * B\\\\subseteq A, and * If another disc D contains B, then D ot\\\\subseteq A. One way of defining the skeleton of a shape A is as the set of centers of all maximal disks in A., Section 9.9, p. 387. =Centers of bi-tangent circles= The skeleton of a shape A can also be defined as the set of centers of the discs that touch the boundary of A in two or more locations. This definition assures that the skeleton points are equidistant from the shape boundary and is mathematically equivalent to Blum's medial axis transform. =Ridges of the distance function= Many definitions of skeleton make use of the concept of distance function, which is a function that returns for each point x inside a shape A its distance to the closest point on the boundary of A. Using the distance function is very attractive because its computation is relatively fast. One of the definitions of skeleton using the distance function is as the ridges of the distance function. There is a common mis-statement in the literature that the skeleton consists of points which are \\"locally maximum\\" in the distance transform. This is simply not the case, as even cursory comparison of a distance transform and the resulting skeleton will show. Ridges may have varying height, so a point on the ridge may be lower than its immediate neighbor on the ridge. It is thus not a local maximum, even though it belongs to the ridge. It is, however, less far away vertically than its ground distance would warrant. Otherwise it would be part of the slope. =Other definitions= * Points with no upstream segments in the distance function. The upstream of a point x is the segment starting at x which follows the maximal gradient path. * Points where the gradient of the distance function are different from 1 (or, equivalently, not well defined) * Smallest possible set of lines that preserve the topology and are equidistant to the borders Skeletonization algorithms There are many different algorithms for computing skeletons for shapes in digital images, as well as continuous sets. * Using morphological operators (See Morphological skeleton, Section 9.5.7, p. 543.) * Supplementing morphological operators with shape based pruning . *Using intersections of distances from boundary sections R.

She was one of the most recognizable figures on the music scene in former Yugoslavia, and is renowned for her wide vocal range and operatic style. She also had a successful career in France. She has held many concerts around the world, being one of the few Yugoslav musicians to have sold out shows in The Royal Albert Hall, L'Olympia and Carnegie Hall. Early years Tereza was born in Dubrovnik and grew up in Konavle and Dubrovnik where she got her early music education. She won a federal young Musicians Competition in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Afterwards, she graduated from the flute program at the Zagreb Music Academy and as a student began appearing in amateur music events. In 1962, shortly after the start of her professional career, she won her first international contest at Saint-Vincent, Italy. After this success Tereza had a tour in USSR and she recorded there one EP with Italian songs for the biggest Russian music company ‚Äì Melodiya. She spent 1963 and 1964 touring USSR, Poland, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden. She also had a lot of TV appearances in these countries. Music career =France= In 1965, she moved to France, although she did not speak French. There she became a famous star. At the beginning she was singing in cabarets. Mostly in cabaret Careviƒá. She said: ‚ÄúSix tough months. I used to remain in smoke until early in the morning. Waiting for my performances I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was sitting all alone smoking cigarette after cigarette.‚Äù In 1967, she made the first recording of \\"La chanson de Lara\\" (\\"Lara's theme\\") from the film Doctor Zhivago. It was her first big French success sold out in more than 50 000 copies. After album La chanson de Lara she recorded her second French album C‚Äôest ma chanson with song \\"Je l'aime, je l'aime\\". It was sold out in more than 160 000 copies. With the song \\"Bien plus fort\\", Tereza was chosen by Grace Kelly to represent Monaco in the Eurovision. She was frequently called as La b√™te de sc√®ne or Super-Dalida by French press. In 1968 Tereza performed with Enrico Macias at the L'Olympia in Paris. It was her second Olympia after 1966. She had toured France. =1970s= During the 1970s Tereza became world-known start representing Yugoslav and French song worldwide. In Yugoslavia, her song \\"Nono moj dobri Nono\\" was popular. Claudio Villa recorded Il tuo mondo, an Italian version of Tereza's \\"Nono\\" and Mireille Mathieu recorded the French version, \\"Pour deux coeurs qui s'aiment\\". She performed on many famous festivals (in Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Sopot, Palma de Majorca, Sofia, Istanbul...) In Yugoslavia, she was honored with Best Female Singer of the Year Award six years in a row (1974‚Äì79). Her performs on Yugoslav festivals were always finished with Tereza's triumph. She won many golden records and for it, she won for several times the Yugoslav award for Best Record Seller ‚Äì Golden Bird. In 1972 she represented Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest with \\"Muzika i ti\\" (\\"The Music and you\\"). She won ninth place and recorded a French cover, La Musique et toi. At the beginning of the 1970s she moved from Paris to Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and she neglected a bit her French career. In 1978 she returned to with her interpretation of \\"Je suis n√©e ce jour-l√†\\". She recorded for EMI several French records. At that time she had many tours in Russia, Egypt, Mexico, Japan, United States, Germany, Eastern Europe... At the end of 70s she was at the height of her fame. All her records were awarded, she sang to Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito and she was Tito's favourite singer. Her biggest hits are from late 1970s are \\"≈†to je ostalo od ljubavi, Zaboravi ako mo≈æe≈°, Sviraj mi sviraj, Sve se vraƒáa sve se plaƒáa, Na Stradunu‚Ä¶\\", and others. =1980s= During the 1980s, she continued to touring all around the world. She recorded also several records in France. She continued to win on many important Yugoslav festivals in Split, Zagreb, Belgrade... She was honoured with The best Yugoslav female singer of year award for several times and she realised golden, platinum and diamond records. But the most important event was in 1988. She gave a concert at Olympia Hall in Paris. It was announced as the event of season. She recorded some records in France. Tereza finished 80s touring in Scandinavia and representing Yugoslav football team on Italian TV during Football World Cup. =1990s to present= In the decade following the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, there were wars all over the former Yugoslavia, including the Croatian War of Independence between 1991 and 1995. She defended it with a song. She had a lot of concerts in Italy, France and Germany for collecting money to the defence of Croatia. She had some concerts in Zagreb with Serge Lama. Jacques Chirac honored Tereza in 1999 with Knighthood of High Decoration of Arts and Culture. And she and was also bestowed with the Golden Chart of Humanism. She started to reconstruct a house from 18th century near Dubrovnik. It was a house of an old aristocratic family. In the new millennium, she entered with her big hit ‚Äì I ni me stra' (And I don't have any fear). In 2002 her concert from Olympia was realised on CD edition. This 2002 is important year in her career, because she had some concerts together with Michel Legrand, Oscar and Grammy winner. They performed together superbly Les parapluies de Cherbourgh. It was announced as a concert of the year. In 2005 Tereza celebrated 45 years of her career with a concert Mojih 45 skalina in Lisinski Concert Hall. Her fourth concert at Olympia Concert Hall was realised in 2007. It was her big retour in France. She recorded her Croatian album Zaustavi vrijeme (Stop the time). It was third best-selling album in Croatia. After 2008 she was toured Slovenia, Macedonia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). In 2010, she celebrated 50 years onstage with a concert \\"Jo≈° se srce umorilo nije\\" at Zagreb's Lisinski Concert Hall. Her press conference for her first post-war concerts in Serbia was heavily covered, with more than 200 journalists. In 2011 she decided to come back in Serbia and Montenegro. She participated in charity work, which included UNESCO's gala concerts.

He became son- in-law of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos and Caesar in 1180, and was later murdered in a Byzantine power-struggle. Early life It was Manuel who suggested the marriage of his daughter Maria the Porphyrogenita to a son of William V. Since Conrad and Boniface were already married, and Frederick was in the priesthood, the only eligible son was the youngest, 17-year-old Renier. The Byzantine chronicler Niketas Choniates described him as handsome, blond (his hair \\"shone like the sun\\") and beardless. Renier arrived in Constantinople in autumn 1179 and soon afterwards accompanied Manuel on a military expedition. His marriage to the 27-year-old Maria took place at the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae, in February 1180. The wedding was celebrated with lavish festivity including games in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, as fully described by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, William of Tyre, who happened to be present.William of Tyre, Historia Transmarina 22.4. Renier was given the title Caesar, was renamed John, and (according to some Western sources) was granted Thessalonica,Robert of Torigni, Chronicle, 1844 edition p. 528; Sicard of Cremona, Chronicle, 1903 edition p. 173. presumably as an estate for life, a pronoia. Maria was second in line to the throne, and had only been deprived of the succession by the birth of her much younger half- brother Alexios. Thus Renier became entangled in the perpetual power struggle around the Byzantine throne. With the death of Manuel in September 1180, the throne fell to the boy Alexios II, with his mother, the empress Maria, acting as regent. The Empress caused a scandal by taking the protosebastos Alexios Komnenos as a lover. This, combined with her Latin-friendly views, triggered a plot to end the regency (or, as some describe it, to overthrow the Emperor) and give power to Maria and Renier. The plot was discovered, and several conspirators arrested. Maria and Renier sought refuge in the Hagia Sophia cathedral with some 150 of their followers. Fighting ensued, later dubbed the Holy War as it took place in that most holy church. Eventually, the conspirators were offered an amnesty to end the hostilities. Background Both the Emperor and the conspirators soon fell victim to another usurper, however, as Manuel's cousin and rival Andronikos Komnenos returned from exile, apparently with Maria's encouragement, and, more importantly, with an army in support. Andronikos' takeover was marked by the massacre of the Latin population that followed. Maria died soon afterwards, allegedly by poison: she was, no doubt, a potential focus of opposition to the usurper. Renier seems to have shared her fate,Niketas Choniates p. 260 van Dieten. though his death is noted by very few sources.Sicard of Cremona, Chronicle, 1903 edition p. 172. Alexios II was forced to recognise Andronikos as his co-Emperor, and was later murdered. The Latin massacre had not been forgotten, twenty years later, when the leaders of the Fourth Crusade found reasons to divert their expedition to Constantinople. Later sources suggest that Renier's surviving older brother Boniface based his claim to Thessalonica on his late brother's title.E.g. Salimbene de Adam, Chronicle, 1966 edition vol. 2 p. 790.

Allen had been a prolific striker throughout his career. Early life Clive Allen was born in Stepney, London on 20, May 1961. His father is Les Allen who was a member of Tottenham Hotspur's Double-winning team of 1960‚Äì61. His younger brother is Bradley Allen and his cousins Martin Allen and Paul Allen also played football. Club career =Queens Park Rangers= He started his career at Queens Park Rangers in the late 1970s, and scored 32 league goals in 49 appearances, before moving to Arsenal. =Arsenal= Allen signed for Arsenal in the summer of 1980 for a fee of ¬£1.25m, but he did not play a single competitive match (although he did play three matches in Arsenal's 1980‚Äì81 pre-season friendly campaign). He shortly moved on to Crystal Palace in a swap deal with Kenny Sansom. =Crystal Palace= Allen was Palace's top scorer for the 1980‚Äì81 season with nine goals in the league and 11 in all competitions, when Palace finished bottom of the First Division. =Return to Queens Park Rangers= QPR, still in the Second Division, were now managed by Terry Venables (who had signed Allen for Palace) and in Allen's first season back at the club (1981‚Äì82) he scored 13 Second Division goals, though not enough to win promotion. QPR also had their most successful FA Cup run, reaching the FA Cup Final for the first time with Allen scoring the goals in 1‚Äì0 victories in both the 6th Round (vs Crystal Palace) and semi-final (vs West Bromwich Albion). Allen was injured in the final against Tottenham Hotspur and subsequently missed the replay. Over the next two seasons, Allen scored 27 League goals as QPR first won the Second Division Championship in 1982‚Äì83 and then finished fifth in the First Division in 1983‚Äì84. He moved to Tottenham for a ¬£700,000 fee. =Tottenham Hotspur= Allen scored twice on his debut on 25 August 1984, a 4‚Äì1 away win at Everton, and scored 10 goals from 18 appearances in his first season, in which Spurs finished third behind Liverpool and Everton. In 1986‚Äì87 he scored 33 League goals, and 49 goals in all competitions. He also picked up the titles of PFA Player of the Year and Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year. =Bordeaux= He moved from Spurs to join Bordeaux in March 1988. =Later career= In July 1989 he joined Manchester City, who had just been promoted to the First Division. He scored 10 league goals in his first season, but only four goals in 1990‚Äì91. He managed three appearances and scored twice in the league for City the following season, and was transferred to Chelsea in December 1991. He scored seven goals in 16 league games over the next three months with Chelsea before he joined West Ham United in March 1992, scoring once in four league games but was unable to stop them from being relegated. He scored 14 goals in the 1992‚Äì93 Division One campaign as West Ham were promoted as runners-up. His goal on the last day of the season, against Cambridge United, secured promotion to the Premier League. He played just seven league games in the 1993‚Äì94 in the new Premier League scoring two goals, against Sheffield Wednesday in August 1993. He played his final game for West Ham in March 1994 in a 0-0 FA Cup sixth-round game at Upton Park against Luton Town, coming on as a substitute for Lee Chapman. In January 1994, when Allen was out of favour at West Ham United, Tottenham manager Ossie Ardiles (who had been his Tottenham teammate the previous decade) expressed interest in bringing Allen back to White Hart Lane as he looked to spend up to ¬£500,000 on buying a striker to cover for the injured Teddy Sheringham, but the transfer did not happen. Allen opted to drop down a division and join Millwall for a fee of ¬£75,000. He ended his career with three league games for Carlisle United in 1995‚Äì96. International career In the summer of 1984, Allen was given his first England cap against Brazil. In total he made five appearances for England. American football career In 1997, he played for the London Monarchs in NFL Europe. Personal life His son Oliver was also a footballer. In 2019, Allen published his autobiography, Up Front: My Autobiography.

Their purpose is to protect the weld area from oxygen, and water vapour. Depending on the materials being welded, these atmospheric gases can reduce the quality of the weld or make the welding more difficult. Other arc welding processes use alternative methods of protecting the weld from the atmosphere as well ‚Äì shielded metal arc welding, for example, uses an electrode covered in a flux that produces carbon dioxide when consumed, a semi-inert gas that is an acceptable shielding gas for welding steel. Improper choice of a welding gas can lead to a porous and weak weld, or to excessive spatter; the latter, while not affecting the weld itself, causes loss of productivity due to the labor needed to remove the scattered drops. If used carelessly, shielding gasses can displace oxygen, causing hypoxia and potentially death. Common shielding gases Shielding gases fall into two categories‚Äîinert or semi-inert. Only two of the noble gases, helium and argon, are cost effective enough to be used in welding. These inert gases are used in gas tungsten arc welding, and also in gas metal arc welding for the welding of non-ferrous metals. Semi-inert shielding gases, or active shield gases, include carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen. These active gases are used with GMAW on ferrous metals. Most of these gases, in large quantities, would damage the weld, but when used in small, controlled quantities, can improve weld characteristics. Properties The important properties of shielding gases are their thermal conductivity and heat transfer properties, their density relative to air, and the ease with which they undergo ionization. Gases heavier than air (e.g. argon) blanket the weld and require lower flow rates than gases lighter than air (e.g. helium). Heat transfer is important for heating the weld around the arc. Ionizability influences how easy the arc starts, and how high voltage is required. Shielding gases can be used pure, or as a blend of two or three gases.Lyttle, Kevin. (2005-01-11) Simplifying shielding gas selection. TheFabricator. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.The Evolution of Shielding Gas. Aws.org. Retrieved on 2010-02-08. In laser welding, the shielding gas has an additional role, preventing formation of a cloud of plasma above the weld, absorbing significant fraction of the laser energy. This is important for CO2 lasers; Nd:YAG lasers show lower tendency to form such plasma. Helium plays this role best due to its high ionization potential; the gas can absorb high amount of energy before becoming ionized. Argon is the most common shielding gas, widely used as the base for the more specialized gas mixes.Advanced welding supply gas type guide Carbon dioxide is the least expensive shielding gas, providing deep penetration, however it negatively affects the stability of the arc and enhances the molten metal's tendency to create droplets (spatter).What You Should Know About Shielding Gas Carbon dioxide in concentration of 1-2% is commonly used in the mix with argon to reduce the surface tension of the molten metal. Another common blend is 25% carbon dioxide and 75% argon for GMAW.Choosing a Shielding Gas for Flux-Cored Welding Helium is lighter than air; larger flow rates are required. It is an inert gas, not reacting with the molten metals. Its thermal conductivity is high. It is not easy to ionize, requiring higher voltage to start the arc. Due to higher ionization potential it produces hotter arc at higher voltage, provides wide deep bead; this is an advantage for aluminium, magnesium, and copper alloys. Other gases are often added. Blends of helium with addition of 5‚Äì10% of argon and 2‚Äì5% of carbon dioxide (\\"tri-mix\\") can be used for welding of stainless steel. Used also for aluminium and other non-ferrous metals, especially for thicker welds. In comparison with argon, helium provides more energy-rich but less stable arc. Helium and carbon dioxide were the first shielding gases used, since the beginning of World War 2. Helium is used as a shield gas in laser welding for carbon dioxide lasers. Helium is more expensive than argon and requires higher flow rates, so despite its advantages it may not be a cost-effective choice for higher-volume production.Bernard ‚Äì Great Welds Need The Right Gas: How Shielding Gas Can Make Or Break Your Weld . Bernardwelds.com. Retrieved on 2010-02-08. Pure helium is not used for steel, as it causes an erratic arc and encourages spatter. Oxygen is used in small amounts as an addition to other gases; typically as 2‚Äì5% addition to argon. It enhances arc stability and reduces the surface tension of the molten metal, increasing wetting of the solid metal. It is used for spray transfer welding of mild carbon steels, low alloy and stainless steels. Its presence increases the amount of slag. Argon- oxygen (Ar-O2) blends are often being replaced with argon-carbon dioxide ones. Argon-carbon dioxide-oxygen blends are also used. Oxygen causes oxidation of the weld,so it is not suitable for welding aluminium, magnesium, copper, and some exotic metals. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-oxygen blends with 1‚Äì2% oxygen are used for austenitic stainless steel where argon-CO2 can not be used due to required low content of carbon in the weld; the weld has a tough oxide coating and may require cleaning. Hydrogen is used for welding of nickel and some stainless steels, especially thicker pieces. It improves the molten metal fluidity, and enhances cleanness of the surface. It is added to argon in amounts typically under 10%. It can be added to argon-carbon dioxide blends to counteract the oxidizing effects of carbon dioxide. Its addition narrows the arc and increases the arc temperature, leading to better weld penetration. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement; its application is usually limited only to some stainless steels. Nitric oxide addition serves to reduce production of ozone. It can also stabilize the arc when welding aluminium and high-alloyed stainless steel.

Some shielding gases, like argon, are expensive, limiting its use. The equipment used for the delivery of the gas is also an added cost, and as a result, processes like shielded metal arc welding, which require less expensive equipment, might be preferred in certain situations. Finally, because atmospheric movements can cause the dispersion of the shielding gas around the weld, welding processes that require shielding gases are often only done indoors, where the environment is stable and atmospheric gases can be effectively prevented from entering the weld area. The desirable rate of gas flow depends primarily on weld geometry, speed, current, the type of gas, and the metal transfer mode being utilized. Welding flat surfaces requires higher flow than welding grooved materials, since the gas is dispersed more quickly. Faster welding speeds, in general, mean that more gas needs to be supplied to provide adequate coverage. Additionally, higher current requires greater flow, and generally, more helium is required to provide adequate coverage than argon. Perhaps most importantly, the four primary variations of GMAW have differing shielding gas flow requirements‚Äîfor the small weld pools of the short circuiting and pulsed spray modes, about 10 L/min (20 ft3/h) is generally suitable, while for globular transfer, around 15 L/min (30 ft3/h) is preferred. The spray transfer variation normally requires more because of its higher heat input and thus larger weld pool; along the lines of 20‚Äì25 L/min (40‚Äì50 ft3/h).

This world-premiere production, with books and lyrics by Linda Alper, Douglas Langworthy and Penny Metropulos and music and additional lyrics by Sterling Tinsley, was directed by Penny Metropolus. Produced in the New Theatre, the smallest of Oregon Shakespeare Festival's theaters, the musical met with a warm reception from critics and played to sold-out audiences for the entire season. The Saroyan story was transplanted from New York to 1950s San Francisco for the musical. Twentysomething Tracy, whose jivey tiger is invisible to all but him (and the audience), falls instantly for Laura, who has her own invisible and very seductive tigress. But on his first visit to Laura's home, Tracy makes a possibly irremediable mistake. The tiger becomes visible and is hunted down on the streets of San Francisco by a compassionate police officer, under the orders of his bumbling chief. The moving finale is a scene of redemption and reincarnation of characters not seen since Act 1. Tinsley, who also played the piano in this production, worked in a wide range of musical genres, matching the genre to the character.

The band is most notable for its 1975 hit single \\"Zemljo moja\\" as well as for representing Yugoslavia at the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest with \\"Ne mogu skriti svoju bol\\" ‚Äî both times with Ismeta Dervoz on vocals. It is further notable for the 1977 hit single \\"Doƒëi u pet do pet\\", this time with Jasna Gospiƒá as the vocalist. Additionally, the band gained retroactive notability for having two of its lead singers ‚Äî Zdravko ƒåoliƒá (sang with the band from 1969 until 1971) and Hari Vare≈°anoviƒá (from 1979 until 1980) ‚Äî later go on to Yugoslav pop stardom in their respective solo careers.http://www.rockomotiva.com/starinarnica/feljton/sarajevska-pop-rock- skola-ambasadori-cola-ismeta-hari-2/ History Ambasadori were founded in Sarajevo in 1968http://sarajevo.co.ba/grupa-ambasadori/ by two military brass band musicians and Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) ranked officers ‚Äî keyboardist Robert Ivanoviƒá who had been transferred from Belgrade shortly prior to establishing the band and trombonist Srƒëan Stefanoviƒá. At the time of the band's launch, both Ivanoviƒá and Stefanoviƒá were additionally participating in the Sarajevo military orchestra. They soon brought guitarist Slobodan \\"Vuja\\" Vujoviƒá, a Fojnica-born and Sarajevo-raised mechanical engineering student, into the band. In addition to his university studies, Vujoviƒá often hung around Dom Milicije (Police House) that provided free on-site instruments for the musically-inclined youth, which is where Ivanoviƒá and Stefanoviƒá met him and got him to join their group. Ambasadori obtained their first instruments and sound equipment by purchasing them from a travelling Bulgarian ensamble that had been performing at Sarajevo's Hotel Evropa. Still mostly a cover band at this stage, their repertoire centered around the 1960s rhythm & blues covers (Chicago, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, etc.) along with more covers of obligatory Yugoslav hits of the day and years past, and finally even a few original numbers written by the band members thrown into the mix. Their very first performance took place in May 1969 in Sarajevo's Dom JNA (Yugoslav People's Army House). =Zdravko ƒåoliƒá years (1969‚Äì1971)= Soon after their debut performance, eighteen-year-old Zdravko ƒåoliƒá, a fresh high school graduate, joined the band as its new vocalist. Impressed with ƒåoliƒá's vocal range, clean intonation, and the overall ease with which he sang, the band decided to immediately start looking for as many live performance opportunities as possible. With young ƒåoliƒá on vocals, Vujoviƒá on guitar, Ivanoviƒá on keyboards, Ivica Sindiƒçiƒá on saxophone, Srƒëan Stefanoviƒá on trombone, Slobodan Jerkoviƒá on bass guitar, Vlatko Ankoviƒá on trumpet, and Tihomir Doloƒçek on drums, they gigged around town in Sarajevo ‚Äî in clubs like Trasa, FIS, and Sloga as well as the odd appearance in recently built Dom Mladih (Youth House), part of the new Skenderija complex. Most of these appearances were booked and arranged through local music enthusiast and promoter ≈Ωelimir \\"ƒåiƒçak\\" Altarac who practically became the band's unofficial manager. Over time, the group started getting more gig offers, which presented a problem since band leaders Ivanoviƒá and Stefanoviƒá as well as saxophonist Sindiƒçiƒá and drummer Doloƒçek, all of whom were also JNA officers, weren't available for many of them due to their army obligations, and those offers had to be declined. By 1970, seeing their business opportunities limited by the strange setup within the band and further discouraged by the band's founders Ivanoviƒá and Stefanoviƒá enrolling in the Sarajevo Music Academy that took up a lot of their time and focus, Vujoviƒá and ƒåoliƒá decided to step out and form a new group, Novi Ambasadori (New Ambassadors), bringing in drummer Perica Stojanoviƒá, organist Vlado Pravdiƒá, saxophonist Andrej \\"Lale\\" Stefanoviƒá, and bassist Zlatko Hold. With Vujoviƒá now firmly established as the band's driving force and main songwriter, they looked to forge a new career course. Almost immediately, Vujoviƒá's Novi Ambasadori dropped the 'Novi' part, continuing on as just Ambasadori since the original band's founders Ivanoviƒá and Stefanoviƒá quickly gave up on protecting the name. With an almost all new lineup, the band appeared at the 1970 annual schlager competition in Sarajevo where they finished in 7th place with \\"Plaƒçem za tvojim usnama\\", a song that songwriter Zdenko Runjiƒá claimed to have composed and officially signed his name under despite it being a blatant rip-off of The Tremeloes' \\"Suddenly You Love Me\\" (itself a cover of Riccardo Del Turco's \\"Uno tranquillo\\"). No one from the festival noticed the plagiarism and the band avoided controversy. The song would become the band's debut release ‚Äî 7-inch (two-side) single \\"Plaƒçem za tvojim usnama\\" / \\"Zapjevaj\\" released in 1971 by Beograd Disk label. The Va≈° ≈°lager sezone performance was further significant since it marked the band's first television appearance, exposing them to a much larger audience. One of the people in that TV audience was Kornelije Kovaƒç, an already influential and established figure in Yugoslav music circles ‚Äî former member of Indexi now fronting his own band Korni Grupa ‚Äî who took note of young ƒåoliƒá's \\"clean tenor and good stage presence\\" Ambasadori also expanded their repertoire so that in addition to R&B; they now also began playing covers of Led Zeppelin, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Creedence Clearwater Revival, etc. In the summer of 1970, Ambasadori scored a month-long gig with Indexi in Dubrovnik, their first tour-like experience and a taste of life on the road. A year later, during summer 1971, Kovaƒç finally met up with ƒåoliƒá by coming to an Ambasadori gig in Mostar. He quickly managed to convince the young singer to move to Belgrade and join his Korni Grupa as replacement for Dado Topiƒá. =Ismeta Dervoz years (1972‚Äì1976)= After ƒåoliƒá left, eighteen-year-old Ismeta Dervoz became the new Ambasadori vocalist. Dervoz's only previous musical engagement of note had been singing for cover band Kodeksi. Dervoz's first live appearance with Ambasadori came at the 1972 Skopje Festival where they performed the Kemal Monteno-written-and-composed song \\"Sviraj mi, sviraj\\". The same year, Jugoton released their 7-inch single \\"Poslednja serenada\\" / \\"Idila jednog maƒçka\\" / \\"Hej, vi\\" with Dervoz on vocals on each of the three tracks. In 1973, in line with SFR Yugoslavia's new policy of decentralization, Diskoton music label was established in Sarajevo with Ambasadori bandleader Vujoviƒá appointed as its top executive. During fall 1973, Ambasadori went on a tour of the Soviet Union. In early 1974, twenty-six-year-old Diskoton chief executive Vujoviƒá rejected a fledgling local band called Bijelo Dugme, a move that would go down in Yugoslav popular music history as an example of a bad judgement call after they signed a long-term deal with rival label Jugoton and immediately went on to nationwide fame with millions of records sold. In 1975, Ambasadori scored a sizable hit with their entry at that year's festival ‚Äî Kemal Monteno-written patriotic schlager song \\"Zemljo moja\\", inspired by and dedicated to Yugoslav gastarbeiters leaving their homeland in search of expanded employment opportunities throughout Western Europe. Finishing fourth among the sixteen competitors, they additionally won the festival's interpretation award while the main prize went to Zdravko ƒåoliƒá, their former singer who had recently gone solo, and his song \\"Zvao sam je Emili\\". Ambasadori rehearsing at Nederlands Congresgebouw in The Hague ahead of their 1976 Eurovision performance. Ambasadori represented SFR Yugoslavia at the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest in The Hague with song \\"Ne mogu skriti svoju bol\\" (written by Slobodan ƒêurasoviƒá and composed by Vujoviƒá), finishing second last among the 18 participating countries. Their disappointing finish caused a lot of negative reaction in the country and precipitated its 5-year withdrawal from the competition. Fresh off their Eurovision disappointment, Ambasadori returned to the Va≈° ≈°lager sezone where they had had so much success a year earlier. This time performing Marina Tucakoviƒá-written and Nenad Pavloviƒá-composed \\"Usne imam da ga ljubim\\", the song didn't get much attention at the festival, finishing seventh out of sixteen participants as the main prize went to Kemal Monteno and his Alija Hafizoviƒá-written love letter to the city of Sarajevo ‚Äî \\"Sarajevo, ljubavi moja\\". Yugoslav press also reported ironic heckles of \\"Bravo Hag\\" ('Good job at the Hague') during Ambasadori performance as the poor Eurovision showing continued lingering over them. Soon after the 1976 Va≈° ≈°lager sezone appearance, Dervoz left the band. She was eventually replaced with sixteen-year-old Jasna Gospiƒá. =Jasna Gospiƒá years (1977‚Äì1979)= With teenage Gospiƒá whose only prior musical experience had been signing in a band called Plima with her brother Zoran, Ambasadori leader Vujoviƒá continued the practice of acquiring young and inexperienced vocalists. Still a high school student at Sarajevo's Second Gymnasium, Gospiƒá's first appearance with Ambasadori took place at the 1977 Va≈° ≈°lager sezone with \\"Doƒëi u pet do pet\\". Composed by Vujoviƒá with lyrics by Slobodan ƒêurasoviƒá, the cheeky song turned out to be an unexpected Yugoslavia-wide hit despite failing to get much attention from the festival jury that awarded the top prize to Indexi's \\"U jednim plavim oƒçima\\". Riding the unanticipated popularity of \\"Doƒëi u pet do pet\\", the band began touring a lot more throughout the country while also continuing to appear at various schlager festivals. However, the age gap between the band members and their teenage vocalist soon began causing issues. Gospiƒá herself talked about it in later interviews, describing the strange dynamic between the band members ‚Äî all of whom were married with wives and families ‚Äî who saw the band as a job and their teenage vocalist, half their age, who was mostly concerned with hanging out with friends. Other Ambasadori members that came and went throughout the 1968‚Äì1970s include various musicians active on the Sarajevo music scene at the time and after, such as trombone player Srƒëan Stefanoviƒá, keyboard player Robert Ivanoviƒá, keyboard player Sinan Alimanovic, keyboard player Neven Pocrnjiƒá, saxophone player Ivica Sindic, drummer \\"Tica\\", trumpet player Kre≈°imir \\"Keco\\" Vla≈°iƒá (ex Pro Arte), singer Ismeta Dervoz (ex Kodeksi), drummer Perica Stojanoviƒá (ex Jutro), organist Vlado Pravdiƒá, bassist Ivica Vinkoviƒá, bassist Zlatko Hold, saxophonist Andrej \\"Lale\\" Stefanoviƒá, etc. References External links * Ambasadori Videos Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina musical groups Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Yugoslavia Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1976 Category:Yugoslav rock music groups Category:Yugoslav musical groups ","title":"Ambasadori"},{"id":"1924654","text":"The 2001 Pacific hurricane season was a near average season.

Of those, seven became hurricanes, of which two became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHS). Four tropical depressions formed and dissipated before reaching the intensity of a named storm. In the eastern Pacific proper, the season saw average activity in terms of the number of named systems, but the season also featured seven hurricanes and two major hurricanes, both totals a bit below long term averages. Overall, activity during the season was near normal. The first storm of the season, Hurricane Adolph, formed in late May, slightly ahead of schedule, and at the time was the strongest May hurricane on record. This season featured only one named storm in the month of June, followed by three in July and only one during August, including none during the first three weeks of August, a time that usually sees several storms. Activity picked up during the second half of the season, starting in September, when five named storms were observed, before decreasing to three and no storms in October and November respectively. On average, two to three tropical storms or hurricanes hit Mexico every year on the Pacific side. However, only one tropical cyclone, Hurricane Juliette, made landfall along the coast of Mexico in 2001. In addition, Adolph, Dalila, Ivo, and Lorena came close enough to land to require tropical cyclone warnings and watches. Systems =Hurricane Adolph= Hurricane Adolph originated from a tropical wave that left Africa on May 7, and was poorly organized. It was not until May 18 that the storm showed some signs of development in the Atlantic Ocean. On, May 22 the wave crossed over, and on May 25 it intensified into Tropical Depression One-E, about south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico. The system, after drifting a while, intensified into Tropical Storm Adolph the next day. Later, on May 27 Adolph was upgraded to a hurricane. Intensifying into a hurricane, Adolph rapidly intensified, and reached to Category 4 strength on May 28. Two days after, Adolph went under an eyewall replacement cycle, and weakened to a hurricane, which is minimal category 3 intensity. This trend of weakening continued, and deteriorated into a tropical storm. Passing over cooler waters, and stable air, Adolph dissipated on June 1. =Tropical Storm Barbara= A tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on June 1\\\\. The wave eventually entered the Pacific Ocean on June 10, though no further organization occurred until June 18. The system slowly organized further over the next two days, and became Tropical Depression Two-E early on June 20. Although the depression remained poorly organized, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Barbara. At 12:00 UTC on June 21, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Shortly thereafter, Barbara began encountering unfavorable conditions, such higher wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. It weakened to a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on June 26, while crossing 140¬∞W into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. The depression passed north of the Hawaiian Islands on June 25, then weakened to an easterly wave to the northwest of Kauai on June 26\\\\. The remnants of Barbara continued west-northwest until being absorbed by a frontal zone near the International Dateline on June 30. Barbara was the first tropical cyclone in the Central Pacific during the month of June, the second being Tropical Storm Boris in 2020. =Tropical Storm Cosme= A tropical wave that crossed Central America and emerged into the eastern Pacific basin on July 6.The wave moved slowly westward from July 6 ‚Äì July 10. On July 10, the convective pattern began to show signs of organization about south of Acapulco, Mexico, and the system received its first Dvorak satellite classification. Over the next two days, the system moved generally west-northwestward as multiple low- level circulations developed within a broad area of low pressure. During this period, development of the disturbance was hindered by southerly shear from an upper-level trough to the west of the disturbance that caused the system to become elongated north-south. On July 12, the upper trough cut off southwest of the disturbance and the organization improved. By early on July 13, a single low-level circulation center had become established and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed at southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Tropical Depression Three-E moved west-northwestward, and quickly became Tropical Storm Cosme on July 13, about south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The forward motion then slowed over the next 12 hours. Cosme's development was hindered by easterly shear; its peak intensity of was reached late on July 13. By early on July 14, convection was limited and well removed from the center. Cosme weakened back to a tropical depression, when it was about southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Cosme produced no more significant convection after about on July 15, at which point the tropical cyclone became a non-convective low center. The low then moved slowly westward until it dissipated on July 18 about west- southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. =Tropical Storm Erick= Erick apparently formed from a poorly defined tropical wave that traveled westward across the tropical Atlantic and reached the eastern North Pacific on July 16. The thunderstorm activity associated with the wave increased on July 18 when the disturbance was centered about south of the southern tip of Baja California. Thereafter, deep convection gradually developed around a large cyclonic gyre which accompanied the wave. It was not until July 20 that a well-defined center of circulation formed and satellite intensity estimates supported tropical depression status. Moving on a general west-northwest track, the system became a tropical storm and reached maximum winds of and 1001 mbar (hPa; 29.56 inHg) minimum pressure July 22. It then moved over relatively cooler waters and weakened as the deep convection quickly vanished. By July 24, it was just a non-convective and dissipating swirl of low clouds, although some showers re-developed intermittently. =Hurricane Dalila= Dalila's origin is a tropical wave that moved westward from Africa and over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean on July 10. It crossed northern South America and Central America on the July 15 through July 17 accompanied by vigorous thunderstorm activity, and then entered the Pacific basin on July 18 as an organized area of disturbed weather. Early on July 21, the system acquired a low-level circulation and became Tropical Depression Five-E, about south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Moving west-northwestward, it became Tropical Storm Dalila with winds 12 hours later. Dalila's track was toward the west-northwest at forward speeds between five and . The direction of motion was rather steady, varying between 285 and 300 degrees heading. This is attributed to a persistent subtropical ridge of high pressure located north of the cyclone. The center reached its point of closest approach to the coast of Mexico between Acapulco and Manzanillo on the July 22 and July 23, when it came within about of the coast. With warm sea surface temperatures and minimal vertical shear, the winds increased from on July 22 and July 23. The wind speed briefly reached an estimated on July 24, although Dalila quickly weakened back to a strong tropical storm. The storm passed directly over Socorro Island on July 25. By July 27, most of the associated deep convection dissipated as the storm moved over colder water. Reduced to a swirl of low clouds, Dalila dissipated as a tropical cyclone on July 28, while located about west of the southern tip of Baja California. =Tropical Depression Six-E= The origins of the sixth tropical depression of the season possibly developed from a westward moving tropical wave, which previously crossed the Atlantic and Caribbean. At 12:00 UTC on August 22, Tropical Depression Six-E developed. Further intensification was deemed unlikely by the National Hurricane Center, as the depression would soon enter a region of sea surface temperatures less than 77 ¬∞F (25 ¬∞C). In addition to lowering sea surface temperatures, the system began to be affected by southerly wind shear, which displaced the mid-level circulation and deep convection from the low-level circulation. The National Hurricane Center later noted the disorganized state of the tropical depression as being only \\"... a swirl of low clouds with a few showers to the north and northeast of the center\\". It became elongated, and dissipated at 06:00 UTC on August 24. =Hurricane Flossie= A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on August 11 and spawned Atlantic Tropical Storm Chantal three days later. After tracking westward toward the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the southern portion of the tropical wave split and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 21 after crossing Central America. The system initially failed to organize, although there was a closed circulation by August 23\\\\. The low-level circulation began to become well-defined as it moved away from Mexico on August 26, while convection consolidated near the center. Later that day, it was classified as Tropical Depression Seven-E. Conditions appeared very favorable for development, and after banding features increased, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Flossie later on August 26. While steering currents weakened, Flossie began to develop a cloud-filled eye on August 27, and was upgraded to a hurricane based on that and wind estimates of 75 mph (120 km/h). By early on August 29, further intensification was not expected, but Flossie suddenly deepened to a Category 2 hurricane. After winds reached 105 mph (165 km/h) and the barometric pressure fell to , Flossie entered a region with sea surface temperatures less than 79 ¬∞F (26 ¬∞C). Flossie weakened quickly, and was only a minimal hurricane 24 hours after peak intensity, which is when the National Hurricane Center noted an ill-define eye. Early on August 30, Flossie weakened to a tropical storm. On September 1, Flossie was downgraded to a tropical depression, and after becoming devoid of deep convection, the system degenerated into a remnant low on September 2. The remnants of Flossie moved inland over Baja California, eventually entering the southwestern region of the United States and dissipating. The remnants caused flash flooding in San Diego and Riverside counties in California, dropping 2 in (50.8 mm) of rain in one hour. A strong downdraft knocked a tree onto a house. In addition, four people were struck by lightning, two of them fatally. The total cost of damage caused by Flossie's remnants was $35,000 (2001 USD). =Hurricane Gil= A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa between August 14 and August 15\\\\. The northern part of the wave developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22, while the remaining portions entered the Pacific on August 24\\\\. The wave organized slowly and did not develop into a tropical depression until September 4\\\\. Situated roughly 850 mi (1,370 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, the system quickly intensified and became a tropical storm six hours later. By early on September 5, banding features became well-defined; the NHC simultaneously noted the possibility for interaction between Tropical Storm Gil and Tropical Depression Nine-E (later Tropical Storm Henriette), which was 865 mi (1,390 km) to the east-northeast. Although outflow from Henriette was predicted to slow or prevent intensification, Gil managed to become a hurricane early on September 6. Late on September 6, Gil intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Gil curved northwestward on September 6 and began to become affected by northeasterly outflow associated with Henriette. By September 7, the storm became noticeably disorganized and weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. After weakening to a Category 1, Gil accelerated northward around the circulation of Henriette. Further shearing from Henriette occurred, and early on September 8, the NHC noted that the center of Gil was near the edge of the associated deep convection. After over a region with sea surface temperatures near 73 ¬∞F (23 ¬∞C), Gil rapidly weakened, and fell to tropical storm intensity six hours later. Gil continued to weaken and was downgraded to a tropical depression early on September 9. Gil eventually absorbed the remnants of Henriette, but dissipated by 00:00 UTC on September 10 while about east of the Hawaiian islands. =Tropical Storm Henriette= A tropical wave crossed over Central America between August 28 and August 29. While south of Acapulco, it began showing signs of development. Visible satellite images early on September 4 revealed a partially exposed, but well defined low-level circulation. While deep convection was confined to the southwestern half of the circulation, the convection was close enough to the center for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Nine-E on September 4, about west- southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Early on September 5, as the depression headed westward, the separation between the circulation center and the deep convection decreased. Several hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Henriette. The cyclone slowly became better organized on September 6, with the convective pattern becoming more symmetric, while the intensity increase to . Henriette turned to the northwest and accelerated somewhat as it began to feel the influence of Hurricane Gil, then located only about 285 mi (460 km) to the southwest. Upper-level easterly flow, which was still evident over the cyclone early on September 6, lessened and a more favorable outflow pattern began to develop. Convective banding near the center became better defined, and Henriette reached its peak intensity of on September 7\\\\. The cyclone began weakening due to cold waters and its proximity to Gil. A Fujiwhara interaction between Henriette and Gil occurred on September 8\\\\. Henriette soon dissipated after losing its closed low-level circulation, as evidenced by low-cloud trajectories. =Tropical Storm Ivo= Ivo formed from a large tropical wave that moved off the African coast on August 26. The wave was accompanied by a large cyclonic rotation at the low to middle levels and numerous thunderstorms when it entered the eastern Atlantic. On August 28, the wave spawned a northward-moving vortex in the eastern Atlantic, but the wave's southern portion continued westward with very limited convective activity. Once the wave reached the western Caribbean Sea on September 5, the shower activity increased and the whole system continued slowly westward over Central America. The cloud pattern gradually became better organized and by September 9, satellite images showed a low to middle level circulation centered near Acapulco, Mexico. The next day, a portion of the system moved over water and it became a tropical depression about south- southwest of Acapulco on September 10. The center of the depression moved slowly west and west-northwestward with its circulation hugging the southwest coast of Mexico. There was moderate easterly shear over the depression as indicated by the location of the convection to the west of the center. Satellite images and a report from a ship indicated that the depression reached tropical storm status by 06:00 UTC September 11. Thereafter, there was only slight strengthening and Ivo reached its maximum intensity of and an estimated minimum pressure of 997 mbar (hPa; 29.44 inHg) on September 12. The tropical storm moved toward the northwest and then west over increasingly cooler waters, and gradually weakened. It became a low pressure system devoid of convection by the end of September 14. =Tropical Depression One-C= Tropical Depression One-C formed on September 11 more than 400 mi (644 km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii. The system moved west northwestward to 15¬∞N 153¬∞W by September 11, and then southwestward shortly thereafter. The system was poorly organized, and the convection of Tropical Depression One-C dissipated later on September 11. Having only lasted 12 hours as a depression; Tropical Depression One-C never reached tropical storm strength. =Hurricane Juliette= An area of disturbed weather associated with the remnants of Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine organized directly into Tropical Storm Juliette on September 21. Sustained intensification began the next day. Juliette eventually peaked as a Category 4 hurricane with a central pressure of 923 mbar (hPa; 27.26 inHg), which made it the fifth-most intense Pacific hurricane at the time. Juliette turned north and weakened and made landfall as a minimal hurricane. Juliette's remnants hung on for a few more days until they dissipated on October 3. Juliette dumped heavy rains on the Baja California Peninsula and in Sonora, where it caused two deaths. Its effects were especially hard on Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur, which was cut off from the outside world for a few days. The remnants of Juliette moved into the state of California, where they caused thunderstorms, rain, and some downed power lines. The total estimated cost of damage was $400 million (2001 USD; $ USD). =Hurricane Kiko= A tropical wave that led to the formation Atlantic Hurricane Felix over the eastern Atlantic on September 7 also seems to have produced Kiko. This wave moved westward at low latitudes, crossing northern South America on September 13 ‚Äì September 14 and Central America on September 15 and September 16. By September 17, cloudiness and showers increased near the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The area of disturbed weather moved westward for the next few days, without much increase in organization. On September 21, the system's cloud pattern became more consolidated, and curved bands of showers were evident. It is estimated that Tropical Depression Twelve-E had formed that day, at which time it was centered about southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. After forming, the system, which was located in an environment of easterly vertical shear, strengthened slowly. By September 22 the organization of the cloud pattern improved to the extent that tropical storm strength was estimated to have been reached. Kiko turned from a northwestward to a west-northwestward heading that day. Although some easterly shear continued to affect the system, very deep convection persisted near the center, and based on Dvorak intensity estimates, Kiko strengthened into a hurricane around September 23. A little later on September 23, deep convection decreased in coverage and intensity and Kiko weakened back to a tropical storm. The system continued to lose intensity on September 24, at least in part due to the entrainment of more stable air at low levels. Kiko weakened to a tropical depression on September 25, by which time southwesterly shear also became prevalent. Later on September 25, the cyclone degenerated into a westward-moving swirl of low clouds with little or no deep convection. Kiko's remnant low persisted and continued moving generally westward for several more days with intermittent, minor occurrences of deep convection within the circulation. It was finally absorbed into a frontal system to the northeast of the Hawaiian Islands on October 1. =Tropical Depression Two-C= Tropical Depression Two-C formed near 10¬∞N 147.4¬∞W on September 22, southwest of Tropical Storm Kiko (in the East Pacific). Throughout September 23, Tropical Depression Two-C remained a poorly organized system that slowly moved west- northwestward. A slight increase in convection became apparent on September 24, and was followed by a period of consistent thunderstorm activity near the circulation center. Tropical Depression Two-C continued in the west-northwest direction, but weakened by September 25. =Tropical Storm Lorena= The tropical wave that eventually developed into Lorena moved off the west coast of Africa on September 13. The poorly defined wave tracked rapidly westward across the Atlantic for more than a week. There was little or no thunderstorm activity associated with the wave until it moved across Central America on September 27. Significant deep convection finally developed on September 29 and satellite classifications began on September 30 when the system was located about south of Acapulco, Mexico. The wave possessed a well-defined closed low-level circulation at that time. Convection steadily increased and banding features developed during the day on October 1. Satellite intensity estimates indicate the system became Tropical Depression Thirteen-E at October 2. Low-level circulation had tightened up considerably and satellite intensity estimates indicated the depression had strengthened into Tropical Storm Lorena about south-southwest of Acapulco. Lorena tracked steadily west-northwestward at eight to the remainder of the day and gradually turned toward the northwest early on October 3. The peak intensity of occurred later that day as Lorena took a more northerly track when it was located about southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. By October 4, the forward speed of Tropical Storm Lorena had decreased to around seven to nine mph (11 to 14 km/h) and strong upper-level southwesterly shear began to adversely affect the cyclone. Lorena weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated into a non-convective low later that day about southwest of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The remnant low-level cloud circulation remained offshore and persisted for another day or so before completely dissipating just west of Cabo Corrientes, Mexico. =Tropical Depression Fourteen-E= Tropical Depression Fourteen-E developed from a small swirl of low clouds that was first observed along the Intertropical Convergence Zone well to the south-southwest of Baja California on September 30\\\\. Little development occurred until October 3, when the system began to generate more persistent deep convection. While the system was located about southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, the NHC began to classify it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. Although it appeared that wind shear was at initially predicted to remain at a favorable level, an upper-level low to the southwest of the depression generated wind shear greater than expected, and convection significantly weakened only hours later. Despite significant effects from wind shear, the depression was still forecast to intensify into a tropical storm. Later that day, the low-level center of the depression became more difficult to locate on satellite images, and the location of the poorly defined center was estimated. Convection significantly decreased again early on October 4, and the depression dissipated southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. The remnant low cloud swirl continued westward for another 24‚Äì36 hours before dissipating completely. =Tropical Storm Manuel= Tropical Storm Manuel formed from the remnants of Hurricane Iris from the Atlantic Basin. The core circulation of Iris had dissipated over the mountains of eastern Mexico, while new convection was developing a short distance away over the waters of the Pacific. This area became better organized over the next 18 hours and became Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at October 10, about south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The depression moved at 15‚Äì16 mph (24‚Äì26 km/h), first westward and then west-northwestward. An upper-level anticyclone centered over southern Mexico was producing some easterly shear in the environment of the depression, but when this shear lessened the system became Tropical Storm Manuel on October 11, about south-southwest of Zihuatanejo, Mexico. An estimated initial peak intensity of was reached that day when the first clear banding features developed. However, the banding was short-lived, deep convection diminished, and satellite microwave imagery early on October 12 suggested that the circulation was becoming elongated. Wind shear returned, this time from the northwest, and Manuel turned to a west-southwesterly track and slowed. By October 12, Manuel had weakened to a tropical depression. Manuel remained a disorganized depression for the next two and a half days. It continued moving to the west-southwest, but slowed to a drift as a mid-level ridge to the north of the cyclone gradually weakened. An upper-level trough dug southward to the west of Manuel early on October 15, and Manuel began to move to the north-northwest. Convection redeveloped near the center and Manuel regained tropical storm strength on October 15 about south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Wind shear decreased and Manuel strengthened, reaching its peak intensity of winds, and a pressure of 997 mbar (hPa; 29.44 inHg) on October 16 about southwest of Cabo San Lucas. By this point, water temperatures under the cyclone were decreasing and shear, this time from the southwest, was increasing. Manuel began to weaken while moving to the west- northwest and northwest. It became a depression at October 17 about west- southwest of Cabo San Lucas, and dissipated to a non-convective low shortly after October 18. The remnant low moved slowly westward for a couple of days over cool waters before its circulation dissipated completely. =Hurricane Narda= Narda developed from a westward moving tropical wave that crossed Dakar, Senegal around the October 3. The wave became convectively active after it crossed Central America when it produced a large burst of convection in the Bay of Campeche on the October 15. The southern portion of the wave continued westward over the Pacific waters south of Mexico and under favorable upper- level winds, it began to acquire banding features and several centers of circulation. The system finally consolidated and developed one center at October 20. It became a tropical depression about southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Moving on a west-northwest track, it intensified and reached tropical storm status later that day. The cloud pattern continued to become better organized and visible satellite imagery showed an intermittent eye feature, and it is estimated that Narda became a hurricane at October 21. Narda peak's intensity of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg) occurred on October 22. Thereafter, a gradual weakening began and strong shear took a toll on Narda. The tropical cyclone became a tight swirl of low clouds with intermittent convection on October 24, as it moved westward steered by the low-level flow and crossing 140¬∞W over the Central Pacific area of responsibility. It then continued westward as a tropical depression until dissipation. =Hurricane Octave= The final tropical depression of the season likely developed from a weak tropical wave that moved westward across Central America on October 22\\\\. Following an area in convection on October 27 and the formation of a low-level circulation, the system was declared a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on October 31, while centered about southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. The depression was initially affected by easterly upper-level winds and outflow was restricted on the eastern quadrant. The depression intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Octave six hours after forming. Although cloud tops warmed on October 31, Octave organized further, and the NHC noted that the storm began to resemble a hurricane early on November 1. Shortly thereafter, no significant intensification was predicted, as the cloud pattern was becoming elongated, vertical wind shear would soon increase, and Octave would soon entering a region of decreasing sea surface temperatures. However, Octave re-organized and an eye feature began developing later on November 1. The storm was upgraded to a hurricane after a ragged eye developed and T-numbers reached 4.0 on the Dvorak Scale. Early on November 2, Octave attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg). Wind shear began to increase, while sea surface temperatures were decreasing, causing the low-level circulation to become gradually displaced from the associated deep convection. However, the storm remained a hurricane until 18:00 UTC on November 2. By early on November 3, only minimal deep convection was associated with Octave. The NHC downgraded the system to a tropical depression later that day. Deep convection associated with Octave remained minimal, and the system had degenerated into a remnant low located about west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California at 00:00 UTC on November 4. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 2001. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2007 Pacific hurricane season. This is the same list used for the 1995 season except for Ivo, which replaced Ismael. A storm was named Ivo for the first time in 2001. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. { width=\\"90%\\"  * Adolph * Barbara * Cosme * Dalila * Erick * Flossie * Gil * Henriette  * Ivo * Juliette * Kiko * Lorena * Manuel * Narda * Octave *    } For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 2001 are shown below, however none of them were of them were used. { style=\\"width:90%;\\"  *  *  *  * } After the season had begun the names Adolph and Israel (the original replacement for Ismael) were retired for political considerations, after a row brewed over the use of their names.

These outlets were abolished for intra-EU travellers in 1999, but are retained for travelers whose final destination is outside the EU. They also sell to intra-EU travelers but with appropriate taxes. Some special member state territories such as √Öland, Livigno and the Canary Islands, are within the EU but outside the EU tax union, and thus still continue duty-free sales for all travelers. Tax Free World Association (TFWA) announced that in 2011 Asia-Pacific, with 35 percent of global duty-free and travel retail sales, beat Europe and Americas, with these regions accounting for 34 percent and 23 percent respectively. 31 percent of sales came from the fragrances and cosmetics category, followed by the wine and spirit category with 17 percent and then comes tobacco products. The world's largest airport by duty-free sales is South Korea's Incheon Airport, with US$1.85 billion in 2016, narrowly overtaking Dubai Duty Free with 2016 sales of $1.82 billion. History Brendan O'Regan established the world's first duty-free shop at Shannon Airport in Ireland in 1947; it remains in operation today. Designed to provide a service for trans-Atlantic airline passengers typically travelling between Europe and North America whose flights stopped for refuelling on outbound and inbound legs of their journeys, it was an immediate success and has been copied worldwide. Thirteen years later, two American entrepreneurs, Charles Feeney and Robert Warren Miller, founded what is now Duty Free Shoppers (DFS) on 7 November 1960. DFS started operations in Hong Kong and spread to Europe and other places around the globe. Securing the exclusive concession for duty-free sales in Hawaii in the early-1960s was a commercial breakthrough for DFS, which enabled the company to focus on Japanese travelers. DFS continued to innovate, expanding into off-airport duty-free stores and into large downtown Galleria stores; it grew to become the world's largest travel retailer. In 1996 LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired the interests of Feeney and two other shareholders and jointly owned DFS with Miller. In this same period, several locales grew as duty-free shopping destinations. They are exemplified by Saint Martin and the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, Hong Kong and Singapore. Still others claim prices competitive to duty-free. Generally, goods are free of duty and tax levied on imports for sale anywhere in the shopping destination. Merchants may pay inventory/business or other taxes, but their customers usually pay none directly. The mere absence of duty or other taxes on goods being sold does not assure that they are bargains. Costs of identical goods from different duty- free sources can vary widely. They often depend on the presence or absence of nearby competition, e.g., airport stores, especially if all at any airport are owned by a single firm such as Dufry. Also, prices can often be driven upward by the costs of buyer convenience, e.g., in-flight sales by airlines. Many airlines, such as Emirates, El Al, Singapore Airlines, Middle East Airlines, Ukraine International Airlines, Delta, and Avianca, offer duty-free sales on their flights. Duty-free shopping away from ports Some duty-free shops operate in central business districts away from airports or other ports. In Japan, for example, any visitor whose passport indicates that they have been in the country for less than six months can buy items without paying consumption tax, so long as the total purchase value exceeds ¬•5,000 and the items will not be consumed in Japan. Duty-free shops are a mainstay in the Akihabara electronic shopping district of Tokyo. In Thailand, the King Power chain has shops where duty-free items are pre-purchased and delivered separately to the airport to be picked up on departure. For certain other purchases, a VAT refund may be claimed at the airport upon departure. In the Philippines, there is one shopping mall called the Duty Free Philippines Fiestamall, which is located a few miles away from Ninoy Aquino International Airport as opposed to being at the airport itself. It is the only shopping mall of its kind in the world. The goods that are sold in this mall are often imported products which come from around the world (mainly from United States, Asia and Australasia) and are not found in any other shopping malls in the country, aside from duty-free malls. Tourists, visitors and returning citizens of Philippines often pay a visit to this mall shortly after their arrival (since only arriving passengers and their companions are allowed access). In order to gain entry, a passport is needed to be presented and registered at the Customer Registration Counter at the entrance of the mall. The customer will then be issued a shopping card; these shopping cards must be presented to the cashier for validation of purchases. Arriving customers are given a certain tax-free allowance on purchases and anything in excess will be subject to local and national taxes. In the past, the mall used to only accept US dollars and Philippine peso but in recent years, it had begun accepting other currencies such as Japanese yen, Brunei dollar, Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Saudi riyal, Bahraini dinar, and Thai baht. Currency exchange booths are also available inside the mall if a customer wishes to exchange currencies into Philippine pesos or US dollars. Credits cards can also be used for purchasing goods.Duty-free shops usually sell a broad range of alcoholic drinks. In Australia, duty-free shops, once common, have all but disappeared since the introduction of GST in 2000. Retailer James Richardson operates several duty-free shops in major cities, but most duty-free shops are now located within international airports. Residents and tourists are allowed to purchase virtually any physical good within 60 days of departure, which needs to be taken on the outward flight, and claim the GST component back through the Tourist Refund Scheme when passing through customs. Consumers are now free to fully use their items prior to departure. This is in contrast prior to 2000, where all purchases had to be packed by the duty-free store in a sealed clear plastic bag, and could only be broken open by customs staff just prior to departure. =Duty-free outside EU ports= Any traveller living in a country outside the EU VAT area is entitled to shop tax-free at participating shops in the EU. Tax free shopping differs from duty free shopping as the traveller pays the VAT on goods in the shop in the usual way, and can then request a refund when exporting the goods. There are a number of tax-free operators who can support both the stores and the traveler through this process. To qualify, the traveller must: *have residency in a non-EU country *have a maximum stay of six months within the EU *make purchases no more than three months prior to export *obtain a form from the shop where he or she makes the purchase (depending on the tax-free operator) *present the form, and in certain cases the goods, to a customs officer or DIVA machine when leaving the EU, where they will be stamped Only goods meant for personal use are eligible for the refund. The stamped forms and receipts can then be sent back to the retailers, or their agents, for a refund. In most cases, a minimum purchase applies to use the tax-free shopping scheme. The actual amount of VAT reclaimable depends on the VAT rate applicable in the particular country to the goods purchased, and may be subject to a deduction for administration fees. Security considerations Travelers on long-haul routes with at least one transit stop between their departure airport and destination airport should be careful to purchase their duty-free alcohol or perfume at the last transit port, as otherwise they may have it confiscated by security when they board at the transit port, as they will be exceeding the current limit on liquids in hand baggage. This does not apply to passengers transferring within the EU and Singapore on the same day, as long as the liquid item is sealed in a plastic security bag with the receipt showing in the bag. Arrivals duty-free shops are now becoming more common. Most of South and Central America, and the Caribbean have such shops, as does South East Asia and Oceania. Switzerland and Canada are looking to introduce them in 2010. This method of retail removes any security problems with the transit of liquids, as they are not carried on aircraft. Several airlines do not allow sales of certain sharp objects in-flight due to security risk. Other objects that have sharp parts, such as model airplanes, may be bought in-flight but received at the passengers' home address for the same reason. = Boarding Pass / Passports = Proof of travel may be requested at the checkout point to prevent airport employees from making personal purchases. Inbound duty- free Some countries or districts, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Iceland, Italy, Iran, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Lebanon, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan have inwards duty-free facilities, where arriving passengers can purchase duty-free items immediately before going through customs. This not only saves the inconvenience of having to carry these items around the world but also solves the security problem mentioned above. Other countries such as Canada and Sweden have been considering duty-free on arrival. The European Union does not permit arrivals duty-free stores; some EU airports sell goods on arrival in the baggage claim area described as \\"Tax-Free\\", but these goods are all tax-paid sales, the local sales tax is discounted. Normally, discounted liquors or tobacco products cannot be bought when arriving into an EU Member State as there is often a high local Excise Duty on these goods as well as the local sales tax (VAT/IVA/TVA) which is included in the price. In some EU Territories the tax on tobaccos and liquors is lower than in other EU countries, which is why the prices still seem competitive and look like duty-free prices. A good example is the difference in tobacco prices between the UK and Ireland, compared to Spain or Portugal. Legal basis It is a common feature of most tax systems that taxes are not raised on goods to be exported. To do so could place the goods at a disadvantage to those from other countries, for example if the tax rate in the territory of sale is higher than the tax rate in the territory of consumption. Either the tax system allows the goods to be exported without taxes (stored prior to export in a bonded warehouse), or taxes can be claimed back when they are exported (see VAT). Such exemption also applies to goods supplied for use on ships and aircraft, because they are consumed outside the country. Businesses supplying such goods can do so tax- and duty-free. Goods sold to passengers on board ships or aircraft are tax free. The passenger can either consume them on board, or import them tax-free into the country they are traveling to, so long as they are within the traveler's duty-free allowance. Most tax regimes also allow travelers entering a country to bring in a certain amount of goods for personal use without paying tax on them, the so-called \\"duty-free allowance\\"; because it is not economically justifiable to collect the small amounts of tax involved, and would be an inconvenience to the passengers. A duty-free shop works under the same system. The goods must be exported intact (they cannot be consumed in the country of sale), and they are importing into the destination country under that country's own tax rules. In some countries, in order to ensure that goods are exported intact, they are hand-delivered in a closed bag to the passenger at the gate after their ticket is scanned. In the United States, duty-free shops are technically considered class 9 Bonded Warehouses with regard to the U.S. Customs & Border Protection: * Class 9. Bonded warehouse, known as duty-free stores, used for selling, for use outside the Customs territory, conditionally duty-free merchandise owned or sold by the proprietor and delivered from the Class 9 warehouse to an airport or other exit point for exportation by, or on behalf of, individuals departing from the Customs territory for destinations other than foreign trade zones. Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1555(b)(8)(C), Customs territory, for purposes of duty-free stores, means the Customs territory of the U.S. as defined in 101.1(e) of this chapter, and foreign trade zones (see part 146 of this chapter). All distribution warehouses used exclusively to provide individual duty-free sales locations and storage cribs with conditionally duty-free merchandise are also Class 9 warehouses. Moreover, in the U.S. some duty-free stores will sell their goods to domestic passengers with appropriate taxes included. Alcohol and tobacco products are restricted to international passengers only and subject to the age limitations of 18 and 21 respectively, even though the age one must be to import those items into other countries may be lower. =Visiting U.S. protectorates= U.S. citizens receive substantially higher duty exemptions than normal when they visit or transit these locales, e.g., Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands.

He is sometimes credited as Danijel Popoviƒá (–î–∞–Ω–∏—ò–µ–ª –ü–æ–ø–æ–≤–∏—õ). Biography Born to a Montenegrin father and a Belgian mother, Popoviƒá was raised in Titograd, but made his name in Zagreb, where he moved in 1977 to pursue a career in pop music. In 1983, as a regional representative of Croatia (TV Zagreb), he won the right to represent Yugoslavia at the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"D≈æuli\\" (\\"Julie\\"). His national victory was somewhat unexpected because most observers saw popular folk singer Lepa Brena, a regional representative of Vojvodina (TV Novi Sad), as a clear favourite. Daniel achieved 4th place in Munich, equaling at the time the best ever Yugoslav placing at the Eurovision Song Contest (Lola Novakoviƒá's 4th- place finish in 1962). \\"D≈æuli\\" was also a huge hit in Yugoslavia: the album sold 717,166 copies while the single sold further 80,883 ‚Äì a huge number for Yugoslavia in both cases. The song was a big hit in many other European countries as well, including Norway, where Daniel played several venues. Early in 1984, he performed at a NRK broadcast TV show prior to the Sarajevo Winter Olympics, playing \\"D≈æuli\\" and a new song called \\"Miss You\\". Like many other ESC contestants, Daniel failed to build on his triumph, and his commercial appeal gradually declined. By the 1990s, his popularity was already on the wane, though he managed to register one more moderate hit in 1991 ‚Äì a track called \\"Daj obuci levisice\\" that he competed with at 1991 Jugovizija representing HTV and placing second, only two points behind the winning song \\"Brazil\\" by Bebi Dol. A few years earlier, he had also featured in the Lepa Brena folk hit \\"Jugoslovenka\\". He stayed in Croatia during the war and disappeared into anonymity after a few unsuccessful albums. Tapping into his savings, he opened a studio and started producing records for performers like Nives Celzijus (her first and so far only album Cura moderna). He would foray back into singing only occasionally. During the summer of 2001, he took part in the Sunƒçane Skale festival in Herceg Novi, but managed to get only 7 points (winner Ivana Banfiƒá received 107). In early 2005, after an extended commercially barren period in Croatia, Daniel moved back to Montenegro, hoping to resurrect his stuttering singing career. In late 2005, his performance in Munich in 1983 was included in a collection of two double DVDs and two double CDs celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest. The collection, which consisted of all the winners as well as a few of the most favourite non-winning contestants, was entitled Congratulations (1956-1980 and 1981-2005). A glimpse of Daniel's 1983 act could also be seen in the celebration show broadcast from Copenhagen in October 2005. In January 2007, it was reported that Daniel would take part in the Croatian pre-selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, Dora, together with his son Sebastian (20) and daughter Isabella (16), as well as Snje≈æana Ivana Pandl (17). Their song did not make it to the final selection process. In late 2009, he was a contestant on Kmetija reality show, Slovenian version of The Farm. Personal life Daniel has been married 4 times. He wed his first wife Marija in 1978; the couple were divorced by the mid-1980s, when, in 1986, he married macedonian Maja and have baby Ana Marija, than he married Sanja Bjedov and had two children with her: son Sebastian, and daughter Isabella Kim. The couple separated in 1994 before finalizing their divorce in 1996. By that time Daniel was in a relationship with Sandra Bagariƒá whom he soon married and had a son Dominik with. Soon after moving from Zagreb to Podgorica in early 2005, the couple separated and divorced. In August 2005, he was hit with public allegations of spousal abuse by his ex-wife Sandra Bagariƒá who accused him of \\"repeated, jealousy-induced physical and mental maltreatment\\". In March 2008, news appeared in certain media outlets about the possibility that Daniel might end up serving time in prison for not paying child and spousal support to his second wife, Sanja Bjedov, and their two children. In spring 2008, a Croatian court ordered him to pay HRK219,000 (~‚Ç¨31,000) in back spousal and child support payments. In October 2009, during a club appearance in Zagreb his ex- wife Sandra brought their son Dominik along and claimed Daniel owes them ‚Ç¨2,000 in unpaid child support.

A violent Quebec sovereignty movement, the Ch√©nier Cell attempted to usurp the elected Government of Quebec and create a Qu√©b√©cois people's uprising to establish a new Quebec state independent of Canada. The four known members of the Ch√©nier Cell were: Paul Rose, Jacques Rose, Francis Simard and Bernard Lortie. Timeline On October 5, 1970, members of another Montreal based FLQ cell, the Liberation Cell, kidnapped the United Kingdom Trade Commissioner James Richard Cross from his Montreal home.The October Crisis On October 8, 1970, the FLQ Manifesto was broadcast by CBC/Radio-Canada as one of the many demands required for the release of James Cross.FLQ Manifesto The manifesto criticised big business, the Catholic Church, Ren√© L√©vesque, Robert Bourassa and declared Pierre Trudeau \\"a queer\\". On October 10, 1970, the Ch√©nier Cell kidnapped the Vice-Premier of Quebec and Labour Minister, Pierre Laporte. The kidnappers approached Laporte, while he was playing football with his nephew on his front yard and forced him into their vehicle at gunpoint. The members of the Ch√©nier Cell believed many other Qu√©b√©cois people would follow them in an uprising to create an independent state. On October 15, 1970, the Government of Quebec put forward a request for the Canadian Armed Forces to support the Service de police de la Ville de Montr√©al. On October 16, 1970, the Federal Government of Canada proclaimed the existence of a state of \\"apprehended insurrection\\" under the War Measures Act. These emergency regulations outlawed the FLQ and made membership a criminal act. In addition, normal liberties were suspended and arrests and detentions were authorized without charges. On October 17, 1970, the day after the Government of Canada invoked the War Measures Act, the Ch√©nier Cell announced that they had executed Laporte. Laporte was found strangled in the back of a stolen motor vehicle abandoned near the Montreal Saint-Hubert Longueuil Airport. In late December 1970, four weeks after the members of the Liberation Cell were found by authorities, the Ch√©nier Cell members were located in a farmhouse basement at Saint-Luc, Quebec. The Ch√©nier Cell members were put on trial and three were convicted for kidnapping and murder, while Jacques Rose was convicted of being an accessory after the fact with all members pleading \\"responsible\\".

One of the most popular segments of the entire year on Mike & Mike was the annual \\"Sheet of Integrity\\" wager, a bracket wager based on the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament and the massive ESPN.com bracket contest. The bet originated after Golic told of how he would enter a massive number of sheets into different pools to win the money involved in the pool.

He was one of the first major historians of the American Revolutionary War. During the Revolution he served in the South Carolina legislature until he was captured by the British. After his release he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1782-1783 and again in 1785-1786\\\\. Afterwards he served in the state House and Senate until retiring from public service. He was murdered in 1815 by a mentally ill man whom Ramsay had examined as a physician. Early life and family David Ramsay was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the son of an Irish emigrant. His brother was Nathaniel Ramsey, a Congressman and a brother-in-law of painter Charles Willson Peale. He attended college at Princeton, and graduated in 1765. In 1773, he received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Ramsay settled in Charleston, South Carolina, where he built a large practice as a physician. Ramsay's first two marriages were brief, both ending with the death of his wife after one year. In 1775, he married Sabina Ellis (b. 1753), and in 1783, he married Frances Witherspoon (b. 1759). His second wife was the daughter of John Witherspoon, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and president of Princeton (then the College of New Jersey). On January 28, 1787, Ramsay married Martha Laurens (1759‚Äì1811), daughter of Henry Laurens, a wealthy Charleston planter and Revolutionary War statesman who had been president of the Second Continental Congress. Through this marriage, Ramsay also became related to South Carolina governor Charles Pinckney, Ralph Izard, John Rutledge, Arthur Middleton, Daniel Huger, and Lewis Morris. David and Martha Laurens Ramsay had eleven children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. Military and political service Portrait by Charles Willson Peale, 1771 During the American Revolutionary War, Ramsay served from 1776 to 1783 as a member of the South Carolina legislature. During the Siege of Charleston in 1780, when Charleston was attacked by the British, Ramsay served with the South Carolina militia as a field surgeon. He was captured when the British occupied Charleston, and was imprisoned for nearly a year at St. Augustine, Florida, until he was exchanged. Ramsay served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1782 to 1786. In the absence of its chairman, John Hancock, Ramsay served as chairman of the Congress of the Confederation from November 23, 1785 to May 12, 1786. In the 1790s, Ramsay served three terms in the South Carolina Senate, and was its president. During this time, Ramsay was nominated to the U.S. Senate, but his nomination was defeated on account of his abolitionist leanings. Historical writing Portrait by Rembrandt Peale, 1796 In his own day, Ramsay was better known as a historian and author than as a politician. He was one of the American Revolution's first major historians, who wrote with knowledge and insights acquired by being personally involved in the events of the American Revolution. His major historical works included: * History of the Revolution of South Carolina (1785, two volumes)Ramsay's History of the Revolution of South Carolina was the first book to receive a copyright in the United States. * History of the American Revolution (1789, two volumes)Ramsay, David, The History of the American Revolution, 1789. Two volumes. (Volume I at Google Books) * A Dissertation on the Manners of Acquiring the Character and Privileges of a Citizen (1789)A Dissertation on the Manners of Acquiring the Character and Privileges of a Citizen * Life of Washington (1807) * History of South Carolina (1809, two volumes) * History of the United States (1816-1817, three volumes) ‚Äì published posthumously * Universal History Americanized (1819, twelve volumes, including History of the United States as the first 3 volumes) In 1812, six weeks after the death of his wife Martha Laurens Ramsay, he published her diary and private letters under the title Memoirs of the Life of Martha Laurens Ramsay. Her memoirs remain historically valuable as a chronicle of the life of a well-educated Southern woman during the American Revolutionary War and the early years of the nation, including while she took her mother's place as hostess for her father's political gatherings in the 1780s. = Critical response = Ramsay's History of the American Revolution was one of the first and most accomplished histories to appear in the aftermath of that event, according to Karen O'Brien in 1994. O'Brien wrote that Ramsay's history challenges American exceptionalist literary frameworks by presenting itself within the European Enlightenment historical tradition, reflecting Ramsay's belief that the United States would have no historical destiny beyond typical patterns of European political and cultural development. Epic portrayals of American history in the 19th century were more the product of New England's historiographic traditions coupled with German historical thought, treating national character as a historical agent, rather than a historical result, as Ramsay suggests. Ramsay's history, then, is better considered the last of the European Enlightenment tradition than the first of American historical epics. Historian Peter C. Messer, in 2002, examined the transition in Ramsay's republican perspective from his History of the American Revolution (1789) to his more conservative History of the United States (1816‚Äì17). His works went from a call for active citizens to reform and improve societal institutions to a warning of the dangers of an overzealous population and the need to preserve existing institutions. In his discussion of the treatment of Indians and African American slaves he became less critical of whites and changed to reflect the views of society at large. Ramsay's increasing involvement in South Carolina's economic and political institutions and the need for stability that defined early-19th-century nationalism influenced this transformation. Assassination Ramsay was appointed by a court to examine one William Linnen, a tailor known for serial litigation and nuisance suits, after Linnen had attempted to murder his attorney. Ramsay reported to the court that Linnen was \\"deranged\\" and that it would be \\"dangerous to let him go at large.\\" After apparently regaining his sanity, Linnen was released; though he threatened Ramsay, the latter did not take the threat seriously. On May 6, 1815, at 1:00 p.m., Ramsay passed Linnen on Broad Street in Charleston. Linnen took out a \\"horseman's pistol\\" that he had concealed in a handkerchief, and shot Ramsay twice, in the back and hip. According to a contemporary source: Ramsay died at 7 a.m. on May 8, 1815. Collected in He was buried at the Circular Congregational Church in Charleston.

At the 2016 census, Roseworthy had a population of 994. Roseworthy has a large grain storage facility consisting of both storage silos and bunkers for grain grown in the surrounding areas, and grain is now taken by road transport to Port Adelaide for export where it was once taken by rail. Roseworthy is the junction of the former Peterborough railway line and Morgan railway lines, both constructed as broad gauge railway lines (although the Peterborough line was originally narrow gauge from Terowie to Peterborough), and remained that gauge for their entire service. Both lines were originally built to support export from copper mines, respectively at Burra and Kapunda before being extended beyond those towns. The railways later served primarily to carry grain to port instead of copper, but have now been supplanted by road transport. The Roseworthy campus of the University of Adelaide is the location of Australia's newest Vet School. The School of Animal & Veterinary Sciences provides education and training of animal and veterinary scientists in a research environment. The School offers three academic programs: Animal Science, Veterinary Bioscience and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM). Roseworthy is a popular stop for many truck drivers with the Roseworthy Roadhouse often bustling with resting travellers and transport drivers as they traverse along the Horrocks Highway. Roseworthy is in the Light Regional Council, the state electoral district of Schubert and the federal divisions of Barker and Grey. History The Surveyor General of South Australia visited the site which would become Roseworthy on 13 December 1837. In 1855 land in the Hundred of Mudla Wirra was purchased by William and Grace Gartrell. In 1863 when William died Grace sub-divided the land and named it Roseworthy.

Description Fruits Gmelina arborea is a fast-growing tree, which grows on different localities and prefers moist fertile valleys with 750‚Äì4500 mm rainfall. It does not thrive on ill-drained soils and remains stunted on dry, sandy or poor soils; drought also reduces it to a shrubby form. The tree attains moderate to large heights of up to 30 m, with a girth of 1.2 to 4 m. It has a chlorophyll layer just under the outer bark, which is pale yellow on the outside and white inside. Gmelina arborea wood is pale yellow to cream-coloured or pinkish-buff when fresh, turning yellowish brown on exposure and is soft to moderately hard, light to moderately heavy, lustrous when fresh, usually straight to irregular or rarely wavy grained and medium course textured. Flowering takes place during February to April when the tree is more or less leafless whereas fruiting starts from May onwards up to June. The fruit is up to 2.5 cm long, smooth, dark green, turning yellow when ripe and has a fruity smell. This tree is commonly planted as a garden and an avenue tree; growing in villages along agricultural land and on village community lands and wastelands. It is light demander, tolerant of excessive drought, but moderately frost hardy. It has good capacity to recover from frost injury. Gamhar trees coppices very well with vigorous growth. Saplings and young plants need protection from deer and cattle. Distribution and habitat Gmelina arborea grows naturally throughout India, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and in southern provinces of China. It is found at altitudes from sea level to . Since the 1960s, it has been introduced extensively as fast-growing timber trees in Brazil, Gambia, Honduras, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Malawi, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Sierra Leone. It is also planted in gardens and avenues. Utilization of the species Gmelina arborea timber is reasonably strong for its weight. It is used in construction, furniture, carriages, sports, musical instruments and artificial limbs. Once seasoned, it is a very steady timber and moderately resistant to decay and ranges from very resistant to moderately resistant to termites. Bark Flower Its timber is highly esteemed for door and window panels, joinery and furniture especially for drawers, wardrobes, cupboards, kitchen and camp furniture, and musical instruments because of its light weight, stability and durability. It is also used for bentwood articles. In boat building it is used for decking and for oars. Gmelina arborea is a popular timber for picture and slate frames, turnery articles and various types of brush backs, brush handles and toys also for handles of chisels, files, saws, screw drivers, sickles etc. The wood is also used for manufacturing tea chests and general purpose plywood, blackboards, frame core and cross bands of flush door shutters. In the instrument industry gambhar timber is widely employed for the manufacture of drawing boards, plane tables, instrument boxes, thermometer scales and cheaper grade metric scales. It is also used in artificial limbs, carriages and bobbins. It is an approved timber for handles of tennis rackets, frames and reinforcements of carom boards and packing cases and crates. Gamhar is used in papermaking and in the matchwood industry too. The Lion Throne, the most important, and last surviving, of the eight royal thrones of Myanmar, now in the National Museum in Yangon, is carved from Gmelina arborea wood. Gmelina arborea leaves are considered good for cattle (crude protein ‚Äì 11.9%) and are also used as a feed to eri- silkworm. 'Kumizh tree' when burnt yields the whitest possible ash; mention is made by certain 'rock art enthusiasts' that this ash is one of the ingredients in the semi-solid white ochre used to draw the very ancient 'cave paintings,' as old as 3,000 to 5,000 years or more; found in the dense forests of Tamil Nadu.

The first of the 180 Seinfeld episodes, the pilot was written by show creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, and directed by Art Wolff. The episode revolves around a fictionalized version of Seinfeld, who is unsure about the romantic intentions of a woman he met, and frets about the meaning of her signals with his best friend George (Jason Alexander) and neighbor Kessler (Michael Richards, whose character would later be renamed \\"Kramer\\"). Though they had been asked to put together a 90-minute TV special, Seinfeld and David wrote a TV pilot as they felt their \\"show about nothing\\" concept would fit better in the shorter, more conventional half-hour format. The storyline, and the main characters, were inspired by real-life events and people. Though the NBC executives were unsure about the show, they, as Warren Littlefield would later state, \\"all said, ah what the hell, let's try a pilot on this thing and see what happens\\". The test audiences, however, reacted extremely negatively. Although NBC would still broadcast the episode to see how audiences and TV critics would react, the network had already decided not to pick up the show, as a result of the test results. Castle Rock Entertainment, which produced this pilot (and the series proper), also had another pilot produced for NBC featuring actress Ann Jillian in her own eponymous series. After the poor reception of The Seinfeld Chronicles, the production company turned to Jillian's series, which tested better and had earned a full-season order; it would only last a single 13-episode season before being cancelled by the end of 1990. When The Seinfeld Chronicles aired, it was watched by nearly 11% of American households, and received generally favorable reviews from critics, who reacted with disappointment that NBC did not order a first season. Convinced that the show had potential, and supported by the positive reviews, NBC executive Rick Ludwin managed to convince his superiors to order a four-episode first season (the smallest order in US TV history), by offering a part of his personal budget in return. The show, renamed Seinfeld, would go on to become the most successful sitcom in television history. Plot The series opens with Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld) and George Costanza (Jason Alexander) seated at Pete's Luncheonette, debating the placement of one of George's shirt buttons. Jerry tells George about a woman he met in Lansing, Michigan, Laura (Pamela Brull), who is coming to New York, and the two discuss whether or not she has romantic intentions. The next evening, Jerry tells his neighbor Kessler (Michael Richards) that he thinks he misunderstood the situation with Laura. However, he then receives a telephone call from Laura, who asks if she can stay overnight at his apartment. Though Jerry agrees, he is still unsure whether or not her visit is intended to be romantic. George and Jerry continue to debate the issue, with Jerry determined to find the true nature of her visit. While waiting at the airport for Laura to arrive, Jerry and George try to identify the possible signals Laura might give upon her arrival, with George explaining the meaning of various greetings. However, when Laura arrives, her greeting is ambiguous. Upon arriving at Jerry's apartment Laura removes her shoes and some excess clothing to get comfortable, asks for wine, and turns down the light and asks if she can stay over a second night. As Jerry removes his own shoes and begins to grow confident, the phone rings for Laura. When Laura gets off the phone she tells Jerry: \\"Never get engaged.\\" Jerry then realizes that he has no chance with Laura, but has already committed himself ‚Äì and his one-bedroom apartment ‚Äì to an entire weekend with her, including a five-hour sightseeing boat ride around Manhattan. Production =Conception and writing= The Seinfeld Chronicles was written as the pilot for the show that would eventually be called Seinfeld, though earlier versions of the script would refer to the program as Stand Up and The Jerry Seinfeld Show. The idea for the show started on November 2, 1988, after NBC executives had approached comedian Jerry Seinfeld to do a project with the network, upon a suggestion by George Shapiro, Seinfeld's manager at the time. Seinfeld enlisted fellow comedian Larry David to help him develop it, and they wrote a concept for a 90-minute- special (that was to air one weekend in place of Saturday Night Live) about how comedians get their material. However, upon further discussion, Seinfeld felt that the concept could not be sustained for 90 minutes, and the two decided that the project was to become a pilot for a series rather than a special. Developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life. Larry David co-wrote the episode Conceived as a \\"show about nothing,\\" in which the main characters would \\"just make fun of stuff\\", Seinfeld said that the idea of the pilot episode was to explore the \\"gaps in society where there are no rules.\\" The storyline, as well as most of the main characters, were inspired by the personal lives of its creators. Jerry was a fictionalized version of Seinfeld, George a fictionalized version of Larry David and Kessler was based on David's neighbor Kenny Kramer. Though Seinfeld was initially concerned the \\"wacky neighbor\\" would be too much of a clich√©, David convinced him to put the character in the script. However, anticipating that the actual Kramer would exploit the benefits of having a TV character based on him, David hesitated to call the character Kramer. Thus, in the pilot, the character's name was \\"Kessler\\". However, intrigued by the name, Seinfeld was convinced that the character's name should be Kramer, prompting Kenny Kramer to call NBC's legal department with various financial and legal demands, most of which he received. The name inconsistency would eventually be addressed in the season 9 episode \\"The Betrayal\\" in which Kramer explains that Kessler is the name on his apartment buzzer. David and Seinfeld re-wrote the script several times before submitting it to the network, dropping and adding various elements. Originally George, who was called Bennett in early drafts, was a comedian as well, and the first scene of the episode focused on Jerry and George discussing their stand-up material. The character of Kramer, was not included in the first draft of the script, and in another draft he was called \\"Hoffman\\". Another element that was added was Kessler's dog, since it was originally planned that Jerry's stand-up routines would match the events of each episode. Though the stand-up routine about dogs was eventually dropped, the scene in which Kessler enters with his dog remained in the episode. When David and Seinfeld eventually submitted the script, the network executives were unsure whether or not to produce the pilot, but as NBC executive Warren Littlefield would later state \\"we all said, ah what the hell, let's try a pilot on this thing and see what happens\\". Directed by Art Wolff, the pilot was filmed in front of a live studio audience on April 27, 1989, at Stage 9 of Ren-Mar Studios, the same studio where The Dick Van Dyke Show was filmed, which was seen by the crew as a good omen. The exterior of Pete's Luncheonette, the restaurant in which the episode opens, was a leftover set piece from The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984).Bjorklund, 2013, p. 7 Seinfeld's stand-up routine was recorded at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood, in front of an audience of paid extras, though not all of the recorded material was included in the broadcast version. Additionally, a scene was recorded featuring Jerry and George driving to the airport talking about changing lanes on the road and giving \\"Thank you waves\\", but was cut before broadcasting. The music used in the episode was composed by Jep Epstein; however, when the show was picked up, Epstein's tune was replaced by the trademark slap bass music by Jonathan Wolff. =Casting= Michael Richards reportedly did a handstand during his audition The Seinfeld Chronicles featured four characters that were intended to be series regulars if the show was to be picked up for a first season: Jerry, George, Kramer and Claire the waitress. Though it was already settled that Seinfeld would play a fictionalized version of himself, auditions were held for the other three characters. Though George was based on Larry David, David was keen on writing, and did not have the desire to portray the character himself. Prior to the casting progress, Seinfeld pleaded with his friend Jake Johannsen to play the part, but he rejected it. When the casting process started, as casting director Marc Hirschfeld stated, the casting crew \\"saw every actor [they] could possibly see in Los Angeles\\". Among these actors were Larry Miller (Seinfeld's best friend), Brad Hall, David Alan Grier, and Nathan Lane yet none of them seemed fit for the part. Jason Alexander auditioned for the part via a video tape, though he had very little hope for being cast, as he felt he was doing a Woody Allen impression. However, upon watching the tape, David and Seinfeld were immediately convinced Alexander would be the right actor to cast. However, casting sessions traditionally work with rounds, so Alexander and a few other actors considered for the role were flown to Los Angeles for a second audition. One of the other actors who made it to this round was Larry Miller. As Alexander knew Miller was a close friend of Seinfeld, he was convinced he would not get the part, but eventually did. Kenny Kramer initially demanded that he would play the part of Kessler, as he served as the inspiration for the character. However, David did not want this and it was decided upon that casting sessions would be held. Among those who auditioned for the part of Kramer were Steve Vinovich, Tony Shalhoub and Larry Hankin. Although he was not cast for the part Hankin would later portray an in-show fictional version of Kramer in the season four episode \\"The Pilot\\". Seinfeld and David were both familiar with Michael Richards, and David had worked with him on Fridays. Richards did his final audition at the Century Plaza Hotel on April 18, 1989, reputedly finishing with a handstand. David was not sure about casting Richards, as he was trying to cast an actor who resembled the original Kramer. However, impressed by Richards' audition, Seinfeld convinced David that Richards would be the right actor for the part. Lee Garlington was cast as Claire the Waitress, who in an earlier draft of the episode was called \\"Meg\\". Though initially cast as a series regular, the character was replaced with Elaine Benes when the series was picked up for a first season. Accounts differ on the reason why the character was replaced. Warren Littlefield has said that it was because the character's occupation: \\"I thought that as a waitress she'd never be one of the gang. She'd be relegated to pouring coffee, catching up. So I insisted they create a female character they wanted to spend time with\\". Dennis Bjorklund of Seinfeld Reference has suggested that the character was dropped in favor of a female character with more sex appeal. However, Alexander said that Garlington was written out of the series because she had re-written her scene and given it to David, who was not happy with this. Seinfeld has, however, stated that this was not the reason the character was removed from the show, but rather that the producers were looking for \\"someone who was more involved\\". Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who would go on to replace Garlington, has stated that she was not aware of the pilot before becoming a regular on the show, and she will never watch it out of superstition. Reception The pilot was first screened by a group of two dozen NBC executives in Burbank, California in early 1989. Although the pilot did not yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade's previous NBC successes like The Cosby Show and The Golden Girls, it drew mostly positive responses from the assembled executives. One exception was Brandon Tartikoff, who was concerned that the show was \\"Too New York, too Jewish\\". Before the episode's TV premiere it was shown to a test audience of 400 households, and met with extremely negative responses. Littlefield would later recall \\"In the history of pilot reports, Seinfeld has got to be one of the worst of all time\\". The memo that summarized the test audience's reaction, contained feedback such as \\"No segment of the audience was eager to watch the show again\\" and \\"None of the [supporting characters] were particularly liked\\". Despite the low rating the show received from its test audience, the first public broadcast of \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\" took place on the fifth of July 1989, to see how viewers would react, even though the executives had already decided the show would not be picked up for a full season. \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\" finished second in its time slot, behind the CBS police drama Jake and the Fatman, receiving a Nielsen rating of 10.9/19, meaning that the pilot was watched by 10.9% of American households, and that 19% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. With these ratings \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\" finished in the 21st place of the week it was broadcast, tied with Fox's Totally Hidden Video. NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff was concerned the show was \\"Too New York, too Jewish\\". Unlike the test audience, television critics generally reacted positively to the pilot, viewing it as original and innovative, USA Today critic Tom Green summarized the show as a \\"crisply funny blend of stand-up routines interwoven with more traditional sitcom stuff\\". Eric Mink of St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote he thought the show was unusual and intriguing, yet \\"quite funny\\". Joe Stein of the San Diego Evening Tribune commented \\"Not all standup comedians fit into a sitcom format, but Seinfeld does\\". A more negative response came from a The Fresno Bee critic, that stated \\"I liked the concept, but Seinfeld's jokes were so dull that you hoped the standup stuff would fly by so you could get back to the story\\". Though the critic praised Alexander's acting he commented that his performance was not enough to keep the show \\"from being just another piece of summer drivel offered up by a major commercial network\\". Various critics compared the pilot to It's Garry Shandling's Show. In his review of the episode The Philadelphia Inquirer critic Ken Tucker commented \\"Seinfeld's brisk funniness prevents Chronicles from being a rip-off\\", while Jerry Krupnick of The Star-Ledger felt that The Seinfeld Chronicles differentiated itself from It's Garry Shandling's Show by its supporting cast, which he praised. By contrast, John Voorhees of The Seattle Times commented that, though he thought the show was amusing, he considered It's Garry Shandling's Show to be better, and the Houston Chronicle's Mike McDaniel referred to the pilot as \\"a not-as-good Garry Shandling-like show\\". Most critics reacted with disappointment to the fact that NBC had not picked up the show. Bob Niedt of the Syracuse Herald-Journal commented \\"What gives? Comedy this good, and NBC is keeping ‚Äî excuse me ‚Äî A Different World on the schedule?\\". Ken Tucker stated \\"NBC is making a mistake if it doesn't pick up The Seinfeld Chronicles as a midseason replacement; it's bound to be superior to most of what the network has planned for the fall\\". Additionally casting directors Hirschfeld and Meg Liberman were nominated for a Casting Society of America Artios Award for 'Best Casting for TV, Pilot', but lost to the casting directors of Northern Exposure. Though the network executives had decided not to pick up The Seinfeld Chronicles for a first season, some of them were reluctant to give up on it, as they felt the series had potential. Rick Ludwin, one of the show's greatest supporters, eventually made a deal with Tartikoff, giving up some of his own development money and cancelling a Bob Hope special, so that the entertainment division could order four more episodes of The Seinfeld Chronicles; these formed the rest of the show's first season. Although this was a very low order number for a new series (the smallest sitcom order in television history), Castle Rock failed to find any other buyers when it tried to sell the show to other networks, and accepted the order. About a year later the first season would premiere, with the show renamed Seinfeld to avoid confusion with ABC's The Marshall Chronicles. To lead in the first official season of Seinfeld, the pilot episode was repeated on June 28, 1990; it received a Nielsen rating of 13.9/26.

The character was later adapted by Peter Milligan and Chris Bachalo in one of the first Vertigo titles. Both versions of Shade are distinct from the Shade, another DC Comics character. Publishing history Shade, the Changing Man told the story of a fugitive from the militant planet Meta in another dimension. Shade (whose full name is Rac Shade) was powered by a stolen \\"M-vest\\" (or Miraco-Vest, named for its inventor) which protected him with a force field and enabled him to project the illusion of becoming a large grotesque version of himself. The character was the first Ditko had created, or helped to create, for a mainstream publisher for many years. Prior to rejoining DC Comics, Ditko had worked on characters such as his Mr. A. title. Shade was very much a return to mainstream superheroics, although Shade indicated no particular connection with the DC Universe (although the letters columns stated that there is no reason it could not be shown to be there). Michael Fleisher scripted the series based on Ditko's plotting and art. His series ran for eight bi-monthly issues in 1978 before its sudden cancellation in the wake of the \\"DC Implosion\\", a contraction of DC's line that saw a third of their books axed right before the September releases. A ninth extra-length issue, featuring the debut of a new Ditko character called The Odd Man, was produced, but was published only as a part of DC's Cancelled Comic Cavalcade in 1978. A revised version of the Odd Man story appeared in Detective Comics #487 (Dec. 1979-Jan. 1980). Both stories were published in The Steve Ditko Omnibus Vol. 1 (2011), a hardcover collection of Ditko's DC work. After this, Shade was adopted into the DC Universe and made a brief appearance in the Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries, as well as becoming a regular character in Suicide Squad. Fictional character biography =Own series= Cover of Shade, the Changing Man #6 (original series) by Steve Ditko. Rac Shade, a secret agent of the world in the Meta-Zone, a dimension near that of Earth, between which is the Zero-Zone, has been framed for treason and sentenced to death. Through various events, Shade spent some time on Earth trying to clear his name, using the retrieved M-Vest (The Miraco-Vest that had been stolen) in the process; but was met with resistance of the Meta-authorities at each point. His name was being cleared bit by bit, but he remained a wanted man, and Shade continued to use the M-Vest. Shade's former fianc√©e, Mellu Loron, wanted to kill him for some time for causing an explosion that crippled her parents. But her parents, operating a mechanical monster called the Supreme Decider (or Sude) had other plans. The Metans have an outpost on Earth which is called the Occult Research Center (O.R.C). The Center was run by Wizor, assisted by Leno. Mellu ran it for a time. The O.R.C. operates by telling the absolute truth about Meta, something the public tends to laugh off. When Mellu desires to kill Shade, the fact that other, more violent, criminals released in the freak accident during the prison riot that freed Shade become priority, annoys her greatly and causes her to leave the organization. When Dr. Sagan shows Mellu videotape evidence that Shade has rescued her from a deadly part of the Zero- Zone called the Area of Madness (from which no one but Shade, thanks to the vest, has exited without expending all their bodily resources screaming), she changes her mind about Shade, in spite of having been the one who had ultimately captured him. In the final issue, President Olon's hands are tied in regard to the treason charge. Even though he considers Shade innocent, until his death sentence is overturned in court, he is still under a death sentence as Col. Kross gathers evidence in his defense. With all of these on his side, he (Shade) leaps into the Zero-Zone and is swallowed by the Area of Madness. =Running with the Suicide Squad= Shade ends up living in the Area of Madness. The Suicide Squad, after leaving Nightshade's home dimension ends up here and Shade is able to adjust his M-Vest so he can teleport himself and the Squad to earth. Unfortunately the O.R.C has been taken over by Doctor Z.Z. and a gang of Metan criminals. They hope to use the place as a base to conquer Earth and eventually Meta itself. Shade's plan to stop them is sidetracked by the Crisis On Infinite Earths and being stuck back in the Zero Zone. He is eventually rescued by the Squad. Shade's second attempt at stopping Z.Z. is successful, though Meta authorities still wish to arrest him. Rick Flag pulls a gun and Shade is allowed to leave with the Squad. Shade is offered technical help in returning to Meta in exchange for his help on missions. Shade cooperates, though he is not quite sure if Earth's technology is up to the task. Shade also spends time trying to help the ex-Squad member Mindboggler, who had died in issue #2, then became Ifrit, a digitized ally of the Jihad. Shade became increasingly doubtful of the wisdom of staying with the Squad. So when Lashina (in the disguise of Duchess) came to him with an offer to return him to his home dimension via a detour to Apokolips, Shade agrees, not knowing what was in store for him. He ends up being forced to kidnap Vixen as well as Captain Boomerang (although he had little regret with kidnapping the latter). Shade knew that his actions were wrong, but felt he had little choice.Suicide Squad #33 Lashina betrayed him as soon as possible on Apokolips. Several of Shade's friends, the pilot Briscoe, civilian Flo Crowley (part of the Task Force X support staff) and the villain Dr. Light soon die in the fight against parademons and the Female Furies. Darkseid appears and settles the conflict, sending the Squad and its dead home. Shade, wracked with guilt, is sent back to his home dimension.Suicide Squad #36-37 His whereabouts since then have been unknown. Peter Milligan and the Vertigo years In July 1990, just six months after Shade's final appearance in Suicide Squad, Shade was revamped by Peter Milligan and Chris Bachalo, becoming part of the so-called \\"British Invasion\\", alongside Neil Gaiman's Sandman and Grant Morrison's Animal Man. The new series still took place in the DC universe: John Constantine turned up for a three-issue story arc, Death of The Endless appeared in a subtle cameo in issue 50 and Shade appeared with a group of other Vertigo characters in 1999's Totems. However, the comic departed quickly from its origins. Milligan and Bachalo reinvented Rac Shade as a red-headed lovelorn poet sent to Earth to stop a growing tide of madness from consuming the planet, his M-Vest becoming a Madness-Vest capable of warping reality. Working from Brendan McCarthy's character designs, Bachalo created a distinctive look for the comic, distinguishing it from the character's other DC Universe appearances. The original series was retconned as a story that Shade made up to amuse himself while traveling to Earth. (Left unexplained was his stint with the Suicide Squad.) Milligan killed Shade off several times during the series, bringing him back each time in a different form: a woman; a black-haired madman; a red-haired, emotionless mod; and a bedraggled, unshaven obsessive. The series employed concepts and ideas which were at times controversial and distinct from regular DC titles (for example, JFK's assassination and transgenderism). To distinguish these more 'adult' themes in Shade and other titles, DC created the Vertigo imprint in 1993. Shade became one of the initial Vertigo titles starting with issue 33. Shade sold steadily for Vertigo and maintained a cult following. The title lasted 70 issues before being cancelled in 1996. In 2003 a special one-off story by Peter Milligan and artist Mike Allred was printed as part of Vertigo's tenth anniversary celebrations. In 2004, the first six issues of Shade were reprinted as a Vertigo trade paperback. In August 2010, Hellblazer #268 featured the return of Shade the Changing Man, this time as a supporting cast member for John Constantine in a series of storylines written by Milligan. According to Absolute Crisis on Infinite Earths HC, the events of the second series originally took place on Earth-85 in the Multiverse before its destruction. Return to the DCU In 2011, Shade was featured in Geoff Johns Flashpoint miniseries and its spinoff miniseries Flashpoint: Secret Seven (written by Peter Milligan) as the leader of the Secret Seven.http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/07/01/flashpoint-friday-the-secret- seven-revealed/ After Flashpoint as part of The New 52 (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Shade appears as one of the lead characters in the first story arc of Justice League Dark, a new title written by Peter Milliganhttp://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/06/07/dc-comics-swamp-thing- frankenstein/ and drawn by Mikel Janin. Other versions =Kingdom Come= In Kingdom Come, Alex Ross created Shade III, a black adaptation. He is referred to as \\"more of the classic, heroic version\\", and is visually based more on the Steve Ditko Shade than the Peter Milligan Shade. =JLA: The Nail= Another Elseworlds version of the classic Shade appeared in JLA: The Nail as a member of the Outsiders. =Flashpoint= Shade, the Changing Man as seen in Flashpoint. Art by Andy Kubert. In 2011, Shade returned to the DC Universe in Flashpoint: Secret Seven, a limited series spinoff of the Flashpoint crossover event. The series is written by Peter Milligan and drawn by George P√©rez. This version of Shade is visually based on the Vertigo incarnation, but draws elements from the original Steve Ditko iteration of the character as well.DC Universe: The Source \\" Blog Archive \\" Flashpoint Friday: One among them will betray them all! In the series, history is altered accidentally by The Flash, resulting in a greatly altered timeline that reimagines many characters. Here, Shade is the leader of a band of heroes dubbed the Secret Seven, which includes Enchantress and Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld. Shade and the others are recruited by Cyborg as part of an effort to stop an apocalyptic war between Atlantis and New Themyscira.Flashpoint #1 (May 2011) *Flashpoint: Secret Seven #1 *Flashpoint: Secret Seven #2 *Flashpoint: Secret Seven #3 =DC's Young Animal= In October 2016, DC debuted a new imprint: Young Animal. One of the initial titles is Shade, The Changing Girl, which features a female Metan named Loma who admires the late Rac Shade and his poetry. She steals the Madness Vest from a museum and takes over the body of a comatose teenage girl called Megan Boyer on Earth. The creative team behind this new version includes writer Cecil Castellucci and artist Marley Zarcone. Beginning March 2018, the series changed names like many Young Animal titles. It is currently called Shade, The Changing Woman. \\"Shade, the Changing Girl\\" ended its run during the events of \\"Milk Wars\\" and began again in 2018 as \\"Shade, The Changing Woman\\" which went for six issues, ending in July. http://www.dccomics.com/comics/shade-the-changing-girl-2016/shade-the- changing-girl-1 After the name change, the tone of the book changed to a more introspective one, as Loma left her small town and traveled through several locations;while the book also shifted its focus onto the secondary characters introduced on the previous run. Exploring themes of dissociation, depression, xenophobia, destiny and being an outcast, Loma eventually meets Rac Shade and the story comes full circle to connect with the previous Vertigo incarnation.

The song placed second in the contest, and became a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Although \\"Where Are You?\\" remains her sole solo chart entry, in 2000 she re-entered the top 20 of the UK Singles chart alongside Tru Faith & Dub Conspiracy's \\"Freak Like Me\\". Later, she recorded many songs with jazz-dance group Incognito, and in 2014 released her debut studio album, Standing Tall. Career =Eurovision 1998= In 1998, Saleem entered The Great British Song Contest competition to find the UK's song for the Eurovision Song Contest that year. Her track \\"Where Are You\\" was a runaway winner with the British public and was selected to represent the UK. Saleem finished a mere seven points behind the winner Dana International, in second place in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998. The UK has never been so close to winning ever since. After its success in the contest, \\"Where Are You\\" entered the UK Singles Chart in May 1998, peaking at number 15 and spending 15 non-consecutive weeks in the top 100. The track sold over 250,000 copies. Despite this success, her record label EMI decided to cancel the release of her follow-up single \\"You Got a Way\\" in 1999 and parted company with Saleem. =After Eurovision= In 2000, she supplied the lead vocals on Tru Faith & Dub Conspiracy's UK garage cover of Adina Howard's \\"Freak Like Me\\". The song reached No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart. Saleem went on to record with the jazz-funk band Incognito, providing vocals for more than 10 of their records. Since 2005, Saleem has performed as part of UK session organisation The AllStars Collective. The following year, in 2006, she sang on a house track, \\"Bring Me Love\\", by the Copyright Project on Defected Records. The track received a limited release in the UK, but reached the Top 3 in the club chart. In 2014, Saleem released her debut album, Standing Tall. One of its songs, \\"Struggling\\" featured on the 2015 soul compilation album Luxury Soul 2015.

T. (or Drawings of Patient O. T.) is the second studio album by the Berlin-based musical group Einst√ºrzende Neubauten. Some Bizzare Records released the album in 1983, and it was distributed in Germany by Rough Trade Deutschland. In the United States, PVC/Jem Records released the album in 1984 as Drawings of O. T. The title refers to artist Oswald Tschirtner, an institutionalized schizophrenic who earned attention for his art. The original vinyl release of Zeichnungen des Patienten O. T. is Rough Trade Records #RTD 18 and Some Bizzare Records #SBVART 2. Overview The album shows a wider variety of moods and sounds than did the group's first album, Kollaps. Einst√ºrzende Neubauten is famous for banging, scraping, plucking or otherwise wringing sounds from resonant objects. While such metallic clatter pervades the album, the group also uses techniques such as found sounds (telephone conversations, the Hamburg fish market) and (pre- digital) sampling; for example, a sample of the Armenian song \\"Toun en kelkhen imastoun yes\\" is used in \\"Armenia\\". Bass guitar is relatively prominent, though generally played in a minimal style (and perhaps contributing more toward sonic texture rather than forming a rhythmic or harmonic foundation). Trouser Press critic David Sheridan pointed out the group's drift toward conventionality, writing that \\"the title track even has a chord progression!\\" \\"Armenia\\" was later used in the soundtrack of Michael Mann's 1995 film Heat and his 1999 film The Insider.

Although Dr. Frankenstein had a hunchbacked assistant in the film Frankenstein (1931), his name was Fritz. In the original 1818 Mary Shelley novel, Frankenstein has no lab assistant nor an association with a character named Igor. Origins Dwight Frye's hunchbacked lab assistant in the first film of the Frankenstein series (1931) is the main source for the \\"Igor\\" of public imagination, though this character was actually named Fritz. Fritz did not originate from the Frankenstein novel, but instead originated from the earliest recorded play adaptation, Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein, where he was played by Robert Keeley. The second and third sequel films Son of Frankenstein (1939) and The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942) featured a character named Ygor (portrayed by Bela Lugosi). This character is neither a hunchback nor a lab assistant, but a blacksmith with a broken neck and twisted back as the result of a botched hanging. He reanimates the Monster as an instrument of vengeance against the townspeople who attempted to hang him for grave-robbing. He survives a near-fatal gunshot and appears in the next film in which his brain is placed in the Monster's body. Universal Studios actively cemented the idea of the hunchbacked assistant to the \\"mad scientist\\" in the Frankenstein film series' The House of Frankenstein (1944) with J. Carrol Naish playing a hunchbacked lab assistant named Daniel. In the horror film Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), Ivan Igor is the name of the mad wax museum curator. The film was remade as House of Wax (1953), but the name Igor was given to the curator's henchman (Charles Bronson) rather than the curator himself. This character is deaf and mute, rather than a hunchback. In other media =Music= * The 1960s novelty song \\"Monster Mash\\" by Bobby \\"Boris\\" Pickett and the Crypt-Kickers mentions Igor: \\"The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds / Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds\\". Igor is heard muttering \\"Mmm, Mash good!\\" at the end of the song; the character is portrayed using a Peter Lorre impersonation (Lorre never played Igor but, by the time the song came out, had cemented a reputation as a character actor playing deformed eccentrics). * The Alice Cooper album Love it to Death features the song \\"Ballad of Dwight Frye\\", which is loosely based on Fritz's character. * The fifth album released by hip-hop artist Tyler, the Creator titled Igor refers to both the stock character and the urban colloquialism for genius. =Film and television= * In the Three Stooges short \\"A Bird in the Head\\" (1946), a mad scientist has a gorilla named Igor as well as an assistant named Nico who regularly uses the phrase \\"Yes, master.\\" * A different version of Igor named ‚ÄúKarl‚Äù appears in the Hammer horror film The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958) portrayed by Oscar Quitak as the hunchback and by as the monster Michael Gwynn. This version is a hunchback assistant to Victor Frankenstein who rescues him from a death sentence and assists him in his new creation. Karl eventually dies and becomes the film‚Äôs version of Frankenstein's monster. * The 1970s PBS children's show The Electric Company featured a disheveled lab assistant named Igor (portrayed by Jim Boyd and later by Luis Avalos) who served a character known simply as \\"the Mad Scientist\\" (portrayed by Morgan Freeman). * In the Canadian sketch show The Hilarious House of Frightenstein (1971), Igor (portrayed by Fiska Rais) is the burly, bumbling, green-skinned assistant of Count Frightenstein. His catchphrases are \\"Yes, master\\" and \\"I'd rather not get involved.\\" * Igor is featured in Mad Mad Mad Monsters (the \\"prequel of sorts\\" to Mad Monster Party?) voiced by Allen Swift impersonating Peter Lorre. He is the assistant of Baron Henry von Frankenstein, and covets the Bride that Frankenstein creates for the Monster. * Mel Brooks's parody Young Frankenstein (1974) included a hunchbacked assistant portrayed by Marty Feldman who claimed his name is pronounced \\"Eye-gor\\" (in response to Frankenstein's claim that his name is pronounced \\"Fronkunschteen\\"). * In The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), the character of Riff Raff (portrayed by Richard O'Brien) is a hunchbacked servant of Dr. Frank N. Furter (portrayed by Tim Curry). He serves as a lab assistant in the doctor's attempts to create life. In The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again, Riff Raff is portrayed by Reeve Carney. * The Doctor Who television serial The Brain of Morbius (1976), heavily styled after the 1931 Frankenstein film, included an Igor figure in Condo, lumbering deformed servant to Doctor Solon, who collects body parts from crashed spaceships so that his master can build a new body for the disembodied brain of the titular villain Morbius, a renegade Time Lord. * In the 1970s Canadian sketch comedy series SCTV in their \\"Monster Chiller Horror Theater\\" segments hosted by Count Floyd, the mad scientist Dr. Tongue (portrayed by John Candy) had a servile, hunchbacked and deformed assistant named \\"Bruno\\" (portrayed by Eugene Levy as Bruno's actor Woody Tobias Jr.) who played to this trope in each of the Dr. Tongue movies. * Count Dracula had a butler named Igor in ABC's holiday telefilm The Halloween That Almost Wasn't (a.k.a. The Night Dracula Saved the World, 1979). * In The Transformers episode \\"Autobot Spike,\\" a Frankenstein movie was shown that an unnamed hunchbacked assistant (voiced by Michael Bell) was in. * An Igor appears in Return of the Killer Tomatoes, Killer Tomatoes Strike Back, and Killer Tomatoes Eat France portrayed by Steve Lundquist. He is portrayed as a tall, blond, good-looking Yuppie assistant to Professor Mortimer Gangreen (portrayed by John Astin). The character also appeared in the cartoon series voiced by Cam Clarke. * Igor is the main character in the children's television show Toonsylvania, produced by Steven Spielberg in 1998. * The cartoon series Count Duckula features the titular character's faithful old family retainer named Igor (voiced by Jack May) who is portrayed as an anthropomorphic vulture (hence the hunched back). Igor is a traditionalist and often schemes to convert his vegetarian master to a diet of blood as was the case with Duckula's previous incarnations. * In the Super Mario Bros. Super Show episode Count Koopula, King Koopa's most loyal henchman Mouser was portrayed as a hunchback and called himself \\"Mousigor\\" as a homage to the original Igor. * In The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), Halloween Town's resident mad scientist Dr. Finkelstein has a hunchbacked assistant called Igor who acts rather like a canine and works for \\"Bone Biscuits.\\" He helps Dr. Finklestein into creating the skeletal reindeer for Jack Skellington in his plot to improvise Christmas. The character is voiced by an uncredited Joe Ranft in the film and by Rob Paulsen in The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge. * The movie Van Helsing (2004) included a deformed character named Igor portrayed by Kevin J. O'Connor. In the film, he is the former assistant of Victor Frankenstein and the current assistant of Count Dracula. He is a spiteful, hate-filled man who takes pleasure in harming others, but he is intimidated into helping Gabriel Van Helsing and his allies to acquire a werewolf cure to use for Van Helsing. He and Dracula's bride Aleera both perish during the climax. * Igor appears in the animated series Mary Shelley's Frankenhole, a cartoon show which is a modern update of the Frankenstein mythos, voiced by Tigger Stamatopoulos. * In Igor (2008), the main character of the film (voiced by John Cusack) is the former assistant of a now-deceased mad scientist Dr. Glickenstein (voiced by John Cleese). He takes over his master's research and dreams of becoming the most famous scientist in the world. * Daniel Radcliffe plays Igor in the film Victor Frankenstein (2015) by Paul McGuigan. In this version, Igor is initially an unnamed hunchbacked clown at a circus and a self-taught physician whose skills capture Victor Frankstein's attention after he helps him treat injured acrobat Lorelai. Seeing the hunchback's poor treatment by the rest of the circus, Victor frees him and takes him to his flat, draining the cyst that is the cause of his posture, providing him with a brace to help his posture adjust, and giving him the name \\"Igor Straussmann\\" after his currently absent flatmate. Igor goes on to assist Victor in his experiments to create life while falling in love with Lorelai. He regards Victor as a friend despite Victor's various lies (Including the revelation that the original Igor actually died from a drug overdose and Victor has been keeping him on ice to use his organs as part of his experiments). At the film's conclusion, after Igor helps Victor destroy the original creation when it proves to lack the true spark of life, Frankenstein departs to leave Igor to create a new life for himself with Lorelai. * Igor appears in the 2012 animation series of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, in the fifth season episode \\"The Frankenstein Experiment\\" voiced by Grant Moninger. He appears as Victor von Frankenstein's lab assistant. Disgruntled by his master's impatient treatment of him and jealous that Victor befriended Donatello, Igor betrays him and his new friends, the Turtles, to Savanti Romero and Count Dracula, but gets tossed out of a tower window for his reward. It is unknown if he survived the fall or not. =Print= * In Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, the √úberwald region is home to a tribe of hunchbacked lab assistants with speech impediments, to the point that an Igor without an impediment is considered to be an embarrassment; every male is named Igor, while the females are all named Igorina, and are known for literally passing down body parts when their ancestors are deceased. * The comic book story \\"Transilvane\\" (Legends of the DC Universe #22-23, written by Jean-Marc Lofficier and drawn by Jos√© Ladr√∂nn) depicts Dabney Donovan, a mad scientist who has created a whole world based on old horror movie characters. In that world, Igor is the servant of the vampire leader, Count Dragorin. * A hunchback named Igor is a recurring character in The Far Side comics, in typical mad scientist or other horror situations. =Video games= * In the computer game Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness, Igor is the local gravekeeper and the lab assistant to Dr. Cranium. He happens to be allergic to avocado. * In the Persona video game series, Igor is a recurring character who assists the main characters by helping them create new Personas, powerful beings based on both their own personalities and figures from mythology and folklore. Igor is usually assisted by characters that also share names with Frankenstein characters. * In the 1986 video game Castlevania, Igor and Frankenstein's Monster are the boss characters in the fourth group of stages. * In episode 2 of the 2015 video game Life Is Strange, the main protagonist Max Caulfield refers to the character by saying \\"Bring me the brain, Igor!\\" when inspecting the beakers on the counter in the science lab. * In the 2019 video game Death Stranding, the only named member of the Corpse disposal team is named Igor. Igor's brother is named Victor Frank.

He was the 15th bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. Education and family Bennison was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on November 30, 1943, and was baptized at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Hastings, Minnesota, on December 24, 1943. His father, Charles E. Bennison Sr., was also a priest who went on to become the Bishop of Western Michigan. Bennison received a B.A. degree summa cum laude from Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1965. In 1965‚Äì66, he studied at Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, and then attended Harvard Divinity School, where he received a B.D. degree in 1968 and a Th.M. degree in 1970. He earned his M.A. degree from the Claremont Graduate School in 1977, and a S.T.M. degree from Union Theological Seminary in 1992. He was honored with a D.Div. degree from Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1997. Benninson married Joan Kathryn Reahard; they have two daughters, Sarah and Kathryn. Ministerial and academic career Ordained a deacon in 1968 and a priest in 1969, Bennison began his full-time ministry in 1971 as rector of St. Mark's Church in Upland, California, where he was founder of St. Mark's Episcopal School, St. Mark's Homeless Shelter, and new congregations in Rancho Cucamonga and Chino, California. In the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, he chaired the Program Group on Social Relations and the Standing Committee, served as president of the Corporation of the Diocese, taught at the Episcopal Theological School at Claremont Graduate School, and was a frequent reader of the General Ordination Examinations. He served as a member of Venture in Mission Board, the Los Angeles Jewish-Christian-Muslim Trialogue, the Anglican-Roman Catholic Commission, and numerous other bodies. In 1987, he was recognized by the Pomona Valley Council of Churches for outstanding leadership in ecumenical affairs. That year he was also among the nominees considered to replace Robert Rusack as bishop of the diocese, a position that ultimately went to Frederick Borsch.\\"Upland Rector Joins List of Episcopal Bishop Nominees\\". Los Angeles Times, December 12, 1987, p. 7. From 1988 to 1991, he was rector of St. Luke's Church in Atlanta, Georgia, where he substantially raised stewardship giving, broadened the participation of laity in the governance of the parish, and initiated a process leading to the acquisition of significant real estate holdings. Bennison has been a fellow of the College of Preachers. This is a program of the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation. and a Masland fellow at Union Theological Seminary. In 1992, he was elected to the faculty of Episcopal Divinity School, where he served as associate professor of Pastoral theology and founded the program in Congregational Studies. Bishop of Pennsylvania Bennison was elected Bishop Coadjutor of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania at a special convention held on October 19, 1996, at the Cathedral Church of the Savior in Philadelphia and was consecrated as a bishop on February 27, 1997 at the Deliverance Evangelistic church in Philadelphia. He was made the diocesan bishop on May 16, 1998. Controversies Bennison's tenure as Bishop of Pennsylvania was marked by controversies. Early in his episcopacy, Bennison became an important figure in the ongoing tension between liberal and conservative factions in the Episcopal Church. Theological disagreements with conservative Anglo-Catholic parishes led to extended legal battles over control of church property. In the latter years of his episcopacy, Bennison faced opposition from liberals and conservatives alike regarding diocesan finances and the purchase of a multimillion dollar 434 acre waterfront site on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland that was developed as \\"Wapiti\\", a summer camp for youth and a diocesan conference center. =Disputes with traditionalist Anglo-Catholic parishes= In 1994‚Äì1995, seven Anglo-Catholic priestsFr. Vernon Austin, St Johns, Norristown; Fr. Robert Haskell, Redemption, Southampton; Fr. Harry Krauss, All Saints, Wynnewood; Fr. Philip Lyman, St. John, Huntingdon Valley; Fr. David Moyer, Good Shepherd, Rosemont; Fr. David Ousley, St. James the Less, Philadelphia; Fr. Larry Snyder, St. Luke, Newtown. These parishes are sometimes referred to as the \\"seven sisters.\\" They were later joined by Fr. Warren Shaw, St Paul, Chester. These eight parishes were associated with the Episcopal Synod of America, the predecessor of Forward in Faith North America. opposed to the ordination of women made an agreement with the 14th bishop of Pennsylvania, Allen Bartlett, known as the \\"Parsons Plan.\\"Virtue, David. \\"The Parsons' Plan Revisited.\\" Virtue Online, November 1, 2006. Under the terms of this plan, Donald Parsons, the retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Quincy, would make episcopal visitations to several traditionalist parishes until the next General Convention. This arrangement was similar to the role of a provincial episcopal visitor in the Church of England. In 1997, the General Convention adopted a resolution stating that \\"no member of this Church shall be denied a place in the life and governance of this Church on account of their sex or their theological views on the ordination of women,\\"Resolution Number 1997-A053. Acts of Convention, 1976-2003. Archives of the Episcopal Church. after which Bishop Bartlett decided not to renew the Parsons Plan. He retired later that year. Despite differences in churchmanship, traditionalist leaders in the diocese supported Charles Bennison's election under the impression that he would continue the provisions of the Parsons Plan.Virtue, David. \\"Broken Promises. \\" Virtuosity, March 11, 2002. These leaders assert that they cast their votes for him after he gave them solemn assurance that he would continue the \\"Parsons Plan.\\" After his installation as Bishop, he announced that he had \\"changed his mind\\" and would no longer consider the Parsons Plan. When Bennison elected not to reinstitute the arrangement, several crises arose in the diocese, compounded by theological differences between Bennison and several conservative parishes. Theological disagreements Disagreements between traditionalist priests and Bishop Bennison centered on Bennison's writings on homosexuality and Christology. Bennison was a signatory to the \\"Koinonia Statement\\", a 1994 letter authored by John Shelby Spong, retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Newark. The statement affirmed the 1976 ordination of women and said that gay or lesbian relationships \\"that are faithful, monogamous, committed, life giving and holy are to be honored\\" and promised \\"support and protection\\" for gay and lesbian clergy.Spong, John Shelby. ‚ÄúA Statement in Koinonia.‚Äù August 25, 1994. In 1997, while still coadjutor, Bennison published an article arguing that, \\"Because the legitimized paradigm institutionalized in the church's present marriage liturgy is a heterosexist one directed against gay men and lesbian women, a change in the rite is required to delegitimize that paradigm.\\"Bennison, Charles E. \\"Rethinking Marriage Again\\" Anglican Theological Review, Fall 1997. He proposed 24 changes to the sacrament of marriage, some based on a \\"Visigothic rite,\\"Bennison, Charles E. \\"Rethinking Marriage Again\\" Anglican Theological Review, Fall 1997. and wrote, :\\"In their relationships and families, lesbian and gay couples, in fact, often display a more enviable and ideal model of the church than do heterosexual couples. ... Anyone who has seen The Birdcage, Mike Nichols's rendition of the gay comedy classic \\"La Cage Aux Folles\\" with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane playing a gay couple ... knows that it looks like a mini-church. Throughout history gay and lesbian couples have established in their committed relationships such minichurches, and, if such is the nature of marriage, then the church ought to open to gay and lesbian couples the sacrament of marriage.\\"Bennison, Charles E. \\"Rethinking Marriage Again\\" Anglican Theological Review, Fall 1997. Bennison's statements on salvation and the doctrine of the Resurrection have been cited as a source of controversy.Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh. \\"Deposed Philadelphia Priest celebrated Mass at Trinity Cathedral, Pittsburgh.\\" Anglican Communion News Service, September 10, 2002. In a 2003 Easter Message, Bennison also wrote that Jesus \\"acknowledges his own sin.

Many Christians interpreted this remark to be a denial of the sinlessness of Jesus.Olsen, Ted. \\"Jesus' Sins?\\" Christianity Today, June 1, 2003. Dispute with the Church of St. James the Less, Philadelphia The Church of St. James the Less had, for many years, withheld its payments to the diocese in protest about the ordination of women. Bennison's decision to not renew the license of Fr. Willis, an assistant priest of St. James, further strained diocesan relations with the parish.In re: Church of St. James the Less. 953 N.P. 2001. Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Orphans Court Division. March 10, 2003. p. 14. In 1999, the vestry of St. James the Less voted to transfer the property and assets of the parish to a nonprofit corporation called the \\"CSJL Foundation,\\" in order to disassociate from the diocese and the Episcopal Church.In re: Church of St James the Less. 953 N.P. 2001. Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Orphans Court Division. March 10, 2003. pp. 13‚Äì16. In response to St James' attempt to secede from the diocese, Bishop Bennison declared the parish \\"inactive or extinct\\" and initiated litigation to seize its property. In 2003, the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the attempted merger of St. James the Less with the CSJL Foundation was ultra vires and invalid, that the vestry was \\"ineligible to continue in their offices,\\" and that the diocese could appoint or elect a new vestry.In re: Church of St. James the Less. 953 N.P. 2001.

Dispute with the Church of the Good Shepherd, Rosemont Fr. David Moyer, Rector (1989‚Äì2011) of the Church of the Good Shepherd in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, was alleged to have refused to allow Bennison to make canonically-required episcopal visitations to Good Shepherd, saying the bishop \\"was too liberal and could not be trusted in the pulpit.\\"Donovan, Gill. \\"Anglican leader offers job to ousted U.S. priest\\". National Catholic Reporter, September 20, 2002, Vol. 38, Iss. 40, p. 17. The charge, however, was disputed by Moyer and by the Vestry of the Church of the Good Shepherd, who insisted that they only advised Bishop Bennison that a visit would not be helpful. Bennison was specifically invited to visit with the Vestry and to inspect the books and records of the Parish, which would have fulfilled his canonical responsibility. Moyer was publicly critical of Bennison's public statements regarding the veracity of the Bible and sexual teachings, denouncing Bennison's teachings as \\"apostate and heretical\\"Nunley, Jan. \\"Deposed Philadelphia priest to join Pittsburgh diocese \\". Episcopal News Service, September 5, 2002. In March 2002, Bennison approved a decision by the Standing Committee of the Diocese of Pennsylvania to inhibit Moyer from exercising his priestly functions for six months under the canons of the church.Bennison, Charles E. Letter to David L. Moyer . March 1, 2002. In April 2002, Moyer sought help from bishops in the Anglican Communion as they gathered for pre-arranged meetings in London.\\"Suspended Priest Will Ask Anglicans for Help\\". Los Angeles Times, April 6, 2002. The office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, \\"indicated that were David Moyer to be in a position of seeking permission, he would have no hesitation in giving him permission to officiate in the Diocese of Canterbury\\"; since Carey was scheduled to retire that October, however, the issue would have to be resolved by his successor, Rowan Williams. Moyer not having recanted, but insisting that he had not left the Episcopal Church as charged by Bennison, within the six-month period of inhibition, at the conclusion of the canonical inhibition Bennison deposed Moyer on September 4, 2002. Bennison deposed him using a canon designed for the removal from the official list of priests a priest who has left the church, rather than using the canon for disciplining of a wayward priest that provides for a church trial in which the priest may contest charges against him. Bennison explained, \\"I deposed him because he had over a decade shown a pattern of a series of canonical failures, one after another. Under his leadership, his parish has become increasingly alienated from his diocese.\\". On September 5, 2002, Moyer was received by Robert Duncan, Bishop of Pittsburgh, as a priest in good standing, although it is unclear whether such reception was permissible under the canon law of the Episcopal Church. Subsequently, Moyer served as dean of the conservative group Forward in Faith North America in 2004,\\"Anglican Communion Network Announces Resignation of Fr Moyer as Dean.\\" www.forwardinfaith.com, December 21, 2004. Retrieved April 2, 2013. and was consecrated as a bishop in the Traditional Anglican Communion on February 16, 2005, though he continued to serve as rector at the Church of the Good Shepherd until August 2011. A Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, court found in the matter of Moyer v. Bennison, et al., on October 24, 2008, that there was no fraud on the part of Bennison, the charge on which the case turned. =Diocesan financial dispute= During Bennison's episcopacy, the Diocese of Pennsylvania developed serious divisions over the management of church finances. Calls arose for Bennison to step down, which he resisted. The financial crisis came to a head in 2006, when the Standing Committee of the diocese voted twice to request Bennison's resignation, alleging the misappropriation of approximately $11.6 million from diocesan trust funds.Diocesan Digest. \\"Diocese will enter mediation in dispute with bishop \\". Episcopal News Service, February 9, 2006. This followed the committee's repeated refusal to accept the reappointment of diocesan chancellor William Bullitt, who advised Bennison on financial matters, and the defeat of the 2006 budget in a diocesan convention. A major point of controversy was the planned use of $1.2 million in unrestricted net assets. Meanwhile, the Diocesan Council passed a resolution in support of Bennison, and Bishop Clayton Matthews of the church Office of Pastoral Development was called in to mediate.Diocesan Digest. \\"Divisive time requires prayerful discernment, bishop says \\". Episcopal News Service, March 2, 2006.Diocesan Digest. \\"Standing Committee asks again for bishop's departure \\". Episcopal News Service, May 4, 2006. On November 6, 2006, the Standing Committee filed a complaint against Bennison with church authorities, charging that he had usurped its \\"canonical prerogatives and authority\\" by spending money and transferring funds without the committee's consent.Verified Complaint in Re: The Right Reverend Charles E. Bennison, Jr. Standing Committee of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania.

Episcopal News Service, March 29, 2007. =Handling of a sexual misconduct case from the 1970s= During the diocesan financial controversy in 2006, allegations first made in 1979 were raised once again that Bennison, when he was serving as rector of a California parish in the 1970s, failed to respond appropriately to charges that his brother, John, had engaged in sexual misconduct while serving at St. Mark's Church in Upland, California. At the time John was in graduate theological studies, and Charles had hired him to serve as a part-time youth leader of St Mark's.O'Reilly, David. \\"Abused Teen's Mother Joins Other Critics of Area Bishop.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, November 5, 2006. Although married, John was alleged to have had sexual relationships with several persons, including one who was allegedly 14. According to one newspaper reporter, John was alleged to have had sexual intercourse with the teen over a four-year period, both on and off the premises of St. Mark's Church.Noyes, Dan. \\"Priest Removed From Church After Sex Scandal \\". KGO-TV/DT, June 9, 2006. However, in a subsequent deposition for Bishop Bennison's trial, the former teen acknowledged her sexual abuse at the age of 14 consisted of a back rub during a youth group meeting when she \\"felt funny.\\" In 1975, John left St. Mark's. In 1977, John acknowledged his failures, voluntarily left the priesthood, and was deposed by Bishop of Los Angeles Robert Rusack. In 1979, after meeting all canonical requirements, John was restored to the priesthood by the same bishop, who‚Äîaccording to subsequent trial testimony‚Äîwas fully cognizant of the prior allegations of misconduct. In 1992, the same charges from the 1970s were raised once again. After a formal church investigation, the parish where John was then serving as rector responded with a unanimous vote of confidence for their priest. Finally, in 2006, Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) initiated a campaign calling for John's resignation. On June 12, 2006, Bishop of California William Swing announced his resignation from the parish and his deposition from the pastoral ministry.Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles: press release, quoted at http://iteamblog.abc7news.com/2006/06/official_word_f.html Meanwhile, although there had been these two prior public adjudications of the same matter, first in 1979, then in 1992, Bishop Bennison's critics said that he had concealed the alleged abuse of the minor from church authorities and police.For example, the Rev. Greg Brewer (Rector, Good Samaritan, Paoli) and the vestry of his parish requested that Bennison cancel his November 2006 episcopal visitation in partial response to what Brewer called \\"Recent revelations that Bishop Bennison not only hid, but misrepresented the truth with regard to his brother's sexual abuse of parishioners, and the Bishop's role in the cover up of these facts.\\" cf. Brewer, Greg. ‚ÄúLetter to the congregation concerning Bishop Bennison's visit.‚Äù November 11, 2006. Charles Bennison initially said he had learned of the allegations from the girl's parents and promptly fired his brother. He acknowledged not having reported the matter to civil or ecclesiastical authorities at the time, saying, \\"I did not think it was my prerogative to do so on my own\\" (because the girl's parents had not chosen to report the matter to the police).O'Reilly, David. \\"The Episcopal Bishop Failed to Report Abuse\\".

The girl's mother, June Alexis, disputed this account,Associated Press. \\"Bishop Sends E-Mail Apologizing for Handling of Brother's Case.\\" International Herald Tribune, November 1, 2006. based on a 1978 letter from Bennison that she says indicate that he knew that their daughter was being abused by his brother, but did not tell them. John's ex-wife, Margaret Thompson, produced another letter from 1979 in which Charles Bennison asked her not to visit the parish because of the potential for \\"a public scandal here which, I believe, could cost me my job.\\"O'Reilly, David. \\"Episcopal Bishop Charles E.

John's victim has stated that \\"she and John were twice interrupted during sex by Charles Bennison's arrival at his brother's apartment\\" (although it is unclear whether she alleges that Bishop Bennison saw them in a compromising situation). At the annual diocesan convention on November 11, 2006, Bennison said: > \\"Reading the statements from last weekend's sessions reminded me that it was > probably the senior warden, not the girl's mother, who in 1975 reported > John's abuse, after which I immediately told him to leave the parish, and > that in order to maintain the confidentiality of both John and the girl, I > did not tell the parents, who nonetheless confronted me when they had found > out four years later. Until reading the statements I had never before known > that John's destructive behavior did not stop, but rather increased, in the > parish to which he went after leaving my parish. That I could have prevented > that from happening had I known to act differently is extremely grievous to > me. My efforts to maintain confidentiality and prevent scandal were very > misguided.\\"Bennison, Charles E., Jr. \\"A Church for Others \\". Address to the > 223rd Meeting of the Convention of the Diocese of Pennsylvania, November 11, > 2006. He acknowledged a \\"failure in the 1970s to act more assertively with regard to my brother, his victims, and the church,\\" but also reassured people that the church had since established reporting and disciplinary procedures so that, \\"What happened 30 years ago would not happen today.\\" Outside the convention, protesters renewed calls for Bennison's resignation. Inside, a motion to hold him accountable narrowly failed.At least four clergy called for Bennison's resignation during the diocesan convention: The Rev. Judith Beck (Rector, St Peters, Philadelphia), the Rev. Pamela Nesbitt (Deacon, St Andrews, Yardley), the Rev. Marek Zabriskie (Rector, St Thomas, Whitemarsh), and the Rev.

Presentment of charges and inhibition from ordained ministry On October 28, 2007, a judicial committee of the Episcopal Church issued a presentment of charges against Bennison. The two charges contained in the presentment were \\"contemporaneous failure to respond properly\\" when he learned of his brother's sexual misconduct and the \\"subsequent suppression of pertinent information.\\"Before the Court for the Trial of a Bishop: In the Matter of the Presentment Against The Right Reverend Charles E.

Both the Most Reverend Katherine Jefferts Schori, the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and the standing committee of the diocese asked for his permanent deposition from holy orders and a ban against him having any ministerial function in the Episcopal Church. On October 3, 2008, the Court for the Trial of a Bishop handed down its sentence, formally deposing Bennison from holy orders. Specifically it stated that \\"The court finds that even today [Bennison] has not shown that he comprehends the nature, significance and effect of his conduct and has not accepted responsibility and repented for his conduct and the substantial negative effects of that conduct.\\" Subsequent motions, successful appeal, and reinstatement Bennison later filed a motion seeking a reduction of his sentence, but in February 2009 the court upheld its decision to depose Bennison.\\"Episcopal Church upholds ouster of Bennison\\".

Meanwhile, on April 17, 2009, Bennison's attorney filed a motion with the Court for the Trial of a Bishop requesting a new trial, citing newly uncovered exculpatory evidence. According to Bennison's attorney, more than 200 letters, written by the then-teenage female to John, were discovered that contradicted witness testimony at the trial. Bennison's attorney asserted that the letters showed that the teenage girl actively tried to cover up her relationship with John, leaving Charles Bennison unaware of the situation and therefore unable to take appropriate action.Associated Press. \\"Citing letters, defrocked bishop asks for new trial\\". Philadelphia Inquirer. April 28, 2009. Accessed May 17, 2009. On September 24, 2009, the Court for the Trial of a Bishop denied the motion for a new trial. \\"Ecclesiastical trial court denies bishop's request for dismissal of charges or new trial\\" Episcopal Life (25 September 2009) Following the denial of a new trial, Bennison then pursued his appeal to the Court of Review for the Trial of a Bishop, which heard his case in Wilmington, Delaware on May 4, 2010. The basis for the appeal was a statute of limitation provision that had been in effect before a Presentment charge had ever been filed against Bishop Bennison. While Bishop Bennison's attorney had repeatedly raised the matter of the limitation statute, the earlier trial court had declined to rule on the issue for unexplained reasons. On August 4, 2010, the Court of Review reversed the trial court's decision, and Bennison shortly afterward returned as Bishop of Pennsylvania. Bennison v. Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America (Court of Review for the Trial of a Bishop), July 28, 2010. On September 21, 2010, however, the House of Bishops adopted a strongly worded yet nonbinding resolution urging Bennison to resign. On October 9, 2012, Bennison announced his retirement as Bishop of Pennsylvania as of December 31, 2012.Episcopal Digital Network On January 12, 2013, Clifton Daniel was elected provisional bishop for a period of two years or until a new diocesan bishop was chosen;Episcopal Digital Network Daniel G.

In the history of Christianity, iconolatry was manifested mainly in popular worship, as a superstitious belief in the divine nature of icons. It was practiced as a direct adoration of icons, and other objects representing various saints, angels and the God. One of extreme practices of iconolatry was scraping parts of icons into the Holy Communion. Iconolatry is the opposite of iconoclasm, and also should not be confused with iconophilia, designating the moderate veneration of icons. Both extreme positions, iconolatry and iconoclasm, were rejected in 787 by the Second Council of Nicaea, being the seventh Ecumenical Council. The Council decided that holy icons should not be destroyed, as was advocated and practiced by the Byzantine iconoclasm, nor veritable (full) worshiped or adored (; ), as was practiced by iconolatry, but to be only venerated as symbolic representations of God, angels, or saints. Overview Icon in Greek simply denotes a picture but has now come to be closely associated with religious art used by the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches. Icons are used by Orthodox Churches to assist in prayer and worship of God. Icon (image) is the same word used in the Bible in , . The Orthodox Church (while finally reinstating the icons) held at least two Church councils to decide on the proper use of icons. The Council of Hieria in 754 expressly forbade the making of icons, and ordered all pictures of Jesus and the saints to be removed from the churches, saying that they ought instead to be decorated with pictures of birds, flowers, and fruit. This council was held near Constantinople, and all attending bishops were from the Constantinople Patriarchate. The other patriarchs refused to send any delegates. The Second Council of Nicaea held in 787 reversed the decisions of that council. This Council of Church leaders (bishops) was a key step towards an alternate understanding of the use of religious art in the Church. An early Church council defined veneration of icons based on the sacred mystery of the Incarnation of Jesus Christ. The Person of Jesus was thought to reveal not only the Word of God (), but the image of God (). Pre-Christian scriptures defined idolatry as worshipping of false gods. Church leaders defended images of Christ on the basis that they were representations of the true incarnation God and clarified the relationship between an image and the one depicted by the image. The principle of respected worship is that, in honoring an image, the honor is to paid not to the image itself, but the one who is portrayed. After the period of Iconoclasm was over, respected veneration of icons spread to Serbia, Bulgaria, and to distant Russia. Depictions of icons bearing the image of God the Father were forbidden in the Orthodox Church, unless depicted in the context of the Revelation or Apocalypse of Saint John, where God the Father is described as an older version of Jesus. Some prefer the depiction of God in the icon type of Rublev's Holy Trinity. Others believe that, as no-one has ever seen God the Father, he should never be depicted in icons, while Jesus, who was seen by human eyes, is allowed to be pictured.

Marks (born 1955) is a professor of biological anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. He is a significant figure in anthropology, especially on the topic of race. Marks is skeptical of genetic explanations of human behavior, of \\"race\\" as a biological category, and of science as a rationalistic endeavor. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Early life and education Born in 1955, Marks studied at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and took graduate degrees in genetics and anthropology from the University of Arizona, completing his doctorate in 1984. When Marks was beginning his career, few anthropologists held degrees in genetics. The Charlotte Observer quotes him as saying, ‚ÄúTwenty-five years ago I was sort of avant garde.

In 2009, Santa Fe's School for Advanced Research awarded him its J. I. Staley Prize for his book What It Means to be 98% Chimpanzee: Apes, People and their Genes. In their award citation, the review panel noted that the book \\"is being read across anthropological disciplines\\" and \\"engages with issues directly relevant to the future of humanity.\\" He received the First Citizens Bank Scholars Medal in 2012, honoring his career of intellectual inquiry. Since then he has been a Templeton Fellow (2013-2014) and a Director's Fellow (2019-2020) at the University of Notre Dame's Institute for Advanced Study, and a Visiting Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin and at the ESRC Genomics Forum at the University of Edinburgh.  Views Marks' 2002 book What it Means to be 98% Chimpanzee argued that there is a significant gap between scientists' knowledge of genetics and their understanding of its functional significance. In opposition to biological determinism, Marks explores evidence for synergy between genetic and cultural factors in shaping human traits such as body shape, school performance, athleticism, and even menstrual cycles. Marks' published works include many scholarly articles and essays. He is an outspoken critic of scientific racism, and has prominently argued against the idea that \\"race\\" is a natural category. In Marks's view, \\"race\\" is a negotiation between patterns of biological variation and patterns of perceived difference. He argues that race and human diversity are different subjects, and do not map on to one another well.\\"Jonathan Marks honored by UNCC for anthropology work\\" This view is now the stated consensus of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists. As described in his book Is Science Racist?, Marks considers science to have four epistemic qualities: naturalism, experimentalism, rationalism, and a primary value on accuracy. In this book and in Why I Am Not a Scientist, he argues that anthropologists have an ambiguous relationship with science because their goal of illuminating the human condition requires both scientific and humanistic frameworks. In reference to the titles of his books, Marks has stated that \\"he would like it to be known, for the record, that he is about 98% scientist, and not a chimpanzee.\\" Bibliography * Evolutionary Anthropology (1991, with Edward Staski) * Human Biodiversity (1995) * What It Means to be 98% Chimpanzee: Apes, People and their Genes (2002) * Why I Am Not a Scientist (2009) * The Alternative Introduction to Biological Anthropology (2010) * Tales of the Ex-Apes: How We Think about Human Evolution (2015) * Is Science Racist?

A gemma (plural gemmae) is a single cell, or a mass of cells, or a modified bud of tissue, that detaches from the parent and develops into a new individual. This type of asexual reproduction is referred to as fragmentation. It is a means of asexual propagation in plants. These structures are commonly found in fungi, algae, liverworts and mosses, but also in some flowering plants such as pygmy sundews and some species of butterworts. Vascular plants have many other methods of asexual reproduction including bulbils and turions.  In mosses and liverworts  Marchantia with round cups, and Lunularia with crescent cups, both containing gemmae. Gemmae dislodged by rain are visible at the bottom of the image. The production of gemmae is a widespread means of asexual reproduction in both liverworts and mosses. In liverworts such as Marchantia, the flattened plant body or thallus is a haploid gametophyte with gemma cups scattered about its upper surface. The gemma cups are cup-like structures containing gemmae. The gemmae are small discs of haploid tissue, and they directly give rise to new gametophytes. They are dispersed from gemma cups by rainfall.Smith, AJE (1989) The Liverworts of Britain and Ireland, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. The gemmae are bilaterally symmetrical and are not differentiated into dorsal and ventral surfaces. The mature gemmae fall on the ground and if conditions are suitable their germination starts immediately. The surface of the gemma which comes in contact of the soil gives out many rhizoids. This surface eventually becomes the lower(ventral) surface of the thallus. Meanwhile, the apical cells present in the two lateral notches become active and form two thalli in opposite directions.

Origins As an early frequent user of the technique, Dorothy Rice Sims is often thought to be the originator of the psychic bid; however, according to bridge player and writer, Albert Morehead, \\"She did not actually invent the psychic bid, though it is generally credited to her, but she did give it its name and she wrote the first and only book about it.\\"Bridge Beat 23, Dorothy Rice Sims.

Examples After two successive passes, this hand might be opened with 1 as a psych, trying to stop opponents from reaching a likely game or even slam. Some might open with a 1 psych, to confuse matters further. Of course, there is always a danger that the partner will double the opponents on the basis of opener's presumed strength, or support the psychic opening at too high a level. North opens 1 and South can see that game in notrump is probably the best prospect. South might support clubs directly, bid 2NT, or temporize with 1 or 1. But South might instead bid 1, a psych that attempts to talk the opponents out of a diamond lead against 3NT. Right-hand opponent opens 1. Instead of preempting in diamonds, South can bid 1NT to confuse matters, running to diamonds if doubled. This type of psych is referred to as the comic notrump. Some psychic bids are so common that they are often referred to as mini-psychs. For example, many would consider a hand such as to be an automatic 1 bid after partner opens 1 and the right-hand opponent doubles for takeout--it is made in an attempt to talk the opponents out of their likely spade fit, subsequently escaping to 3 if necessary. Regulations Per rules of the game, the partner of a player who has psyched must not take advantage of any special knowledge of the partnership's habits. So a partnership that uses occasional psychic bids must take care to ensure full disclosure -- not only of its formal bidding system but also of its habits. For example, if a partnership tends to psych under certain circumstances, it is much better prepared to recognize a psych, and to cope with it, than are its opponents. The game's Laws and Proprieties therefore require disclosure of the partnership's tendency. In duplicate bridge, sponsoring organizations often impose a number of restrictions on psychic bids. For example, psychs of strong artificial opening bids (such as strong two clubs) are not allowed by the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL).Some authorities disagree with this approach, stating that such a prohibition amounts to giving the force of law to the personal preferences of bridge administrators. However, to do so is not illegal, because the Laws give sponsoring organizations the right to regulate the use of conventions. How Would You Rule?, Bridge World Magazine, 1978, page 43. In addition, if the partner is perceived to have bid abnormally due to taking account of a psych, then the score may be adjusted. Also, partnership agreements to use a \\"check bid\\" or psychic control to verify the psych may either be banned entirely (as by the ACBL) or limited in their usage (as by the World Bridge Federation, which designates them brown sticker conventions).

The existentialist topic of the book is the \\"will to happiness,\\" the conscious creation of one's happiness, and the need of time (and money) to do so. It draws on memories of the author including his job at the maritime commission in Algiers, his suffering from tuberculosis, and his travels in Europe. Camus composed and reworked the novel between 1936 and 1938 but then decided not to publish it. It was eventually published in 1971, over 11 years after the author's death. The English translation by Richard Howard appeared in 1972. A Happy Death was Camus' first novel and was clearly the precursor to his most famous work, The Stranger, published in 1942. The main character in A Happy Death is named \\"Patrice Mersault\\", similar to The Stranger's \\"Meursault\\"; both are French Algerian court clerks who kill another man. A Happy Death is written in the third person, whereas The Stranger is written in the first person. The novel has just over 100 pages and consists of two parts.  Summary  Part 1, titled \\"Natural death\\", describes the monotone and empty life of Patrice Mersault with his boring office job and a meaningless relationship with his girlfriend Marthe. Mersault gets to know the rich invalid Roland Zagreus (Zagreus is a character of Greek mythology) who shows Mersault a way out: \\"Only it takes time to be happy. A lot of time. Happiness, too, is a long patience. And in almost every case, we use up our lives making money, when we should be using our money to gain time.\\" Zagreus implies that his life is a meaningless waste, and so Meursault decides to kill him in order to create his own happiness with the rich man's money. Part 2, titled \\"Conscious death\\", follows Mersault's subsequent trip to Europe. Traveling by train from city to city, he is unable to find peace and decides to return to Algiers, to live in a house high above the sea with three young female friends. Everybody here has only one goal: the pursuit of happiness by abandoning the world. Yet Mersault needs solitude. He marries a pleasant woman named Lucienne whom he does not love, buys a house in a village by the sea, and moves in alone. \\"At this hour of night, his life seemed so remote to him, he was so solitary and indifferent to everything and to himself as well, that Mersault felt he had at last attained what he was seeking, that the peace which filled him now was born of that patient self-abandonment he had pursued and achieved with the help of this warm world so willing to deny him without anger.\\" Severely ill, he dies a happy death: \\"And stone among the stones, he returned in the joy of his heart to the truth of the motionless worlds.\\"  External links  * Review by Anatole Broyard, The New York Times, 13 June 1972 * Notes on A Happy Death by Bob Corbett * A Happy Death, translated by Richard Howard * From In Review by David Latham Category:1971 French novels Category:Novels by Albert Camus Category:Absurdist fiction Category:√âditions Gallimard books Category:1971 debut novels ","title":"A Happy Death"},{"id":"1924983","text":"Braceville Township is one of the twenty-four townships of Trumbull County, Ohio, United States.

The origin of dramatic performance in the Indian subcontinent can be traced back to as early as 200 BCE. Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of Sanskrit literature.Brandon (1981, xvii). Buddhist philosopher Asvaghosa who composed Buddhacarita is considered to have been the first Sanskrit dramatist. Despite its name, a classical Sanskrit drama uses both Sanskrit and Prakrit languages giving it a bilingual nature. Sanskrit drama utilised stock characters, such as the hero (nayaka), heroine (nayika), or clown (vidusaka). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya by Pata√±jali contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.Richmond (1998, 517). This treatise on grammar provides a feasible date for the beginnings of theatre in India.Richmond (1998, 517). KƒÅlidƒÅsa in the 4th-5th century CE, was arguably one of ancient India's greatest Sanskrit dramatists. Three famous romantic plays written by KƒÅlidƒÅsa are the MƒÅlavikƒÅgnimitram (MƒÅlavikƒÅ and Agnimitra), Vikram≈çrva≈õƒ´yam (Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi), and Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntalam (The Recognition of Shakuntala). The last was inspired by a story in the Mahabharata and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into English and German. ≈öakuntalƒÅ (in English translation) influenced Goethe's Faust (1808‚Äì1832).Brandon (1981, xvii). The next great Indian dramatist was Bhavabhuti (c. 7th century CE). He is said to have written the following three plays: Malati-Madhava, Mahaviracharita and Uttararamacarita. Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of Ramayana. The powerful Indian emperor Harsha (606‚Äì648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy Ratnavali, Priyadarsika, and the Buddhist drama Nagananda. Other famous Sanskrit dramatists include ≈öhudraka, Bhasa, and Asvaghosa. Though numerous plays written by these playwrights are still available, little is known about the authors themselves. Beginnings Shatapatha Brahmana (~800‚Äì700 BCE) has verses in chapter 13.2 written in the form of a play between two actors.ML Varadpande (1990), History of Indian Theatre, Volume 1, Abhinav, , page 48 Early Buddhist literature provides the earliest evidence for the existence of Indian theatre. The Pali suttas (ranging in date from the 5th to 3rd centuries BCE) refer to the existence of troupes of actors (led by a chief actor), who performed dramas on a stage. It is indicated that these dramas incorporated dance, but were listed as a distinct form of performance, alongside dancing, singing, and story recitations.Rachel Van M. Baumer and James R. Brandon (ed.), Sanskrit Drama in Performance (University of Hawaii Press, 1981), pp.11 The earliest-surviving fragments of Sanskrit drama date from c.200 BCE.Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 516-517). The wealth of archeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.Richmond (1998, 516). The Vedas (the earliest Indian literature, from between 1500 and 600 BCE) contain no hint of it; although a small number of hymns are composed in a form of dialogue, the rituals of the Vedic period do not appear to have developed into theatre.Richmond (1998, 516). The MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya by Pata√±jali contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.Richmond (1998, 517). This treatise on grammar from 140 BCE provides a feasible date for the beginnings of theatre in India.Richmond (1998, 517). Since the time of Alexander the Great, the Indian subcontinent came into direct contact with Greek culture. This has led to a scholarly debate about how much influence Ancient Greek drama had upon the development of Indian theatre.Arthur Berriedale Keith, The Sanskrit Drama in Its Origin, Development, Theory & Practice (Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, 1992), p.57-68 Theory = Natya Shastra = Major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is A Treatise on Theatre (NƒÅtya≈õƒÅstra), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BCE to 200 CE) and whose authorship is attributed to Bharata Muni. The Treatise is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses acting, dance, music, dramatic construction, architecture, costuming, make-up, props, the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a mythological account of the origin of theatre.Richmond (1998, 517). In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in an hereditary process. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain. Under the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (sutradhara), who may also have acted.Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1998, 517). This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a puppeteer‚Äîthe literal meaning of \\"sutradhara\\" is \\"holder of the strings or threads\\".Richmond (1998, 517). The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique.Richmond (1998, 518). There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played characters their own age, while others played characters younger or older than themselves. Of all the elements of theatre, the Treatise gives most attention to acting (abhinaya), which consists of two styles: realistic (lokadharmi) and conventional (natyadharmi), though the major focus is on the latter.Richmond (1998, 518). The literal meaning of abhinaya is \\"to carry forwards\\". The theory of rasa described in the text has been a major influence on the modern theatre of India as well as Indian cinema, particularly Bollywood. Plays =Mricchakatika (The Little Clay Cart)= One of the earliest known Sanskrit plays, this play was composed by ≈öudraka in the 2nd century BC. Rife with romance, sex, royal intrigue and comedy, the juicy plot of the play has numerous twists and turns. The main story is about a young man named Charudatta, and his love for Vasantasena, a rich courtesan or nagarvadhu. The love affair is complicated by a royal courtier, who is also attracted to Vasantasena. The plot is further complicated by thieves and mistaken identities, and thus making it a greatly hilarious and entertaining play. It invited widespread admiration when staged in New York in 1924. The play was made into a 1984 Hindi movie Utsav, directed by Girish Karnad. The Indian play depicted in the 2001 film Moulin Rouge! may have been based on The Little Clay Cart. =BhƒÅsa= The plays written by BhƒÅsa were known to historians only through the references of later writers, as the manuscripts themselves were lost. Manuscripts of 13 plays written by him were discovered in an old library in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) in 1913 by the scholar Ganapati Sastri. A 14th play was later discovered and attributed to BhƒÅsa, but its authorship is disputed. BhƒÅsa's most famous plays are Svapnavasavadattam (SwapnavƒÅsadatta) (\\"Vasavadatta's dream\\"), PancharƒÅtra, and Pratijna Yaugandharayaanam (\\"The vows of Yaugandharayana\\"). Some other plays being PratimanƒÅtaka, AbhishekanƒÅtaka, BƒÅlacharita, D≈´tavƒÅkya, KarnabhƒÅra, D≈´taghatotkacha, ChƒÅrudatta, MadhyamavyƒÅyoga and ≈™rubha·πÖga. Karnabharam is a critically acclaimed play and it is being subjected to lot of experimentation by the modern theatre groups in India. BhƒÅsa is considered to be one of the best Sanskrit playwrights, second only to Kalidasa. He is earlier than Kalidasa and is dated to the 3rd or 4th century CE.Robert E. Goodwin (1998), The Playworld of Sanskrit Drama, Introduction, pg. xviiiMoriz Winternitz, History of Indian Literature, p.204-205 =KƒÅlidƒÅsa= KƒÅlidƒÅsa (4th-5th century CEKalidasa at Encyclop√¶dia BritannicaSheldon Pollock (ed., 2003) Literary Cultures in History: Reconstructions from South Asia, p.79) is easily the greatest poet and playwright in Sanskrit, and occupies the same position in Sanskrit literature that Shakespeare occupies in English literature. He deals primarily with famous Hindu legends and themes; three famous plays by KƒÅlidƒÅsa are Vikram≈çrva≈õƒ´yam (\\"Vikrama and Urvashi\\"), MƒÅlavikƒÅgnimitram (\\"Malavika and Agnimitra\\"), and the play that he is most known for: Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntalam (\\"The Recognition of Shakuntala\\"). The last named play is considered to be greatest play in Sanskrit. More than a millennium later, it would so powerfully impress the famous German writer Goethe that he would write: :\\"Wouldst thou the young year's blossoms and the fruits of its decline :And all by which the soul is charmed, enraptured, feasted, fed, :Wouldst thou the earth and heaven itself in one sole name combine? :I name thee, O Sakuntala! and all at once is said. \\" KƒÅlidƒÅsa also wrote two large epic poems, Raghuva·πÉ≈õa (\\"The Genealogy of Raghu\\") and KumƒÅrasambhava (\\"Birth of Kumara\\"), and two smaller epics, ·πöitusa·πÉhƒÅra (\\"Medley of Seasons\\") and Meghad≈´ta (The Cloud Messenger), another 'perfect' work. KƒÅlidƒÅsa's writing is characterized by the usage of simple but beautiful Sanskrit, and by his extensive use of similes. His similes have earned him the saying, Upama Kalidasasya (KƒÅlidƒÅsa owns simile). The full ≈õloka reads: \\"upamƒÅ KƒÅlidƒÅsasya, BhƒÅraver artha gauravam  Da·πá·∏çinah padalƒÅlityam, MƒÅghe shanti trayogu·πáah \\" =Mudrarakshasa of Vishakhadatta= Amongst Sanskrit plays, the historical play Mudrarakshasa is unique because it contains political intrigue and is full of life, action and sustained interest. The time period of composition is prior to 800 C.E. In the play, Chandragupta Maurya is ruling from Pataliputra, having deposed the last of the Nanda kings. Rakshasa the minister of Nanda, attempts to avenge his late master. Chanakya, the minister of Chandragupta succeeds in winning over Rakshasa to his master's side.Macdonell A.A. A history of Sanskrit plays(1913 p 365) =Other major plays= Other great plays include Ratnavali, Nagananda and Priyadarsika by Sri Harsha (7th century CE), Mahendra Vikram Varman Mattavilasa Prahasana, Shakti Bhadra's ƒÄ≈õcaryac≈´·∏çƒÅma·πái, Kulasekhara's Subhadra Dhananjaya and Tapatisamvarana, Neelakanta's Kalyana Saugandhika and Sri Krishna Charita. King Udayana in Bhasa's Swapnavasavadattam Koodiyattam‚Äîthe only surviving ancient Sanskrit theatre. (Artist:Mani Damodara Chakyar) Performances Sanskrit plays were very popular and were staged in ancient times all over India. Now the only surviving ancient Sanskrit drama theatre is Koodiyattam, which is preserved in Kerala by the Chakyar community. This form of Sanskrit drama is thought to be at least 2000 years old and is one of the oldest living theatrical traditions in the world. All major Sanskrit plays such as that of Bhasa, Sri Harsha, Shakti Bhadra etc. are performed in Koodiyattam. Guru NƒÅtyƒÅchƒÅrya Vid≈´shakaratnam Padma Shri MƒÅni MƒÅdhava ChƒÅkyƒÅr choreographed and directed plays like Kalidasa's Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntala, Vikramorva≈õƒ´ya and MƒÅlavikƒÅgnimitra; Bhasa's SwapnavƒÅsadatta and PancharƒÅtra for the first time in the history of Koodiyattam. He popularised Koodiyattam and rejuvenated the only surviving Sanskrit drama theatre in India. One of the hypotheses (as yet without consensus) of the origins of the \\"Trivandrum plays\\" of Bhasa is that these 13 plays were adapted from their original sources and brought to Kerala for choreography in the Koodiyattam tradition. Modern Sanskrit Plays Manmohan Acharya, a modern Sanskrit playwright has written many plays and dance dramas. Some worth-mentioning plays are Arjuna-Pratijnaa, Shrita-kamalam, Pada-pallavam, Divya-Jayadevam, Pingalaa, Mrtyuh, Sthitaprajnah, Tantra-mahasaktih, Purva-sakuntalam, Uttara-sakuntalam and Raavanah.http://www.narthaki.com/info/rev11/rev1092.html Famous Indian Dance Drama, Tantram youtube video by Srjan, Script written by Vanikavi Vidyadhar Shastri wrote three Sanskrit plays viz.

The station at Wo Hop Shek was the most modern of all stations in Hong Kong at the time it was built, and instead of being a brick built structure as other stations were it was of cement and steel. Special vehicles were built to carry the bodies. The branch was abandoned after the railway was electrified in 1983. No traces can be found now of the line, but the site of the station survives as a roundabout.

It is performed in many industries or hobbies although in the repetition industries the machine's initial setup is designed to remove the need to mark out every individual piece. Manufacturing Marking out consists of transferring the dimensions from the plan to the workpiece in preparation for the next step, machining or manufacture. Typical tools include: * Surface plate or marking out table -- provides a true surface from which to work * Angle plates -- assist in holding the workpiece perpendicular to the table * Scriber -- is the equivalent of a pen or pencil. It literally scratches the metal surface leaving behind a fine, bright line * Height gauge or scribing block -- allows lines to be scribed at a preset distance, from the tables surface * Surface gauge -- an ungraduated comparison measuring tool that performs much the same function as the vernier height gauge. It is often used in conjunction with a dial indicator and a precision height gauge. * Marking blue -- to provide a usable writing surface by covering any existing scratches and providing a contrasting background * Profile gauge * Protractor -- to assist in the transfer of angular measurements * Combination square -- an alternative tool for transferring angular measurements * Square -- to transfer 90¬∞ angles to the workpiece * Punches -- either prick or center punch to create permanent marks or dimples for drill bits to start in ** Automatic center punch -- a spring-loaded punch that creates prick punch marks without the need for a ball peen hammer * Ball peen hammer -- used in conjunction with the punches to provide the striking blow needed * Dividers or measuring compass -- used for marking out circles of any desired radius, Welding As welding does not always require the use of fine tolerances, marking out is usually performed by using centre punches, hammers, tape measures and chalk. The \\"chalk\\" is actually a small pre-cut block of talc (soapstone). These talc blocks can be sharpened to a stronger point than the softer blackboard chalk. The color of the chalk provides good contrast against the dark color of the hot rolled steel that is generally used.

He was the son of Ashoka's blind son, Kunala, and succeeded his cousin, Dasharatha, as emperor of the Maurya Empire. Claim to throne Kunala was the son of one of Ashoka's queens, Padmavati (who was Jain), but was blinded in a conspiracy to remove his claim to the throne. Thus, Kunala was replaced by Dasharatha as the heir to the throne. Kunala lived in Ujjain with his \\"Dhai Maa\\". Samprati was brought up there. Years after being denied the throne, Kunala and Samprati approached Ashoka's court in an attempt to claim the throne. Ashoka could not deliver the throne to his blind son, but promised Samprati would be heir apparent after Dasharatha. After Dasharatha's death, Samprati inherited the throne of the Maurya Empire. Reign According to the Jain tradition he ruled for 53 years. The Jaina text mentions that he ruled both from Pataliputra and Ujjain.Thapar, Romila (2001). and the Decline of the Maurya, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, , p.187 According to a Jain text, the provinces of Surashtra, Maharashtra, Andhra, and the Mysore region broke away from the empire shortly after Ashoka's death (i.e., during Dasharatha's reign), but were reconquered by Samprati, who later deployed soldiers disguised as Jain monks. Samprati and Jainism Samprati is regarded for his patronage and efforts to spread Jainism in east India. While in one source, he is described as nominally a Jain from birth (Sthaviravali 9.53), most accounts emphasize his conversion at the hands of the Jain monk Suhastisuri, the eighth leader of the congregation established by lord Mahavira Swami. After his conversion he was credited with actively spreading Jainism to many parts of India and beyond, both by making it possible for monks to travel to barbarian lands, and by building and renovating thousands of temples and establishing millions of idols. He was a disciple of Suhastisuriji. In literature Around 1100 CE Devachandrasuri of the Purnatalla Gaccha told the story of Samprati in his commentary on the Textbook on Fundamental Purity (Mulashuddhi Prakarana), in a chapter on the virtues of building temples. A century later, Amradevasuri of the Brihad Gaccha included the story of Samprati in his commentary to the Treasury of Stories (Akhyana Manikosha). In 1204, Malayaprabhasuri, a disciple of Manatungasuri of the Purnima Gaccha, wrote an extensive Prakrit commentary on his teacher's Deeds of Jayanti (Jayanti Carita), in which he included the story of Samprati as an example of the virtue of compassion (Caudhari 1973: 201-2). There are also some anonymous and undated medieval texts devoted solely to the story of Samprati, such as the 461-verse Sanskrit Deeds of King Samprati (Samprati Nripa Charitra).

The triumvirate established by the law was renewed in 38 BC. Unlike the First Triumvirate, which was a private arrangement among three men, the Second Triumvirate was a legal instrument, which vested the three men with dictatorial powers. The Second Triumvirate, nominally a \\"three-man commission for restoring the constitution of the republic\\" (triumviri rei publicae constituendae), was given the power to make or annul laws without the need for approval from the Senate or the people, insulated their judicial decisions from appeal and allowed the Triumvirs to name magistrates at will and manage state lands. Although the three members possessed the full powers of their office, unlike the normal republican magistracies, the triumvirs could not veto one another. While the constitution of the Roman Republic was not dismantled by the lex Titia, it never recovered and, over the next two decades, would transform into the constitution of the Roman Empire. Certainly, it can be argued that in Roman constitutional theory, the law's passage was simply an exercise of the sovereign people's legislative authority. The passing of the lex Titia marked the de jure end of the Roman Republic, but in practice, it had already been repeatedly subverted by prior legislation, such as that conferring dictatorships on generals, such as Sulla and Julius Caesar.

He has won twenty Breeders' Cup races, received five Eclipse Awards for his accomplishments, and his horses have won 25 year-end Eclipse Awards. He was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2007. Background and career Born and raised on a small farm, Lukas grew up with an interest in horses. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison with a master's degree in education then taught high school where for nine years he was a head basketball coach. He began training quarter horses in California in 1968 and after 10 years of achievement that saw him train 24 world champions, he switched to training thoroughbreds. The first trainer to earn more than $100 million in purse money, he has been the year's top money winner 14 times. Lukas got his big break in 1980 when he won the Preakness Stakes on Codex. His horses have won the Kentucky Derby four times, the Preakness Stakes on six occasions, and have claimed victory four times in the Belmont Stakes, including winning all three of the Classics in 1995 with Thunder Gulch (Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes) and Timber Country (Preakness), making him the first trainer to sweep the Triple Crown Classic races with two different horses in a season. In 2013, he surpassed Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons for the most Triple Crown race victories, with 14. He has won Breeder's Cup races a record 20 times. Fillies Lukas has trained have won the Kentucky Oaks four times. Three of his horses‚ÄîLady's Secret in 1986, Criminal Type in 1990 and Charismatic in 1999‚Äîwon the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. He has a total of 25 horses that have won various Eclipse Awards. He has won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Trainer four times. In 1999, the same year his horse Charismatic came within 2 lengths of the Triple Crown, he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2007, becoming the first person to enter both the Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse halls of fame. In 2013 he was awarded the Eclipse Award of Merit for his accomplishments. In 2014, at age 78, in his acceptance speech for the 2013 Eclipse Award of Merit, he stated, \\"[w]hen they start giving you awards...they are trying to get you to retire. Well, you young trainers get ready because I'm not retiring. We're coming after you, so you'd better get up a little more early in the morning from now on. We're coming after you with a vengeance.\\" Personal life Lukas has been married four times. He had one son, Jeff (1957‚Äì2016), and two grandchildren, with his first wife. In December 1993, Lukas' derby contender Tabasco Cat seriously injured Jeff Lukas, who worked for his father as an assistant trainer and was the elder Lukas' hard-driving right-hand man. In a shedrow accident at Santa Anita Park, the colt broke loose and when Jeff Lukas tried to stop him, the horse slammed into him, throwing him into the air and when Jeff landed on the concrete, he suffered a skull fracture which left him in a coma for several weeks. He suffered permanent brain damage; he had changes in personality, vision loss, and damage to his memory. By spring of 1994, he had recovered enough that he attempted to return to horse racing, but after a series of less-demanding jobs ending in 2003, it was clear he could not work safely around racehorses. He also tried living and working near horse farms, but his disabilities were too severe for him to be safe around horses at all. He ultimately moved to Atoka, Oklahoma, in 2007 to work for David Burrage, who had been the accountant and general manager for Lukas Racing Stables. By that time, Burrage was a banker and owned the First Bank in Atoka, which employed Lukas. His father bought him a home there and Jeff lived a quiet life until his death at age 58 in March 2016.Jeff Lukas RememberedOut of the Darkness Thoroughbreds trained with major wins ;Kentucky Derby *Winning Colors (1988) *Thunder Gulch (1995) *Grindstone (1996) *Charismatic (1999) ;Preakness Stakes *Codex (1980) *Tank's Prospect (1985) *Tabasco Cat (1994) *Timber Country (1995) *Charismatic (1999) *Oxbow (2013) ;Belmont Stakes *Tabasco Cat (1994) *Thunder Gulch (1995) *Editor's Note (1996) *Commendable (2000) ;Breeders' Cup Classic *Cat Thief (1999) ;Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic *Life's Magic (1985) *Lady's Secret (1986) *Sacahuista (1987) *Spain (2000) ;Breeders' Cup Mile *Steinlen (1989) ;Breeders' Cup Sprint *Gulch (1988) *Orientate (2002) ;Breeders' Cup Juvenile *Capote (1986) *Success Express (1987) *Is It True (1988) *Timber Country (1994) *Boston Harbor (1996) ;Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies *Twilight Ridge (1985)BC Juvenile Fillies Star Twilight Ridge Dies *Open Mind (1988) *Flanders (1994)Champion Flanders Euthanized *Cash Run (1999) *Folklore (2005) *Take Charge Brandi (2014) ;Breeders' Cup Juvenile Sprint *Hightail (2012) References Further reading *DeVito, Carlo.

The Bagler faction was made up principally of the Norwegian aristocracy, clergy and merchants. It was formed in Sk√•ne, then part of Denmark, in 1196 principally by Bishop Nicholas Arnesson of Oslo and Archbishop Erik Ivarsson (ca. 1130‚Äì1213) of Nidaros around the pretender Inge Magnusson (nicknamed the Baglar-King) to depose King Sverre Sigurdsson. It contested with the Birkebeiners, essentially a faction of peasants, led by the pretender King Sverre, for control in a Norwegian civil war during the late 12th century. Sverris saga provided Sverre a royal lineage as putative bastard son of the late king Sigurd II of Norway, which in the Norway of the time provided him a claim to the throne. Historians generally agree with the consensus of his time that he was a pretender/ impostor. The civil wars period of Norwegian history lasted from 1130 to 1217. During this period there were several interlocked conflicts of varying scale and intensity. The background for these conflicts were the unclear Norwegian succession laws, social conditions and the struggle between church and king. There were then two main parties, firstly known by varying names or no names at all, but finally condensed into parties of Bagler and Birkebeiner. The rallying point regularly was a royal son, who was set up as the head figure of the party in question, to oppose the rule of the king from the contesting party. From a socio-historical perspective, Bagler can be interpreted as conservatives against the results of developments such as the rapid increase in landless border men (markamenn), who settled along the Swedish border and made their living by pillaging the rich old settlements. That lawless population became the foremost basis of the Birkebeiner. Bagler also favoured the church and its privileges and possessions. Viken and Vestlandet, where social distinctions were growing deeper, were gaining more power at the expense of Tr√∏ndelag, a region where the social tensions were not as marked. The wealthier classes, particularly in Viken, were the basis of the Bagler party. The powerful old Tr√∏nder families were simply being left behind by their peers in the south, who had acquired a strong leader in the Vestland earl Erling Skakke in the mid-12th century. The antecedents of the Bagli party had been supporting the rule of King Inge I of Norway and after him, King Magnus V of Norway (killed 1184) and the latter's father and regent, earl Erling Skakke (killed 1179). The Birkebein faction had been formed in 1174 to depose Magnus and Erling. The Birkebeiner continued earl Erling's centralization which underscores the geographical motivations behind the conflicting parties. The Birkebein policy during Sverre did not seek a social revolution, only to move the centre of power back to Tr√∏ndelag. Around the year 1200, these rival groups shared the identical but opposite goal of controlling the entire country. King Sverre managed to acquire control of much of Norway, but in Hedmark and √òsterdal, the Baglers remained powerful. Upon Sverre's death in 1202, the Bagler power increased. Sverre's successor, King Haakon III of Norway, died after a two-year reign in 1204, leaving his posthumous son Haakon Haakonsson in Hamar, which was under Bagler control. In 1206, a group of the Birkebeiners set off on a dangerous voyage through treacherous mountains and forests, taking the now two-year-old Haakon Haakonsson to safety in Trondheim. Norwegian history credits the Birkebeiners' bravery with preserving the life of the boy who later became King Haakon IV of Norway. The Birkebeins managed to hold some power, despite short reigns of their monarchs after Sverre. In 1209, a pact was made between Bagler and Birkebeiner, which recognized Bagler pretender Philip Simonsson as ruler of Oppland and Viken in Eastern Norway, without the title of king, and recognized Birkebeiner's Inge B√•rdsson as King Inge II of Norway. They both died in 1217 and Birkebeiner-born Haakon IV ascended the throne, relatively unopposed, under the regency of Duke Skule Baardsson. Later in 1240, Haakon IV ended the civil wars and weakened the role of the aristocracy in Norway.

Its name derives from that of the Toggenburg region of the Canton of St. Gallen, where it is thought to have originated. It is among the most productive breeds of dairy goat and is distributed world-wide, in at least fifty countries in all continents.  History  The Toggenburg is the traditional goat breed of the Toggenburg and Werdenberg regions of the Canton of St. Gallen in eastern Switzerland. The herd-book was started in 1890. At first, the goats were often dark-coated, sometimes with white markings; there may have been some cross- breeding with Appenzell and Chamois-coloured stock in neighbouring areas. The typical mouse-grey colour with white facial markings was fixed by selective breeding in the twentieth century. There were 850 goats in the Toggenburg and the Werdenberg region of 3000 in Switzerland, which is down from 20,000 in the 1950s. The club St. Gallen Goat Breeders Association, that was founded in 1901, registers the breed. The Verein Ziegenfreunde was formed to protect the breed and unite breed owners. British Toggenburgs are heavier and have improved milk quality. By the middle of 2002, 4146 Toggenburgs had been registered with the New Zealand Dairy Goat Breeders Association.

The merged institution was named Queen Mary and Westfield College until 2013, when the name was legally changed to Queen Mary University of London. History The college was founded in 1882 by Constance Louise Maynard (1849‚Äì1935) and Ann Dudin Brown. Dudin Brown had intended to found a missionary school but she had been persuaded otherwise by Maynard and Mary Petrie.Janet Sondheimer, 'Brown, Ann Dudin (1822‚Äì1917)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 , accessed 8 September 2018 They worked with the Metcalfe sisters.

In the mid-to-late 1980s, the University of London underwent considerable reorganisation, and many smaller colleges were merged. Consequently, Westfield was merged with Queen Mary College in 1989, forming Queen Mary and Westfield College. Most student accommodation, administrative offices and several academic departments continued to be based at the Hampstead campus until 1992, however, and the College retained its separate identity.

The remainder of the south side (the Caroline Skeel Library, Ellison, Temple, Chesney and Stocks buildings) was used by King's College as student accommodation and as an archive. The north side of the site (Queen Mother Hall, Bay House, Old House, Maynard, Lady Chapman, Orchard I and II, Dudin-Brown and Skeel buildings) remains in use as student accommodation, with Orchard I and II renamed for Lord Cameron and Rosalind Franklin, respectively.

The station initially operated on 1060 kHz with 100-watts from an on-campus antenna supported by two steel towers. In 1925 power was increased to 500 watts and the call letters changed to WCAC.\\"Additions and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 1, 1925, page 10. On April 30, 1936 WCAC's license was voluntarily surrendered for cancellation,\\"WICC Gets Full Time\\", Broadcasting, June 1, 1936, page 32. due to frustrations over restricted operating hours and constant frequency and power changes mandated by the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) and its 1934 successor the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), that made it impossible for the college to achieve its goal of developing a state- wide educational service.\\"Connecticut State College\\", Education's Own Stations by S. E. Frost, Jr., 1937, pages 71-72. =AM carrier current station = Around the time that WCAC went off the air, students at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island were developing a campus-wide broadcast service called \\"The Brown Network\\". This employed \\"carrier current\\" transmissions, using multiple very low power AM band radio transmitters that fed their signals into building electrical wires, for reception by any standard radios that were close by.The Gas Pipe Networks: A History of College Radio 1936-1946 by Louis M. Bloch, Jr., 1980, pages 11-13. Because of their extremely limited coverage, the FCC did not require carrier current stations to be licensed. Station installations soon spread to other college campuses, especially in the northeastern United States. Representatives from the University of Connecticut traveled to Brown to investigate the idea, and decided to establish a station at Storrs. In February 1940 the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) was formed to coordinate activities between twelve college carrier current stations and to solicit advertisers interested in sponsoring programs geared toward their student audiences, with the University of Connecticut as one of the charter members.Bloch (1980) pages 26-27. The University of Connecticut station initially identified itself as both the \\"Husky Network\\" and \\"UCBS\\", which stood for the \\"University of Connecticut Broadcasting System\\".Bloch (1980) pages 82-83. It began broadcasting on April 8, 1940, using student- built equipment installed by a group headed by LaVerge Williams.\\"Competent Leadership Basis Of Husky Network Growth\\", Connecticut Campus, May 17, 1949, page 5. The station was initially funded by the Student Senate, but in the fall of 1941 became financially independent by selling airtime to advertisers. A May 1943 review of the \\"Husky Network\\" stated that the station was operating from 7:00-8:30 a.m. and 5:00-11:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, for a total of 37¬Ω hours per week.\\"Radio Tactics Put Into Action\\" by Sydney Jaffe (United Picture Service), Hartford Courant, Parade of Youth section, May 9, 1943, page 4. However, equipment shortages due to the outbreak of World War II, as well as staff entering the military, caused the station to cease operations until after the war. Operations were reactivated in May 1946, under the guidance of Dan Harris, operating on 560 kHz from 4-10 p.m. A 1948 review stated that transmitters were operating on both 560 and 640 kHz, with advertisers that included local grocery, drug, and stationary stores as well as restaurants. The station now identified itself as \\"WHUS\\", although because it did not need a license these call letters were not formally assigned by the FCC.\\"Husky Network Tells History and Plans\\", Connecticut Campus, September 17, 1948, pages 1, 4. The studios were moved from the basement of Koons Hall to the new Student Union Building in 1952. Between 1954 and 1956, there was another hiatus in broadcasting owing to technical difficulties in complying with FCC restrictions on signal strength. Eventually low power AM broadcasting was resumed at 670 kHz. AM programming was predominant through the late 1960s, although during periods when the AM and FM stations were carrying the same program, provisions had to be made to avoid airing commercials on the FM side, which was only licensed for non-commercial operation. In 1963 twenty-four- hour-a-day broadcasting was started on WHUS (AM) with the use of automatic reverse tape reels that provided 6 hours of programming. However, by the mid-1970s the closed-carrier AM broadcasting system had fallen into disrepair and was discontinued. =FM station= WHUS On-Air Studio in 2007 In 1957 the university received a license for a 10-watt non-commercial FM station operating on 90.5 MHz, which was now formally issued the WHUS call letters by the FCC. This new authorization meant that station coverage was no longer limited to just the campus. WHUS moved to 91.7 MHz in 1966, increased power to 1,250 watts in 1968, then to 3,200 watts in 1974. In the mid-1970s student managers decided to operate the station 24 hours a day year round, adding non- student volunteers to staff and produce programs. WHUS became a \\"community\\" station. Beginning about 1975, a major refurbishment of the studios upgraded the mostly mono vintage equipment so that in 1977 FM-stereo broadcasting could begin. In 1997, WHUS built a new tower that allowed its signal to reach a radius. This expansion into the Hartford area helped grow its audience. During the summer of 1998, WHUS began webcasting its air signal over the Internet. The station moved to an old farmhouse on the North Campus in 2002 for the remodeling of the Student Union. In 2006 the station's website, WHUS.org, acquired a new design and a schedule database system, which allowed dynamic displays of currently playing and upcoming shows. In 2007, the station moved into new state-of-the-art studios in the remodeled Student Union. Awards Between 2002 and 2013, WHUS was voted \\"Best College Radio\\" by the readers of the Hartford Advocate each year except 2006, when it received a second place award.\\"Hartford Advocate Best of Awards\\" Hartford Advocate In December 2009, WHUS was recognized as a finalist in the University of Connecticut's Provost's Award for Excellence in Community Engagement. At the 2014 Intercollegiate Broadcast System Awards in NYC, WHUS Studio Sessions won \\"Best Live Performance\\" and \\"Most Creative Program.\\" WHUS was also a finalist in the \\"Best Use of Social Media,\\" \\"Best Sports Broadcast,\\" and \\"Best Radio Drama\\" categories that year. In 2015, WHUS won \\"Best News Delivery\\" and \\"Best Facebook Page\\" at the College Media Association Apple Awards.

His guides are a cranky, antisemitic grandfather (Boris Leskin), his deranged Border Collie named Sammy Davis, Jr., Jr., and his over-enthusiastic grandson, Alex (Eugene H√ºtz), whose fractured command of English, passion for American pop culture, and constant chatter threaten to make the worst of every situation. The guides are not very knowledgeable about the subject of finding Jews, and usually just attempt to scam them by taking them on long journeys, but after hearing about Jonathan's compelling story, they decide they actually want to help him. After traveling through much of rural Ukraine, they eventually find Augustina's sister, Lista (Laryssa Lauret), who leads them to where Augustina was killed by Nazi soldiers after her father refused to spit on the Torah.

Biography His father was Manuel Martinez de Irujo y de Erice and his mother Narcisa Tac√≥n y Gamiz (born Beriain, Navarre, 1740). He had two siblings, Narcisa Mart√≠nez de Irujo y Tac√≥n and Mar√≠a Rafaela Mart√≠nez de Irujo y Tac√≥n. Casa Irujo (often spelled Yrujo) was the Spanish minister to the United States from 1796 to 1807. Casa Irujo changed positions and became minister at Rio de Janeiro and then Paris.Fleming, Thomas The Duel-Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr and the future of America Perseus Books Group 1999 He was Secretary of state (Prime Minister) of Spain (ministro de estado) three times, first in 1812, then in an interim capacity from 1818 to 1819, and finally for a few weeks from December 1823 until his death in January 1824. In 1794 while an attach√© at the Spanish embassy in London he had an illegitimate daughter named Lavinia de Irujo. Lavinia herself later gave birth to two daughters Fredericka and Frances out of wedlock, the father being Major Charles Jones (father of Ernest Jones, a poet, dramatist and novelist.) There are several drawings of Lavinia by the artist Henry Fuseli (1741-1825). In 1798 Don Carlos married Sarah McKean, the daughter of Pennsylvania governor Thomas McKean. The couple have been described as \\" intriguers of the highest order.\\"Fleming The Duel Their son Carlos Mart√≠nez de Irujo y McKean (1802-1855), Duque of Sotomayor, became prime minister of Spain for a short period in 1847. Character Sally McKean D'Yrujo \\"He was an obstinate, impetuous and rather vain little person with reddish hair; enormously wealthy, endlessly touchy, extremely intelligent and vastly attractive ‚Ä¶ he liked America, he understood it and enjoyed it; he was tremendously popular at Philadelphia, and at Washington when he condescended to appear there; he was on intimate terms at the President's House. If he lost his temper from time to time, and thought nothing of haranguing the country through the newspapers, he served his King with energetic loyalty; he went about his business with dignity and shrewdness; he never forgot the respect due to his official person, however much he might indulge his democratic tendencies in private intercourse; he was the only Minister of the first rank in America, and consequently the leading figure in the diplomatic corps; he contributed to American society the brilliant qualities of his elegant and felicitous personality; he was a very great gentleman.\\" ‚Äî from Aaron Burr, Samuel H. Wandell, Meade Minnigerode, 1925. Yrujo was doubly and trebly attached to the Administration. Proud as a typical Spaniard should be, and mingling and infusion of vanity with his pride; irascible, headstrong, indiscreet as was possible for a diplomatist, and afraid of no prince or president; young, able, quick, and aggressive; devoted to his King and country; a flighty and dangerous friend, but a most troublesome enemy; always in difficulties, but in spite of fantastic outbursts always respectable,‚ÄîYrujo needed only the contrast of characters such as those of Pickering or Madison to make him the most entertaining figure in Washington politics. He loved the rough-and-tumble of democratic habits, and remembered his diplomatic dignity only when he could use it as a weapon against a secretary of state. If he thought the Government to need assistance or warning, he wrote communications to the newspapers in a style which long experience had made familiar to the public and irritating to the Government whose acts he criticized. \\\\- from The First Administration of Thomas Jefferson, Part I, Chapter 17 References * Caballeros de Carlos III Category:1763 births Category:1824 deaths Category:Politicians from Cartagena, Spain Category:Spanish diplomats Category:University of Salamanca alumni Category:Prime Ministers of Spain ","title":"Carlos Mart√≠nez de Irujo, 1st Marquess of Casa Irujo"},{"id":"1925069","text":"Rajiv Gandhi along with Sonia Gandhi at The Doon School Founder's Day in the 1970sThe Rajiv Gandhi Foundation was established on 21 June 1991. The foundation works on a range of issues including literacy, health, disability, empowerment of the underprivileged, livelihoods and natural resource management. Its current focus areas are community welfare, literacy, health and special programmes for children and women. All donations to the Foundation are tax deductible to the extent of 50 percent under section 80G of the Income Tax Act. The foundation is headed by Sonia Gandhi, who is also the leader of the Indian National Congress Party.  History  The Rajiv Gandhi Foundation was set up to carry forward the legacy of former Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi. The Jawahar Bhawan Trust, led by Sonia Gandhi met in July, 1991 and passed a resolution inviting the Foundation to work in the Jawahar Bhawan. The Foundation constituted a group of 8 founding Trustees. They were Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, Amitabh Bachchan, Suman Dubey, N.K.Seshan and Sunil Nehru. In 1992, P. V. Narasimha Rao, P. Chidambaram, V. Krishnamurthy, Sam Pitroda, Dr. Sekhar Raha, Mani Shankar Aiyar, Montek Singh Ahluwalia and R. P. Goenka were also inducted as Trustees.  Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies (RGICS)  Nelson Mandela speaking at the Rajiv Gandhi Memorial Lecture In August 1991, the Foundation setup Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies (RGICS) to provide research based ideas, analysis, policy and practical programmes into contemporary issues. RGICS programmes cover economic reform, science and technology, social issues, public affairs and international relations. The Institute organises conferences, lectures, workshops, short studies and projects and invites experts to lend their insight into the contemporary issues. It also encourages research scholars, scientists, economists and social scientists to undertake projects which can provide inputs towards policy framing and decision making. Some of the speakers include Robert McNamara, Nelson Mandela, Hillary Clinton, and Edward Said.  Initiatives taken  = Education = * In the Yakutpura slum area of Hyderabad where 400 muslim girls were enrolled into schools in collaboration with Mahita, a local agency. * In 2007-08, the Foundation launched Vidyagyan scholarship program in collaboration with the Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar Educational and Charitable Trust in select districts of Uttar Pradesh. It focused on very poor Muslim and lower caste girl children in classes 6 to 10. Around 1500 girl children in classes 6 to 9 were supported through this scholarship programme. * Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi scholarship is given to two women pilot trainees at the institute every year. * Traveling scholarships to students from various British universities were given to visit India during their vacations as part of undergraduate or graduate studies. * The Teachers Empowerment Programme was initiated to provide extensive training in the District Institute of Education & Training (DIET), Titabor in Jorhat district in Assam. It was also extended for school teachers of Mizoram, Meghalaya, Manipur and Nagaland. * Decentralization of Education Governance was launched in 2010. It is a way to devolve power systematically to primary stake holders empowering them to participate in the decision making process, and structurally alter the process of planning and decision making within the entire education system. = Health = * In 1993, RGF launched an HIV/AIDS prevention awareness campaign India. On Worlds AIDS Day in 2009, Sonia Gandhi, Chairperson of the Foundation flagged off Red Ribbon Express. Over the years, the Foundation has partnered with a number of organisations and conducted workshops for General Medical practitioners and NGOs to create awareness on how to prevent and control AIDS. *In 2012 ,RGF have conducted 800 heart surgeries with the help of AGS charity and then congress leader's.  Ongoing initiatives  = Access to opportunities = The Foundation enables physically challenged young people to access better opportunities by awarding motorised vehicles. It was initiated with the support of corporate bodies and concerned individuals in 1992 and has helped over 2400 individuals access higher education and attain financial independence. = Interact = The Interact scholarship program supports children affected by conflict across the country. After 2005, it included another 160 children affected by the tsunami in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Puducherry. As of 2016, the Foundation supports 2086 children across Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Nagaland, Jammu & Kashmir, Gujarat, Puducherry and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. In addition to scholarships, on-going psycho-social support, orientation in and exposure to, various professions, placements, academic support, and internships are also provided. =Natural resource management= The Rajiv Gandhi Foundation has been working on issues of livelihoods and Natural Resource Management since 2001. This programme was implemented in backward villages in Jaipur, Pali and Karoli districts of Rajasthan which faced serious environmental degradation. A third party evaluation revealed the significant impact in the lives of the targeted families. In order to scale up this transformative work, RGF set up Gram Gaurav on 19 December 2011. Gram Gaurav currently works in 74 villages located in Dang region of Karauli and Dholpur districts to augment water resources, conserve soil and enhance agriculture production. = Rajiv Gandhi Cambridge Scholarship = The Foundation, in collaboration with Cambridge Commonwealth Trust offers two scholarships for Indian students to pursue MPhil and LLM at the University of Cambridge. = Libraries = Since 1993, the Foundation has set up 1648 libraries in villages and slums across 22 states in India. In 2013, RGF partnered with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and worked with the public libraries in Barabanki and Rai Bareilly districts of Uttar Pradesh. It plans to open a library in each village of India. = Transformative learning= The Foundation has been working with ten partners across the country to introduce a capability based learning approach for children. This initiative has focused on redefining the assessment frameworks and learning approach and focusing on continuous comprehensive evaluation. A cluster approach has been adopted in selecting schools (covering 15-20 schools in a cluster) and works on capacity building of teachers.  Controversies  In 1991, Manmohan Singh the then Minister of Finance had tried to allocate the Foundation a sum of 100 crore rupees. The Budget Speech of 1991-92 by Manmohan Singh presented on July 24, 1991 has the detail. \\"As a homage to the late Shri Rajiv Gandhi and in support of the laudable objectives of the Foundation, Government has decided to contribute Rs 100 crore to the Foundation at the rate of Rs 20 crores per annum for a period of five years beginning from the current year,\\" the then Finance Minister said in the Budget speech. After huge political uproar, the decision was overturned. In the subsequent discussions that followed, Manmohan Singh had read a letter from the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, that stated that the Foundation appreciates the generous sum but it thinks that the government should itself invest the funds in suitable projects. The UPA government led by Congress has also been accused of diverting funds from Prime Minister's National Relief Fund to the foundation while members of the Gandhi family and other senior Congress leaders sat on both board. In 2005-6 and 2007-8, while Congress led UPA was in power, it received funds from several ministries, public sector banks and PSUs. It have also been criticised for receiving funds from Sonia Gandhi led PMNRF, a fund set up by public donations. In September 2016, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation had received donations from Zakir Naik in 2011 despite the government having had expressed security concern with regard to Naik‚Äôs TV channel. Later, a congress spokesperson claimed that the Rs 50 lakhs were returned. In June 2020, the BJP accused the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation of accepting a donation of $300,000 from China during 2005-06 which congress claims that is in response to the Congress' criticisms of the government's handling of the 2020 Ladakh standoff, and questioned whether it was a ‚Äúbribe‚Äù for lobbying for a free trade agreement between India and China which, according to Ravi Shankar Prasad, lead to a 33% increase in trade deficit between India and China under the congress government. The foundation also had links to a Chinese united front organization called the China Association for International Friendly Contact. An inter-ministerial committee have been set up to look into allegations at the 3 Nehru-Gandhi family trusts - RGF, Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust and the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust all of which are leadby Sonia Gandhi.

Format Next dealt with a contestant going on blind dates with possibly up to five other single people, known as \\"the daters\\", who were secluded on a RV, referred to as the \\"Next Bus\\". The added twist was that the date could end at any time by the contestant shouting \\"next\\". Each episode featured two segments, featuring a single man or woman as the prime contestant, and five other single men or women as the daters. The segment began with the prime contestant describing themselves to the audience. They would usually explain a hobby that they enjoy and what they like and dislike in a person, often chiding that they would \\"next\\" a person if they had this attribute. Then, the five daters described themselves to the audience. The five daters were secluded in the \\"Next Bus\\" (which was always in a very short walking distance from the date location), and the contestant was at a location where the date will be held. (Most typically in an outdoor urban setting, which generally throughout the segment took place in that area alone, but in some cases date locations were at multiple diverse locations sometimes.) In a preselected fashion, the five daters were put into an order to go on a date with the contestant. When a dater leaves the bus for their date, as they are exiting out of the RV door, the screen pauses momentarily and personal facts are captioned on the screen. The dater then exits and introduces themselves to the contestant. The date begins at this exact moment, and a timer is shown at the bottom of the screen, (which captures the length of the date). The date usually varied, but most of the time, it consisted of a challenge or an activity that the contestant asked the dater to participate in. However, it wasn't uncommon for a date to feature the two people conversing or eating a meal as well or in addition to that. Unlike most dating shows to where usually a contestant goes on a date with someone then afterwards decides what happens after, the contestant in Next is in full control to how long, or even if a dater is on the date. A date is concluded only by two methods. Either a dater is \\"nexted\\" by the contestant, (in which if this person were one of the first four of the five daters, the segment continues and another dater would then immediately leave the RV to date the contestant; if not, the segment would immediately be over;) or the dater is offered a proposition from the contestant to go on another date/continue relations outside the program, or to essentially \\"next\\" themselves and reject the contestant. (This can only be done once, and once only to one dater, and the segment is over shortly after this.) In the sense of a date ending from being \\"nexted\\": If at any time (which could be within seconds or even hours) during the date in which the contestant feels that the dater isn't a match, (which a contestant can next a dater for warranted or unwarranted reasons; usually it's whether it is from lack of attraction, a bad first impression, a problem that happens during the date, not participating in a task or activity, or learning more about the daters personal life as the date goes along) he or she would be rejected for the rest of the program by the contestant and exclaim \\"next,\\" and the date would immediately end. (If the contestant was riding in a vehicle which would caravan the secluded daters on the RV to a date location, the vehicle will immediately pull over, and the dater would get out of the vehicle and get on the RV which would be in front of or behind the vehicle.) When the date ends, the timer immediately stops and morphs into a dollar amount. The daters on the RV who were \\"nexted\\", will receive $1 for every minute the date lasted (indicated from the timer on the bottom of the screen). If a dater was \\"nexted\\" before one minute, they received one dollar. The dater would be sent back to the RV. Once back in the RV, the dater would usually say either a positive or negative thing about the person to give the remaining daters an idea about the contestant. (If the dater was one of the first four in the order, the next dater in the lineup would exit the RV and begin a date with the contestant, following the same identical format. If this were the last dater in the order, the segment ends as all five daters have been \\"nexted') On select occasions, a dater for apparent or for no apparent reasons would ask to end the date and/or hint for themselves to be \\"nexted\\", despite the fact the contestant did not want to. So in essence, the contestant who by the rules of the show is the only person allowed to end a date, this is a way for a dater to circumvent, and end the date themselves. This in turn would most likely have the contestant \\"next\\" the person due to this. In the sense of a date ending from a dater being propositioned from a contestant for a second date: During the date, if a contestant felt that they had an extreme connection/chemistry to an RV dater, the timer would stop and be morphed into a dollar amount (which would correlate to a dollar for every minute the date lasted. If the date was less than a minute, it would be one dollar) and the date would officially end, but not with the dater being \\"nexted\\". The contestant would then say, \\"You have been on a date with me for (\\"X\\" number of minutes). You can either take the (\\"X\\"amount of money) and run, or go on a second date.\\" The screen would then pause on the dater and a review of their date would play, including flashbacks of positive and negative aspects of the date. Also, comments from daters on the RV about the contestant would air. At this point, the dater would opt to either take the money (similar to as if they were \\"nexted\\"), or forfeit that money and go on a second date with contestant. The tables would then essentially turn, and a dater would have the chance to either reject a contestant, or exchange the same feelings the contestant had. If the dater decides to reject the contestant for any reason, they take the money they earned from the date, and he or she will go back to the RV just as if they were \\"nexted\\" and tell the daters what happened. The contestant would then be left alone by themselves. On the other hand, if the dater chose to go on a second date, the dater would forfeit the money they earned from the date, and dater would walk away together with the contestant, and the remaining daters on the RV would usually say rude or impolite things to the contestant and/or the dater. The segment then shortly ends after either scenario. The contestant can ask any dater for a second date. They can be the first or the last. The contestant can also do this at any time during the date, whether it's within seconds of meeting the person, or hours into the date. However, the contestant is only allowed to select one person out of the five to proposition a second date to, (regardless if the dater accepted or rejected their offer for a second date) and after doing this, they are not allowed to meet the remaining daters on the RV (if any). If the dater offered a second date by the contestant was not the final person in the dating order, the remaining dater(s) never get to meet the contestant or go on a date with him or her. A segment would usually end with the contestant giving a proposition to a dater to go on a second date, but the segment could also essentially end if the person \\"nexted\\" all five contestants.

It was part of the Orientale Province until that province's dissolution. It lies at an elevation of 1275 m on a plateau about 30 km west of Lake Albert in the Albertine Rift, and about 25 km east of the Ituri Forest. The city is at the center of the Ituri conflict between the Lendu and Hema. In the Second Congo War the city and district were the scene of much fighting and many civilian deaths from this conflict, and related clashes between militias and Uganda-based forces. Consequently, the city is the base of one of the largest United Nations peace-keeping forces in Africa, and its headquarters in northeastern DRC. The area's natural resources include gold mines over which militias and foreign forces have been fighting.  Climate  Transport The main dirt highways connecting north-eastern DR Congo with Kisangani to the west and Butembo and Goma to the south pass through Bunia, but have fallen into disrepair and are virtually impassable, especially after the frequent rains. Bunia is only 40 km from the Ugandan border running down Lake Albert, but there are no road connections across the Great Rift Valley to the closest Ugandan towns of Toro and Fort Portal. Instead a dirt highway going north-east reaches Arua and Gulu north of the lake. Before the war made the route impassable, this was the chief trade route between the DRC and Uganda, as well between the DRC and Juba in South Sudan, and Bunia was an important market city, for cross-border trade as well as internal trade. The supposed route of the Lagos-Mombasa Highway passes just to the south of Bunia, emphasising its potential as a centre of trade, but that transnational highway does not exist as a viable route through the DRC. Bunia is linked to the small port of Kasenyi on Lake Albert by a 60-kilometre dirt track via Bogoro, which has a spectacular and dangerous 600-metre descent of the western escarpment of the Great Rift Valley. Kasenyi has a jetty from which boat transport can link with Mahagi-Port at the north end of the lake, and with Butiaba on the Ugandan side and Pakwach on the Albert Nile. Given the poor state of the roads, and the total lack of railway transport, Bunia Airport is of prime importance. Other features Bunia from the air. Mount Hoyo is 35 km south-west of Bunia. The Shari River flows along the northwestern outskirts of the city. The Ituri River flows around 35 km west of Bunia. The confluence of the Shari and Ituri is about 45 km south-southwest of Bunia.Google Earth ‚Äîmeasurements and directions checked. Although Bunia is about 170 km north of the Equator, the city was featured in the BBC television travel documentary Equator made in 2006, since it was one of the few places near the Equator in eastern DRC where the safety of the TV crew could be assured, by the presence of the large UN peace-keeping force. Higher education Bunia has a number of universities, the largest being the University of Bunia (UNIBU) followed by the private Universit√© Shalom de Bunia (USB) which offers the largest library in Bunia (about 40,000 volumes) with an online catalog.

After ten seasons with the Orix BlueWave of Nippon Professional Baseball, he played eight years in Major League Baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs, followed by a final two years in Japan with the Orix Buffaloes. Taguchi is the second Japanese-born player to win a World Series after Tadahito Iguchi in 2005. Taguchi is also the first Japanese player to win two World Series with different teams ‚Äì with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 2008. Early life Taguchi was born and raised in Nishinomiya, Hy≈çgo, Japan. He graduated from Kwansei Gakuin University in his hometown, with a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration. He was a teammate of Ichiro Suzuki when the two played for the Orix BlueWave in the Pacific League of NPB. Although he was drafted by the BlueWave as an infielder, he was moved to the outfield later in his career. Career =St. Louis Cardinals (2002‚Äì2007)= Taguchi with the St. Louis Cardinals. He was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals as a free agent in at the age of 33, a year in which he rose through the minor league system, playing for the New Haven Ravens and the Memphis Redbirds, compiling a .262 batting average, with 6 home runs and 51 RBI. He eventually earned a call-up on September 7, and recorded the first hit of his major league career in the second inning against the Chicago Cubs. Taguchi became the first (and to date only) Japanese-born player in Cardinal history. He originally requested to wear the number 6, but he couldn't because it was retired for Stan Musial, nor could he turn 6 upside down because 9 is retired for Enos Slaughter. He could not wear the number he had at the Olympics because 1 was retired for Ozzie Smith. He was also unable to double 6 as Rick Ankiel was on the roster that year. Finally, he decided to wear 99. Taguchi signing autographs before a game against the Houston Astros on May 30, . Taguchi got another brief call-up in , then got more playing time with the Cardinals in , appearing in 109 games. He was included on the '04 Cardinals postseason roster, and appeared in two games of the 2004 World Series, which the Cardinals lost to the Boston Red Sox in a four-game sweep. In , injuries to outfielders Larry Walker and Reggie Sanders opened up manager Tony La Russa's lineup card, and Taguchi became an everyday player. He responded with his best season, batting .288 in 396 at-bats with eight home runs and 53 RBI, and contributing with his stellar defense at all three outfield positions as the Cardinals won 100 games and had the best record in the National League. Cardinal radio announcer Mike Shannon took to calling Taguchi \\"the So-man\\" and praising his hard work and extreme personal courtesy. By habit, Taguchi would even give a little bow to the umpire whenever he stepped up to the plate. His modest and happy demeanor, as well as shyness due to struggling with English in interviews early on, endeared him to St. Louis fans. In , Taguchi's playing time declined somewhat, his at-bat total falling to 316 from 396 the year before. However, Taguchi would make the playoff roster for the Cardinals for the third year in a row, and have a heroic postseason moment: on October 13, 2006, he hit the go-ahead home run off Billy Wagner in the top of the 9th inning of Game 2 of the NLCS.

Taguchi returned to the Cardinals in 2007 and had another solid season, batting .290 as a part-time player, with 307 at-bats in 130 games. He was one of manager Tony La Russa's most valuable pinch-hitters; of 46 games in 2007 where he's shown to have had just 1 AB, Taguchi picked up 15 hits. Taguchi played 617 innings in the field, with 41 starts (and 22 other appearances) in center (where Jim Edmonds was banged up) and 21 starts (20 other) in left (where the Cardinals hadn't settled on one player until 2008 and Skip Schumaker). Taguchi played sparingly in right field (2 starts, 6 other) and part of a game at 2B. =Philadelphia Phillies (2008)= Taguchi with the Philadelphia Phillies After the 2007 season ended, the Cardinals declined Taguchi's option for , then decided to forgo arbitration and release Taguchi on December 5, 2007, after Taguchi's agent had requested his release earlier in the week.Strauss, Joe. \\"LaRussa: Now, it's personal.\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 2007-12-06.

Exchanging water with several rivers and lagoons, the Laguna is part of the most important hydrographic river basin in Mexico. It is important commercially, as well as ecologically by serving as a refuge for an extensive number of flora and fauna; its mangroves provide an important role as a refuge for migratory birds. History The Boca de T√©rminos was discovered during Juan de Grijalva's expedition in 1518.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, Environment =Geography= Laguna de T√©rminos (Lagoon of Terminus, as it is the end of regional rivers) is made up of a series of rich, sediment-laden lagoons and tidal estuaries connected by two channels to the Bay of Campeche in the southern part of the Gulf of Mexico, in Carmen Municipality in the southwestern part of the Mexican state of Campeche. Its shores are swampy and support mangroves. It is fed by several freshwater rivers, including the Mezcapala, Grijalva and Usumacinta Rivers, and includes several lagoons such as Pom, Atasta, Puerto Rico, Este and Panlau. It is long, wide, and covers an area of . Every nine days, approximately 50% of the lagoon's water volume is renewed, primarily through the effect of ocean tides. On the surrounding barrier islands, beach ridges, and mangrove coastline there are several Late Postclassic Maya sites. The city of Ciudad del Carmen is located on Isla del Carmen, between the lagoon and the Bay of Campeche. =Flora and fauna= Twenty-nine percent of the lagoon is covered with seagrass. The lagoon was designated as a federally protected area for flora and fauna in 1994 by the Mexican government because of the importance of the biological ecosystems provided by its estuaries. There have been 1,468 identified fauna species found within the protected area of Laguna de T√©rminos; 30 species are endemic to Mexico and 89 are threatened; 132 species are considered to be commercially important. There are 279 bird, 74 insect (considered an incomplete listing), and 34 mammal species identified. At least 367 species of fish are listed. It is a known breeding and nursery area for the yellow stingray (Urobatis jamaicensis); seagrass is reported to be important for its parturition. Campeche and Tabasco hold wetlands consisting of mangrove zones, swamps, and lagoons serving as important habitats for aquatic reptiles such as crocodiles (American, Morelet's, brown caiman). Nationally endangered hawksbill, green sea, and Kemp's ridley sea turtles come on sandy shores to lay eggs especially setting a special protection on Kemp's ridley turtles. Mangroves around the Lagoon of T√©rminos provides a migratory collider for at least 33% of the Mississippi - migratory birds. Of about 134 mammalian species from 27 families present in the area, rare and endangered species include felines (jaguar, ocelot, margay), primates (Geoffroy's spider monkey), and marine mammals including cetaceans and the West Indian manatee. Bottlenose dolphins Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are known to visit the lagoon regularly, but their safety could be endangered due to several artificial factors. A conservation group called Instituto Via Delphi which is specially designed for protection of local dolphins along Mexican gulf regions were founded to focus understanding of biology of these dolphins and to strengthen their protection. Threats The biggest influence on the area and a possible threat are the operations of state-owned oil company, Pemex operating within the protected area. The drilling of oil wells and the construction of pipelines can destroy habitat. Additionally, oil spills are a continual threat. Other possible threats include habitat change through population growth in the surrounding area. Laguna de T√©rminos Flora and Fauna Protection Area as a whole is considered to be critically threatened. Although Pemex is both the biggest influence and the biggest threat to the protected area and its biodiversity, it is also economically important to Mexico. Currently there is a petroleum boom which presents an opportunity for the management of the protected area to offer to cooperate with the industry and coordinate use of the resources. There are local residents and non-governmental organizations who are aware of the potential problems and who are a strong voice, with public protests against Pemex plans that emphasize the destruction to ecosystems and quality of life at other Pemex locations. Pemex has acknowledged that they must take into account the opinions of the protected area's management and other voices when planning projects so as to minimize negative environment impacts. Local populations of crocodiles and sea turtles in the areas are in serious danger due to their value for commercial industries.

A multitap is a video game console peripheral that increases the number of controller ports available to the player, allowing additional controllers to be used in play, similar to a USB hub or a power strip. A multitap often takes the form of a box with three or more controller ports which is then connected to a controller port on the console itself. Mainly sports games have supported multitaps due to the multiplayer aspect of some sport games, though some role- playing video games and first person shooters have taken advantage of multitap support.  History  = Third generation = The Four Score for the original NES. The earliest multi-controller adapter was the Joypair by HAL Laboratory, released in Japan for Nintendo's Family Computer in 1985, which allows two additional controllers to be plugged into the console's DA-15 expansion port. Originally the Joypair was only intended to allow two players to use specialized controllers (specifically HAL's controllers) in place of the standard Famicom joypads (which were hardwired into the console itself), but Nekketsu K≈çk≈ç Dodgeball Bu (the Japanese version of Super Dodge Ball) utilized it to allow up to four players to participate in the game's Bean Ball mode.Hori later released the Twin Adapter in 1989 as an alternative to the Joypair, while certain controllers (such as the ASCII Stick series and certain models of the Family Champ joysticks) came equipped with an additional expansion port that allowed for users to connect an additional controller into them. A more conventional 4-Players Adapter for the Famicom was eventually released by Hori in 1990, which allowed up to four controllers to be plugged into the expansion port (allowing each player to utilize a specialized joypad if they desired). During the same year, Nintendo released their own first- party adapters for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America: the NES Four Score and the NES Satellite. Despite the fact that the HVC-101 model of the Famicom uses the same controller ports as the NES, 4-player Famicom games are not compatible with the NES multitaps. = Fourth generation = The Multitap (the first device to be marketed with such a name) by NEC Home Electronics for the PC Engine, which launched alongside the platform in Japan on October 30, 1987, was the first multi-controller adapter made specifically for multiplayer support, allowing up to five controllers to be plugged into the console. Because the console itself only has one controller port as standard, the Multitap was a necessity for games that supported more than one player. As a result, various inexpensive alternatives to the Multitap were released for the PC Engine by third-party companies, such as the Battle Tap by Big Club and the Joy Tap 3 by Hudson Soft, which featured less controller ports than the first-party Multitap, but these were gradually phased out as more games started to allow up to five players. The first PC Engine game to allow more than two players simultaneously was Pro Tennis: World Court in August 1988 (ten months after the launch of the system), which allowed up to four players in a doubles match, while Dungeon Explorer in 1989 was the first game to fully allow up to five players. The Multitap was redesigned into the TurboTap for the North American market with the launch of the TurboGrafx-16 in 1989, and later as the DuoTap for the TurboDuo in 1992 (the different models were due to the change in controller ports between the TurboGrafx-16 and the TurboDuo). An unlicensed multitap for the Super NES. Hudson Soft manufactured the Super Multitap, a multiplayer adapter for the Super NES in 1993. The adapter connects to the second controller port of the SNES control deck (leaving the first one free), resulting in a total of five controller ports (much like the original Multitap for the PC Engine). It was produced primarily for Super Bomberman, which had a prior installment on the PC Engine (simply titled Bomberman) that featured a five-player battle mode, although the SNES game only supported up to four players (the series did not support five players on the SNES until Super Bomberman 3, which was released only in Japan and the PAL region). The Super Multitap has a switch for 2P Mode and 5P Mode, allowing it to remain connected into the console without affecting incompatible games. While no Nintendo-produced version of the peripheral was ever produced (nor were there any first-party games that supported it), various other SNES multitaps were later produced by other companies (both, licensed and unlicensed) such as the Hori Multitap (released by Bulletproof Software in North America as the Super Links) and the Multi-Adaptor Auto. One particular unlicensed model, the Tribal Tap 6 Player Adaptor by Naki, added a fraudulent sixth controller port that was promoted as a selling point against competing multitap models, even though no licensed SNES game ever supported more than five players. J-Cart with two built-in controller ports Two independently developed multitaps were released for the Sega Genesis also in 1993. The 4-Way Play (which utilized both controller ports) was developed by Electronic Arts without license from Sega and was made specifically for their lineup of sports games (such as Madden NFL '94), whereas the Team Player (known as the SegaTap in Japan) was developed by Tengen for Gauntlet IV and sold by Sega as a first-party product. In contrast to the 4-Way Play, the Team Player only required one controller port (leaving an additional port free for a fifth player, much like the Super Multitap) and also acted as a splitter that allowed users to switch between multiple input devices (such as a mouse or a light gun) connected to the console at the same time. The original model of the Team Player (MK-1654) was incompatible with games that required the 4-Way Play, so a revision (MK-1647) was later produced that solved this issue by adding a second controller cord and an \\"Extra\\" setting for 4-Way Play compatibility. While most Team Player-compatible titles only supported up to four players (with some games such as Columns III supporting up to five), Konami's Double Dribble: The Playoff Season and Sega's Egawa Suguru's Super League CD (a Japan-exclusive baseball game for Mega CD) both allow up to eight players with the use of two Team Player adapters (one in each controller port). In addition to these multitaps, Codemasters released a series of Genesis cartridges known as the J-Cart with two additional controller ports installed on them, allowing users to plug in additional controllers on them without the need of an adapter. A total of six games were released in J-Cart format. A few games released for the Amiga home computer system after 1995 included support for custom-built multitaps. Instructions for how to build a multitap were included in the manual to classic Amiga racing sequel Super Skidmarks. The Amiga multitap would plug into the computer's parallel port and provide two additional ports for use. Earlier, the Amiga version of Bomberman, Dynablaster had already included support for a similar device, as demonstrated on Season 2, Episode 5 of TV's GamesMaster. = Fifth generation = PlayStation. The original PlayStation Multitap was one of the earliest peripherals released for the platform. It featured not only four additional controller ports, but also four memory card slots for each of them as well. Like the Team Player adapter for the Genesis, two PlayStation Multitaps could be used at the same time for up to eight controllers and memory cards, although very few games allowed for more than five players. An official multitap for the Sega Saturn. A six-controller adapter was released for the Sega Saturn (sold as the Multi-Player Adaptor in the United States and as the Multi Terminal 6 in Japan), which features the most controller ports out of all the multitaps made by first party manufacturers. The most famous Saturn game to make use of the multitap was Saturn Bomberman, which supports up to 10 players (requires two multitaps) simultaneously. A number of sports games such as NFL Quarterback Club 96 support the maximum of 12 players. The \\"Sega Saturn Multiplayer Task Force (SSMTF)\\" is a small but enthusiastic group of developers who have released homebrew games dedicated to utilizing the Saturn's multitap. One of the first multitaps for personal computers, the Gravis Interface Protocol (officially abbreviated GrIP) from Advanced Gravis Computer Technology, has six ports, four for digital Gravis-brand gamepads (e.g. the Gravis PC GamePad), and two pass-through ports for analog joysticks. =Decline= The Nintendo 64 did not have any official multitaps released for it, as the console featured four controller ports by default (the first console to do so since the Bally Astrocade and the Atari 5200). As a result, many four-player games were released for the system. Dreamcast and the original Xbox would follow the N64's example by including four controller ports as default as well, as did Nintendo's succeeding console, the GameCube. Despite this, the PlayStation 2 was released with only two controller ports like its predecessor, so a Multitap was still produced for the console. Because of compatibility issues, the original PS2 Multitap (SCPH-10090) for the early models of the console only worked specifically on PS2 games, meaning that the original PlayStation or PS one Multitap was still required for the games on the previous console. For the \\"slimline\\" model of the PS2, a new Multitap (SCPH-70120) was made that supported both, PS and PS2 games. All three seventh generation consoles abandoned the use of conventional wired controller in favor of having wireless controllers as standard, although the maximum number of detected controllers varies with each platform. The Xbox 360 console can detect up to four wireless controllers, as well as three wired controllers via USB connection. The Wii, which uses a motion-sensitive remote controller known as the Wii Remote, could detect up to four wireless controllers, but also had four controller ports that were compatible with GameCube controllers. The PlayStation 3 could support up to seven wireless controllers. For the eighth generation consoles, the maximum number of wireless controllers detected by the PlayStation 4 was reduced to four, while the ones detected by the Xbox One was raised to eight. The Wii U can support up to seven Wii Remotes or Wii U Pro Controllers in addition to the GamePad, for a total of eight wireless controllers. The Wii U does not feature GameCube controller ports by default, but a GameCube Controller Adapter was primarily made for Super Smash Bros. for Wii U that connects up to four GameCube controllers via the Wii U's USB port. Through the use of a USB hub and two adapters, up to eight GameCube controllers can be used. The Nintendo Switch supports up to eight controllers, in any combination of individual Joy-Con controllers or Pro Controllers.  Method of operation  Many systems were not designed with multitaps in mind, and so require some clever design to work. Because of this, games usually have to be specially written to include multitap support. The most common way of implementing 8 and 16 bit multitaps is to multiplex the signals from each attached controller in some way. Some systems have unused lines available on the controller port, designed for future expansion, which can be used. Another popular technique is to serialise the data from each controller. Since the NES and Super NES both use a serial bus for standard controllers, creating a multitap is simply a case of increasing the amount of serial data available to the console. In that way, an almost unlimited number of extra controllers can be connected. Later systems used more complex buses, such as the Nintendo 64 serial bus, the Dreamcast Maple Bus or USB. These buses tend to be more modular and can already support more than one device per port, making the multitap little more than a hub.

It was in use in the Classical era, and was widespread in the Middle Ages, reaching its zenith in the 16th and 17th centuries. History Pliny mentions a metoposcopos, described by Appion the Grammarian, who (\\"a thing incredible to be spoken\\") could judge a person's age and how much longer they would live. According to Suetonius, another practitioner determined that Titus, and not Britannicus, would become Emperor. Juvenal was disdainful, and considered metoposcopy to be plebeian. Metoposcopy is prominently featured in the Zohar.Matt, Daniel, \\"Zohar, Vol.4\\" Isaac Luria (1534 - 1572), a Syrian rabbi considered to be the founder of contemporary Kabbalah, practised a form of metoposcopy in which he interpreted the appearance of Hebrew letters on the forehead. Metoposcopy was developed by the 16th century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano, considered to be one of the foremost mathematicians of the Renaissance. His seminal work Metoposcopia libris tredecim, et octingentis faciei humanae eiconibus complexa, illustrated with engravings of 800 foreheads, was written in 1558 and published posthumously in 1658. Giovanni Antonio Magini was also interested in the subject. Many metoposcopy books were published in the 16th and 17th centuries. Criticism Portrait of Cardano on display at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews. Jean Bodin denounced metoposcopy in his influential work De la d√©monomanie des sorciers (1580). The practise was banned by Pope Sixtus V in 1586.

It is a common unit process used in refineries, and is also used in petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants and other industries. Processes within oil refineries or chemical processing plants that remove hydrogen sulfide are referred to as \\"sweetening\\" processes because the odor of the processed products is improved by the absence of hydrogen sulfide. An alternative to the use of amines involves membrane technology. However, membrane separation is less attractive due to the relatively high capital and operating costs as well as other technical factors. Many different amines are used in gas treating: * Diethanolamine (DEA) * Monoethanolamine (MEA) * Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) * Diisopropanolamine (DIPA) * Aminoethoxyethanol (Diglycolamine) (DGA) The most commonly used amines in industrial plants are the alkanolamines DEA, MEA, and MDEA. These amines are also used in many oil refineries to remove sour gases from liquid hydrocarbons such as liquified petroleum gas (LPG).  Description of a typical amine treater  Gases containing or both and are commonly referred to as sour gases or acid gases in the hydrocarbon processing industries. The chemistry involved in the amine treating of such gases varies somewhat with the particular amine being used. For one of the more common amines, monoethanolamine (MEA) denoted as RNH2, the chemistry may be expressed as: :RNH2 \\\\+ RNH + SH‚àí A typical amine gas treating process (the Girbotol process, as shown in the flow diagram below) includes an absorber unit and a regenerator unit as well as accessory equipment. In the absorber, the downflowing amine solution absorbs and from the upflowing sour gas to produce a sweetened gas stream (i.e., a gas free of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide) as a product and an amine solution rich in the absorbed acid gases. The resultant \\"rich\\" amine is then routed into the regenerator (a stripper with a reboiler) to produce regenerated or \\"lean\\" amine that is recycled for reuse in the absorber. The stripped overhead gas from the regenerator is concentrated and . Process flow diagram of a typical amine treating process used in petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants and other industrial facilities. =Alternative processes= Alternative stripper configurations include matrix, internal exchange, flashing feed, and multipressure with split feed. Many of these configurations offer more energy efficiency for specific solvents or operating conditions. Vacuum operation favors solvents with low heats of absorption while operation at normal pressure favors solvents with high heats of absorption. Solvents with high heats of absorption require less energy for stripping from temperature swing at fixed capacity. The matrix stripper recovers 40% of at a higher pressure and does not have inefficiencies associated with multipressure stripper. Energy and costs are reduced since the reboiler duty cycle is slightly less than normal pressure stripper. An Internal Exchange stripper has a smaller ratio of water vapor to in the overheads stream, and therefore less steam is required. The multipressure configuration with split feed reduces the flow into the bottom section, which also reduces the equivalent work. Flashing feed requires less heat input because it uses the latent heat of water vapor to help strip some of the in the rich stream entering the stripper at the bottom of the column. The multipressure configuration is more attractive for solvents with a higher heats of absorption.  Amines  The amine concentration in the absorbent aqueous solution is an important parameter in the design and operation of an amine gas treating process. Depending on which one of the following four amines the unit was designed to use and what gases it was designed to remove, these are some typical amine concentrations, expressed as weight percent of pure amine in the aqueous solution: :* Monoethanolamine: About 20 % for removing H2S and CO2, and about 32 % for removing only CO2. :* Diethanolamine: About 20 to 25 % for removing H2S and CO2 :* Methyldiethanolamine: About 30 to 55 % for removing H2S and CO2 :* Diglycolamine: About 50 % for removing H2S and CO2 The choice of amine concentration in the circulating aqueous solution depends upon a number of factors and may be quite arbitrary. It is usually made simply on the basis of experience. The factors involved include whether the amine unit is treating raw natural gas or petroleum refinery by-product gases that contain relatively low concentrations of both H2S and CO2 or whether the unit is treating gases with a high percentage of CO2 such as the offgas from the steam reforming process used in ammonia production or the flue gases from power plants. Both H2S and CO2 are acid gases and hence corrosive to carbon steel. However, in an amine treating unit, CO2 is the stronger acid of the two. H2S forms a film of iron sulfide on the surface of the steel that acts to protect the steel. When treating gases with a high percentage of CO2, corrosion inhibitors are often used and that permits the use of higher concentrations of amine in the circulating solution. Another factor involved in choosing an amine concentration is the relative solubility of H2S and CO2 in the selected amine. The choice of the type of amine will affect the required circulation rate of amine solution, the energy consumption for the regeneration and the ability to selectively remove either H2S alone or CO2 alone if desired. For more information about selecting the amine concentration, the reader is referred to Kohl and Nielsen's book. =MEA and DEA= MEA and DEA are primary and secondary amines. They are very reactive and can effectively remove a high volume of gas due to a high reaction rate. However, due to stoichiometry, the loading capacity is limited to 0.5 mol CO2 per mole of amine. MEA and DEA also require a large amount of energy to strip the CO2 during regeneration, which can be up to 70% of total operating costs. They are also more corrosive and chemically unstable compared to other amines.  Uses  In oil refineries, that stripped gas is mostly H2S, much of which often comes from a sulfur- removing process called hydrodesulfurization. This H2S-rich stripped gas stream is then usually routed into a Claus process to convert it into elemental sulfur. In fact, the vast majority of the 64,000,000 metric tons of sulfur produced worldwide in 2005 was byproduct sulfur from refineries and other hydrocarbon processing plants.Sulfur production report by the United States Geological SurveyDiscussion of recovered byproduct sulfur Another sulfur-removing process is the WSA Process which recovers sulfur in any form as concentrated sulfuric acid. In some plants, more than one amine absorber unit may share a common regenerator unit. The current emphasis on removing CO2 from the flue gases emitted by fossil fuel power plants has led to much interest in using amines for removing CO2. (See also: Carbon capture and storage and Conventional coal-fired power plant.) In the specific case of the industrial synthesis of ammonia, for the steam reforming process of hydrocarbons to produce gaseous hydrogen, amine treating is one of the commonly used processes for removing excess carbon dioxide in the final purification of the gaseous hydrogen. In the biogas production it is sometimes necessary to remove carbon dioxide from the biogas to make it comparable with the natural. The removal of the sometimes high content of hydrogen sulfide is necessary to prevent corrosion of metallic parts after burning the bio gas. = Carbon capture and storage = Amines are used to remove CO2 in various areas ranging from natural gas production to the food and beverage industry, and have been for over sixty years. There are multiple classifications of amines, each of which has different characteristics relevant to CO2 capture. For example, Monoethanolamine (MEA) reacts strongly with acid gases like CO2 and has a fast reaction time and an ability to remove high percentages of CO2, even at the low CO2 concentrations. Typically, Monoethanolamine (MEA) can capture 85% to 90% of the CO2 from the flue gas of a coal-fired plant, which is one of the most effective solvent to capture CO2. Challenges of carbon capture using amine include: * Low pressure gas increases difficulty of transferring CO2 from the gas into amine * Oxygen content of the gas can cause amine degradation and acid formation * CO2 degradation of primary (and secondary) amines * High energy consumption * Very large facilities * Finding suitable location for the removed CO2 The partial pressure is the driving force to transfer CO2 into the liquid phase. Under the low pressure, this transfer is hard to achieve without increasing the reboiler‚Äôs heat duty, which will result in higher cost. Primary and secondary amines, for example, MEA and DEA, will react with CO2 and form degradation products. O2 from the inlet gas will cause degradation as well. The degraded amine is no longer able to capture CO2, which decreases the overall carbon capture efficiency. Currently, variety of amine mixtures are being synthesized and tested to achieve a more desirable set of overall properties for use in CO2 capture systems. One major focus is on lowering the energy required for solvent regeneration, which has a major impact on process costs. However, there are tradeoffs to consider. For example, the energy required for regeneration is typically related to the driving forces for achieving high capture capacities. Thus, reducing the regeneration energy can lower the driving force and thereby increase the amount of solvent and size of absorber needed to capture a given amount of CO2, thus, increasing the capital cost.

His ubiquitous late-night infomercials, which promoted unsubstantiated health, diet, and financial advice, earned him a fortune but eventually resulted in civil and criminal penalties for fraud, larceny, and contempt of court. In the early 1990s, Trudeau was convicted of larceny and credit card fraud. In 1998, he was accused of grossly misrepresenting the contents of his book, The Weight-Loss Cure \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About. In a 2004 settlement, he agreed to pay a $500,000 fine and cease marketing all products except his books, which are protected under the First Amendment. However, in 2011, he was fined $37.6 million for violating the 2004 settlement, and ordered to post a $2 million bond before engaging in any future infomercial advertising. In 2013, facing further prosecution for violations of the 2011 agreement and non-payment of the $37-million judgment, Trudeau filed for bankruptcy protection. His claims of insolvency were challenged by FTC lawyers, who maintained that he was hiding money in shell companies, and cited examples of continued lavish spending, such as $359 for a haircut. In November 2013, Trudeau was convicted of criminal contempt, and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. He will be eligible for release in 2022. Infomercials starring Trudeau and promoting his books ‚Äî under the auspices of a private California corporation of undisclosed ownership ‚Äî continue to air regularly on United States television stations.  Early life  Trudeau grew up in Lynn, Massachusetts, the adopted son of Robert and Mary Trudeau. He attended St. Mary's High School in Lynn, where he was voted \\"Most Likely to Succeed\\" by the class of 1981.  Career  After high school Trudeau became a used car salesman, then joined the seminar circuit, selling memory improvement techniques. In 1990 he pleaded guilty to depositing $80,000 in worthless checks and impersonating a physician, but served, he said, fewer than 30 days. In 1991, he pleaded guilty to 11 counts of credit card fraud and spent two years in federal prison. After his release in 1993, Trudeau joined a multi-level marketing firm, Nutrition for Life. The firm was successful until the Attorney General of Illinois charged that it was running a pyramid scheme. Trudeau and Nutrition for Life settled cases brought by the state of Illinois, and seven other U.S. states, for US$185,000. Next, Trudeau produced and appeared in a series of late-night television infomercial broadcasts throughout North America. They promoted a range of products, including health aids, dietary supplements (such as coral calcium), baldness remedies, addiction treatments, memory-improvement courses, reading- improvement programs, and real estate investment strategies. The FTC took regulatory action against Trudeau, alleging that his broadcasts contained unsubstantiated claims and misrepresentations. In 1998, he was fined. In 2004, he settled a contempt-of-court action arising out of the same cases by agreeing to a settlement that included both payments of a $2 million fine and a ban on further use of infomercials to promote any product other than publications protected by the First Amendment. In 2004, Trudeau began writing books and promoting them with infomercials in the U.S. The first book he published was a medical guide titled Natural Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About, which was published in 2005. The book was criticized for containing no natural cures. Trudeau claimed he was not able to include them because of threats by the FTC.Revealing the Truth about Natural Cures The book became a bestseller selling 5 million copies. Two years later, Trudeau published a second medical book titled More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease (). According to Trudeau, the book identifies brand name products that will cure myriad illnesses. Trudeau's books claim that animals in the wild rarely develop degenerative conditions like cancer or Alzheimer's disease, and that many diseases are caused not by viruses or bacteria, but rather by an imbalance in vital energy. Science writer Christopher Wanjek critiqued and rejected many of these claims in his July 25, 2006 LiveScience.com health column. Trudeau went on to publish The Weight-Loss Cure \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About and Debt Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About. His writing has been commercially successful if not factual. In September 2005, Natural Cures was listed in the New York Times as the number-one-selling nonfiction book in the United States for 25 weeks. Trudeau launched a self-titled Internet radio talk show in February 2009 which also aired on several small radio stations consisting of mostly brokered programming.  Personal life  Trudeau has been married at least three times. Little is known about his first marriage, to Oleksandra Polozhentseva, a Ukrainian immigrant. His second union, in 2007, to Kristine Dorow, a Norwegian student whom he met in London, ended in annulment after four months. In 2008, he married Natalya Babenko, another Ukrainian, who currently runs several of his former companies. She has returned to her home in Kiev, according to Trudeau.Gell, A. (January 20, 2015).

Publications  = Natural Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About = In 2004, Trudeau self-published his book Natural Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About, in which he made a number of unsubstantiated claims‚Äîfor example, that sunlight does not cause cancer, sunscreen is one of the major causes of skin cancer, and that AIDS was a hoax devised as an excuse to stimulate medication usage. Trudeau further suggested‚Äîagain without documentation‚Äîthat various \\"natural cures\\" for serious illnesses, including cancer, herpes, arthritis, AIDS, acid reflux disease, various phobias, depression, obesity, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, attention deficit disorder, and muscular dystrophy, had been deliberately hidden from the public by the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, and the major food and drug companies.Michael Shermer, \\"Cures and Cons: Natural scams \\"he\\" doesn't want you to know about,\\" Scientific American, March 2006. In one widely quoted example, he asserted that the University of Calgary had developed a \\"natural\\" diabetes treatment, then quashed its data, fearing reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry. (A spokesman for the school told ABC News that \\"there have been no human studies conducted at the University of Calgary in the past 20 years on herbal remedies for diabetes.\\" The university later sent Trudeau a \\"cease and desist\\" letter, ordering him to stop using its name.U of C refutes diabetes coverup (January 31, 2006). Calgary Herald . Retrieved April 8, 2015.) Rose Shapiro cited Natural Cures as a prime example in her book, Suckers: How Alternative Medicine Makes Fools of Us All. Natural Cures sold briskly due to an aggressive infomercial promotion. Quackwatch and other internet watchdog sites cautioned that the infomercial itself was \\"misleading\\". In a 2005 public warning from the New York State Consumer Protection Board, CPB Chairman Teresa A. Santiago cautioned that Natural Cures contained no actual cures, only \\"speculation\\". Cures were promised, but only by subscribing to Trudeau's newsletter or website at $71.40 per year or $499 for a \\"lifetime membership\\". The paid sites contained only additional, similarly unsubstantiated speculation, according to the CPB. The Chicago Tribune also noted that a purported back-cover endorsement by former FDA commissioner Herbert Ley‚Äîwho died three years before the book was written‚Äîwas actually an excerpt from a 35-year-old New York Times interview.\\"Author targeted for cure claims\\",Chicago Tribune, August 30, 2005, Retrieved November 23, 2013 = More Natural Cures Revealed = Following Natural Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About, Trudeau released a second medical guide two years later. His second book, More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease, was self-published as well. The book is a similar publication to his first, where he purports to explain why drug and food companies hide the truth about how their products can cause disease. In More Natural Cures Revealed, Trudeau writes that workers at the FDA and FTC want to censor him and, figuratively, burn his books. Though the book received negative comments from some reviewers, it received average ratings on both Amazon and GoodReads.com. = The Weight Loss Cure \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About = In April 2007, Trudeau released The Weight Loss Cure \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About. The book describes a weight loss plan originally proposed by British endocrinologist ATW Simeons in the 1950s involving injections of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The diet was criticized in 1962 by the Journal of the American Medical Association as hazardous to human health and a waste of money. In 1976, the FTC ordered clinics and promoters of the Simeons Diet and hCG to inform prospective patients that there had been no \\"substantial evidence\\" to conclude hCG offered any benefit above that achieved on a restricted calorie diet. Clinical research trials published by the Journal of the American Medical Association and the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that hCG is ineffective as a weight-loss aid, citing \\"no statistically significant difference in the means of the two groups\\" and that hCG \\"does not appear to enhance the effectiveness of a rigidly imposed regimen for weight reduction.\\" The FTC filed a contempt-of- court action against Trudeau alleging that the alleged misrepresentations in the book violate a 2004 consent order. = Debt Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About = Debt Cures was published in 2007 and has been marketed on television. Chuck Jaffee, a columnist at CBS MarketWatch, stated: \\"Truth be told, most of the information (in the book) is readily available in personal finance columns you can find online or in books that are readily available in your local library.\\" Trudeau says that if readers disagree with items on their credit reports, they can dispute them as identity theft; this was the \\"magic cure\\" of the book's title. = Your Wish Is Your Command = Published in 2009, the product says it gives tools on how to use the Law of Attraction to manifest readers' desires. The packaging also says it contains key links to using the Law of Attraction that are missing in other publications. Among the claims made in the related infomercial is Trudeau's assertion to have virtually flunked out of high school.Trudeau, Kevin (Host). (2010, May 16).Your Wish is your Command[Informercial]. Toronto: CityTV He also says he was \\"taken in\\" by a mysterious group called \\"The Brotherhood\\" that taught him the secrets that he is now widely announcing in his book. There is also an invitation to join the now defunct \\"Global Information Network,\\" an \\"exclusive group of highly influential, affluent, and freedom-orientated [sic] people\\" (see below). The network operated out of the Caribbean island Nevis and employed the Law of Attraction as its principal wealth generator, a concept generally regarded by much of the scientific community as placebo or pseudoscience.The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question ‚Äì pages 189 to 198 by Leon Lederman with Dick Teresi (copyright 1993) Houghton Mifflin Company  Media interviews  Trudeau has been interviewed by CNN's Paula Zahn, Matt Lauer of NBC's Today Show, and Harry Smith of CBS's The Early Show.\\"Is Trudeau A Charlatan Or Healer?\\" ‚Äì CBS News, The Early Show Trudeau was also the subject of investigative reports done by Inside Edition, ABC's 20/20 (transcript) and Dateline NBC.Dateline NBC: From the Inside Out by John Larson The 20/20 segment highlighted a Nightline interview with Jake Tapper in which Trudeau misrepresented the money he was forced to pay to the government, the charges filed against him and the reason the government did not follow through with charges, and claiming ignorance when the claims made in his book were called false by Tapper.  Infomercials  At one time, Trudeau was a prolific producer of infomercials. He consented to an FTC ban applying to everything except publications that the FTC concluded would infringe upon his First Amendment rights. All of his subsequent infomercials advertised his books, Natural Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want You To Know About and The Weight Loss Cure. Notable co-hosts included Leigh Valentine (former wife of televangelist Robert Tilton) and the late Tammy Faye Messner (the former Tammy Faye Bakker). = Pharmaceutical companies = Trudeau offers a conspiracy theory, saying that the drug industry and the FDA work with each other to effectively deceive the public by banning all-natural cures in order to protect the profits of the drug industry. Trudeau says that FDA commissioners who leave the FDA to work for large drug companies are paid millions of dollars. In any other industry, according to Trudeau, this would be called \\"bribery,\\" a \\"conflict of interest\\" or \\"payoffs.\\" Trudeau also says in his infomercials that the food industry includes chemicals (such as MSG and aspartame) to get people \\"addicted to food\\" and to \\"make people obese.\\" = References to scientific studies = One of the major complaints about Trudeau's infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies, making them impossible to cross-check for accuracy. The same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence that he presents in the infomercials. He does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods. For example, he tells a story in an infomercial about \\"a friend from England\\" who came to his house and complained of heartburn. He also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of St. John's Wort compared to two prescription medications. These studies, the infomercials suggest, are identified in the book being advertised for sale, but none of his books provide any such substantiation. In an interview, he explained that he cannot reveal his source material because of \\"FTC suppression\\"; but readers can join his web site, where, for $9.99 a month or $499 for a lifetime, they can gain access to the special members-only section from which they can e-mail him for the information. = Newspaper articles = A pair of 2005 Associated Press articles by Candice Choi on the infomercials elaborated on the success and problems of the programs. Choi says that by repeatedly mentioning government sanctions against him, Trudeau \\"anticipated any backlash with his cuckoo conspiracy theory\\" and can partially deflect any criticism of him or his infomercials. Trudeau's use of the word \\"cure\\" is an issue for regulators. Also, bookstores are polled on their decisions to sell or not sell a successful and controversial self-published book.  Additional marketing ventures  = Audio tapes: \\"Mega Memory\\" = Trudeau says he adapted techniques used to improve the memory of the blind and the mentally challenged to create Mega Memory and Advanced Mega Memory audio tapes. His promotion of memory-enhancing products was ended by the intervention of the Federal Trade Commission which alleged that the claims made by Trudeau were false and programs involved would not enable users to achieve a \\"photographic memory,\\" as the advertising claimed. Trudeau used research that Dr. Michael Van Masters conducted with the State School for the Blind in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in 1975 as the basis of the Mega Memory products. Trudeau was selling automobiles at Neponset Lincoln Mercury in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston in 1982 when he first met Van Masters. Shortly after meeting Van Masters, he joined the latter's business in Chicago. = Non-surgical facelift = In addition to Natural Cures, Trudeau also hosted an infomercial that features the \\"Perfect Lift\\" non-surgical facelift. In the United Kingdom, this infomercial was found to violate the ITC advertising rules. In 2008, Trudeau began airing another infomercial, for a product called Firmalift, with Leigh Valentine. = Trudeau partners with Donald Barrett and ITV Direct = On September 11, 2006, Donald Barrett and ITV Direct, a direct marketing company based in Beverly, Massachusetts, announced that they had partnered with Trudeau to market both of his Natural Cures books.Direct Marketing Leaders Donald Barrett and Kevin Trudeau Join Forces. Retrieved December 21, 2006. Trudeau also worked with ITV to create ITV Ventures, a new MLM group based out of ITV's home office.ITV Ventures . Retrieved December 21, 2006. As of December 2006, ITV Direct has pulled all information concerning both this partnership and Trudeau's books from its corporate website; however, the infomercials continued to run for several years thereafter.  International Pool Tour  Las Vegas, Nevada, July 2006 In 2005, Trudeau founded the International Pool Tour (IPT). His goal was to transform billiards into a \\"major league\\" sport with aggressive promotion and the largest purses ever offered. The initial three events in 2005 and early 2006 were successful, but at the fourth, the IPT World Open tournament in Reno, Nevada, promoters announced that they did not have sufficient funds on hand to cover the purse. Winners were assured that they would receive their prizes in small installments, but most were never paid. The Reno fiasco marked the demise not only of IPT but of professional pool competitions as a whole. As one commentator put it, \\"The pool hustler wasn't murdered by any single suspect, but the last man holding the knife was Kevin Trudeau.\\"  Legal proceedings  In connection with his promotional activities he has had a felony conviction and has been an unsuccessful defendant in several Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuits. Trudeau has been charged several times by agencies of the United States government for making claims without evidence. In these cases, Trudeau signed a consent decree in which he did not plead guilty but did agree to stop making the claims and to pay a fine. Trudeau subsequently began to sell books, which are protected by the First Amendment. Trudeau was convicted of fraud and larceny in the early 1990s. The FTC has sued him repeatedly and keeps an extensive record of its conflicts with him. A court order currently restricts his ability to promote and sell any product or service; however, he is permitted to promote books and other publications due to free-speech protection under the First Amendment as long as they are not used to promote or sell products or services and do not contain misrepresentations. On November 19, 2007, a court found Trudeau in contempt of that court order for making deceptive claims about his book The Weight Loss Cure \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About. In August 2008, he was fined more than $5 millionKevin Trudeau Banned from Infomercials For Three Years, Ordered to Pay More Than $5 Million for False Claims About Weight-Loss Book, Federal Trade Commission, October 6, 2008. and banned from infomercials for three years for continuing to make fraudulent claims pertaining to the book. The amount of the monetary damages was later increased to $37 million. = 1990‚Äì1991: Larceny and credit card fraud = In 1990, Trudeau posed as a doctor in order to deposit $80,000 in false checks, and in 1991, he pleaded guilty to larceny.

Later, in an interview, he explained his crimes as: = 1996: SEC and various states = Trudeau began working for Nutrition For Life, a multi-level marketing program, in the mid-1990s. In 1996, his recruitment practices were cited by the states of Illinois and Michigan, as well as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Illinois sued Trudeau and Jules Leib, his partner, accusing them of operating an illegal pyramid scheme. They settled with Illinois and seven other states for $185,000 after agreeing to change their tactics. Michigan forbade him from operating in the state.Ryan's Sweeping Settlement With Trudeau Protects Consumers & Nets $185,000 For Eight States Cagey Consumer website A class action lawsuit was filed by stockholders of Nutrition for Life for violations of Texas law, including misrepresenting and/or omitting material information about Nutrition for Life International, Inc.'s business.

In July 2003, Trudeau entered into a stipulated preliminary injunction that prohibited him from continuing to make the challenged claims for Coral Calcium Supreme and Biotape. In the summer of 2004, the court found Trudeau in contempt of court for violating the preliminary injunction, because he had sent out a direct mail piece and produced an infomercial making prohibited claims. The court ordered Trudeau to cease all marketing for coral calcium products. In September 2004, Trudeau agreed to pay $2 million ($500,000 in cash plus transfer of residential property located in Ojai, California, and a luxury vehicle) to settle charges that he falsely claimed that a coral calcium product can cure cancer and other serious diseases and that a purported analgesic called Biotape can permanently cure or relieve severe pain. He also agreed to a lifetime ban on promoting products using infomercials, but excluded restrictions to promote his books via infomercials.2004 Stipulated Final Order\\"Kevin Trudeau Banned from Infomercials\\", FTC press release, September 10, 2004Kevin Trudeau Banned from Infomercials ‚Äì ConsumerAffairs.com, September 10, 2004 Trudeau was the only person ever banned by the FTC from selling a product via television.

FTC = On February 28, 2005, Trudeau filed a complaint against the FTC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Trudeau also filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which the court denied. The complaint charged that the FTC had retaliated against him for his criticism of the agency by issuing a press release that falsely characterized and intentionally and deliberately misrepresented the 2004 Final Order. That conduct, Trudeau asserted, exceeded the FTC's authority under 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 46(f) and violated the First Amendment. The FTC responded with a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), and for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6). The district court granted the FTC's motion to dismiss. First, the court concluded that it lacked subject- matter jurisdiction because the press release was not \\"a 'final agency action'\\" under \\"section 704 of the [Administrative Procedure Act]\\", 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 704. Second, the court held, \\"in the alternative, that Trudeau's claims failed to state a viable cause of action as a matter of law.\\" Trudeau later filed an appeal which was unsuccessful in reversing the court's ruling.Trudeau v.

New York Consumer Protection Board = Trudeau filed a lawsuit on August 11, 2005, accusing the New York State Consumer Protection Board of violating his First Amendment rights by contacting television stations in New York state and urging them to pull Trudeau's infomercials promoting his book Natural Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About.Infomercial king sues New York regulators, Chicago Sun- Times, August 15, 2005 by Stephanie Zimmermann Trudeau won a temporary restraining order on September 6, 2005 prohibiting the Board from sending letters to the television stations. The temporary restraining order was replaced by a preliminary injunction. However, Trudeau lost a motion to have the Board send a \\"corrective letter\\" to the television stations and subsequently dropped all claims for monetary damages. The case is still in litigation. = 2007: FTC contempt of court action = The FTC filed a contempt of court action against Trudeau and the companies that market The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About, alleging that Trudeau was in contempt of a 2004 court order by \\"deceptively claiming in his infomercials that the book being advertised establishes a weight-loss protocol that is 'easy' to follow.\\" The action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on September 17, 2007. According to an FTC press release, Trudeau has claimed that the weight loss plan outlined in the book is easy, can be done at home, and readers can eat anything they want. When consumers buy the book, they find it describes a complex plan that requires intense dieting, daily injections of a prescribed drug that is not easily obtainable, and lifelong dietary restrictions. On November 19, 2007, Trudeau was found in contempt of the 2004 court order for \\"patently false\\" claims in his weight loss book. U.S. District Court Judge Robert W. Gettleman ruled that Trudeau \\"clearly misrepresents in his advertisements the difficulty of the diet described in his book, and by doing so, he has misled thousands of consumers.\\" On August 7, 2008, Gettleman issued an order that Trudeau was not to appear in infomercials for any product in which he has any interest, for three years from the date of the order; and was to pay a penalty of $5,173,000, an estimate of the royalties received from the weight loss book. On November 4, 2008, Gettleman amended the judgment to $37,616,161, the amount consumers paid in response to the deceptive infomercials. The court denied Trudeau's request to reconsider or stay this ruling on December 11 of the same year. Trudeau appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which upheld the contempt finding, but sent the case back to the lower court to explain the basis of the $37,616,161 damage finding and the three-year infomercial ban. After the lower court justified the basis for the damage finding, and set a $2 million performance bond for future infomercial advertising, Trudeau again appealed to the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed the damage award on November 29, 2011. = 2010: Arrest on criminal contempt of court charge = On February 11, 2010, Trudeau was arrested and appeared in U.S. District Court before Gettleman for criminal contempt of court after he \\"asked his supporters to email the federal judge overseeing a pending civil case brought against him by the Federal Trade Commission.\\" He was forced to turn over his passport, pay a $50,000 bond and was warned he could face future prison time for interfering with the direct process of the court. On February 17, Gettleman sentenced Trudeau to 30 days in jail and forfeiture of the $50,000 bond. Psychiatrist Stephen Barrett, the creator of Quackwatch.org, \\"has for years labeled Trudeau a fraud\\" and was quoted: \\"He struck me as somebody who (believes he) is omnipotent. That is, no one can touch him,\\" Barrett said. \\"That's almost been the case.\\" Trudeau appealed the ruling and on May 20 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted his motion, dismissing the contempt citation. =2011: Loss of appeal against $37.6m fine= On November 28, 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission issued warnings to companies selling human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) as weight loss products as the claims are unsupported. The HCG diet was popularized by Trudeau's The Weight-Loss Cure \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About book in 2007. On Nov. 29, 2011, Trudeau lost his 2010 appeal in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The court found that the $37.6 million fine for violating his 2004 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission was appropriate as Trudeau had aired 32,000 infomercials and described the figure as \\"conservative.\\" The court considered sales only from the 800 number used to place orders and excluded internet and store sales. Additionally, the court found that requiring Trudeau to make a $2 million performance bond prior to participating in an infomercial was constitutional. = 2013‚Äì2015: Additional contempt citations, asset concealment, imprisonment = In September 2013, Judge Robert Gettleman held Trudeau in civil contempt for violation of multiple court orders and failure to pay the $37 million fine assessed in 2010. Noting that he continued to maintain a lavish lifestyle, despite insisting that he had been \\"completely wiped out\\" financially, Gettleman appointed a receiver to identify and catalog Trudeau's assets and holdings. A month later Trudeau was arrested after refusing to cooperate with the receiver's investigation. In November a jury found him in criminal contempt for repeated violations of his 2004 agreement as well as subsequent orders and plea deals. Pending sentencing he was held without bail as a flight risk, and for continued failure to disclose hidden assets. In February 2014, the court-appointed receiver announced that a number of Trudeau's known assets, including a home in Ojai, California, would be auctioned, with proceeds to be applied toward unpaid fines and restitution. The receiver also assumed control of Trudeau's Global Information Network (GIN), the Nevis-based \\"secret club\\" that had promised extraordinary \\"secrets to success\\". Court officials informed GIN members that the club's business model \\"likely amounted to an illegal pyramid scheme\\", and that its relentlessly publicized group of 30 billionaire financial advisors known as the \\"GIN Council\\" did not exist. GIN's remaining assets were later auctioned as well.Infamous infomercial king Kevin Trudeau's secret global club off the market, sold to highest bidders. KHSB.com archive . Retrieved April 15, 2015.

Other criticisms  = Medical experience = One common criticism by consumer groups is that Trudeau has had no medical training. Trudeau responds that by not having such training, he is not biased toward pharmaceutical companies and the FDA, and that medical doctors \\"are taught only how to write out prescriptions\\" for \\"poisons\\" and \\"cut out pieces of a person's anatomy.\\"(Natural Cures, Chapter 1 ‚Äì \\"I Should Be Dead by Now\\") = Unsubstantiated claims = Trudeau has been criticized for his inability to provide evidence to back up his claims. Although he recites anecdotes, he has never provided evidence evaluated by licensed medical practitioners. In instances where Trudeau has been asked to provide proof, he has misinterpreted medical studies or cited dubious or fictitious studies. For example, Trudeau cited a nonexistent 25-year research study involving a natural cure for diabetes at the University of Calgary. When ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper confronted him on Nightline, Trudeau insisted that he had a copy of the study and would provide it; he never did. He later claimed in his infomercials that the university destroyed its findings to prevent reprisals from the pharmaceutical industry. In 2006 University of Calgary officials announced in a public statement that none of Trudeau's claims about the university's research were true, and that its attorneys had sent Trudeau a \\"cease and desist\\" letter, demanding that he stop associating himself with the school. = False endorsements = In August 2005, the New York Consumer Protection Board warned consumers that Trudeau has used false claims of endorsements to promote his products, noting that the back cover of Natural Cures includes false endorsements. Further, the NYCPB states that Trudeau's television advertisements \\"give the false impression that Tammy Faye Messner opposes chemotherapy in favor of the 'natural cures' in Trudeau's book.\\" A representative for Messner before her death from cancer said that was not true and that she was starting chemotherapy again. The back cover includes the following quote from Dr. Herbert Ley, a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration who died three years before the book was written: \\"The thing that bugs me is that people think the FDA is protecting them. It isn't. What the FDA is doing and what people think it's doing are as different as night and day.\\" The statement, extracted from a 1969 interview in The New York Times, was made in the context of Ley's resignation from his post as a result of numerous policy disputes.Jennifer Ross-Nazzal. ‚ÄúFrom Farm to Fork‚Äù: How Space Food Standards Impacted the Food Industry and Changed Food Safety Standards page 226.

These include the health impacts of smoking; the permissibility of smoking on holidays and fast days, and the impacts of second-hand smoke on other people. Kosher tobacco shop in Cheb, Czech Republic Historical background Until the late 20th century, the use of tobacco for smoking and in the form of snuff was common among Jews. It is speculated that a Jew named Luis de Torres, who accompanied Christopher Columbus on his expedition in 1492, settled in Cuba, learned the use of tobacco, and introduced it into Europe. From this time Jews were connected with the trade in tobacco.M. J. Kohler, in Publ. Am. Jew. Hist. Soc. x. 52 Ritual concerns As early as the 17th century, rabbis debated various halachic issues which arose in connection with tobacco use, particularly its permissibility on Shabbat, holidays, fast days, and whether a blessing must be recited before use. Among the early sources are Keneset ha-Gedolah by R' Chaim Benveniste (1603‚Äì73) and Magen Avraham by Avraham Gombiner (1635‚Äì83). Gombiner referred to the \\"drinking of tobak [tobacco] through a pipe by drawing the smoke into the mouth and discharging it,\\" and was undecided on whether a smoker should first make a blessing over smoking as a type of refreshment.Magen Avraham, Orach Hayyim 210:9 Believing that tobacco was soaked in beer‚Äîa kind of chametz‚Äîhe banned smoking during Passover.Magen Avraham, Orach Hayyim 467:10 Benveniste expressed himself very forcibly against smoking tutun (tobacco) on Tisha BeAv, and reportedly excommunicated a Jew who smoked on that solemn fast-day.Keneset ha-Gedolah, to Orach Chayim, 551:21 Benveniste pointed out the inconsistency of those authorities who permit smoking on holidays because it is a 'necessity,' a 'means of sustaining life,' and who allow it on fast-days because smoke has no 'substance' like food. In Benveniste's opinion, smoking was prohibited on holidays; he quoted Rabbi Joseph Escapa as coinciding in this view, though he thought it unwise to enforce a generally accepted law.Jewish Encyclopedia: Tobacco. 1906. Retrieved 1 January 2016. Writing in Turkey, an Islamic country, Benveniste further argued that smoking on fast days is Chillul Hashem (a defamation of God's name), because Muslims refraining from smoking on fast-days would see Jews smoking on theirs.Keneset ha-Gedolah, ib. 567 [ed. Constantinople, 1729, pp. 101 et seq.] Despite such concerns, some Jews did smoke on Shabbat using hookas prepared before Shabbat, or else visited Muslim neighbors to enjoy the smoke in their homes. Rabbinic authorities banned this practice on the grounds that Gentiles would consider Judaism as ridiculous.Alkalai, \\"Zekor le- Abraham,\\" i. 142-143, Salonica, 1798 The Turkish narghile, in which the smoke passes through water, early became popular; Benveniste rules that the \\"tumbak\\" (cake of tobacco, over which a burning coal is placed at the other end of the narghile) extinguishes the fire, which is forbidden on holidays as well as Shabbat. Gombiner prohibits tumbak because it is like \\"mugmar\\" (spice for burning), mentioned in the Talmud, which likewise is prohibited. This, however, is disputed by R. Darchei No'am No. 9, Venice, 1698 who permits the use of the narghile on holidays.See Be'er Heitev, to Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayyim 514:1 The controversy finally ended in a victory for those rabbis who permitted the use of tobacco on holidays and fast-days, except of course on Yom Kippur, which is like Sabbath; still, some Jews still abstain from smoking on Tisha BeAv. Unlike smoking, the use of snuff was allowed on the Sabbath, holidays, fast-days, and Yom Kippur.Leket ha-Kemah, p. 51b, Amsterdam, 1707 Jacob Hagiz (1620-74) quotes a responsum of Isaiah Pinto permitting the use of snuff on the Sabbath, even though it cures catarrh; for everybody, even healthy people, use snuff, and it can not therefore be considered a drug.\\"Halakhot Ketannot,\\" No. 101 Moral concerns The Chofetz Chaim (1838‚Äì1933) sought to dissuade practitioners from smoking. He considered it a waste of time, and saw the practice of people borrowing cigarettes from each other as morally questionable.◊©◊ó◊ï◊• ◊û◊î ◊©◊î◊ù ◊û◊ñ◊ô◊ß◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊í◊ï◊£ ◊õ◊ô◊ì◊ï◊¢, ◊¢◊ï◊ì ◊í◊ï◊®◊û◊ô◊ù ◊î◊ô◊ñ◊ß ◊ú◊†◊©◊û◊™◊ù ◊ë◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ï◊ú ◊™◊ï◊®◊î... ◊ï◊õ◊©◊†◊™◊®◊í◊ú ◊ë◊ñ◊î ◊ê◊ñ◊ô ◊õ◊ë◊® ◊ß◊©◊î ◊ú◊ï ◊ú◊î◊û◊†◊î ◊û◊î◊ù (Zachor laMiryam, 23); Cp. Stone (296f., 299) and Eliezer Waldenberg R' Moshe Feinstein prohibited smoking in any place where other people are found, on the grounds that it causes them distress (even ignoring health impacts).Igrot Moshe, Hoshen Mishpat 2:18 The early modern responsa literature addresses the question of students smoking in their batei midrash and synagogues. Some rabbis sought to outlaw smoking and the use of snuff in places of worshipPahad Yitzkhak, 9, p. 62a and posted notices for study halls.Ha-Maggid, 1859, 3:16 Many leading acharonim prohibited smoking in batei midrash and synagogues on the grounds that smoking is a frivolous activity which does not show respect for the holiness of these places.Aruch haShulchan Orach Chaim 151:5; Pahad Yitzchak 3 s.v. \\"Tabak\\"; Mishnah Brurah 151:6, Beur Halacha s.v. ◊ì◊ë◊ô◊î◊û\\"◊ì, Kaf haChaim 151:14 Health concerns When 20th century medicine discovered the negative effects of smoking on health, the question arose whether smoking is forbidden in all circumstances. The debate about the acceptability of smoking according to halacha is centered primarily around the prohibition for a person to damage his body, or bring about his death.Beit Yitzchak 20, ◊°◊ß◊ô◊®◊î ◊û◊ß◊ô◊§◊î ◊ë◊†◊ï◊©◊ê ◊î◊¢◊ô◊©◊ï◊ü ◊ë◊î◊ú◊õ◊î, Daniel Stone (1988); p.296 Opponents of smoking argue that since there is a clear link between smoking and cancer, smoking should be prohibited. However, Rabbi Moses Feinstein wrote a responsum stating that while inadvisable, smoking was permitted for one who had already started. Feinstein explained that since the risk of illness or death due to smoking is considered small, and it is a widespread practice, it is therefore permitted under the rabbinical principle: \\"The Lord protects the simple.\\" However, starting to smoke would be prohibited because of the transgression of v'lo sasuru.Igros Moshe, Choshen Mishpat 2;76 According to students, when informed of the dangers of smoking, Rabbi Aaron Kotler ruled that smoking was a biblical transgression.letter from his close student Rabbi Yechiel Perr, the current Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva of Far Rockaway available at Many Haredi rabbis have called on people not to smoke and called smoking an 'evil habit'. These rabbis include Rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv, Rabbi Aharon Leib Shteinman, Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Shapiro, Rabbi Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz, Rabbi Nissim Karelitz, and Rabbi Shmuel Auerbach. Rabbi Shmuel HaLevi Wosner forbade people from starting to smoke and said that those who smoke are obligated to do everything they can to stop. All of these rabbis also said that it is forbidden to smoke in a public place, where others might be bothered by it.; ; Among important Sephardi Haredi rabbis, Rabbi Ben Tzion Abba Shaul and Rabbi Moshe Tzadka called on youth not to start smoking. Other major Ashkenazi rabbis who explicitly forbade smoking include Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg, Rabbi Moshe Stern, and Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Sheinberg. Smoking is specifically prohibited by Solomon Freehof, other Reform rabbis, as well as rabbis in the Conservative movement in the U.S. and Israel. There is a custom still practiced today by Hasidic and some Haredi grooms who hand out free cigarettes to their friends at their vort (engagement). Recent rulings against smoking by great rabbis do not have seem to have stopped the tradition. Early on in the Hasidic movement, the Baal Shem Tov taught that smoking tobacco can be used as a religious devotion, and can even help bring the Messianic Era. Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berditchev is quoted as saying that \\"a Jew smokes on the weekdays and sniffs tobacco on the Sabbath\\". Rabbi Dovid of Lelov taught that it is a good religious practice to smoke on Saturday nights after the Sabbath, and this practice is followed by the Rebbes of Lelov and Skulen, however the current Rebbe of Skulen discourages people from following his example, in light of current views opposing smoking, and he himself only takes a few brief puffs of a cigarette after Havdalah. Many Hasidic Jews smoke, and many who do not smoke regularly will smoke on the holiday of Purim, even if they do not do so any other time of the year, and some consider it to be a spiritual practice, similar to the smoke of the altar in the ancient Temple. However, many Hasidic Rabbis oppose smoking. In 2006, the Vaad Halacha (Jewish law committee), sponsored by the Rabbinical Council of America, ruled that the use of tobacco is forbidden to Jews, and the committee specifically cited and reversed precedents that permitted smoking.

The critique maintains that the methodology neglects how economics can be done, is done, and should be done to advance the subject. Its recommendations include use of good rhetorical devices for \\"disciplined conversation.\\"  Substance  Deirdre McCloskey's 1985 book The Rhetoric of Economics argues that \\"The Mathematization of Economics Was a Good Idea\\", but that \\"economic modernism\\" took equilibrium model-building and econometrics (especially \\"existence- theorem\\" mathematics, and statistical significance) \\"absurdly\\" far. Roughly speaking McCloskey wants economics to make interesting, new, and true statements about the real world, and argues that proving the hypothetical possibility of an effect within an analytical framework is not a constructive way of doing this. Although the conventional way of connecting the economic model with the world is through econometric analysis, she cites many examples in which professors of econometrics were able to use the same data to both prove and disprove the applicability of a model's conclusions. She argues that the vast efforts expended by economists on analytical equations is essentially wasted effort. In \\"Ask What the Boys in the Sandbox Will Have\\", McCloskey identified the economists whom she accuses of leading economics astray in the 1940s: # Paul Samuelson: In her view, Samuelson wanted economics to resemble more closely the hard sciences (especially physics), and elevated the \\"vice\\" of \\"blackboard proofs\\" and other mathematical (but not necessarily scientific) values to accomplish this. # Lawrence Klein was the econometrician she says is responsible for the modern \\"mistake\\" of confusing statistical significance with scientific significance. # Jan Tinbergen she considers responsible for the third vice of social engineering, which is based on the other two. McCloskey says that this presumes to know more than it can, and raised the prestige of the mathematical \\"modernist methodology\\" above other ways of performing economics. Her complaint against the modern profession, and against the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel winners above, has provoked a strong defense from the economic mainstream. It has led to debates with such figures as Kenneth Arrow, who vigorously support the \\"Samuelson\\" approach, and argue that the quantity of analytical mathematical models in modern economics is a critical requirement for progress. However, McCloskey acknowledges the virtues as being born from each man's \\"genius\\", and rather blames the vices as being created not by these three Nobel economists, but by their students and their students' students, including herself.  The diagnosis and solution  McCloskey says that most economists when they write are \\"tendentious\\", assuming that they know already, and concentrating on a high standard of mathematical proof rather than a \\"scholarly\\" accumulation of relevant, documented facts about the real world. The advice she offers colleagues here is to spend more time in the archives, and write more heavily researched papers from specific observations in the real world (she argues that this is the norm in the natural sciences on which economics believes it is modelling itself, but that most economics practitioners actually base their methodology more closely on pure mathematics). Since she says: \\"No one really believes a scientific assertion in economics based on statistical significance\\" the solution she proposes to establishing cause and effect in economics is \\"calibrated simulation\\". Calibrated simulation relies on measurement and numerical techniques (such as Monte Carlo methods) to test the robustness of its predictions, without requiring a closed-form solution proving that the postulated relationship will always hold (or will be reached in \\"equilibrium\\", or be impossible). As an illustration, she contrasts the Babylonian and Greek \\"rhetoric\\" used to back up the claim that the square on the long side of every right angle triangle has the same area as the sum of squares on the other two sides: While Greek geometry found a 'universal proof', the Babylonian engineers simply measured the sides of a thousand right triangular stones, and applied the heuristic that since all of these obeyed the relationship so would the rest. McCloskey believes that the Babylonian approach is more applicable to economics, and that Moore's Law and advances in modeling software will soon make it easier to use and understand than the Greek approach. In Calibrated Simulation is Storytelling she writes that one way to describe scientific theories is how mechanically mathematical they are: at the one end lie such hypotheses as Newtonian celestial mechanics which can be reduced entirely to equations - at the other are important works such as The Origin of Species which are \\"entirely historical and devoid of mathematical models\\". McCloskey says that economics would benefit from recalibrating its output within that spectrum to the more historical, \\"narrative\\" analysis.

Its current name derives from an Indian word aboga (\\"many fish\\"). The island's first settlers were Indian slaves from Venezuela and Nicaragua. The small town of San Pedro was founded in 1524 by Hernando de Luque, dean of the Panama cathedral. The town church of the same name is claimed to be the second-oldest church in the hemisphere. Rose of Lima (1586‚Äì1617), the first Catholic saint of the Americas, may have been born on the island. French painter Paul Gauguin visited the island in 1887. Paul Gauguin in Taboga Having worked for the first (French) attempt to dig a canal from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific, attempt in which 22000 workers lost their life, French painter Paul Gauguin, taking ill, was sent for treatment in Taboga Island; he then returned to France, with a stopover in Martinique; then left for the Marquesas and meeting his Destiny. His stay in Taboga is marked by an engraved plate on the island's main beach. Geography At low tide, the northern end of the island is joined by a sand bar to the small island of El Morro, and the southeastern end is from the neighboring Urab√° island. The island has a tropical rain forest climate (Af), with average daytime temperatures of . It is famous for its beautiful beaches, clear waters, soft sands, and wildlife refuge. Tourism Tourism is the major economic activity on the island, although fishing and agriculture are also practiced. The island has become a popular touristic attraction due to its beautiful natural areas and its proximity to Panama City. Daily ferries link the city to the island, most of them departing from the Amador Causeway. Aside from beaches, the island has trails for hiking to its highest points, including Cerro Vig√≠a and Cerro de la Cruz. The latter is a hill located south of the town, topped with a huge cross. many activities are available such as: Boat tours for fishing, whale watching, snorkeling, mountain tours and sightseeing are available, as well as walking and nature tours.

Some court magicians would use inductive lecanomancy; whereby the magician or priest would observe patterns of oil within water to predict the future. However, intuitive lecanomany is thought to have developed out of this, which merely required the magician to interpret ripples on the water through meditation. There are also reports of inductive lecanomany being used by the Mesopotamians, though they sometimes substituted flour for oil. In the Old Testament a form of lecanomancy was apparently used by Joseph in Egypt (Genesis 44:5) The Catawba people used an entirely different system of divination, which is still classified as lecanomany, whereby a bowl of water was placed by a deceased person's head. On the third day of the bowl being present, the deceased's family would watch the bowl for ripples and these would be interpreted to determine the whereabouts of the deceased's soul. In medieval Europe, lecanomancy was described as clear bowls being filled with water to determine the future. This is in stark contrast with earlier forms of the divination, which used clay bowls or basins. Other forms of lecanomancy throughout history involved dropping a rock in water and interpreting the ripples in the water. In yet another form, demons were thought to enter the water whose ripples were being interpreted, and were forced to answer questions by the scryer.

Hot mirrors can be designed to be inserted into the optical system at an incidence angle varying between zero and 45 degrees, and are useful in a variety of applications where the buildup of waste heat can damage components or adversely affect spectral characteristics of the illumination source. Wavelengths reflected by an infrared hot mirror range from about 750 to 1250 nanometers. By transmitting visible light wavelengths while reflecting infrared, hot mirrors can also serve as dichromatic beam splitters for specialized applications in fluorescence microscopy or optical eye tracking. Some early digital cameras designed for visible light capture, such as the Associated Press NC2000 and Nikon Coolpix 950, were unusually sensitive to infrared radiation, and tended to produce colours that were contaminated with infrared. This was particularly problematic with scenes that contained strong sources of infrared, such as fires, although the effect could be moderated by inserting a photographic hot mirror filter into the imaging pathway. Conversely, these cameras could be used for infrared photography by inserting a cold mirror filter into the imaging pathway, most commonly by mounting the filter on the front of the lens. New incandescent bulbs incorporate hot mirrors, increasing efficiency by redirecting unwanted infrared frequencies back to the filament.

He worked as the CIA chief of station in Islamabad, Pakistan from May 1981Coll 57 until 1984. He was succeeded by William Piekney in the summer of 1984. He died on April 30, 2017. Early life Hart was born Howard Lester Phillips, Jr. on 16 October 1940 in St. Louis, Missouri, the only son of Eleanor Laidley and Howard Lester Phillips. Within months of his birth the family traveled to Manila, Philippines where Howard Sr. was an engineer with a U.S. firm. When the Japanese invaded Manila early in World War II, the family was interned first at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, then moved to Los Banos. On 26 February 1945, The 11th Airborne Division jumped in behind Japanese lines and extricated the 2000+ internees under fire. They took them to Manila and onward to the United States. Following their return to the United States, Eleanor and Howard Sr. divorced and Eleanor married Joseph Chittendon Hart. Joseph Hart was a banker with Citi Bank and following an assignment in Calcutta, India they returned to Manila in 1950. Hart attended Kent School and graduated from Brent School in the Philippines in 1958. He attended Cornell University,Charlie Wilson's War, by George Crile, Published by Grove Press, 2007, , where he was in Chi Psi fraternity, and the University of Arizona, and has both B.A. (Honors) and M.A. degrees in Oriental Studies and Political Science. His languages include Urdu, Indonesian, and German. Career Hart joined the CIA after finishing graduate school at the University of Arizona in 1965. He spent two years at Camp Peary in Virginia, attending \\"the standard two-year course for ... aspiring case officers.\\" He joined the Directorate of Operations after graduation.Coll 55 A career Near East Division officer, Hart's overseas postings included five years in India; two years as a Chief of Station (COS) in the Persian Gulf; a three-year posting in Iran, before, during and after the Iranian Revolution (where he was Chief of Station after the Shah fell and the American Embassy was overrun by Khomeini elements); three years as COS Pakistan during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War; and COS, Germany in the period leading up to the collapse of Communism. In 1978 Hart began working the streets of Tehran. His reports that, contrary to over 15 years of CIA estimates, the Shah's rule was far from stable or secure were suppressed by more senior personnel within the CIA. He was captured a few days after the Shah's fall by an armed group of supporters of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and escaped summary execution by appealing to a mullah, who agreed that the Koran did not sanction such punishment.Tim Weiner, 2007. Legacy of Ashes pp. 368‚Äì369. Immediately following his return from Iran in the fall of 1979 he was assigned to the Pentagon's \\"Iran Rescue Mission Joint Task Force\\" as the senior intelligence advisor to the Task Force commander. Hart established and managed an extraordinary CIA-in-country support structure for the ill-fated Iran Rescue Mission in 1980, and accompanied the mission on deployment. Hart jump-started the CIA's efforts to equip the Afghan resistance with weapons and supplies to allow them to mount an effective campaign during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Hart is a U.S. Martial Arms weapons collector with a \\"passion for weapons and paramilitary tactics,\\" making him a natural choice for the Islamabad post.

As a priest, he was also known as Abb√© Nollet. Biography Nollet studied humanities at the Coll√®ge de Clermont in Beauvais, starting in 1715. He completed a master's degree in the Faculty of Theology at the University of Paris in 1724. He was consecreated as a deacon in the Roman Catholic church in 1728, but abandoned his clerical career in the same year. However he used the title of Abb√© throughout his life. Nollet was particularly interested in the new science of electricity. He joined the Soci√©t√© des Arts in 1728, an association which was reestablished from a previous version which ended in 1723. Formed under the patronage of Comte de Clermont, the Soci√©t√© focused on applying natural philosophy to practical arts. This association gave Nollet the opportunity to come into contact with important natural philosophers. In particular, it is likely that he came into contact with Du Fay and R√©aumur, two leading members of the Royal Academy of Sciences. Nollet assisted them with experiments in a wide variety of topics (e.g., anatomy of insects, fertilization of frogs, thermometry, pneumatics, phosphorescence, magnetism, and electricity) from about 1731 to 1735. In the period from 1731 to 1733, Nollet assisted Du Fay, especially with electrical experiments, and travelled with du Fay in 1734 to meet physicists in England and in 1736 to the Netherlands. He was a member of the Royal Society of London from 1734. He is reputed to have given the name to the Leyden jar after it was invented by Pieter van Musschenbroek. To finance his own experimental instruments, Nollet started building and selling duplicate instruments in 1735. From at least 1743, the Royal Academy of Sciences identified Nollet as the person who was particularly in charge of research about electricity. In 1753 he became the first professor of experimental physics in France, at the coll√®ge de Navarre, University of Paris. In 1762, he was named director of the Royal Academy of Sciences. Nollet held lectures aimed to popularise physics with the use of instruments. These lectures, collected together and published as Le√ßons de physique exp√©rimentale and L‚ÄôArt des exp√©riences, continued to inspire self- taught scientists through the 19th century. Scientific work The Electric Boy, Essai sur l'electricit√© des corps, 1746 Effects of electricity on living organisms and electrospray, Recherches sur les causes particuli√®res des ph√©nom√®nes √©lectriques,, 1749 (Wellcome L0007028) One of many experimental demonstrations of static electricity which he carried out was the \\"Electric boy\\", in which a young man was suspended from the ceiling using insulating silk cords, and electrified, causing his body to accumulate charge. Objects were attracted to him, and close proximity of another person could lead to sparks. In 1746 Nollet gathered about two hundred monks into a circle about a mile (1.6 km) in circumference, with pieces of iron wire connecting them. He then discharged a battery of Leyden jars through the human chain and observed that each man reacted at substantially the same time to the electric shock, showing that the speed of electricity's propagation was very high. In 1748 he discovered the phenomenon of osmosis in natural membranes. In the same year, he also invented an electroscope. In 1750 Nollet was the first to report a phenomenon that is known today as electrostatic spraying. He noted that water flowing from a vessel would aerosolize if the vessel was electrified and placed near electrical ground. He also noted that similarly ‚Äúa person, electrified by connection to a high-voltage generator, would not bleed normally if he were to cut himself; blood would spray from the wound.‚Äù Writings * 1735: Cours de physique exp√©rimentale Paris. * 1743-1764: Le√ßons de physique exp√©rimentale (6 vols.).

It was a single track, narrow gauge railway and was slightly over long running through the rugged and picturesque area bordering Exmoor in North Devon, England. Although opened after the 1896 Light Railways Act came into force, it was authorised and constructed prior to that act. Therefore, as with all other railways, it was authorised under its own Act of Parliament and built to higher (and more costly) standards than similar railways of the time. In the United Kingdom it was notable as being the only narrow gauge line required to use main-line standard signalling. For a short period the line earned a modest return for shareholders, but for most of its life the L&B; made a loss.G A Brown, J D C A Prideaux, & H G Radcliffe: The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway published by David and Charles, First Edition 1964, In 1923 the L&B; was taken over by the Southern Railway, and eventually closed in September 1935. The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway Association was formed in 1979; and a short section was reopened to passengers in 2004. This was extended in 2006; and the following year plans were announced to open of track, linking the station at Woody Bay to both Lynton (at a new terminus on an extension to the original line, closer to the town) and Blackmoor Gate, and to a new station at Wistlandpound Reservoir. The present track is now narrow gauge. History Extract from an early contemporary map showing the route From up on Exmoor, looking towards the hilltops, and beyond, the sea... Following the opening of the Devon and Somerset Railway to Barnstaple, there were calls for an extension to serve the twin villages of Lynton and Lynmouth,L T Catchpole: The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway 1895‚Äì1935 published by The Oakwood Press. Eighth edition 2005. . which were popular with holiday- makers. Through the middle of the 19th century, several schemes were proposed, from established railway companies and independent developers. One scheme suggested electric power, while another proposed a line from South Molton. None of these schemes offered sufficient prospects to encourage investment, and few got further than initial plans. Due to the difficult terrain, one scheme suggested a narrow gauge, already in use by the and elsewhere, to ease construction. This scheme was supported by Sir George Newnes, publisher of Titbits and The Strand Magazine who became chairman of the company. The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway Bill was passed on 27 June 1895, and the line opened on 11 May 1898 with public service commencing on 16 May, connecting with trains from Waterloo on the Ilfracombe Branch Line at Barnstaple Town. The scheme did not meet with universal enthusiasm, and from the beginning, there were some who doubted the true intentions of the promoters. Although many of the sinuous curves and deviations were due to having to maintain a 1 in 50 gradient where there was no leeway (most observers being oblivious to the fact that a straighter shorter line would have made the gradient even steeper), several were due to resistance by local landowners along the route. A guide published whilst the line was being built stated: The L&B seldom attracted sufficient passengers to remain viable. The journey of nearly took on average an hour and a half. To satisfy several influential residents, the terminus at Lynton was some distance from the town itself, and from the cliff railway to Lynmouth. Declining tourism during the First World War, improved roads, increased car ownership further depleted the line's income until it was no longer economic. A guidebook published in 1921 described the situation: Despite numerous cost- saving measures and extra investment in the line, the Southern Railway was unable to reverse the trend, and closed the line. The last train ran on 29 September 1935. An observer at the time wrote: The Southern removed everything they could use elsewhere, and by 8 November, had lifted the track from Lynton to milepost 15‚Öì ‚Äì on the Barnstaple side of Woody Bay station. On 13 November an auction was held, although the railway failed to attract much interest. Most rolling stock, and every locomotive except for Lew, was scrapped at Pilton. Some coaches were sectioned for use as garden sheds. Third class seats became garden furniture, and first class seats found their way into local snooker halls and Masonic lodges. In December, Plymouth ship breaker Sidney Castle won the tender to dismantle the railway. The remaining track was lifted by June 1936, and in September, surviving locomotive Lew was shipped to Brazil. The stations and track bed were auctioned in 1938. The L&B; had an exemplary safety record, and no members of the public were killed or injured during its 37-year existence, although accidents at Braunton Road and Chumhill did claim the lives of three track workers.Thomas Middlemass, Encyclopaedia of Narrow Gauge Railways of Great Britain and Ireland, Guild Publishing, 1991, page 209. Route The route of this diminutive railway and the scenery through which it passes, has been described many times, such as in a 1920s guide to the area: ( *Note: Wooda Bay station was actually renamed Woody Bay in 1901. The geographical feature Woody Bay after which the station was named was the subject of an attempt to develop it as a tourist resort to rival Lynmouth; a pier was even constructed. The developers felt that the spelling \\"Woody\\" was more attractive to tourists, and so changed it from the original \\"Wooda\\"; the station name was changed accordingly.) As well as several foot- and cycle-routes which can still be followed today, the hostelry in Parracombe mentioned in the article remains a popular venue (although the geese are now singular). = Gradient profile = The L&B; rises and falls several times along its length. Starting at above sea level, The first , through Barnstaple, and along the Yeo Valley stays relatively level. Collard Bridge marks the start of an climb, mainly at one in fifty, to Blackmoor Gate. A shallower down-gradient follows, of about , towards Parracombe Bank, and the start of another climb, of about , to Woody Bay ‚Äì at , the highest railway station in southern England. The line then falls, again mostly at one in fifty (2%) ‚Äì to Lynton & Lynmouth station, still above the sea, and hidden by the landscape from the town of Lynton. The minimum radius on curves was . Rolling stock Ffestiniog coach No. 14 (ex-L&B; No. 15) (centre) at Coach 7 at Woody Bay, 2005 Van 23 in the loading bay, Woody Bay, 2005 One of the most distinctive aspects of the L&B; was its rolling stock, with the locomotives appearing originally in a livery of plain lined Holly green, later on a black base, with chestnut under-frames, hauling passenger carriages coloured terracotta with off-white upper panels, and light grey goods wagons. The schemes were simplified as individual vehicles were repainted. With the take over by the Southern and arrival of Lew the livery was slowly changed to Maunsell Green for locos and passenger stock, and umber for the goods wagons. The loco headlamps which had been black under the L&B; were re-painted red. =Locomotives= At least four contractors' locomotives were used for construction. Unusually, some of the temporary track was wider than the final gauge ‚Äì the section around Parracombe Bank for example, spanning the Heddon valley, was built to gauge, with a locomotive known as Winnie. A fifth locomotive ‚Äì perhaps named Spondon ‚Äì may also have been used, although little is known of either of these. In 1900, Kilmarnock was sold by the L&B.; It is believed to have been left behind by James Nuttall, as a result of the financial problems and litigation between railway and contractor. The L&B; used only coal-fired steam motive power. In 1896, the Hunslet Engine Company submitted two designs (a and a ), but eventually an order was placed for three s from Manning Wardle & Co of Leeds. The locos were named after local rivers: Yeo, Exe, and Taw. These were supplemented by a , Lyn, built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, USA, as the Company realised that three locos would be insufficient. Baldwin was selected as they could deliver the loco ‚Äì based largely on standard components ‚Äì more quickly than domestic suppliers,Thomas Middlemass, Encyclopaedia of Narrow Gauge Railways of Great Britain and Ireland, Guild Publishing, 1991, page 212. who had a backlog of orders, caused by a national engineering dispute over the 8 hour working day resulting in a lock-out by employers from July 1897 and January 1898. After construction by Baldwin, the loco was shipped across the Atlantic in parts, and re-assembled at Pilton by railway staff. It first steamed in July 1898. The Manning Wardles were delivered ahead of the lock-out, and Yeo and Taw were used in the final stages of construction. Exe was stored locally in a stable, where she received the unwelcome attention of thieves who stole various brass fittings and fixtures. In 1923 the L&B; was absorbed into the Southern Railway, and began an upgrade programme. All locos & coaches were repainted in Southern Maunsell Green livery, the wagons were repainted in Southern Umber livery and track and buildings were improved. A fifth locomotive, Lew was purchased in 1925, with improvements to the original Manning Wardle design. Fate of Lew Although bought at the auction (it is believed by Barwicks of London) by December 1935, Lew was working for Sidney Castle, the dismantler of the railway. This work was completed by July 1936 and in September, Lew was moved by rail to Swansea and loaded onto the S.S. Sabor destined for the port of Pernambuco (since renamed Recife), Brazil. Most of the relevant shipping records were destroyed in World War II, Lew then vanished from history and despite several attempts, no trace of the locomotive, or evidence of its fate, has so far been found. =Passenger stock= Sixteen passenger carriages were delivered for the opening. Built by the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works Co. Ltd., these comprised six different types, all the same size, being long, wide, ( over steps) and high ‚Äì large by narrow gauge standards ‚Äì and certainly superior to any previous British narrow gauge stock. The coaching stock was extremely solidly constructed, and offered levels of accommodation far in advance of anything else at the time ‚Äì certainly compared to any other narrow gauge railway. Almost 70 years later, the design was used as the basis for a new rake of carriages built by the Ffestiniog ‚Äì testament to the excellence of the original design. The body for coach 17 was built in 1911, by local firm Shapland and Petter, and mounted on a steel underframe constructed by the railway in its own workshops at Pilton. Marginally longer than the earlier coaches, it contained both smoking and non-smoking accommodation for first and third class passengers, as well as the brake van space. =Goods stock= The Southern Railway introduced several new items of goods stock, and also purchased two ex-War Department travelling cranes for the line. Goods-only trains were a rarity, and the usual practice was to attach goods wagons to any scheduled passenger services. Whilst the shunting of wagons at intermediate stations no doubt added to the interest of the tourist and occasional traveller, it also added marginally to the journey time. The open goods wagons were originally delivered with a single top-hung side door on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted to side hung double doors. By 1907, most had been fitted with tarpaulin rails. The goods vans used the same underframe, and were fitted with double sliding doors on each side. The bogie open doors were also originally top-hung, but converted by the railway at Pilton.G A Brown, J D C A Prideaux, & H G Radcliffe: The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway published by the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Trust, Fourth edition, 2006 with additional material by G A Brown & P J M Rawstron. Wagon No. 19 was originally used by the contractors. After the railway opened, it was modified and entered revenue service in 1900. At only it was used often in preference to an wagon as it reduced the overall weight of a train. Van 23 ‚Äì partially restored but now being prepared (2019) for service at Woody Bay ‚Äì was built at Pilton by the L&B.; Unlike all other L&B; stock, its underframe was entirely made of wood. The restored van will have a steel underframe clad in wood. The travelling cranes were ex-WD stock, and fitted with outriggers, rated at with a radius, at . Intended as recovery cranes in the event of a derailment, neither saw much use. One crane, with its match truck, was kept in the long headshunt at Pilton, the other was put to use in Lynton goods yard. The 1927 bogie goods vans were originally fitted with heavy diagonal wooden cross braces at each end, but these were later replaced with single diagonal angle-iron braces. Present Eighty-five years after its closure, much of the line is still in evidence. The most spectacular evidence is Bridge 22 ‚Äì the brick-built Chelfham Viaduct. Fully restored in 2000, its eight wide arches reach above the Stoke Rivers valley ‚Äì the largest narrow-gauge railway structure in England.The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway Magazine published by The L&BR; Trust. Various editions The station at Lynton is now private residences, Blackmoor Gate is a restaurant and Barnstaple Town a school. Chelfham and Woody Bay both serve the new L&B.; Chelfham station is currently being restored, and open to visitors every weekend, while Woody Bay is the main centre of operations. Snapper Halt was purchased in 2010 and Bratton Fleming in 2020 by Exmoor Associates ‚Äì a private company dedicated to securing trackbed for the restoration of the railway. A short section of the line reopened to passengers in 2004. Bridge 67 was generously rebuilt as a gift by Edmund Nuttall Ltd. ‚Äì a firm descended from James Nuttall of Manchester, the main contractors for the original construction ‚Äì allowing an extension to Killington Lane in 2006. Work is progressing on the next section to be restored, towards Parracombe, Blackmoor and a new temporary Southern terminus at Wistlandpound Reservoir. A total of 7 planning applications were submitted to Exmoor National Park Authority and North Devon CouncilNDC Planning Applications, February 2016 (retrieved 18 May 2016) NDC Planning Applications, February 2016 (retrieved 18 May 2016) in February 2016, with approvals granted by March 2018. Restoration of Bridges 54 and 55 was completed in December 2019. In November 2015 the Lynton & Barnstaple signed a twinning agreement with the Walhalla Goldfields Railway in Victoria, Australia. This agreement came about due to the similar nature of the railways and to foster cooperation and volunteer exchanges. Like the L&B;, the Moe- Walhalla railway was closed over 70 years ago and the work of restoration requires rebuilding the track bed and railway infrastructure. =Restoration= Laying track, Woody Bay, 2003 Hand shunting, Woody Bay, 2003 Unlike the Welsh Highland Railway, the track bed was sold off piecemeal ‚Äì often reverting to the original owners, paying much less than they had sold it for originally. Although there has been minor development on parts of the route, and Wistlandpound Reservoir has flooded the track bed close to its midpoint, much is still in open countryside, with many sections identifiable. The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway Association (since 2000, a charitable trust) was formed in 1979. Woody Bay Station was purchased by the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Company in 1995 and, after much effort, a short section of railway reopened to passengers in 2004. This was extended to over a mile in 2006, with steam and diesel-hauled trains running between Woody Bay and the new, temporary terminus at Killington Lane. In 1995, the Lynbarn Railway ‚Äì at the Milky Way, a theme park near Clovelly, was created and operated by L&B; volunteers. Profits from this funded the purchase, restoration and reopening of Woody Bay. The Lynbarn was handed over to the park in 2005, once Woody Bay had become established, and continues to operate as part of the attraction. Little original rolling stock survives, but as well as the heritage coaches mentioned below, the largely restored Van 23 was on display at Woody Bay until being removed to the L&B; restoration team in Essex in November 2013, for refurbishment and the fitting of brakes, underframe and couplers. The remains of several other coaches and Goods Van 4 are in storage awaiting reconstruction. Coach 2, used as a summer house, is on display (unrestored) at the National Railway Museum York along with the nameplates of the original locomotives. Coach 15, recovered from Snapper Halt in 1959 and restored by the Ffestiniog Railway in North Wales, has been running there (now as FR Coach 14) for longer than it did on the L&B.; Due to the Ffestiniog's smaller loading gauge, the roof profile was altered so it can pass through Garnedd tunnel. In September 2010, Coach 15 visited the L&B; with the Lew replica loco, Lyd. A 1915 Kerr Stuart \\"Joffre\\" class 0-6-0T loco was bought in 1983, and named Axe. Restored to working order in 2008, Axe worked most passenger trains at Woody Bay until December 2013. An 0-4-0WT Maffei named Sid, owned by several L&B; members, was also used on the L&B; steam service until the end of 2013, when it was sold off to a railway museum line in Sweden. To replace \\"Sid\\", another privately owned loco, \\"Isaac\\" ‚Äì a Bagnall 0-4-2T, No. 3023, built in 1953 for use in a South African Platinum mine ‚Äì arrived at Woody Bay from Boston Lodge in December 2013, principally for use hauling the restored original L&B; heritage coaches. The Trust owns three industrial diesel locomotives, one of which Pilton, can be used as backup for Axe and Isaac, and another, Heddon Hall, is often used for maintenance trains. A number of other visiting diesel and steam locomotives have also seen service on the line. Heritage coaches Sixteen coaches were originally built for the L&B; in 1898, and another was built by the railway in 1911. Although most were broken up when the railway closed, several parts have survived, and have been retrieved and stored by the railway preservationists. Following a ten-year restoration, Coaches 7 and 17 returned to Woody Bay on 15 April 2013, to re-enter passenger-carrying service on 10 May 2013 after an absence of 78 years. Coach 16 followed in September 2013, and Coach 11 returned in April 2015. Coach 5 returned to service after restoration in August 2019, with Coach 1 the next to be restored. The initial rake of three heritage coaches, after an inaugural service over the Autumn Gala weekend in September 2013, entered regular service ‚Äì hauled by \\"Isaac\\" ‚Äì for the Santa Specials in December 2014. Modern replicas =Lyd= Lyd inside the Ffestiniog Railway's Boston Lodge Workshops, 2009 A Lynton and Barnstaple Manning Wardle type replica, named Lyd, is operational on the Ffestiniog Railway in North Wales. Lyd at Porthmadog Harbour Station First Steamed in Spring 2010, Lyd visited Woody Bay in September 2010 ‚Äì to mark the 75th Anniversary of the closure of the L&B.; Lyd first moved under its own steam on 5 August 2010 and then underwent running-in trials before visiting the L&B in September 2010 with former L&B coach 15 and Ffestiniog Railway observation car 102. =Lyn= A modern version of the Baldwin, Lyn ‚Äì looking externally similar to the 1898 original, but employing several advanced steam technologies, including roller bearings, welded tanks, Lempor exhaust system,Design details (Retrieved 15 July 2017) and a high-pressure boiler ‚Äì was completed in 2017. Its first public steaming took place on 8 July 2017 at Alan Keef Ltd. Lyn was delivered to Woody Bay on 11 September 2017, and first ran there on 28 September. =Yeo and Exe= A set of frames for a new Yeo were built by Winson Engineering in 2000, and these are in storage, awaiting further funds to continue the construction. A new fundraising campaign was launched in 2019 to build replicas of both Yeo and Exe, but it is unclear yet whether the Winson frames can be used for the new Yeo. Prospects Lyn (2017 replica) with a train near Woody Bay. Restoring passenger services from Woody Bay was a major undertaking by the enthusiastic volunteers. Although much of the track bed survives intact, several obstacles ‚Äì including Wistlandpound Reservoir ‚Äì must be overcome if the greater part of the route is to be restored, fulfilling the hopes expressed in a card left at Barnstaple on the day after the line closed ‚Äì Perchance it is not dead, but sleepeth...JDCA Prideaux, The Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Remembered, David and Charles, 1989, p96. In October 2007, the railway announced plans for reinstating enough trackbed to reopen of track, linking the station at Woody Bay to both Lynton (at a new terminus on an extension to the original line, closer to the town) and a new station at Wistlandpound. It is hoped that the extension, codenamed 'Phase 2a', will be complete by 2026. Exmoor Enterprise, the working group leading the project, estimated that the full project being considered was likely to cost around ¬£30 million, including the building of replica rolling stock, reconstructing original coaches and Van 4, as well as improving the line as an important local tourist attraction. The railway's management predicts the scheme will generate over ¬£70 million for the south west economy within five years.North Devon Gazette, 3 October 2007 (Retrieved 16 October 2007) Working closely with international engineering and design consultants Arup, The L&B; Trust held a series of public consultations during May and June 2012, providing information to local communities about plans for obtaining a TWO, and the next phase of the reinstatement, south-west from Killington Lane to Blackmoor, then Wistlandpound, and north-east to Caffyns, and eventually to Lynton. Longer- term plans foresee the reopening of the line towards Barnstaple.

The temple was founded in 1876.American Jewish Year Book, Jewish Publication Society of America, Published by American Jewish Committee, 1907, p. 150 Beth-El is a member of the Union for Reform Judaism, and has led the congregation in Reform Judaism services since the temple's foundation. The current rabbi is Joel Fleekop. History The first Jews who migrated to northwest Florida originally stopped at Milton, twenty miles to the east,Temple Beth-El history because Milton was a national hub for lumber production and distribution in the South (the first Jews to the area were skilled in lumber production; they came from heavily wooded areas in what is now southern Germany). Sensing more business opportunities to the west, a congregation settled in Pensacola and founded a Reform temple after forming in 1876. Many of the lumber workers in Milton did not follow the congregation, and eventually started a smaller Jewish community in Okaloosa County when lumber opportunities dried up. The male members of Beth-El's first congregation consisted largely of businessmen and tavern owners. The Temple's placard, with the name in Hebrew script below. Temple Beth-El is now in its third building, still in its same spot on 800 North Palafox Street. The current building, designed in the 1930s, is an example of Art Deco architecture, which was prominent in Florida at the time. Today, many members of the current congregation are descendants of the men who founded the temple over 125 years ago. Immigrants from Eastern Europe, Israel, and the Caucasus eventually settled in Pensacola and became part of the congregation as well. Beth-El is unique today in that a large number of the congregation consists of Jews who converted from other faiths. Starting in 1962, Paula Ackerman, the first woman to perform rabbinical functions in the United States, served the congregation at Beth-El. A Pensacola native, Beth-El was Mrs. Ackerman's home temple and she was asked to fill in until a suitable replacement was found in 1963.

McNeil was educated at Woodside School and the University of Glasgow, trained as an engineer and worked as a journalist on a Scottish national newspaper. He was a member of Glasgow Town Council from 1932 to 1938. He chaired Glasgow Trades Council and stood for Parliament unsuccessfully in Galloway in 1929 and 1931, in Glasgow Kelvingrove in 1935 and in Ross and Cromarty in 1936. He was elected Member of Parliament for Greenock unopposed in a wartime by-election in 1941. Following the 1945 election, McNeil became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He was promoted to Minister of State at the Foreign Office in October 1946, de facto deputy to the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, and appointed a member of the Privy Council. Through his position at the Foreign Office, he was vice-president of the United Nations General Assembly in 1947 and leader of the British delegation to the Economic Commission for Europe, 1948. It was later revealed that his personal assistant and private secretary at the time, Guy Burgess, was a Soviet agent, although McNeil never came under suspicion. He served as Secretary of State for Scotland from February 1950 until October 1951 in the government of Clement Attlee. McNeil died shortly after keeping his seat in the 1955 election. Hector McNeil Memorial Baths The Hector McNeil Memorial Baths was a swimming pool in the town of Greenock named in honour of McNeil. The foundation stone was laid by McNeil's wife on 9 October 1963. The baths were demolished in 2002 after the Greenock Waterfront Leisure Centre opened. Hector McNeil House In May 2014 Inverclyde Council approved the name Hector McNeil House for the former library building in Clyde Square, Greenock when it re-opens as the main offices for Community Health and Care Partnership services in August 2014.

He joined London Wasps at the age of 16 from Welwyn RFC. He went on to help Wasps win the Anglo-Welsh Cup in 1999 and 2000. He became the youngest player to represent England U21s, after being a member of the England Schools 18 Group Grand Slam team in 1994‚Äì95. Amongst his trophies at Wasps were four Premiership titles in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008. Worsley played in all four finals, scoring a try in 2003. He also played in the victorious 2004 and 2007 Heineken Cup finals. Worsley is noted for his defensive capabilities against opposing ball-carriers. His ability to play any of the three back row positions earned him a place in the England World Cup Squad in 1999 as a bench replacement. He won his first cap against Tonga at the World Cup, then came on as a replacement against both Scotland and Italy during England's Six Nations Championship matches in 2000. He won two more caps as a replacement in that summer's Tests against South Africa in Pretoria and Bloemfontein. He enjoyed a successful tour to North America in the summer of 2001, filling Lawrence Dallaglio‚Äôs number 8 position and scoring against both Canada and the United States. He continued in the back row for England's 2001 Investec Challenge matches, when he turned in two outstanding performances against Australia and South Africa. He also replaced Richard Hill in both of England's 2003 tour matches against New Zealand and Australia. His 2002‚Äì03 season started well, and Worsley won the Man of The Match award against Saracens in September. However, a hamstring injury, forced him out of the England Autumn Internationals and six weeks of the Zurich Premiership. He scored England's second try in their win over Wales at Cardiff in 2003, just eight days after scoring against France A for England A at Northampton, and being voted man of the match. Worsley was a member of England's victorious Rugby World Cup squad in 2003, coming on during the pool match against South Africa and starting against both Samoa and Uruguay. In 2004 he played against Italy, Ireland and France in the Six Nations Championship, as well as coming off the bench against Wales to score a match winning try. Worsley played powerfully against both South Africa and Australia in November 2004. He started in the back row, now an automatic choice after former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio retired from England duty two months earlier. He was a member of the London Wasps side that won both the Zurich Premiership final and the Heineken European Cup Final in 2004 and he played well on the summer tour to New Zealand and Australia. He missed out on England's entire 2005 Autumn test series due to a knee injury but regained full fitness in time for the 2006 Six nations championship. Worsley participated in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He made a \\"try-saving tap-tackle\\" which prevented Vincent Clerc of France from scoring a probable match-winning try late in the semi-final (13 October). Worsley toured New Zealand in June 2008, coming on as a substitute in both Tests, and was named as a replacement for Tom Rees in the shadow of the 2009 Six Nations, and began as a replacement against Italy. He then restarted his international career, starting in front of Steffon Armitage against Wales, and proving his worth, earning man of the match. He played on the Lions 2009 tour of South Africa in front of any other English flankers other than Tom Croft. On 1 August 2011 it was announced that Worsley had been cut from England's training squad due to injury and would probably miss the 2011 Rugby World Cup. On 14 November 2011 it was announced that Worsley would be forced to retire due to a neck injury. Worsley is now defence coach of French top 14 team Bordeaux B√®gles. Charitable work He is an Honorary President of the rugby charity Wooden Spoon improving the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in Britain and Ireland. He has also started actively participating in Rugby classes for the Alex Boys academy, helping disadvantaged children learn rugby of which he is a keen advocate.

The show is broadcast 6:30‚Äì10:00am each weekday (originally broadcasting from 6:55‚Äì10:00am between 2004‚Äì2007).  Radio X version  On 21 September 2015, Moyles relaunched the show on Radio X, the rebranded XFM, reviving the show under the same title. The new show incorporates elements of the BBC Radio 1 incarnation of the show, in particular referencing the opening \\"Cheesy Song\\" at the start of the show before reverting to the Radio X imaging, Paul Turner providing prerecorded voice over, and Richard Oliver singing the show's jingle. In February 2016 RAJAR published the first listener figures for the Radio X show. However these figures were only for FM listeners in London. Moyles provided a 39% boost in listeners for Radio X and gave the station its best breakfast show figures in London in almost a decade. = Format = The Chris Moyles Show's rebrand on Radio X consisted largely of the same format used in the Radio 1 version. The \\"Cheesy Song\\" and similar jingles were replaced by a more distinguished rock- led sound. Dominic Byrne returned for news, sport and weather. Similarly Pippa Taylor, also previously at Radio 1, returned as producer joining previous XFM Breakfast Show producer Dave Masterman. = Features = *Rob DJ's Monday Night Pub Quiz - The only regular feature to be carried over from the former Radio 1 incarnation, this is still played on each Tuesday's show. Rob DJ remains the host, with Pippa asking the questions and providing answers. *Pippa's Weekend Round-Up Quiz Type Thing - Played every Monday since January 2019, this is a not-so-serious quiz of three stories that went viral over the previous weekend. *Reverse Words - Audio Producer Matt Parkes-Smith records a phrase which is then played backwards. The team have to imitate the reversed phrase, recordings of which are also reversed (so that the phrase is now played \\"forwards\\") and see how close they can get to the original. *Letters - Dominic Byrne reads out letters sent into the show by listeners, often accompanied by parcels of snacks and other items sent to the team. The address is then sung as a jingle, with many different versions featuring people such as Video Producer Alfie, David Hasselhoff, Taron Egerton, Jon Culshaw (as Donald Trump) and Wynne Evans (the GoCompare man). *WhatsApp Messages - Since 2019 the show has allowed listeners to send in audio messages via WhatsApp. These are then compiled and the best ones played out on the show. *Happy Endings - Chris and Dom (sometimes Audio Producer Matt) compete head-to-head to identify a song from the final few seconds of the track. Themed versions are often played, such as a \\"Weather\\" or \\"Wimbledon\\" edition. * The Platinum Hour - The first Platinum Hour was played on Friday 25 September 2015. Excluding the news, sport, weather and advertising as much of the hour was filled with Chris Moyles' favorite songs from the Radio X archives. * Wheel of Inappropriate tracks - in this feature, created on the Radio X Chris Moyles Show, Moyles and the team would choose seven inappropriate songs to then spin on a wheel and whichever it may land on, must play. This would then usually upset Mike, the head of music at Radio X. This feature usually takes place every show either between 7.45 and 8.15 am or between 9.45 and 10 am. =Team members= * Chris Moyles - host (2015-present) * Dominic Byrne - newsreader and regular contributor (2015-present) * Pippa Taylor - executive producer/producer and regular contributor (2015-present) * Matt Parkes-Smith - audio producer and regular contributor (2015-present) * Alfie Butler - video producer and contributor (2016-2019) *James Robinson - producer and regular contributor (2017-present) *Toby Tarrant - Radio X DJ, regular cover presenter and regular contributor (2017-present) *Karl Russell - video producer and contributor (2015-2016) *Dave Masterman - producer/day producer and regular contributor (2015-2017) = Stand-in presenters = Johnny Vaughan initially covered the programme when Moyles and the team were absent and presented the programme under the title The 6.30 till 10 Thang - a variation on his normal 4 till 7 Thang drive-time slot. Vaughan used most of his own features from his afternoon slot and would be joined on air by his usual team of Gavin Woodman, Sunta Templeton, Big Si and Little Si. As of 2019, Toby Tarrant typically covers Moyles and the team, keeping with the normal format of the show.  Radio 1 version  At eight years, The Chris Moyles Show did continue to hold the title of the longest running breakfast show in BBC Radio 1's history, having overtaken original Radio 1 breakfast show presenter Tony Blackburn's tenure of five years between 1967 and 1973. =Format= The original BBC Radio 1 show lasted for three and a half hours, with news and sport read half- hourly between 06:30 and 10:00, except at 09:00. Starting on 1 January 2007, the show began with the \\"Cheesy Song\\", an opening song performed by session singer Richard Oliver in the style of the \\"Station Song\\" jingles which were commonly used in radio before the advent of 24-hour broadcasting. Starting on 5 January 2009, the song had its own day, for example, if it was Wednesday, it would go \\"the Wednesday Cheesy Song\\" repeatedly. A typical half-hour segment contained fifteen to twenty minutes of chat, discussing the team members' lives, Radio 1's features, music or popular culture. There were regular celebrity guest interviews usually between 08:00 and 09:00, with the occasional live music performance and frequent first exclusive plays of new single releases. At 10:00, when Fearne Cotton took over (who took over the slot previously occupied by Jo Whiley from 21 September 2009) Moyles and the team would typically talk to Cotton for the first few minutes. The show relied in a variation of the \\"zoo\\" format, with members of the production team, news and sport readers and other studio guests contributing throughout the show. = Features = *Dave's Tedious Link - This feature was carried forward from Moyles' afternoon show and was a parody of Tenuous Link a feature Jo Whiley used in her show. Each day the feature would include a well known song. Comedy Dave would start with the Tedious Link song from the previous show and then lead to the next with a deliberately ramshackle and vague succession of linking 'facts', some real and some ludicrous. The style was an extreme parody of 'bloke down the pub' logic. After the song, any of the real facts contested by the team or listeners were debated while Dave explained and defended his logic. It appeared at 9 o'clock on the Monday to Thursday shows, making way for the Golden Hour on Fridays. *The Golden Hour - A well-established feature, previously on various Radio 1 Breakfast Shows from 1973 to 2001. For the first half, records were played that all charted in the UK Singles Chart in a certain year and listeners were invited to guess the year. The second half contained random songs chosen by each member of the team in turn, time permitting. After a hiatus, the feature returned for a one-off on Friday 22 July 2005 during the \\"Summer Friday Thing\\" strand, on a show broadcast live from a canal boat, and then as part of Radio 1's 40th birthday celebrations in 2007. After which it appeared in the final hour of each Friday's show. The final Golden Hour was played on Friday 7 September 2012. *Buzz Off - This feature took place every morning at 7:20 from the first breakfast show in 2004. The feature consisted of Chris playing a song from his personal CD collection, and three members of the team (usually Dave, Aled and Rachel) would 'Buzz Off' when they wanted the song turning off. Audience participation consisted of a fourth vote, with the vote being 'Buzz Off' if less than 50% of the audience voted in favour of keeping the song on. The song would normally be turned off when all three team members and the audience had all 'buzzed off', although Chris often ignored the votes if it was a song he particularly liked, or if he disagreed with the votes. The feature was discontinued after the final show of 2004. *Rob DJ's Monday Night Pub Quiz - The team played a 5-question pub quiz against each other. The questions were taken from a real pub quiz run the previous evening by one of Moyles' friends, Rob DJ, in their mutual home town of Leeds. Running totals of each team member's recent scores were kept and analysed. Since 2007, the quiz became an interactive feature, with listeners able to play along via SMS and more recently through Facebook and Twitter. A basic rule of the quiz was that the only answer taken as correct is that given by Rob DJ, regardless of its accuracy or clarity. However, inaccuracies or any vagueness in Rob DJ's answers were usually vigorously debated amongst the team, with Moyles usually bearing down for the answer to be taken in his favour. Chris Moyles won the pub quiz in both 2007.The Chris Moyles Show - Radio 1‚Äì6 December 2008 and 2008.The Chris Moyles Show - Radio 1‚Äì16 December 2008 This feature appeared in Tuesday shows, sometime between 7:45 and 8:15. *Guess Who - a Twenty Questions-style game amongst the team in which they try to guess the name of a celebrity spotted by one of them. Questions are supposed to be answered 'yes' or 'no' only but more is often given away, usually to stop the process hitting a dead end. *McFly Day - Every Friday (from 22 January 2010) Moyles played \\"Star Girl\\" by the band McFly in the McFly day feature. On 10 September 2010 the band surprised Moyles and the team performing a live version of the McFly Day Star Girl at Maida Vale. On the last airing of the show, McFly prepared a tribute song named 'Star Boy'. *Car Park Catchphrase - two listeners in their cars have to guess a catchphrase answer from an anecdote-style clue. The first to beep their car horn gets a chance to give their answer but a wrong answer will get them frozen out and leave their opponent to guess while more of the clue is revealed. The feature is 'hosted' by voice samples of the Northern Irish comedian and original Catchphrase presenter, Roy Walker. Simple and reasonably-obvious catchphrases are chosen and the anecdotal clue often involves the fictional character Mr Fish, a reference to Mr Chips from the original game show. The game is played as a best-of-3 knockout and the prize is the chance to compete again when the feature returns (though this was usually ignored if the contestants were entertaining enough, usually with Moyles wiping points off), usually in the next show. Car Park Catchphrase was played with for the last and final time between Andi Peters and Alan Carr with Peters becoming champion on Wednesday 12 September 2012. *Cheggers' Pop Quiz - a play on 1970s television show Cheggers Plays Pop. Within it, Moyles asked two callers questions related to pop music and popular culture. The winning caller (the contestant who had answered the most questions correctly) returned the following day in a 'winner stays on' format. On 29 July 2009, Moyles announced that it would be the last edition. *Face Your Fears - a week-long feature (end of June/early July 2011) that involved team members facing their various phobias. Monday began with the feature being introduced by fellow BBC Radio 1 host Fearne Cotton. Tuesday had Tina Daheley facing her Acrophobia by climbing aboard a cherry picker to travel to the BBC Radio 1 buildings roof. Wednesday saw Comedy Dave face Claustrophobia by climbing through a \\"tunnel\\". Thursday saw Moyles (and latterly Comedy Dave) fight Cynophobia with a police dog attack. Friday saw Aled Jones facing his arachnophobia by holding a spider and Dominic Byrne facing his pteromechanophobia by going out on a plane. He was meant to jump out of it, but he couldn't do it. *Celebrity Raspberry - in this, a single phone contestant had one guess at the secret identity of the celebrity recorded blowing a raspberry. The competition continued over successive shows until someone gets the correct answer. The winner was awarded with a mug featuring a team member of their choice. *Westwood's Where am I? - a daily feature in which a pre-recorded Tim Westwood was 'in' a certain location and the team had to guess, through a series of clues, where he claimed he was. The feature was the source of much amusement due to Westwood's inability to pronounce many words and place names, most notably Rio de Janeiro. *Duck Register - in this feature, Moyles and Vitty read out names of listeners who sent in their name via text message in time to the song \\"Barbra Streisand\\" by Duck Sauce. The feature debuted on 27 September 2010.The Chris Moyles Show - Radio 1‚Äì27 September 2010 Numerous other features of past shows include \\"Celebrity Tarzan\\", \\"Celebrity Two Word Tango\\", \\"Who Knows Dom?\\", \\"One Word Weather with Nelson Mandela\\", \\"One Road Travel\\", \\"Yesterday's Weather\\", \\"Truth or Gunge\\", \\"Listen, Watch, Cher\\", \\"Let's get ready to Ramble!\\" and \\"Birthday Corner\\". Other former regular competitions hosted included Viaduct (named by Simon Mayo when asked for a suggestion about what to call the quiz when Moyles stood in for Zo√´ Ball on the breakfast show). It was based on a Two Ronnies sketch (in turn based on Mastermind, with a specialist subject of \\"answering the question before the last\\"). =Guests= =Team members= The team members of The Chris Moyles Show on Radio 1 were: *Chris Moyles - host (2004-2012) *Dominic Byrne - newsreader and regular contributor (2004-2012) *Pippa Taylor - executive producer/producer and regular contributor (2012) *\\"Comedy Dave\\" Vitty - so-called \\"Director of Comedy\\" (2004-2012) *Juliette Ferrington - sports reader (2004) *Carrie Prideaux (n√©e Davis) - sports reader and regular contributor (2004-2010) *Tina Daheley - sports reader and regular contributor (2010-2012) *Rachel Mallender (n√©e Jones) - producer/day producer and regular contributor (2004-2009) *Aled Haydn Jones - producer/day producer and regular contributor (2004-2012) *Will Kinder - day producer (2004-2005) *Samantha Moy - day producer and contributor (2010-2011) *Freya Last (n√©e Mehta) - day producer and contributor (2011-2012) *Jocelin Stainer - assistant producer and regular contributor (2005-2007) *Matt Fincham - assistant producer and regular contributor (2007-2012) =Contributors= As well as the team members, other contributors also regularly featured on the show: *Paul Turner - voiceover artist who records daily voiceovers for the show (2004-2012, 2015-present) *Rob DJ - friend of Moyles, host of feature Rob DJ's Monday Night Pub Quiz *Roy Walker - host of Car Park Catchphrase (2004-2012) *Andi Peters - former children's TV presenter who frequently appears on the show *Keith Chegwin - contributor, host of Cheggers' Pop Quiz (2009) *Jake Humphrey - reported live on the Friday of a Formula One weekend from the track *Ant Danbury - creator and producer of the Best of Chris Moyles free download *Suzanne Kane - Irish DJ and Chris‚Äôs cousin, who regularly contributes to the show, usually over the phone = Stand-in presenters = Scott Mills covered the programme when Moyles and the team were absent, and presented the programme under the title The Chris Moyles Show with Scott Mills.

When only Moyles was away, Vernon Kay or Sara Cox would present in his place, and stay with the usual format of the show. =Radio 1's Longest Show Ever= On 28 February 2011, it was announced that Moyles and David Vitty would attempt to beat the record for the longest continuous Radio 1 show in aid of Comic Relief. The previous record of 37 hours was set by Simon Mayo from 1999. Moyles and Vitty began their record attempt on the morning of 16 March 2011.

He is best known for his stint in World Championship Wrestling in 2001 under the ring name Kid Romeo, where he was one half of the first ever Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions alongside Elix Skipper. Professional wrestling career =World Championship Wrestling (1999-2000, 2001)= Debut and departure After briefly working as a male stripper, Roman started wrestling in 1999 in World Championship Wrestling after being trained by Paul Orndorff at the WCW Power Plant. He debuted later that year at a house show on September 3 under the ring name Kid Romeo, where he defeated Triple A. Two days later, Triple A defeated Romeo in a rematch. After Triple A began using his real name (Allan Funk), the two exchanged victories on Saturday Night before Romeo began wrestling against fellow Power Plant graduates in dark matches through the rest of 1999 and into early 2000. On the January 24, 2000 episode of Nitro, Romeo made his televised debut and was easily defeated by The Wall. Two days later on Thunder, Romeo lost to Prince Iaukea in a Cruiserweight Championship tournament quarterfinal match. After winning a few consecutive dark matches, Roman was sent to Japan to compete in New Japan Pro Wrestling in order to further hone his skills. Return and Cruiserweight Tag Team Champion After losing a match against Essa R√≠os on the February 10, 2001 episode of Jakked, Roman returned to WCW, where he resumed his Kid Romeo name and lost to Chris Harris in a dark match before SuperBrawl Revenge. On the March 5 episode of Nitro, Romeo was introduced as Elix Skipper's mystery tag team partner against A.J. Styles and Air Paris. With Skipper, Romeo won his redebut match and they both advanced to the semi-finals of a tournament to crown the inaugural Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions. Upon returning, Romeo adopted a heel gimmick loosely based on Ricky Martin, which was further emphasized with his entrance music being a cover of Martin's song \\"The Cup of Life\\". The following week on Nitro, Skipper and Romeo defeated The Jung Dragons to advance to the finals of the tournament. On March 18 at Greed, WCW's final pay-per-view, Romeo and Skipper defeated The Filthy Animals (Rey Mysterio, Jr. and Kidman) in the tournament finals to become the promotion's first ever Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions, which also gave Romeo the first championship of his career. Romeo and Skipper began feuding with the Animals over the title, and on the final episode of Thunder on March 21, Romeo and Skipper's undefeated streak was broken as they and Chavo Guerrero, Jr. lost to Mysterio, Jr. Kidman and Shane Helms. On the final episode of Nitro on March 26, their feud culminated as Romeo and Skipper lost the Cruiserweight Tag Team Title to Mysterio, Jr. and Kidman in what turned out to be the second to last match in WCW's history. =Independent circuit, hiatus and retirement (2002‚Äì2005, 2008)= Following WCW's closure, Roman traveled to Puerto Rico to wrestle for the World Wrestling Council. He also made some appearances in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, making his debut there on July 10, 2002 in a six-way elimination match that included Tony Mamaluke, Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper, Jerry Lynn, and Low Ki, although Roman was eliminated after Low Ki forced him to submit. He returned to TNA on May 21 as Romeo, competing in a four-way match against CM Punk, Jason Cross and Paul London, the latter of whom won the match and became the number one contender to the X Division Championship. From 2003 to 2004, Roman would continue to be used as a jobber, losing to the likes of Raven, Jeff Hardy, Kid Kash and Chris Sabin. During his time with TNA, Roman's only victory was a tag team dark match where he and Sonjay Dutt defeated The Naturals. In addition to TNA, Roman also wrestled in Championship Wrestling from Florida for a short time, where he feuded with Tyree Pride. He returned to TNA for the final time on May 17, 2005, where he lost to Zach Gowen. Roman then took a hiatus from wrestling and subsequently began working as an exterminator. In 2008, Roman returned to wrestling as Romeo and joined NWA South Atlantic. On May 10, he teamed with Benny Blanco as the Casanova Cartel to defeat Manson and Black Knight (the latter substituting for Manson's partner Rico Moon) to win the territory's Tag Team Championship. The Cartel would go on to hold the title for over six months before being defeated by the SWAT Patrol on November 15. Following the title loss, Roman retired from wrestling.

Playing career =Club= Ladiƒá was born in ƒåakovec, but grew up in the nearby village of Gornji Hra≈°ƒáan and started his career at NK Varteks in 1977, transferring to the club's senior squad in 1980. He left Varteks for Dinamo Zagreb in 1984, but the club decided to loan him to Iskra Bugojno for two seasons immediately after they signed him. He eventually made his debut for Dinamo in July 1986 and stayed at the club until the end of his playing career nearly 14 years later, collecting a record-holding total of 802 appearances in official matches. During his time at the club, Ladiƒá also played in several matches of both the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup. In 1997, he notably saved a penalty kick in Dinamo Zagreb's home match against Partizan Belgrade in the first qualifying round for the UEFA Champions League, which they won 5‚Äì0. The Dinamo team continued to compete in the UEFA Cup after an unlucky 4-3 defeat on aggregate in the last minute of extra time against Newcastle United in the second qualifying round for the UEFA Champions League and got all the way to the third round, where they lost 2‚Äì1 on aggregate against Atl√©tico Madrid. In the autumn of 1998, Ladiƒá debuted with Dinamo Zagreb in the group stages of the UEFA Champions League and played all six group matches before the club was eliminated from the competition by finishing second in their group, behind Olympiacos. The club repeated the success of qualifying for the UEFA Champions League group stages the following year, with Ladiƒá making four group-stage appearances before being injured in the fourth group match against Sturm Graz and missing the final two matches before the team was eliminated from the competition after finishing last among the four teams in their group, one point behind the third-place Sturm Graz. He soon recovered from the injury and continued to play for Dinamo until the end of the 1999‚Äì2000 season, making his last appearance for the club in the Croatian Cup finals against Hajduk Split on 16 May 2000 in Zagreb. With Dinamo, he won the Croatian First League champions title six times, in 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, as well as four Croatian Cup titles in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998. =International= In early 1990, Ladiƒá was for the first time in his professional career a candidate to play for the national team of former Yugoslavia and was also mentioned to be part of their squad at the 1990 FIFA World Cup finals in Italy, but was eventually omitted from the squad without making his debut for the team that year. He eventually made his international debut for at the time newly founded Croatian national team in their first international match, a friendly against the United States on 17 October 1990 in Zagreb. After winning his first two caps for Croatia, Ladiƒá nevertheless managed to make his international debut for Yugoslavia as well. He appeared in two matches, playing all 90 minutes in a friendly against Turkey on 27 February 1991 in ƒ∞zmir and being the team's substitute goalkeeper in the last 25 minutes of a Euro 1992 qualifier against the Faroe Islands on 16 May 1991 in Belgrade. The match against the Faroes was also the last where Croatian footballers have played for the Yugoslav national team. Ladiƒá went on to become the first- choice goalkeeper of the Croatian national team throughout the 1990s and won a total of 59 international caps before he retired in May 2000. His competitive debut for the Croatian national team came in the team's first qualifying match for the UEFA Euro 1996 against Estonia on 4 September 1994 in Tallinn. He went on to make nine out of possible ten appearances in that qualifying campaign, only missing the team's away match against Ukraine due to a one-match suspension for a red card received in the previous home match against Slovenia. He was also the team's starting goalkeeper at the Euro 1996 finals in England, making three out of possible four appearances and only missing the final group match against Portugal where Croatia started to play with seven players who were normally left on the bench. Croatia was eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinals after losing 2‚Äì1 to Germany. Ladiƒá was also the first-choice goalkeeper during the Croatian national team's qualifying campaign for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and appeared in seven out of possible ten matches, but is mostly remembered from this period for his two blunders that he made during the qualifying campaign. The first happened to him in the team's home match against Denmark, when he conceded a bizarre goal after misjudging the path of Brian Laudrup's cross due to strong wind deflecting the ball and allowing Denmark to get an equaliser in the final ten minutes of the match. The incident saw Croatia losing two possibly crucial points after the match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. The second blunder was when he scored an own goal that put the Bosnia and Herzegovina team 1‚Äì0 up in another Croatia's home match, but the team eventually managed to get all three points with a tough 3‚Äì2 victory. Croatia eventually qualified for the finals after beating Ukraine 3‚Äì1 on aggregate in the play-offs, without Ladiƒá playing in the second leg. Despite Ladiƒá's solid performances for Dinamo Zagreb in the European competition in 1997, his two blunders for the national team were still remembered by many people and made them sceptical when he was chosen as the Croatian national team's starting goalkeeper at the 1998 World Cup finals in France. However, he showed really good shape at the tournament and already distinguished himself in the second group match against Japan with a great save of Masashi Nakayama's shot in a one-on-one situation. He once again attracted the attention in the quarterfinals against Germany by saving a header and a volley from Oliver Bierhoff at close range, helping the Croatian team to record a surprisingly convincing 3‚Äì0 victory over the highly favoured German side. In the semifinals, he was helpless against two Lilian Thuram's goals that gave France a 2‚Äì1 victory and a place in the Final, but once again performed well in the third-place match against the Netherlands, clearing several promising goalscoring chances from the Dutch side and conceding only an unstoppable shot from Boudewijn Zenden for the 1‚Äì1 equaliser. Croatia won the match 2‚Äì1 in the end and was awarded with bronze medals in their very first World Cup appearance since the country's independence. Ladiƒá was seen by many as one of the three best goalkeepers of the tournament. He appeared in all of the team's seven matches. Despite initially announcing his withdrawal from the national team following the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Ladiƒá later continued to play for Croatia in the Euro 2000 qualifying and made seven out of possible eight appearances, eventually ending his international career after the final qualifying match against Yugoslavia on 9 October 1999 and Croatia's failure to qualify for the final tournament. He briefly returned to the Croatian national team for their friendly match against France on 28 May 2000 in Zagreb to make the final appearance of his career, symbolically appearing in the opening ten minutes of the match. As this was his 59th match for the Croatian national team, he played it with an otherwise unusual shirt number 59. Managerial career When Otto Bariƒá took the charge of the Croatia national team in 2002, Ladiƒá was appointed goalkeeping coach in his coaching staff. He left the post following the UEFA Euro 2004 finals in Portugal, along with the rest of the staff, as their contracts expired after the tournament and were not renewed following Croatia's failure to reach the quarter-finals. On 9 August 2006, Ladiƒá was appointed the head coach of the Croatia national under-21 team, replacing Slaven Biliƒá, who was appointed the head coach of the country's senior national team at the time. =Car accident and sacking= In the early morning of 5 September 2010, hours after an under-21 international between Serbia and Croatia, Ladiƒá was involved in a car accident when the Mercedes-Benz E-Class he was driving, collided with a Renault Clio at a Zagreb road intersection. Both cars were damaged beyond repair and three passengers in the Renault sustained serious injuries. Ladiƒá escaped the accident unhurt.\\"Dra≈æen Ladiƒá sudjelovao u te≈°koj prometnoj nesreƒái: Petero ozlijeƒëenih\\" Some eyewitnesses of the accident accused Ladiƒá of a red light violation, which he denied.\\"Svjedoci nesreƒáe tvrde: Pro≈°ao je kroz crveno svjetlo\\" He was removed from his position in January 2011, when the Croatian Football Federation accused him of falsifying insurance documents following the car accident. However, within the federation there were, and still are, others who have been charged of felonies and have not been removed from their positions, sparking corruption claims within the media.\\"Dra≈æen Ladiƒá smijenjen s mjesta izbornika U-21 reprezentacije, verificiran izbor Vlatka Markoviƒáa\\" =Return to Croatia= In March 2018 Ladiƒá joined Croatia's coaching staff under the manager Zlatko Daliƒá, as an assistant coach.Hrvatska A reprezentacija, Retrieved 5 May 2020 Honours =Club= Iskra Bugojno *Yugoslav Second League ‚Äì West (1): 1983‚Äì84 *Mitropa Cup (1): 1985 Dinamo Zagreb *Prva HNL (6): 1992‚Äì93, 1995‚Äì96, 1996‚Äì97, 1997‚Äì98, 1998‚Äì99, 1999‚Äì00 *Croatian Cup (4): 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998 =International= *FIFA World Cup runner-up (1): 2018 *FIFA World Cup third place (1): 1998 =Individual= *Franjo Buƒçar State Award for Sport - 1998 =Orders= *50pxOrder of Danica Hrvatska with face of Franjo Buƒçar ‚Äì 1995 *50px Order of the Croatian Trefoil ‚Äì 1998 References External links  * Category:1963 births Category:Sportspeople from ƒåakovec Category:Living people Category:Croatian footballers Category:Croatia international footballers Category:Yugoslav footballers Category:Yugoslavia international footballers Category:Croatian football managers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Association football goalkeepers who have scored Category:NK Vara≈ædin players Category:GNK Dinamo Zagreb players Category:Yugoslav First League players Category:Croatian First Football League players Category:UEFA Euro 1996 players Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:Dual internationalists (football) ","title":"Dra≈æen Ladiƒá"},{"id":"1925270","text":"Simon Dalton Shaw MBE (born 1 September 1973) is a former English rugby union player who played at lock. He last played for Toulon and played for England. Biography He was born 1 September 1973 in Nairobi, Kenya. At , he is one of the tallest men to have played for England. Shaw has represented England at various levels including students and Under-21s. He played for Bristol at 17. This was despite not taking up the game seriously until he was 16, just after his family had moved to England from Spain. He was educated at Runnymede College, in Madrid and at Godalming College in Surrey. He also played for Cranleigh Rugby Club in his younger years, and often returns to train with the youth teams. Playing style Despite Shaw's hefty size, he was a very skilful and athletic player with good hands and an impressive ability to get around the field. He was also known for being very effective in the maul. Club career Shaw played for Bristol at the age of 17. He joined London Wasps in 1997. Wasps won the Tetley's Bitter Cup in 1999 and retained it the following season with a victory over the Northampton Saints. Playing against Bath in August 2000, Shaw became the only lock in the Premiership to have scored a drop goal. In the 2002‚Äì03 Zurich Premiership Shaw won the Premiership for the first time, defeating Gloucester in the final. That season Shaw also won his first European silverware with victory against Bath in the 2002-03 Parker Pen Challenge Cup. The 2003-04 Zurich Premiership season saw Wasps retain their Premiership crown and win the 2003-04 Heineken Cup, their first Heineken Cup title. The 2004‚Äì05 season saw Wasps win the Premiership for a third season in a row. The following season Wasps defeated the Scarlets to win the Powergen Cup. Wasps defeated Leicester Tigers in the final of the 2006‚Äì07 Heineken Cup to become European Champions for the second time. The following 2007‚Äì08 season saw Wasps defeat Leicester Tigers in a final again to regain the Premiership title. In May 2008, playing against Leeds Carnegie in the last match of the regular season, Shaw became the first player ever to play in 200 Premiership matches. In November 2011, Shaw decided to finish his career overseas and signed for French club, RC Toulonnais. International career He won his first England cap against Italy in 1996. The following year Shaw was picked for the successful 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa. A spate of injuries and Wasps' indifferent form in his first season at the club cost him his England place and although he regained his place in the England squad for the following summer's tour, he was forced to withdraw with a long- standing back injury. During the 2000 Six Nations Championship, he had to step in for the injured Martin Johnson. He earned his 20th cap during the 2003 Six Nations Championship, a tournament which saw England win the Grand Slam. Shaw played in all three 2003 Rugby World Cup warm up matches. He was not named in the original 30-man squad but was flown out to Australia due to an injury to Danny Grewcock, earning him an MBE as part of the World Cup winning team. He keeps this in a drawer as he feels he didn't \\"win\\" it as he never played in a test. Shaw was called up to the squad for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand after Irish lock Malcolm O'Kelly aggravated a groin injury in training. Shaw was selected as a member of the England 2007 Rugby World Cup squad. Shaw played the full 80 minutes in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final. In recognition of his continued good form with club and country, Shaw was selected for the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. This made him the oldest person to ever be selected and play for a Lions team. In South Africa he was awarded his first Lions cap on his third tour when he was selected to start in the second test against the Springboks at Loftus Versfeld, Pretoria and he put in one of the most outstanding performances by a British and Irish lock in a test match, with his performance subsequently earning him man of the match. During the third test in Johannesburg he was yellow-carded for dirty play when he knee-dropped Fourie du Preez. In 2004 he was red-carded for a similar offence against the All Blacks. In August 2011 he was selected as part of England's 30-man squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. In 2011, Simon Shaw became a director of Rugby Hospitality company Set Piece Events.

It features the origin of the Fantastic Four and the team's first battle with the evil Doctor Doom. Executive-produced by low-budget specialist Roger Corman and Bernd Eichinger, the film was ultimately never released officially, but illegal copies began circulating after a few years. Plot Reed Richards and Victor Von Doom are college friends who use the opportunity of a passing comet to try an experiment; however, the experiment goes wrong, leaving Victor believed dead. Susan and Johnny Storm are two children living with their mother, who has a boarding house where Reed lives. Ben Grimm is a family friend and a college buddy of Reed's. Ten years later, Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben go up into an experimental spacecraft of Reed's as the same comet passes by Earth. They are hit by cosmic rays from it, due to a necessary diamond being exchanged for an imitation by the Jeweler. Upon crash-landing on Earth, the four discover that the cosmic rays gave them special powers: Reed's bodily structure has become elastic, Sue can become invisible, Johnny can generate fire on demand and Ben has transformed into a creature with stone-like skin: the Thing. They are later captured by Victor's men, who pose as Marines, and meet villainous monarch Dr. Doom. After escaping from Doom's men, the four regroup at the Baxter Building, trying to decide what to do now that they have gained superpowers. An angry Ben leaves the group to go out on his own, feeling he has become a freak of nature. He is found by homeless men and joins them in the lair of the Jeweler. The Jeweler has his henchmen kidnap blind artist Alicia Masters, whom he plans to force into being his bride and intends to use the stolen diamond as his wedding gift to her. Doom has his own plans for the diamond and sends his henchmen to the Jeweler's lair to make a deal with him, to no avail. Doom, displeased, seizes the diamond himself as a gun battle breaks out between The Jeweler's and Doom's men. Ben enters the fray, only for Doom to take Alicia as his hostage. Ben threatens to 'clobber' Doom, only for Alicia to beg his not to risk it and confesses her love for him. Her confession reverts Ben to human form, causing him to flee out onto the city streets. Frustrated at his helplessness, he reverts to the Thing. Ben returns to his friends; by now, Reed has learned that Doom is actually Victor. Doom contacts them and threatens to use the diamond to power a laser cannon that will destroy New York City, unless they surrender to him. Realizing they are the only ones who can stop Doom, they don costumes and travel to Doom's castle. There, the Fantastic Four battle a series of Doom's military. Doom fires his laser as Reed has a final battle with him, which ends with Doom being knocked off a balcony wall. He manages to grab hold of the wall and Reed attempts to rescue him, only for Doom's gauntlet to come loose and him falling into the fog below. His gauntlet, still on the balcony, starts to move on its own. Johnny becomes the Human Torch and flies off to stand between the laser's shot and the city, pushing the beam into outer space. Ben frees Alicia and finally introduces himself to her. She feels the rocky surface of his face but is not fazed by his altered appearance. Thereafter, the Four dedicate themselves to fighting evil, and Reed and Sue marry.

The option was not available until three years later, when Eichinger's production company Constantin Film obtained it for a price the producer called \\"not enormous\\" and which has been estimated to be $250,000.Ito, p. 110 Despite some interest from Warner Bros. Pictures and Columbia Pictures, budget concerns precluded any production, and with the option scheduled to expire on December 31, 1992, Constantin asked Marvel for an extension. With none forthcoming, Eichinger planned to retain his option by producing a low-budget Fantastic Four film. In September 1992, he teamed with B-movie specialist Roger Corman, who agreed to produce the film on a $1 million budget, to be released by his distribution company New Horizons Pictures. Production began on December 28, 1992, under direction of music video director Oley Sassone. Storyboards were drawn by artist Pete Von Sholly. The 21-day or 25-dayGore, p. 40 production was shot on the Concorde Pictures sound stage in Venice, California, as well as in Agoura, California for a spacecraft-crash scene, the Loyola Marymount University campus for a lab-explosion scene, and the former Pacific Stock Exchange building in downtown Los Angeles for team-meeting scenes.Ito, p. 111 Costume designer R√©ve Richards recalled in 1993 going to Golden Apple Comics on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles to buy Fantastic Four comic books for research, and, upon explaining his task, \\"these people in the store just swarmed me and said, 'You are going to be faithful to it?' And I told them, 'This is why I am buying these books.'\\"Gore, p. 31 Paul Ahern was hired as weapons consultant, and Scott Billups for computer visual effects.Gore, p. 33 (sidebar: \\"FF FX\\") The special-effects makeup was by John Vulich and Everett Burrell of Optic Nerve.Gore, p. 33 Stuntman Carl Ciarfalio, who wore a rubber suit to portray the monstrous superhero Thing, worked with actor Michael Bailey Smith, who played the Thing's human self, Ben Grimm, so that their mannerisms would match. During the months of post-production, music composers David and Eric Wurst personally contributed $6,000 to finance a 48-piece orchestra for the soundtrack. Marketing and release plans A 1993 magazine article gave a tentative release date of Labor Day weekend 1993.Gore, p. 41 During that summer, trailers ran in theaters and on the video release of Corman's Carnosaur. The cast members hired a publicist, at their own expense, to help promote the film at a clips-screening at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and at the San Diego Comic-Con International, and the film appeared as a cover story on an issue of Film Threat magazine. By this time, the world premiere was announced to take place at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, on January 19, 1994, with proceeds from the event earmarked for the charities Ronald McDonald House and Children's Miracle Network.Ito, p. 218 Suddenly, the premiere was halted, the actors received a cease and desist order on all promotion from the producers, and the studio confiscated the negatives. Eichinger then informed Sassone that the film would not be released. Speculation arose that the film had never been intended for release, but had gone into production solely as a way for Eichinger to retain rights to the characters; Stan Lee said in 2005 that this was indeed the case, insisting, \\"The movie was never supposed to be shown to anybody,\\" and adding that the cast and crew had been left unaware.Ito, p. 108 Corman and Eichinger dismissed Lee's claims, with the former stating, \\"We had a contract to release it, and I had to be bought out of that contract\\" by Eichinger. Eichinger called Lee's version of events \\"definitely not true. It was not our [original] intention to make a B movie, that's for sure, but when the movie was there, we wanted to release it.\\" He said future Marvel film impresario Avi Arad, at this point, in 1993, a Marvel executive, Arad recalled in 2002 that while on a trip to Puerto Rico in 1993, a fan noticing Arad's Fantastic Four shirt expressed excitement over the film's upcoming premiere, of which Arad said he was unaware. Concerned how the low-budget film might cheapen the brand, he said he purchased the film \\"for a couple of million dollars in cash\\" and, not having seen it, ordered all prints destroyed, in order to prevent its release.Ito, p. 219 Eichinger continued negotiations to produce a big-budget adaptation, speaking with directors including Chris Columbus, Peyton Reed, and Peter Segal. After pre-production briefly went underway in 1996, Eichinger and his company began production in 2004 of Fantastic Four (2005), with an estimated $90 million budget. Following that film's 2005 release, Eichinger and Constantin produced a $130 million sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007). A reboot for the film series was released in 2015. Although never officially released to the general public, but exhibited once on May 31, 1994, The Fantastic Four has been subject to bootleg recordings. Critical reception On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 30%, based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 4.67/10. Clint Morris of Film Threat magazine said of a copy of the film he obtained, \\"[Y]es it's terribly low-budget and yes it's derisorily campy and feebly performed, but at the same time there's also something inquiringly irresistible about this B comic tale that makes you wonder why it didn't get a release somewhere along the line. Even if it does resemble Toxic Avenger [more so] than say, Spider-Man ... The script isn't actually all that bad and some of the actors‚Äînotably Michael Bailey Smith‚Äîare actually quite good here, and with an extra polish I think they might have been able to release this thing.\\" Neil Calloway of Flickering Myth said it had \\"the production values are of a 1990s daytime soap, with some rather clunky dialogue.\\" In popular culture In 2013 a main story arc in fourth season of the television series Arrested Development concerned the character Tobias F√ºnke's attempt to stage a musical based on The Fantastic Four. The setup for the story concerned his romantic relationship with an actress who had played Sue Storm in an unreleased Fantastic Four movie. This backstory parodies the development of the 1994 Corman movie and the storyline is an extended satire on various comic book rights battles. In 2014, a trailer for the documentary Doomed!: The Untold Story of Roger Corman's The Fantastic Four was released, with Corman and the rest of the cast and crew explaining what transpired with the film and its production. The documentary was released on July 10, 2015.

Harnack's inequality applied to harmonic functions. He also worked on the real algebraic geometry of plane curves, proving Harnack's curve theorem for real plane algebraic curves. He was the son of the theologian Theodosius HarnackHarnack, Axel; George L. Cathcart. \\"An Introduction to the Study of the Elements of the Differential and Integral Calculus\\" London: Williams and Norgate, 1891, p. 6. and the twin brother of theologian Adolf von Harnack (who long outlived him) - all of them from Dorpat, now known as Tartu, in what is today Estonia. His father was a professor at the University of Dorpat, and he studied also himself in the university. After his studies in Tartu, he moved to Erlangen to become a student of Felix Klein. He published his PhD thesis in 1875, and received the right to teach (venia legendi) at the university of Leipzig the same year. One year later he accepted a position at Technical University Darmstadt. In 1877 he married Elisabeth von √ñttingen, and they moved to Dresden, where he acquired professorship in the Polytechnikum, which becomes a technical university in 1890. Harnack suffered from health problems from 1882 onwards, forcing him to spend long times in a sanatorium. He published 29 scientific articles and was a well-known mathematician at the time of his death. The various Harnack inequalities in harmonic analysis and in related discrete and probabilistic contexts are named after him, as are the Harnack's curve theorem and Harnack's principle.

Naming The genus was named in 2002 by Wang Xiaolin, Zhou Zhonghe and Xu Xing. The type species, the only known, is Jeholopterus ninchengensis. The genus name is derived from its place of discovery, Jehol in China, and a Latinized Greek pteron, \\"wing\\". The specific name refers to Nincheng County. Description Artist's impression The type species is based on holotype IVPP V12705, a nearly complete specimen from the Daohugou beds of Ningcheng County in the Neimongol (Inner Mongolia) Autonomous Region of China.Wang, X., Zhou, Z., Zhang, F., and Xu, X. (2002). \\"A nearly completely articulated rhamphorhynchoid pterosaur with exceptionally well-preserved wing membranes and 'hairs' from Inner Mongolia, northeast China.\\" Chinese Science Bulletin 47(3), 226 ‚Äì 232. The specimen is crushed into a slab and counterslab pair, so that parts of the specimen are preserved on one side of a split stone and some on the other. This includes exquisite preservation of carbonized skin fibers and pycnofibres. The fibers are preserved around the body of the specimen in a \\"halo.\\" Wing tissue is preserved, though its extent is debatable, including the exact points of attachment to the legs (or if it is attached to the legs at all). In 2009 Alexander Kellner published a study reporting the presence of three layers of fibers in the wing, allowing the animal to precisely adapt the wing profile.Alexander W. A. Kellner, Xiaolin Wang, Helmut Tischlinger, Diogenes de Almeida Campos, David W. E. Hone, and Xi Meng. (2009). \\"The soft tissue of Jeholopterus (Pterosauria, Anurognathidae, Batrachognathinae) and the structure of the pterosaur wing membrane\\", Proc. R. Soc. B As an anurognathid, Jeholopterus shows the skull form typical for this group, being wider than it was long, at , with a very broad mouth. Most teeth are small and peg-like, but some are longer and recurved. The neck was short with seven or eight cervical vertebrae. Twelve or thirteen dorsal vertebrae are present and three sacrals. There are five pairs of belly ribs. The tail vertebrae have not been preserved. The describers argue that Jeholopterus had a short tail, a feature seen in other anurognathids but unusual for \\"rhamphorhynchoid\\" (i.e. basal) pterosaurs that typically have a long tail. Wang et al. cited the presence of a fringe of pycnofibres in the region of the tail to infer the presence of a short tail. However, a subsequent study by Dalla Vecchia argued that gleaning any information about the tail is impossible, given that the tail is \\"totally absent\\" in the fossil.Dalla Vecchia, F.M. (2002). \\"Observations on the non-pterodactyloid pterosaur Jeholopterus ningchengensis from the Early Cretaceous of Northeastern China.\\" Natura Nascosta, 24: 8 - 27. Fossil specimen (IVPP V 12705) The wing bones are robust. The metacarpals are very short. A short pteroid, supporting a propatagium, is pointing towards the body. The hand claws are long and curved. The wings of Jeholopterus show evidence that they attached to the ankle, according to Wang et al.. They are relatively elongated with a wingspan of ninety centimetres. The legs are short but robust. The toes bear well-developed curved claws, but these are not as long as the hand claws. The fifth toe is elongated, according to the authors supporting a membrane between the legs, the uropatagium. Phylogeny Jeholopterus was by the authors assigned to the Anurognathidae. An analysis by L√º Junchang in 2006 resolved its position as being the sister taxon of Batrachognathus. Kellner et al. 2009 proposed Batrachognathinae for the clade comprising these two genera and Dendrorhynchoides. Lifestyle Anurognathids are normally considered insectivores. Wang e.a. hypothesised that Jeholopterus, being the largest species known of the group, might also have been a piscivore, a fish-eater. In 2003, natural history writer David Peters, widely known for his highly inaccurate reconstructions and theories about most vertebrates, proposed Jehelopterus to be a hematophagic animal akin to a vampire bat. This theory has been widely condemned and ridiculed by the palaeontological community.

She represented the constituency of Fleetwood‚ÄîPort Kells, British Columbia from her election in the 2004 federal election to her defeat in the 2015 federal election by Liberal MP Ken Hardie. Biography Grewal was born in Osaka, Japan in 1958. She and her husband lived in Liberia before emigrating to Canada, where she raised her young family while working as a sales manager selling Registered Education Savings Plans. Grewal became an active member of the community and the Reform Party of Canada (subsequently the Canadian Alliance and Conservative Party of Canada), participating in many national and regional conferences and conventions. She is married to former Member of Parliament Gurmant Grewal, and the Grewals were the first married couple in Canadian history to concurrently serve as federal MPs. 2006 Canadian Federal elections Grewal is a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Sub-Committee on International Human Rights, and she has served on the Immigration, Canadian Heritage, and Status of Women committees. During her first term, she introduced a private members motion seeking to raise the age of consent. While the then-Liberal government defeated the measure, the subsequent Conservative government put it into law. She also proposed measures to tackle identity theft (with Bill C-271) and to amend the State Immunity Act (Bill C-346), both of which were incorporated into government legislation and subsequently passed. In addition, she pursued bills against child pornography (Bill C-347) and regulations for the volume of television commercials (Bill C-621). The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission later decided to implement her proposals entirely. From May 15‚Äì18, 2005, Grewal's husband surreptitiously taped his discussions with the Liberal Party which, he claimed, showed Liberal government officials enticing him to crossing the floor in exchange for patronage positions. The Liberals were concerned with saving the government during the vote of confidence, and had also contacted MPs Chuck Cadman, Inky Mark, and Belinda Stronach (the last of whom did cross the floor, and was made a minister). When the audio tapes were released, Nina Grewal publicly refused to comment about these discussions; the Liberals were cleared of any wrongdoing, and the Grewals had to explain in detail to the Parliamentary Ethics Commissioner about the discussions and secret tapings on May 16.The Grewal-Dosanjh Inquiry Office of the Ethics Commissioner. (January 2006) On November 29, 2006, it was announced that Nina Grewal would be standing for re- election, even though her husband was not. She successfully defended her seat in the 2006, 2008, and 2011 federal elections, but lost in the 2015 election.

Operated by RTC Transit, it began service on October 27, 2005. Originally The Deuce meant four things: (1) buses on the route were double decked; (2) the one-way fare was $2; (3) the route served the two primary gaming areas, the Strip and Downtown; and (4) the first batch of vehicles bought primarily for the service were assigned fleet numbers starting with \\"2\\". Although the double decker buses also serve other local routes and the price is no longer $2, the name The Deuce on the Strip is used by RTC to emphasize that the route refers to just the tourist route. Background Before the Deuce's debut, the Las Vegas Strip corridor was served by route 301, which ran between Downtown Las Vegas and the former Vacation Village resort. It was also accompanied by its express counterpart, route 302. (When the transit authority was branded as Citizens Area Transit (or CAT), it categorized routes serving the Strip under the 300's.) In March 2010 a new bus rapid transit line connecting the Strip to downtown Las Vegas and Town Square and the South Strip Transfer Terminal became operational. This new 11 mile service was called ACE Gold Line and is similar to the Metropolitan Area Express BRT Line which had been operating since June 30, 2004. Due to a lawsuit by Ace Cab, the line was rebranded as the Gold Line. On November 7, 2010, it was rebranded to be known as the Strip and Downtown Express (SDX). Previously, RTC planned to shorten The Deuce on the Strip from the current 9.3 miles to just the 5 miles of the Strip from Mandalay Bay Casino to Palace Station on Sahara Avenue. This would have been the first time in 45 years (including Las Vegas Transit System) that the main Strip corridor route had undergone a major route change and be shortened. However, the first week of the service change, the northern portion of the route was reinstated with buses continuing to serve the Downtown Transportation Center.http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit/transitguide/TransitGuide(3-28-10).pdf As of 2020, the fare for the Las Vegas Strip is $6 for a two-hour pass, $8 for a 24-hour pass, or $20 for a 72-hour pass. Fleet An Original 200 Series Deuce bus on the Nellis route 115 loading a wheelchair. The route operates using Alexander Dennis Enviro500 vehicles built by the British manufacturer Alexander Dennis. They each seat 27 people on the lower deck, 53 on the upper deck, and are 42 feet long. RTC Transit is one of five transit agencies that operate double-decker buses in the United States for fixed-route services, the others being Unitrans of Davis, California; Community Transit of Snohomish County, Washington; Antelope Valley Transit Authority of Palmdale, California and Lancaster, California; and SLO Transit of San Luis Obispo, CA. All of the five agencies reside on the west coast. In 2006, the RTC announced that they purchased 40 more double-deckers that arrived in Spring 2007, and another 40 that arrived in 2008. These new vehicles replaced the original 50 that have been serving the Strip. The original vehicles were reassigned to local routes (height permitting). These new Deuces are special in that they have 2 staircases, one in the current position, and a second one in the back. They are also 2 feet longer than the present double deckers, and have earned the nickname \\"Superdeuce.\\" Since January 2008, 80 new double deckers have arrived with half of that order featuring the reconfigured 42 ft, double staircase bus. The double staircase buses are assigned mostly to The Strip, while some, as well as all of the 40 ft double deckers are assigned to local routes. Although rare, some of the 40 ft vehicles will find their way onto The Strip route as a last resort.

Total prize money for the race is A$400,000. History The first Adelaide Cup was raced on 21 April 1864 at Thebarton Racecourse, where Mile End is today. The race had stakes of 500 sovereigns with an additional sweep of 50 sovereigns to induce owners from other colonies to compete in the race. Victoria's P. Dowling's Falcon carried 10 stone 1 pound and ridden by jockey J.Morrison won the race in a time of 3:50.50. A crowd of 7,000 or 8,000 was present for the event. The race was run at Weight for Age over two miles from 1864-68. In 1869, still at Thebarton Racecourse, it was run as a handicap race over two miles. There was no Cup raced in 1870 or 1871. The Cup resumed in 1872 and was run at \\"The Old Course\\" (Victoria Park Racecourse) over two miles with a smaller stake of 200 sovereigns and an additional sweep of 15 sovereigns. In 1876 the race was held at Morphettville Racecourse. In 1884 the race was run over 13 furlongs or miles (~2,600 metres), as was every race held until 1941. The Totalizator, whose operation on South Australian racecourses became legal in 1880, was abolished by the Totalizator Repeal Act of 1883, and the SAJC suffered a financial collapse. The racecourse was mortgaged and the 1885 Adelaide Cup was held at Flemington, Victoria, and was not held for three more years. In 1889, running of the Cup resumed at Morphettville when Sir Richard Baker and A. O. Whitington took over the course. Starting on 1 March 1942, there was a ban on racing due to World War II and thus the race was not held in 1942 and 1943. In 1980 due to renovation of Morphettville Racecourse the race was run at Victoria Park Racecourse and in 2000 the Cup race day was abandoned due to rain and was rescheduled later and also run at Victoria Park. The highest ever Cup attendance was in 1951 when 50,000 spectators attended. The cup is held on the second Monday of March since March 2006. Before 2006 it was held in May. It was first run in 1864, just three years after the Melbourne Cup commenced. The day received public holiday status in 1973 and became a major social event in South Australia. In the decade since the move of the Adelaide Cup to March, attendance has fallen to a third of previous levels, seeing 10,500 people trackside in 2015. This is due to use of the public holiday by other \\"Mad March\\" events (the Adelaide Festival of the Arts, the associated Fringe Festival, the WOMAD world music festival, a touring car race the weekend prior). Thoroughbred Racing SA and the South Australian Jockey Club wish to move the race and its associated public holiday out of March.

It is not a part of the APG, APG II and APG III classifications, being sunk in Malvaceae but has an extensive historical record of use. All through its existence the family has had a very lively history, with various authors taking very different views on what should be part of this family. As a result, it is recommended when this name is encountered to check what the author means. However, in the northern temperate regions the name is unambiguous as the only representative is Tilia, the lime or linden. Tiliaceae in the de Candolle system In the de Candolle system the circumscription of the family was: * family Tiliaceae *: genus I. Sparmannia [sic: now Sparrmannia] *: genus II? Abatia *: genus III.

Modern botanical taxonomy, such as the relevant volume in the Kubitzki series which conforms to APG, treats most of the plants that traditionally constitute the family (see above) in the subfamilies Tilioideae, Brownlowioideae, and Grewioideae within this extended family Malvaceae sensu lato.

He is best known for his tenures in World Championship Wrestling and New Japan Pro-Wrestling, in which he was a member of the New World Order and nWo Japan. He is a two-time world champion, having won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship twice. Early life Norton started out as a professional arm wrestler. He won over 30 championships during his days as an arm wrestler, including four U.S. National championships, and gained the nickname \\"Flash\\" due to his quickness in winning matches. His status in the arm wrestling world earned him a role in Sylvester Stallone's arm wrestling movie, Over the Top. While touring the arm wrestling circuit in Japan, Norton was approached by New Japan Pro-Wrestling about becoming a professional wrestler, but he turned it down initially. In addition to his professional arm wrestling career, Norton also worked as a bodyguard for Prince during the musician's 1999 and Purple Rain Tours. Professional wrestling career After finally deciding to enter professional wrestling, Norton was trained to wrestle by former Olympic wrestler Brad Rheingans. Despite Norton's inexperience, Verne Gagne decided to debut him before he was totally finished with his training, putting him on television as a regular performer for the American Wrestling Association in 1989. He sometimes teamed with John Nord as the Yukon Lumberjacks. He challenged then World Champions Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair and Larry Zbyszko to an TV arm wrestling match. If anyone beat him, he would pay them (kayfabe) $1,000,000. Nothing became of the challenge. By the end of 1989, Norton left the AWA and went to the Pacific Northwest territory to further his career. In PNW, Norton started out as a face with a lumberjack gimmick and the nickname \\"Flapjack\\". He soon formed a tag team with John Nord once more to reprise their lumberjack gimmick from the AWA. In 1990, Norton turned heel and broke away from Nord to become a singles competitor. He won the Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship from Brian Adams on May 12, 1990, but was stripped of the title two weeks later after attacking several wrestlers. =New Japan Pro- Wrestling (1990‚Äì1993)= In 1990, Norton signed with New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Upon debuting for the promotion, Norton alternated between tag team and mid- card singles matches. Norton appeared at both the joint NJPW/World Championship Wrestling Starrcade in Egg Dome shows, giving him exposure to WCW executives. The working agreement between NJPW and WCW meant that The Steiner Brothers would tour Japan on a regular basis, often wrestling against Scott Norton alongside a variety of partners. On November 5, 1991 Norton acted as a substitute for the injured Scott Steiner in an IWGP Tag Team Championship match. Norton and Rick Steiner were unsuccessful on the night and lost the tag-team titles to Hiroshi Hase and Keiji Mutoh. About a year after losing the title he never technically held, Norton won the Tag Team Title properly when he and Tony Halme beat the Steiner Brothers for the gold on November 22, 1992. The powerhouse team only held on to the title for a little over three weeks before losing them to the Hell Raisers (Road Warrior Hawk and Power Warrior). After splitting up with Halme, Norton started to team with Hercules Hernandez in March 1993. Hercules was a fellow powerhouse wrestler and the two formed The Jurassic Powers, a team that won the IWGP Tag Team Championship from the Hell Raisers. The Powers held the title for about four months before losing them back to the Hell Raisers at NJPW's January 4 Dome Show. While holding the title, the Jurassic Powers successfully defended against teams such as Keiji Mutoh and Hiroshi Hase, The Nasty Boys, Takayuki Iizuka and Akira Nogami, Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts and Brutus Beefcake, Masa Saito and Manabu Nakanishi and The Barbarian and Haku in non-title competition. The team also and made it to the finals of the 1993 Super Grade Tag League, where they lost to Keiji Mutoh and Hiroshi Hase. After breaking up with Hernandez, Norton failed to achieve much notoriety in the singles ranks nor in the tag team division, where he teamed with a variety of partners such as Mike Enos, Ron Simmons, Masahiro Chono, Osamu Kido, and Road Warrior Hawk. =World Championship Wrestling (1993)= Norton returned to the U.S. and signed with World Championship Wrestling in 1993. The promoters first tried to get Norton over with the fans as a villain by feuding with Sting, but Norton quit before Slamboree 1993 and was replaced by the Prisoner. =World Wrestling Federation (1994)= Norton made an appearance on a WWF house show in Sunrise, Florida on October 9, 1994. He was defeated by Thurman \\"Sparky\\" Plugg.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm =World Championship Wrestling (1995‚Äì1999)= Norton returned to WCW in September 1995, where he briefly feuded with Shark, after the latter inadvertently helped Randy Savage defeat Norton on the September 11 edition of WCW Monday Nitro. Fire and Ice (1996) During a WCW Saturday Night taping, Norton squared off against Ice Train. The bout ended in a double count out when both men clotheslined the other, knocking each out. After the match, the two shook hands and Norton explained to announcer Gene Okerlund that he felt that they would make a formidable tag team because of their similar wrestling styles. The team was quickly named Fire and Ice. At Slamboree, Norton and Ice Train were randomly drawn to be on the same team and easily defeated the makeshift team of Big Bubba Rogers and Stevie Ray. The team advanced to the \\"Lord of The Ring\\" battle royal, but neither won the match. At The Great American Bash, Fire and Ice came head to head with Norton's long-time rivals, the Steiner Brothers. The two teams was engaged in a mini-feud of sorts, as the two teams tried to show who was better powerhouse team. On that night the Steiner Brothers won, but Fire and Ice were not deterred. After a pre-PPV loss to The Rock 'n' Roll Express at Bash at the Beach, dissension started to appear between the two, a dissension that turned into battle as Norton attacked Ice Train after another team loss. Norton defeated the Ice Train at Hog Wild in a submission match, but lost to Ice Train in a rematch a month later. After Fire and Ice ended, Norton split his time between WCW and NJPW, achieving more success in NJPW than WCW most notably in the tag team division. Norton and Shinya Hashimoto teamed up and won the Super Grade Tag League in 1996 after beating Keiji Mutoh and Rick Steiner in the finals. New World Order and Vicious and Delicious (1996-1999) In late 1996, Norton joined the New World Order (nWo), which gave his WCW career some direction after the breakup of Fire and Ice. In the nWo, Norton teamed with Buff Bagwell as Vicious and Delicious. They feuded with the Steiner Brothers, but were never able to win the World Tag Team Championship. During his nWo days, Norton traveled back and forth to NJPW, where he was a member of nWo Japan, and became NJPW's gaijin ace while also becoming one of the few wrestlers to be a regular member of both factions. On September 23, 1998, he won the vacant IWGP Heavyweight Championship by defeating Yuji Nagata. Norton's title win was mentioned only once in America on a broadcast of Nitro while he was seen holding the belt, but Norton's standing in the WCW version of the nWo never changed from this fact mostly due to the nWo's leader being Hollywood Hogan, who was the WCW World Heavyweight Champion. Norton held the IWGP Heavyweight Title for four months before losing the title to Keiji Mutoh. Norton is one of nine foreigners who ever held the IWGP Championship, the others being Big Van Vader, Salman Hashimikov, Bob Sapp, Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, AJ Styles, Kenny Omega and Jay White. Norton soon began playing a smaller role in WCW, becoming part of the nWo \\"B-Team\\", which often placed him in mid-lower card matches; although he would continue to squash jobbers frequently in singles competition. While in NJPW, however, Norton was seen as a main eventer and constant threat to world champions. He left WCW completely in 1999 after losing a match against Goldberg on the September 30 episode of Thunder and began focusing his efforts on NJPW, where he was part of Masahiro Chono's Team 2000. =Return to NJPW (1999‚Äì2006)= On March 17, 2001, Norton defeated Kensuke Sasaki in Nagoya, Japan to capture the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship a second time. His second reign was shorter than his first, and he lost to Kazuyuki Fujita on his first defense. After the loss, Norton started to team with fellow WCW alumnus Rick Steiner whenever Steiner toured Japan, but otherwise he was planted solidly in the mid-card as a test any hopeful world title challenger would have to pass. After briefly retiring in 2004, Norton returned later that year and resumed teaming with Steiner. Following the 2006 New Japan Cup, he left NJPW after 16 years, becoming a freelancer in the process. =Independent circuit and semi- retirement (2006‚Äìpresent)= In mid-2006, Norton started his own independent promotion, Wild West Championship Wrestling, based in the southwest of United States, where he acted as both a booker and wrestler until its closure later that year. After wrestling for Hustle from mid to late 2007, Norton took a near-year long hiatus before returning on October 24, 2008, where he and Masahiro Chono defeated Don Frye and Yoshihiro Takayama in the first part of the Pro Wrestling Expo. The next day, Norton, Frye and Dick Togo lost to Chono, Eric Young and Kohei Sato. Since then, Norton has been inactive from wrestling. In an August 2010 interview, Norton revealed that he would be interested in a run with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. At the time, Norton lived in Brentwood, Tennessee, which is located minutes outside of TNA's headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee and commented that wrestling is, \\"something I enjoy doing. You miss it. I can still perform at a high level. I‚Äôm still a big, strong man. I would like to give it another shot. If I can get a couple-year run, I'll fold up my tent and call it a day.\\" On October 7, 2012, Norton teamed with Keiji Mutoh to defeat the team of Masanobu Fuchi and Taiyo Kea in a tag team match on the first event of All Japan Pro Wrestling's 40th Anniversary Tour. Norton returned to NJPW on January 4, 2017, at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome, taking part in the New Japan Rumble, from which he was eliminated by Michael Elgin. The following day, Norton teamed with Cheeseburger and former nWo Japan stablemates Hiro Saito, Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima in a ten-man tag team, where they defeated Bullet Club (Bad Luck Fale, Bone Soldier, Kenny Omega, Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa). On April 29, 2017, Norton faced NYWC Heavyweight Champion Bull James at April Reign in a losing effort. Personal life Norton is married to his wife Tammy. His book, Scott Norton: Strong Style, with assistance from Adam Randis, who has been a longtime fan of Norton, was released on May 25, 2019. Growing up in Minnesota, Norton became friends with a number of future fellow professional wrestlers, including Road Warrior Hawk, Curt Hennig, Rick Rude, John Nord and Wayne Bloom.

History The band formed at Hiatt Baker Hall at the University of Bristol in 1996. Originally there were six members: Rupert Browne (vocals), Ed East (rhythm guitar), Steve Bond (drums), Simon (Boris) Exton (keyboards), Luke Sherwood (lead guitar) and Trevor Wensley (saxophone). Originally called \\"Rupert & The Beards\\", the band have been playing together for over 15 years. After Sherwood left the band, Wensley became a second keyboard/synth player. As there was no bass player the two keyboards shared rhythm, bass and melody duties. All five members write the songs. An early EP, \\"Telephone Heroes\\", was followed by their first album, Experiment with Mother. Recorded at home, it was released by Bristol Label Sink and Stove Records along with the single \\"Like It Or Leave It‚Äù. Having gigged regularly for many years around Bristol they began to play further a-field. This led to them acquiring management and subsequently signing a deal with Island Records. The band recorded the album Lick Your Ticket in 2003 with producer Steve Osborne at Realworld Studios. They released a number of singles from it and toured extensively, playing with bands such as Kasabian (other than in Southampton), the Kaiser Chiefs and The Charlatans as well as at Glastonbury and V festivals. However, they were unable to sell enough records to make a sufficient return on the large investment Island had made in them and their contract was not extended to another album. Whilst working in Berlin with dance producers Tiefschwarz they were seen performing by Kitty-Yo Records who signed the album up for release in GAS. Their next album, Brace, Brace was licensed by Weekender among other labels. Produced by Bruno Ellingham this album featured the single, \\"You Said\\" which enjoyed airplay and allowed the band to play a large number of gigs across Europe. Their most recent album, Bitten (2011), was written and recorded at Studio East in Berlin; a studio run by their guitarist East. Funded by BMG Rights and distributed by Rough Trade it featured the single \\"Bitte Bitte\\".

Biography =Early life and career= Lundquist was born in Duluth, Minnesota. He graduated from Austin High School in Austin, Texas, before attending Texas Lutheran University (formerly Texas Lutheran College), where he was one of the founders of the Omega Tau Fraternity in 1958 before graduating in 1962. He is now a member of the Board of Regents for his alma mater. Lundquist attended Augustana Seminary in Rock Island, Illinois in 1962. His father was a Lutheran pastor and President of the Nebraska Synod of the Augustana Lutheran Church. Lundquist played basketball and baseball and was a disc jockey at WOC, Davenport, Iowa. His 'Golden Voice' was the highlight of the seminary class on preaching. He began his broadcasting career as sports anchor for WFAA in Dallas and in Austin for KTBC, as well as being the radio voice of the Dallas Cowboys. Lundquist joined the Cowboys Radio Network in 1967Hot Seat: Verne Lundquist. The Dallas Morning News, January 31, 2009. Retrieved February 4, 2009. and remained with the team until the 1984 season. He was paired with future (and now current) play-by-play man Brad Sham starting with the 1977 season, the year the Cowboys went 12‚Äì2 and captured their second NFL title in Super Bowl XII. He was sportscaster at WFAA during their 6pm news, while his eventual successor Dale Hansen did the 10pm news. Before becoming a nationwide sports commentator, from 1970 to 1974, Lundquist was commentator for the sports show, Bowling for Dollars, in Dallas, Texas. It aired weekday evenings on the ABC station, WFAA-TV, from 6:30 to 7:00, in north central Texas. During these four seasons, Lundquist started interviewing Cowboys players and their first head coach, Tom Landry, at their sidelines, during halftimes, practices, pre-season and pre-game warm-ups, in Dallas. =Network assignments= Nationally, Lundquist worked for ABC Sports from 1974 to 1981, CBS from 1982 to 1995, and TNT cable from 1995 to 1997 before returning to CBS in 1998. Lundquist's patented belly laugh and his contagious enthusiasm for the events he covers have made him one of the more prominent and recognizable on-air talents in network TV.https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/fans-going-crazy-for-uncle- verne-on-twitter-as-former-sec-broadcaster-calls-masters/ He is among the key voices of NFL Films, and in past years had called regional NFL games for CBS, NBA games for CBS and TNT, and TNT's Sunday Night Football telecasts. He called television play-by-play on Seattle Seahawks preseason games from 2006 to 2008. During the 1992, 1994, and 1998 Winter Olympics, whose rights were held by CBS and TNT, Lundquist and Scott Hamilton served as the announcers for figure skating events. Their performances were parodied by Saturday Night Live cast members Phil Hartman and Darrell Hammond (as Lundquist) with Dana Carvey, David Spade, and Will Ferrell (both as Hamilton): in 1992 with Jason Priestley and 1994 with Nancy Kerrigan and Chris Farley. They did a spoof of the Olympics figure skating events, as both Hartman and Myers went \\"Oh!\\" when Priestly or Farley (in a pre-recorded performance) did an on-ice pratfall. Lundquist, after seeing the original footage in 1992, commented that Hartman \\"nailed it dead on.\\" Lundquist filled in for Ernie Johnson Jr. as host of TNT's coverage of the PGA Championship twice, in 2006 as Johnson was battling cancer, and in 2011 when Johnson left after the second round following the death of his father on that Friday night. After his return to CBS, Lundquist served as the long-time lead play-by-play announcer for CBS Sports' coverage of college football on the SEC on CBS from 2000‚Äì2016. Lundquist retired from broadcasting college football games after calling the Army‚ÄìNavy Game on December 10, 2016. He planned to contribute to other CBS Sports programs, including its college basketball and golf coverage, for the foreseeable future. In March 2018, Lundquist announced he would not work the 2018 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, as he was still recovering from back surgery he had in November 2017, and would retire from calling college basketball. Despite his retirement from calling college football and basketball, Lundquist remains active as an announcer, calling The Masters and the PGA Championship for CBS Sports in 2018 and 2019.https://awfulannouncing.com/cbs/verne- lundquist-masters-pga-championship-cbs.html Currently, Lundquist resides in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. =Appearances in other media= Lundquist played himself commentating on golf tournaments in the 1996 motion picture Happy Gilmore.

The ladies free skate portion of the 1994 Olympics drew Super Bowl type television ratings because of the hyped Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan debacle. The drama unfolded that evening as Tonya Harding begin her free skate, then quit 45 seconds into her program, and went crying to the judges table of a broken skate lace. She was granted permission to fix her skate and start her free skate later in the evening. During the ordeal, he said: * September 16, 2000: In his first college football game called on CBS, a rivalry game between the #6-ranked Florida Gators and the #11-ranked Tennessee Volunteers at Neyland Stadium, Florida quarterback Jesse Palmer threw a pass to wide receiver Jabar Gaffney that was caught in the end zone on second-and-goal in the final seconds of the fourth quarter, only to have it stripped instantly by Tennessee cornerback Willie Miles. The line judge official signaled a touchdown, and the call was confirmed although replays showed that Gaffney did not gain complete possession of the football. The winning score gave the Gators a 27‚Äì23 win in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Lundquist described the play: * April 10, 2005: While calling the final round of the 2005 Masters Tournament on CBS, Tiger Woods sunk a dramatic chip-in birdie on the 16th hole. : * March 26, 2006: While calling play-by-play for the 2006 NCAA Men's Basketball Washington, D.C. Regional Finals, a stunning upset was crafted by George Mason over #1-seed Connecticut in the Elite 8. : * October 7, 2006: While calling a college football rivalry game on CBS between the #5-ranked Florida Gators and the #9-ranked LSU Tigers, Florida quarterback Tim Tebow completed a one-yard touchdown to Tate Casey on the \\"jump pass\\" in the final seconds of the first half to help give the Gators a 14‚Äì7 lead: * November 11, 2006: While calling a college football game on CBS between the #6-ranked Florida Gators and the unranked South Carolina Gamecocks, Florida defensive end Jarvis Moss blocked a game-winning 48-yard field goal attempt by South Carolina kicker Ryan Succop to keep the Gators' national championship hopes alive: * October 24, 2009: While calling a college football rivalry game on CBS between the #1-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide and the unranked Tennessee Volunteers, Alabama defensive tackle Terrence Cody blocked a game-winning 44-yard field goal attempt by Tennessee kicker Daniel Lincoln to keep the Tide's national championship hopes alive: * November 10, 2012: While calling the college football game on CBS between the #1-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide and the #15-ranked Texas A&M; Aggies, A&M; quarterback Johnny Manziel threw a touchdown pass to receiver Ryan Swope after nearly getting sacked and fumbling the football, all but cementing Manziel's Heisman Trophy that year. * November 16, 2013: While calling a college football rivalry game on CBS between #7-ranked Auburn and #25-ranked Georgia, Auburn quarterback Nick Marshall threw a 73-yard touchdown pass to Ricardo Louis known as \\"The Prayer at Jordan-Hare,\\" a Hail Mary pass that propelled Auburn past Georgia in the final seconds of the game. : * November 30, 2013: While calling a college football game on CBS between #1-ranked Alabama and #4-ranked Auburn, a fierce in-state rivalry known as \\"The Iron Bowl,\\" Auburn cornerback Chris Davis returned a missed 57-yard field goal attempt by Alabama placekicker Adam Griffith with 0:01 remaining 100 yards for a game-winning touchdown on the game's final play. Known as the Kick Six, the play gave Auburn a 34‚Äì28 victory and a spot in the 2013 SEC Championship Game. : * September 27, 2014: While calling a college football rivalry game on CBS between #6-ranked Texas A&M; and unranked Arkansas, a game that renewed the annual rivalry at AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Arkansas led 28-21 with 2:17 left to play in the 4th quarter. A&M; quarterback Kenny Hill threw a pass to receiver Josh Reynolds, who weaved around a would-be tackler to take it for a 59 yard touchdown, tying the game. It would go on to overtime, where Texas A&M; would emerge victorious 35-28. * October 1, 2016: While calling a college football rivalry game on CBS between #11-ranked Tennessee and #25-ranked Georgia at Sanford Stadium, Tennessee quarterback Joshua Dobbs completed a Hail Mary pass to wide receiver Jauan Jennings with no time remaining in regulation play to give Tennessee a 34-31 victory, only 10 clock seconds after Georgia had scored a 47-yard touchdown to secure the lead and presumably the win: * April 14, 2019: Lundquist called the 16th hole at the 2019 Masters Tournament, where Tiger Woods hit a remarkable tee shot and made a birdie to increase his lead in the final round. Woods would go on to win the tournament (his first win at Augusta in 14 years) capping an amazing comeback to the top of the golfing world. Lundquist referenced his call of Woods' amazing 16th in 2005, the last time Tiger won the Masters. =Honors= At the 2005 Sun Bowl, Lundquist was inducted into the Sun Bowl Hall of Fame along with former UCLA Bruins football coach Terry Donahue.

Fifteen were built, and one has survived to preservation. Originally known as the Big Goods class, they became class I under Peter Drummond's 1901 classification scheme. Fifteen locomotives were built by Sharp, Stewart and Company and delivered between September and November 1894, numbered 103 to 117. At the time, these were the most powerful main line engines in the country. Originally intended principally as freight engines, they were often called upon for passenger duties during the wide fluctuations of traffic which occurred on the Highland Railway, particularly during the summer season. Overview The 4-6-0 wheel arrangement had its origins in the United States, and its introduction to Britain was the work of the Highland Railway's locomotive superintendent David Jones. When the 'Jones Goods' first appeared they were felt to be somewhat daring as they were such an advance on anything that Jones or the Highland Railway had previously built. Although the type was a notable success for Jones, an accident while testing one of the locomotives caused one of his legs to be severely scalded. Although he recovered, he was permanently affected and by the end of December 1896 had retired due to ill- health. Dimensions Boiler pressure was ‚Äî the previous highest on the Highland being . Outside cylinders were , bore by stroke ‚Äì the previous largest being . Driving wheels were in diameter ‚Äî the HR standard for freight locomotives. Additionally the boiler and chassis were significantly longer than anything previously attempted by the company. It was also the first tender locomotive for the railway not to have Allan double frames and inclined cylinders beside the smokebox. Transfer to LMS The class was numbered 17916‚Äì17930 and given power classification '4F' by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). They were withdrawn between 1929 and 1940. Preservation The first of the class, Number 103, (LMS 17916) was set aside for preservation by the LMS in 1934. It was restored to working order by British Railways in 1959 and spent several years operating enthusiasts' tours. During this time, it appeared in the 1965 film Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines. It was finally retired in 1966 and is today in the Glasgow Museum of Transport. In addition to being the first ever British 4-6-0, no. 103 has since 1966 also had the less positive distinction of being the only surviving former Highland Railway locomotive.

Biography Yuval Ne'eman was born in Tel Aviv during the Mandate era, graduated from high school at the age of 15, and studied mechanical engineering at the Technion. At the age of 15, Ne'eman also joined the Haganah. During the 1948 Arab- Israeli War Ne'eman served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as battalion deputy commander, then as Operations Officer of Tel Aviv, and commander of Givati Brigade. Later (1952‚Äì54) he served as Deputy Commander of Operations Department of General Staff, Commander of the Planning Department of the IDF. In this role, he helped organize the IDF into a reservist-based army, developed the mobilization system, and wrote the first draft of Israel's defense doctrine. Between 1958 and 1960 Ne'eman was IDF Attach√© in Great Britain, where he also studied for a PhD in physics under the supervision of 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics winner Abdus Salam at Imperial College London. In 1961, he was demobilized from the IDF with a rank of Colonel. In 1981, Ne'eman became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Between 1998-2002 Ne'eman was the head of the Israeli Engineer Association Scientific career One of his greatest achievements in physics was his 1961 discovery of the classification of hadrons through the SU(3) flavour symmetry, now named the Eightfold Way, which was also proposed independently by Murray Gell-Mann. This SU(3) symmetry laid the foundation of the quark model, proposed by Gell- Mann and George Zweig in 1964 (independently of each other).

He was also the co-director (along with Sudarshan) of the Center for Particle Theory at the University of Texas, Austin from 1968 to 1990. He was a strong believer in the importance of space research and satellites to Israel's economic future and security, and thus founded the Israel Space Agency in 1983, which he chaired almost until his death. He also served on the Israel Atomic Energy Commission from 1965 to 1984 and held the position of scientific director in its Soreq facility.

He was elected to the Knesset in the 1981 elections in which Tehiya won three seats. The party joined Begin's coalition about a year after the elections and Ne'eman was appointed Minister of Science and Development, the role later changed to Minister of Science and Technology. He retained his seat in the 1984 elections, but Tehiya were not included in the grand coalition formed by the Alignment and Likud. After the 1988 elections, Tehiya were again excluded from the governing coalition. Ne'eman resigned from the Knesset on 31 January 1990 and was replaced by Gershon Shafat. However, Tehiya joined the government in June after the Alignment had left, and he was appointed Minister of Energy and Infrastructure and Minister of Science and Technology despite not retaking his seat in the Knesset. He lost his ministerial position following the 1992 elections and did not return to politics. Death He died at age 80, on 26 April 2006 in the Ichilov Hospital, Tel Aviv, from a stroke.

He was the last known holder of the 1914 Star (the Old Contemptibles), the last known combatant to participate in the 1914 World War I Christmas truce, Scotland's last known World War I veteran, and Scotland's oldest man for more than a year. Early life Alfred Anderson was born on 25 June 1896 at 20 Kirloch Street, Dundee. He was the son of Andrew Anderson, a joiner, and Christina Thomas Emmerson. His parents married on 5 September 1888 in Chicago, Illinois, where they had two sons before returning to Scotland. The Andersons went on to have four more children, including Alfred. Andrew Anderson died on 31 July 1943, aged eighty-one, of bronchial asthmafrom which he had suffered for over twenty-five yearsand bronchopneumonia. Christina Anderson died of cardiovascular degeneration on 9 January 1953, aged eighty-four. Alfred registered both of his parents' deaths. First World War (1914‚Äì1918) In October 1914, Anderson left his home and with the rest of the 1/5th Angus and Dundee Battalion of the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), travelled by train from Dundee to Southampton and then crossed the channel by ferry to Le Havre. The regiment was mainly recruited in Angus, so Anderson was surrounded by a group of friends with whom he had joined the Territorial Force in 1912 at the age of sixteen; he thought that he was going on a grand adventure and as Anderson recalled in a television interview in 2005, it offered the chance of a holiday . The young lads who had joined up had volunteered to go and fight on the Western Front. On Christmas Eve and Christmas Day (24 and 25 December) 1914, Anderson‚Äôs unit was billeted in a farmhouse away from the front line. He vividly recalled the day and once said: > I remember the silence, the eerie sound of silence. Only the guards were on > duty. We all went outside the farm buildings and just stood listening. And, > of course, thinking of people back home. All I‚Äôd heard for two months in the > trenches was the hissing, cracking and whining of bullets in flight, > machinegun fire and distant German voices. But there was a dead silence that > morning, right across the land as far as you could see. We shouted ‚ÄòMerry > Christmas‚Äô, even though nobody felt merry. The silence ended early in the > afternoon and the killing started again. It was a short peace in a terrible > war. Bertie Felstead, who died in August 2001 at the age of 106, was originally believed to have been the last survivor of the Christmas Truce. However, it later emerged that Alfred Anderson had participated in the Christmas Truce, and he outlived Felstead by four years. The following year the 1/5th Battalion fought at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and Loos. He became batman to his platoon commander Lieutenant Ian Bruce Gardyne MC, and also briefly to Captain Fergus Bowes-Lyon, brother to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Bowes-Lyon (1889‚Äì1915) was killed during the Battle of the Hohenzollern Redoubt in the Battle of Loos. Whilst Alfred Anderson was serving as a batman, he would often go out at night with Bruce-Gardyne into No-Man‚Äôs Land to listen for enemy activity such as tunneling or troop movements. On one of these night-time watches, Anderson was wounded in the back of the neck by shrapnel from shellfire in 1915. The wound, termed a ‚ÄòBlighty‚Äô wound, meant that he was sent home to Britain to recuperate. After recovering at a hospital in Norfolk he became an infantry instructor at a camp near Ripon, rising to the rank of Staff Sergeant by the end of the war in 1918. It was during his time as an instructor that he met and married his wife, Susanna Iddison (1896‚Äì1979). After the war, he took her back to Scotland and recommenced life as a joiner in his father‚Äôs business. Second World War (1939‚Äì1945) When the Second World War erupted in 1939, Alfred by now was aged forty-three and therefore too old to be drafted into the military. He was placed in command of a detachment of the Home Guard which ensured that he ‚Äòdid his bit‚Äô for 'King and country' a second time. Following the British and Allied victory in 1945, Anderson was elected Chairman of the local branch of the Royal British Legion. Postwar His wife died in 1979 and he moved to Alyth to be near his youngest daughter. He was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur in 1998 as were all First World War veterans who fought on French soil. In 2003, when his service as batman to Fergus Bowes-Lyon (who was killed in 1915) came out, Prince Charles went to visit him. Charles is the great-nephew of Fergus Bowes-Lyon. Six weeks before his own death he moved to Mundamalla Nursing Home, where he died in November 2005 at the age of 109. At his death, he was Scotland's oldest man. He died just a few weeks after featuring in the BBC One documentary The Last Tommy, which interviewed some of the last surviving First World War British Army veterans (nicknamed Tommy or Tommy Atkins). The widower, who had five children, said he had lost count of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He was actually survived by four children, ten grandchildren, 18 great-grandchildren, and two great-great grandchildren. A biography (Alfred Anderson: A Life in Three Centuries) was published in 2002, and a bust of him stands on display at the public library in Alyth.

He was one of seven children in the Berger Iversen family. His eldest brother Jon immigrated to the United States in 1861, followed by his sister Mathea in 1865. In 1867, his parents and the rest of the family also followed ‚Äì landing first in New York City, and then traveling to Black River Falls, Wisconsin, to join the oldest son and daughter. Simon Bergersen was 16 when he arrived in the United States. After arriving in the United States, the family had taken out naturalization papers, changed their family surname to \\"Benson\\" and proceeded to become United States citizens. =Early career= Benson first went to work as a farm hand and later worked in logging camps and sawmills. At the age of 24, he opened a general store in Lynxville, Wisconsin. It did well until it was destroyed by fire three years later. Then 27, he was completely broke and now had a wife, Esther Searles, and son Amos to care for. Having heard about all the timber there was in the Northwest and with his experience working in the woods and sawmills of Wisconsin, he moved his family to Portland, Oregon in 1880. Simon had two more children with Esther, Alice and Caroline, before Esther died in 1891 after a long fight with tuberculosis. In 1894 Simon married Pamelia Loomis by whom she had two more children, Gilbert and Chester. Riding through two personal cycles of prosperity and poverty before his third and lasting success, Benson went into the business of logging in near Clatskanie, Oregon and Oak Point, Washington, downstream from Portland, buying up tracts of timber wherever he could. He introduced a number of changes to Northwest logging, including the donkey steam engine which replaced the oxen that had previously been used to haul logs. He later built the famous Benson seagoing rafts which could carry up to six million board feet (14,000 m¬≥) of timber, cutting the cost of transporting logs to markets in California. In 1898, he moved his family and his business headquarters back to Portland. The family lived in a rented house for two years until Benson decided to build a new home at the corner of SW Park and Montgomery. This is the home known as the Simon Benson House. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, it was later saved from city condemnation and restored by the Friends of Simon Benson House and moved to the Portland State University (PSU) campus at SW Park and Montgomery in 2000. It houses a visitor's center and is home to the PSU Alumni Association. =Success= Simon Benson Now a wealthy man, Benson's interests expanded beyond the timber industry. In 1912, he began building a fine hotel because he felt it was needed in Portland to attract tourists and more commerce to the city. It was modeled on the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago, a brick structure with the same type of French mansard roof. It opened in 1913 and was known as the Oregon Hotel. For sixteen months it lost money and finally Benson took over management, at which time it became known as the Benson Hotel. Benson later built the Columbia Gorge Hotel near Hood River in 1921. He brought Henry Thiele, later owner of his own famous restaurants in Portland, to be its head chef. Benson was also an enthusiastic supporter of good roads and among a group of businessmen who encouraged the building of the Columbia River Highway. When citizens of Hood River County voted a $75,000 bond levy to construct the portion of the highway that would run from the Multnomah County line to Hood River, Benson purchased the entire bond issue within a month because the bonds were not selling. =Death and legacy= One of many \\"Benson Bubblers\\" in downtown Portland In the early 1920s, Benson moved to southern California to retire, but gradually became active in business again, buying and developing land and managing business properties. He died in Los Angeles, California in August 1942. Benson is buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.from River View Cemetery Benson is well remembered for his philanthropy. He has been quoted as having said: \\"No one has the right to die and not leave something to the public and for the public good.\\"John Gorman, A Portland Lumber Baron‚Äôs Legacy. Benson purchased a 400-acre (1.6 km¬≤) tract of land in the Columbia River Gorge, which included Wahkeena Falls and Multnomah Falls, and deeded it to the City of Portland for a public park. Subsequently, the land was divided to become the Wahkeena Falls Recreation Area, Benson State Park, and Multnomah Falls Recreation Area. Benson also paid for the masonry footbridge across Wahkeena Falls and the reinforced concrete arch pedestrian bridge over the lower Multnomah Falls. Forestry Building at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, Portland In 1905 Benson donated the Forestry Building at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland.Lars Nordstr√∂m: Skogshuggarna i Fj√§rran v√§sterns skogar. . The building was the largest wooden building at the time and it burnt down in 1964.http://www.offbeatoregon.com/1206c-forestry-building-biggest-log-cabin- burned.html The interior was copied in the Glacier Park Lodge. Simon Benson was a tee-totaler and he wanted to discourage his workers from drinking alcohol in the middle of the day. In 1912, Benson gave the City of Portland $10,000 for the installation of twenty bronze drinking fountains. These fountains, known as \\"Benson Bubblers\\", are still in use in downtown Portland. Today there are 52 Benson fountains, most in Portland but also one in Sapporo, Japan (since 1965), the first of Portland's sister cities; one at the Maryhill Museum of Art in the Columbia River Gorge; and since 2012 one in Pendleton, Oregon. Conservationist Francis J. Murnane was instrumental in preserving the bubblers, his first successful project. Benson was chosen to represent Oregon at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915, as the state's \\"First Citizen.\\" In 1916, Benson gave the Portland School District $100,000 to help fund the building of a polytechnic school. Finished in 1918, the school was first used for the training of soldiers for World War I. It was re-opened to high school students in January 1919 and renamed Benson Polytechnic. In 1921, after moving to Beverly Hills, California, Benson deeded the city of Portland nine acres overlooking the Willamette River between North Greeley and Going Streets. The land was later dedicated as Madrona Park. Simon Benson Award The Simon Benson Award was created in 1999 to honor the region's contemporary pioneers of philanthropy. Portland State University's Simon Benson Award honors philanthropists who have made a lasting impact in the region.Simon Benson Awards Dinner Footnotes Further reading * Alice Benson Allen, Simon Benson: Northwest Lumber King.

They entered the music scene of Antwerp in 1993, still under the name A Beatband with the EP Jintro Travels The Word In A Skirt. The group is typical of the music scene in Antwerp, with members playing in numerous other groups. The best known member is singer, musician and composer Stef Kamil Carlens, who founded the group together with Aarich Jespers and also played in dEUS. The same group released Everyday I Wear A Greasy Black Feather On My Hat under the name Moondog Jr. in 1995. Shortly thereafter they encountered legal trouble over the name Moondog with Louis T. Hardin, and changed it to Zita Swoon (Zita = intense, Swoon = desire). The success of this album was awarded with invitations to the Lowlands, Pinkpop and Rock Werchter festivals. The same year they also appeared live on MTV in Most Wanted with Michael Blair. Their first appearance in the US was at the South by Southwest festival in 1998. Zita Swoon has played in numerous locations, from New York to the Belgian Rock Werchter festival, the Holland Festival, as well as in Germany. In early 1999 their work was recognized by the Flemish government with a grant of 1.5 million Francs and the title Cultural Ambassador of Flanders (a title previously awarded to DAAU and dEUS). In 2009 Stef Kamil Carlens participated with Lexus Concert, a 'hybrid' concert where Stef does a crossover concert at Klara festival with a musician from a totally different style and background. The winner of Lexus concert wins a private try out concert on board a new Lexus RX 450h.

It uses as a narrative framing device the format of being a transcription of tape recordings of interviews made in preparation for writing a biography of the now-dead 'Papa Francesco'.Galeotti uses the Italian version ‚Äî \\"Papa Francesco\\" ‚Äî throughout his narration. The four interviewees are, in order: Master Gunnery Sergeant Giuseppe Michelangelo Guicciardini, Jr., USMC retired, who recounts Walsh‚Äôs wartime experiences; Associate Justice of the Supreme Court C. Bradley Walker, III, who recounts the circumstances leading to Walsh‚Äôs appointment, career, and eventual resignation as Chief Justice; Ugo Cardinal Galeotti, who recounts the election of Declan Walsh (at the time a simple monk who had resigned as Chief Justice after the death of his wife) by a bitterly deadlocked conclave and his subsequent career as Papa Francesco; and Walsh‚Äôs Papal Press Secretary Robert Twisdale, who recounts the assassination and funeral of Papa Francesco.

Collectively, they are known as fungus moths or tineid moths. The family contains considerably more than 3,000 species in more than 300 genera. Most of the tineid moths are small or medium-sized, with wings held roofwise over the body when at rest. They are particularly common in the Palaearctic, but many occur elsewhere, and some are found very widely as introduced species. Tineids are unusual among Lepidoptera as the larvae of only a very small number of species feed on living plants, the majority feeding on fungi, lichens, and detritus. The most familiar members of the family are the clothes moths, which have adapted to feeding on stored fabrics and led to their reputation as a household pest. The most widespread of such species are the common clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella), the case-bearing clothes moth (Tinea pellionella), and the carpet moth (Trichophaga tapetzella); the brown-dotted clothes moth (Niditinea fuscella) despite its name, preferentially feeds on feathers in bird nests. One remarkable genus is Ceratophaga, whose members feed exclusively on pure keratin in the form of the horns and hooves of dead mammals and even the shells of dead tortoises.

Only one prototype was built in 1944, although its testing was relatively successful and negotiations began for another series of three to test the necessary changes before beginning series production in 1945. These plans were cancelled at the beginning of that year when the decision was made to concentrate production on designs already being built. Background and description The Neger and Marder human torpedoes and the Biber midget submarines were difficult to launch from anywhere other than a harbor. The special preparations required to do so limited their operational flexibility and required additional time and resources. Alois L√∂dige and several of his colleagues of the Kiel-Eckernf√∂rde torpedo testing center developed the concept of putting tracks on a midget submarine to allow it to move on and off a beach under its own power. They designed and built a proof-of-concept vehicle in early 1944 that was tested in March. The one-man (special vessel) was long and displaced without armament. It mounted a pair of torpedoes low on the hull by the tracks.Prenatt & Stille, p. 18; Rossler, p. 292 The prototype Seeteufel was developed in four months and was ready for testing in July. A two-man crew controlled the submarine. It had a beam of and displaced . The submarine was equipped with an gasoline-fueled Otto engine provided propulsion on both water (at on the surface using a single propeller) and land (at ). When submerged, the same electric motor as used in the Seehund (Seal) midget submarine, gave the vessel a cruising speed of . The prototype demonstrated a diving depth of Prenatt & Stille, p. 30; Rossler, p. 292 The Seeteufels engine was in the bow, directly underneath the fixed snorkel mast that also contained the periscope, a radio antenna and the magnetic compass. The control room was aft of this with a low-profile conning tower fitted with the entry hatch. The batteries and the fuel tank were in the middle with the AEG electric motor in the stern. The forward diving planes were fixed, but the rudder and aft diving planes were governed by the driver with his aircraft-like control stick. The boat was equipped with a special ballast tank that compensated for the weight of its armament of a pair of standard G7e torpedoes and prevented it from breaking the surface when the torpedoes were fired. It could carry four naval mines in lieu of the torpedoes. On land it could be equipped with flamethrowers or machine guns. Testing showed that the submarine performed well underwater, but it was considered underpowered on land and the tracks were too narrow. More powerful diesel engines were planned for later models, in addition to wider tracks to spread the load and decrease ground pressure. The prototype was demonstrated to the management of the Borgward factory in Bremen and negotiations began for the production of three preproduction vessels to test the planned changes.

He is regarded as the father of modern chemotherapy for his work using folic acid antagonists to combat leukemia, which led to the development of other chemotherapeutic agents against other malignancies. Farber was also active in cancer research advocacy and fundraising, most notably through his establishment of the Jimmy Fund, a foundation dedicated to pediatric research in childhood cancers. The Dana‚ÄìFarber Cancer Institute is named after him. Early life He was born in Buffalo, New York, to Jewish parents Simon and Matilda (Goldstein) Farber. He was the third of 14 children. He was the younger brother of the noted philosopher and University of Buffalo professor Marvin Farber (1901‚Äì1980). Farber graduated from University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, or SUNY Buffalo, in 1923. Farber Hall, built in 1953 on the South Campus of SUNY Buffalo, is named for him. In the mid-1920s, Jewish students were often refused admission to US medical schools, prompting him to go to Europe. As Farber was fluent in German, he undertook his first year of medical school at the Universities of Heidelberg and Freiburg in Germany. Having excelled in Germany, Farber entered Harvard Medical School as a second-year student and graduated in 1927. Farber pursued postgraduate training in pathology at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (the predecessor of Brigham and Women's Hospital) in Boston, Massachusetts, where he was mentored by Kenneth Blackfan, and was appointed to a resident pathologist post at Children's Hospital in 1929. Career Following postgraduate training, Farber became an Instructor in Pathology at Harvard Medical School in 1929. That same year, he was also appointed the first full-time pathologist to be based at Children's Hospital, where he became a close mentee and friend of pathologist Simeon Burt Wolbach. Farber was an extremely meticulous and precise scientist, and his laboratory become known for its tidiness. In 1946, Farber was named Chairman of the Staff at the Children's Hospital, where he managed the Medical Center of Children's and envisioned an Institute for Pediatric Pathology which now exists as the Pediatric Research building. Farber was appointed Pathologist-in-Chief of the Children's Hospital in 1947 and Professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School in 1948. Throughout his career, Farber published more than 270 books and research papers on pediatric pathology, autopsy, and the history of medicine. Many remain classic references today, such as his 1937 book on autopsy methods and techniques titled The Postmortem Examination. =Founder of pediatric pathology= Farber's research was primarily focused on diseases in children and infants. His work at Children's spanned many areas, including cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, infant hyaline membrane disease, Eastern equine encephalitis, eosinophilic granuloma, meconium ileus, and sudden infant death syndrome. As a result, Farber is now known as a founder of pediatric pathology. =Father of modern chemotherapy= Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia Through the mid- to late-1940s, childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia was almost inevitably fatal and little was known about the mechanisms of the disease. Only basic forms of treatment were available, including red blood cell transfusions and antibiotics, leading to survival rates of merely weeks to months after diagnosis. Despite general pessimism in the scientific community towards efforts to cure cancer, Farber became dedicated to the battle against childhood leukemia in 1947 during his assistant professorship at Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Farber discovered that folic acid plays a key role in the proliferation of cancer cells in leukemias. Realizing this, he attempted to use a folate antagonist, aminopterin, to block the function of folic acid in patients with leukemia in hopes of achieving remission. In 1947, Farber conducted a clinical trial on aminopterin on 16 children, 10 of which eventually achieved temporary remission. While many practicing physicians responded to these results with enthusiasm, many scientists expressed disbelief and resistance against the new drug since Farber, a young pathologist at the time, was viewed as presumptuous. However, Farber's discovery marked a breakthrough in cancer research since no drugs had previously been found effective against tumors of the bodily fluids. While working at Harvard Medical School on a research project funded by a grant from the American Cancer Society, he carried out both the preclinical and clinical evaluation of aminopterin (synthesized by Yellapragada Subbarow). He showed for the first time that induction of clinical and hematological remission in this disease was achievable. These findings promoted Farber as the father of the modern era of chemotherapy for neoplastic disease, having already been recognized for a decade as a founder of modern pediatric pathology. Wilms' tumor Throughout the 1950s and '60s, Farber continued to make advances in cancer research, notably the 1955 discovery that the antibiotic actinomycin D and post-operative radiation therapy could produce remission in Wilms' tumor, a pediatric cancer of the kidneys. The antibiotic, derived from Streptomyces parvulus, was originally offered for free by the Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company. Farber and his colleagues published their results on the efficacy of actinomycin D in 1960, and further development of treatment protocols by the National Wilms Tumor Study Group resulted in a 90% survival rate in children with Wilms' tumors by the end of the century. =Other scientific contributions= In 1939, during his appointment at the Children's Hospital, Farber worked with colleague Jerome S. Harris to publish a classic description of the transposition of the great blood vessels in the heart. This work played a major role in the development and advancement of pediatric cardiac surgery. In 1952, Farber described a lipid storage disease that was subsequently named Farber disease. =The Jimmy Fund= Farber began raising funds for cancer research with the Variety Club of New England in 1947. Together they created the Children's Cancer Research Foundation (CCRF), which was one of the first nationwide fundraising efforts to take full advantage of modern media, such as a broadcast of the radio show Truth or Consequences. On May 22, 1948, one of the CCRF's first patients to respond to Farber's antifolate, a twelve-year-old boy named Einar Gustafson, appeared on the show. Despite having Burkitt lymphoma, rather than leukemia, Gustafson (nicknamed 'Jimmy' for publicity purposes) became an inspiration for all pediatric cancer patients and triggered the renaming of the CCRF to the Jimmy Fund. The success of the Jimmy Fund led Farber to realize the importance of marketing in the scientific advancement of knowledge about diseases. For the remainder of his career, Farber would extend far beyond his identity as a pathologist and oncologist, becoming not only a clinician but a public cancer research advocate too. This personal transition reflected the shift in society's attitude towards cancer as well; bringing cancer into the public spotlight propelled funding and awareness for cancer research for the remainder of the century and beyond. =Cancer research advocacy= Beginning in the early 1950s, and continuing until his death in 1973, Farber became a star presenter at Congressional hearings on appropriations for cancer research. A compelling speaker, he was very successful in his efforts. With Mary Woodard Lasker, a longtime advocate of biomedical research, famed surgeon Michael E. DeBakey, Senator J. Lister Hill of Alabama and Congressman John E. Fogarty of Rhode Island, Farber led the drive for a massive expansion in federal spending for cancer research. Between 1957 and 1967, the annual budget of the National Cancer Institute, the government's primary funder of cancer research, jumped from $48 million to $176 million. =Dana-Farber Cancer Institute= In 1974, Farber's CCRF was renamed the Sidney Farber Cancer Center, and again in 1976 to the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute. Long-term financial support by industrialist Charles A. Dana and his foundation was acknowledged by the building of the Charles A. Dana Building in 1978 and the establishment of the Institute's present name of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 1983. Personal life Farber married Norma Farber (formerly Holzman) in 1928, a poet, author of children's books, and classical soprano. On March 30, 1973, at the age of 69, Sidney Farber died from cardiac arrest while working in his office. Upon his death he was survived by his widow, four children, and three grandchildren.

Archaeologists identify several different types including the inverted-bell beaker, the butt beaker, the claw beaker, and the rough-cast beaker. When used alone ‚Äúbeaker‚Äù usually refers to the typical form of pottery cups called inverted-bell beakers associated with the European Beaker culture of the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age. Bell beakers The inverted-bell beaker or bell-beaker was first defined as a find-type by Lord Abercromby in the early twentieth century and comes in three distinct forms, the (typical) bell beaker, and the rarer short-necked beaker, and long-necked beaker. There are many variations on these basic types, with inter-grades between them. Bell- beakers have been found from North Africa to southern Scotland and from Portugal to the far east of Europe, but are particularly common in the Rhine valley and the coasts of the North Sea.

When the decoration covers the whole vessel they are known as all-over corded (AOC) beakers. Where comb designs are used, perhaps along with cord impressions they are called all-over ornamented (AOO) beakers. Some have a looped handle on one side or a white coloured material pressed into the decoration, contrasting with the usual orange or brown ceramic. The traditional archeological interpretation is that the original, typical bell-beaker shape was replaced by the short-necked form, which in turn was replaced by long-necked bell-beakers. However, work by Humphrey Case in the 1990s suggests that all three styles were used contemporaneously, with different shapes used for different purposes.

Professional wrestling career After graduating from Elon College, Kernodle started wrestling in 1973 in the National Wrestling Alliance's Jim Crockett Promotions. He got his start by accepting a \\"shoot\\" wrestling challenge from Bob Roop. Although Roop defeated Kernodle by submission, Kernodle's skills impressed Ole Anderson and Gene Anderson who both offered to train Kernodle for free. At first, he (now known as Pvt. Kernodle) was part of Sgt. Slaughter's \\"Cobra Corps\\" and teamed with Slaughter and Pvt. Jim Nelson. In 1982, the team of Kernodle and Nelson won the NWA Mid- Atlantic Tag Team Championship from Porkchop Cash and Jay Youngblood. They later lost the title to Cash and King Parsons, from whom they also regained the title. After Nelson was removed from the alliance, Kernodle became the tag partner of Sgt. Slaughter, with whom he held the NWA World Tag Team Championship in late 1982 and early 1983. They lost the titles in a steel cage match vs. Rick Steamboat and Jay Youngblood on March 12, 1983. Following the title loss, Kernodle remained a villain and formed a tag team with Bob Orton, Jr. and was managed by Gary Hart. He soon turned against America and formed a tag team with Ivan Koloff and won the NWA World Tag Team Title. When Koloff's \\"nephew\\" Nikita Koloff arrived in late 1984, Kernodle helped to train him. Also in 1984, the Koloffs turned on Kernodle after he and Ivan lost the NWA World Tag Titles to Dusty Rhodes and Manny \\"The Raging Bull\\" Fernandez and started a feud. Kernodle teamed with his brother Rocky to feud with the Koloffs and helped the Rock 'n' Roll Express to win the Tag Team Title from them at Starrcade '85: The Gathering. In 1986, Kernodle left the NWA and wrestled in various independent promotions in the Carolinas. He later became a Sergeant for Immigration Customs Enforcement for Alamance County. Since 2002, Kernodle and his brother have wrestled several times per year with CWF Mid- Atlantic near their home in Burlington, NC. He is now a deputy sheriff with the Alamance County sheriffs office. Other media He appeared in the 1978 Sylvester Stallone movie Paradise Alley.

It runs from US Highway 131 (US 131) at exit 61 outside of Bradley to M-43 just west of Hastings in the Lower Peninsula. The highway crosses through forest land and provides access to state recreational areas. M-179 has been given the Chief Noonday Recreational Heritage Route designation by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). Prior to October 1998, this highway was the eastern portion of county road A-42. The number was formally assigned by the next year. This is not the first time the number was used in Michigan, an unrelated M-179 previously existed in the 1930s through the 1950s farther north. Route description M-179 begins at an interchange with US 131 just west of Bradley. From there, the road travels to the east past the Gun Lake Casino and through the community before bending around the southern edge of Sager Lake. After passing the lake, the highway resumes its easterly course and continues through the rural forest areas of eastern Allegan County, where the road is known as 129th Avenue. M-179 crosses the county line and heads into Barry County north of Gun Lake. The road is then locally known as Chief Noonday Road. Here it continues its eastward trek until it winds its way through the Yankee Springs State Recreation Area. After passing through the recreation area, the road continues to the east passing through wooded area before a slight curve to the north, after which it continues to the east and terminates at a junction with M-43 just west of Hastings. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) maintains the roadway as a part of the state highway system. As a part of this role, the department tracks the average annual daily traffic on its roadways, a calculation of the number of vehicles to use a highway segment on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that 5,622 vehicles in Allegan County and 4,253 vehicles in Barry County used M-179 daily. For the whole length of the highway, the commercial traffic was calculated to be 246 trucks daily in 2009. No section of the highway has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. M-179 has been named the Chief Noonday Trail Recreational Heritage Route (now a Pure Michigan Byway) by MDOT for its \\"natural beauty\\" and access to recreational areas. History The original version of M-179 was established in 1935 as a shortcut near Le Roy between US 131 and what was M-63.

Early life Archie poses with his pony Algonquin in 1902 Quentin on the left, TR, Ted, Archie, Alice, Kermit, Edith, and Ethel As a child, Archie was very quiet but very mischievous ‚Äì especially when he was with his brother Quentin; growing up, Archie and Quentin were very close. They rarely left each other's side and had very few fights. But as for the other siblings, Archie was not close to either Kermit or Ethel, because they would gang up on him. Ted would help beat up Kermit for him and would also tell their mother, Edith, about Ethel, who would often get in trouble. Alice was ten years older than Archie, and he barely remembered her being around, since she would often go places with other family members and friends. Archie was an avid reader and very good at putting puzzles together quickly. His father remarked to him, \\"Archie, my smart boy, never give up your smartness; that goes for you and your brother Quentin.\\" Archie first attended the Force School and Sidwell Friends School. After being expelled from Groton, Archie continued his education at the Evans School for Boys,Theodore Roosevelt (1916) A Book-Lover's Holidays in the Open. New York: Charles Scribner's sons. and graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass., in 1913. He went on to Harvard University, where he graduated in 1917. =Family= Archie was born in Washington, D.C., the fourth child of President Theodore \\"T.R.\\" Roosevelt, Jr. and Edith Kermit Carow. He had three brothers, Ted (Theodore III), Kermit, and Quentin, a sister Ethel, and a half- sister Alice. Archie was named for his maternal great-great-great-grandfather Archibald Bulloch, a patriot of the American Revolution. His first cousin was Eleanor Roosevelt and his fifth cousin, once removed was Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was uncle to Kermit Roosevelt Jr., Joseph Willard Roosevelt, Dirck Roosevelt, Belle Wyatt \\"Clochette\\" Roosevelt, Grace Green Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt III, Cornelius V.S. Roosevelt, and Quentin Roosevelt II. His sister-in-law was Belle Wyatt Willard Roosevelt, and his grandniece was Susan Roosevelt Weld, the former wife of Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld. Military career =World War I and years later= Archie volunteered for the United States Army during 1917, shipped over to France, and was wounded while serving with the U.S. 1st Infantry Division. His wounds were so severe he was discharged from the Army with full disability. He had ended the war as an Army captain. For his valor, Archie received two Silver Star Citations (later converted to the Silver Star medal when it was established in 1932) and the French government's Croix de Guerre. After the death of his father in 1919, he sent a telegram informing all his siblings that \\"the old lion is dead\\". After the end of the war, he worked for a time as an executive with the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Company, as vice president of the Union Petroleum Company, the export auxiliary subsidiary of Sinclair Consolidated. At the same time his eldest brother Ted was Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In 1922, Albert B. Fall, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, leased, without competitive bidding, the Teapot Dome Field to Harry F. Sinclair of Sinclair Oil, and the field at Elk Hills, California, to Edward L. Doheny of Pan American Petroleum & Transport Company, both fields part of the Navy's petroleum reserves. The connection between the Roosevelt brothers could not be ignored. After Sinclair sailed for Europe to avoid testifying, G. D. Wahlberg, Sinclair's private secretary, advised Archibald Roosevelt to resign to save his reputation. Eventually, after resigning from Sinclair, Roosevelt gave key testimony to the Senate Committee on Public Lands probing the Teapot Dome scandal, in which Roosevelt was not implicated, but where Sinclair and Doheny both gave \\"personal loans\\" to Secretary Fall. Following this, Roosevelt took a job working for a cousin in the family investment firm, Roosevelt & Son. In the summer of 1932, Archie, former President Calvin Coolidge, former Solicitor General William Marshall Bullitt, Admiral Richard E. Byrd, and General James Harbord, among others, formed a conservative pressure group known as the National Economy League, which called for balancing the federal budget by cutting appropriations for veterans in half. =Meeting with Qazi Muhammad of Republic of Mahabad= In 1942, Captain Archibald Roosevelt met with the Kurdish president, Qazi Muhammad, of the Republic of Mahabad in Mahabad, Iran, shortly before the creation of the Soviet-backed Kurdish republic.

At the time of his injury, command of his battalion passed to his executive officer, Major Taylor. Archie returned to his unit in early 1944.

He joined the John Birch Society and was the founder of the Veritas Foundation, which was dedicated to rooting out presumed socialist influences at Harvard and other major colleges and universities. Writing in the book America's Political Dynasties (Doubleday, 1966), Stephen Hess commented: \\"Archie Roosevelt has, in recent years, added the family's name to many ultra-rightist causes.

During the course of those years, it broke colonial ties with Spain, waged a civil war to define its organization and wars with Brazil, Paraguay, Britain and France. The military also played a role in the institutional life of the country, during a series of coups d'√©tat that took place in the 20th century.  Before independence  William Beresford surrenders to Santiago de Liniers after the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata. One of the first notable military conflicts taking place in modern Argentina were the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata, involving both Buenos Aires and Montevideo (currently part of Uruguay). As part of the Napoleonic Wars, a British force led by William Carr Beresford occupied Buenos Aires on June 27. The French Santiago de Liniers moved to Montevideo and led the forces that would reconquer Buenos Aires on August 12, 1806. The Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte, who had fled from the city to C√≥rdoba, was not allowed to return, and Liniers was trusted to organize the defense of the city against a possible British counter-attack. For this end he drafted all men capable to bear arms, regardless of their social condition (including slaves), and formed militias to defend the city. The Regiment of Patricians, composed of criollo people, was created during this time. The second invasion took place the following year. A new British army, much bigger than the first one, invaded first Montevideo and then moved to Buenos Aires, led by Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke. The British found a strong resistance and were forced to surrender, and return Montevideo to the viceroyalty. As a result of the invasions, Sobremonte was removed as viceroy, and replaced by Liniers. The Regiment of Patricians, led by Cornelio Saavedra, became a strong political force in Buenos Aires, and was instrumental to the failure of the Mutiny of √Ålzaga and the success of the May Revolution.  19th century  = War of independence = Depiction of the Crossing of the Andes, where a combined army of Argentine and Chileans invaded Chile, leading to its liberation from Spanish rule. The May Revolution ousted the Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros and replaced him with a junta, the Primera Junta. The viceroyalty was also renamed, removing the \\"viceroyalty\\" word from it, and it nominally became the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata. However, the status of the different territories that used to belong to the viceroyalty changed many times during the development of the war, as some regions would remain loyal to the former organization, others were captured or recaptured, and later they would divide into several countries. The first military campaigns against the royalists were waged by Manuel Belgrano and Juan Jos√© Castelli. The Army of the North led by Castelli was headed first by Ortiz de Ocampo and defeated a counter-revolution organized by Liniers at C√≥rdoba. Castelli took command to enforce the execution of the captured royalists, and then moved to the Upper Peru. He took control of it for a brief time, and was defeated by Goyeneche at the Battle of Huaqui. Belgrano led an ill-fated campaign to Paraguay, and created the Flag of Argentina when preparing the defenses of Rosario against a possible attack from the Banda Oriental (where Montevideo was under siege by Artigas). Belgrano led a new campaign to the Upper Peru, achieving military victories at Salta and Tucuman, but being defeated at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma. By this time Jos√© de San Mart√≠n arrived to Buenos Aires with other generals of the Peninsular War. They gave new strength to the Revolutionary war, which was compromised by the defeats of Belgrano and Castelli and the royalist resistance at the Banda Oriental. Alvear took Montevideo, and San Mart√≠n started a military campaign that would span across an important part of the Spanish territories in America. First, he created the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers and defeated a Spanish raid at the Battle of San Lorenzo (the only battle that San Mart√≠n fought in Argentine territory). He created the Army of the Andes in Mendoza and, with help of Bernardo O'Higgins nd other Chileans he made the Crossing of the Andes and liberated Chile. With the Chilean navy at his disposal, he moved to Peru, liberating that country as well. San Mart√≠n met Sim√≥n Bol√≠var at Guayaquil, and retired from action. The Congress of Tucum√°n was called while San Mart√≠n was preparing the crossing of the Andes. It declared independence from Spain or any other foreign power. = After independence = The Argentine Navy during the Battle of Juncal, The battle saw Argentines capture 12 ships, and deny the Brazilians use of the Uruguay River for the rest of the Cisplatine War. After the Argentine independence from Spain, a history of military conscription emerged and that this tradition of mandatory military service began in 1896 with the First Conscription (Servicio Militar Obligatorio) where 20-year-old men were drafted by a decree of President Jos√© Evaristo Uriburu and lasted until 1994. This policy persisted owing to numerous conflicts that Argentina was involved in previously after its independence and the foreseen territorial conflicts with neighboring countries. For instance, 1825 saw the outbreak of the Argentina-Brazil War over the control of Uruguay, then called Banda Oriental. This war ended with the independence of Uruguay in 1828. The Argentine military achieved several victories against Brazil but internal political strife eventually forced them to withdraw and settle for the 1828 Convention of Peace, with the British serving as the intermediary. Several years later, Argentina became involved in a conflict against the United Kingdom and France. This came with the November 20, 1845 Anglo-French blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata. The combined forces from the United Kingdom and France seized control of the Paran√° River in order to establish trade relationships with Paraguayan ports blocked by Argentina. The Army of the Argentine Confederation, commanded by General Lucio Mansilla, expelled the invaders causing severe damage to the 11 warships by shooting from both river's shores, at the cost of 150 Argentines killed and 90 wounded. Although the invading troops took fewer casualties (26 killed, 86 wounded), they decided to leave in order to preserve the remaining ships. It was the last attempt on Argentine rivers by the Royal Navy. Other notable conflicts include the following: * 1864-1870: War of the Triple Alliance. Argentina, the Brazilian Empire and Uruguay invaded and routed the militaristic Paraguay of Francisco Solano L√≥pez, after the strategic Rio Grande do Sul in Southern Brazil was invaded. *1870s: The Conquest of the Desert, a military campaign directed mainly by General Julio Argentino Roca, established Argentine dominance over Patagonia. *1879: The Hydrographic Service was established. 20th century South American dreadnought arms race. From the latter part of the 19th century to the early 20th century, the Argentine military history was characterized by a process of armed forces modernization and technification. The following are key milestones during this period: *1907: The South American dreadnought race between Argentina, Brazil and Chile started. It ends in 1914. *1912: The Argentine Army Aviation created the Army Aviation School at El Palomar, Buenos Aires. * 1914-1918: Argentina remained neutral during World War I by decision of President Victorino de la Plaza. Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen kept a similar policy. It is considered that staying neutral boosted the Argentine economy. *1919: The Argentine Naval Aviation was established. *1921: The Argentine Army was used to eliminate strikers in Santa Cruz. Lt. Col. Varela commanded the operation. Between 1,500 and 3,000 workers were executed. *1930: General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu made a coup d'√©tat and became the first de facto President of Argentina. The military continues overthrowing civilian governments until 1983. *1933: The Argentine Submarine Force was established. = Postwar = After the war, the military's role began to shift from the previous appearance as protector of the constitution and of the people against corruption. Military leaders during the postwar period began increasingly imposing their own rules and standards on the political system so that, in the end, the armed forces came to dominate the political system. This began during World War II, between 1939 and 1945. The civilian government considered joining the allies, but many officers in the armed forces and ordinary citizens objected due to fears over the spread of communism. This was a factor contributing to the military coup of 1943. Pedro Pablo Ram√≠rez, who had been attached to the Kaiser's army and later Mussolini's in the twenties, became dictator. In 1944 he was replaced by Edelmiro Juli√°n Farrell, who had spent two years attached to Mussolini's army. The government maintained a neutral policy but towards the end of the war, Farrell bowed to intense pressure from the United States. Like several Latin American states, Argentina made a late declaration of war against Germany.  Timeline of postwar military history  *1959: The ARA Independencia (V-1) became the first aircraft carrier of the Argentine Navy. *1974-1983: The Dirty War, a period of state-sponsored violence, occurred, as a response to widespread leftist guerrilla movements that threatened the society and civil existence of the country * 1978: After Argentine repudiation of an obligatory arbitration to settle a territorial dispute with Chile concerning the Beagle Channel, General Jorge Rafael Videla moved troops to the Andes mountains. The Argentine Operation Soberan√≠a to invade the islands was stopped with mediation from the Holy See. The crisis lasts up to 1984, over the Falklands War. Argentine soldiers during the 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands. * 1982: Falklands War (). The Argentine Armed Forces invaded the Falkland Islands. In a ten-week war 255 British and 649 Argentines were killed. The war ended with Britain reclaiming the islands. Argentina's defeat caused the collapse of the military junta. * 1990s: Argentina became greatly involved in UN peacekeeping missions around the world. * 1991: Argentine Navy ships and Air Force transport aircraft participated in the 1991 Gulf War. Argentina was the only Latin American country in the coalition. * 1993: Argentina joined the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus replacing the Canadian Forces. As of 2010, ground troops and helicopters continue serving and since 1999 have other Latin American troops within their ranks. * 1995: The murder of young conscript Carrasco caused the end of compulsory conscription.

Ever since people of 18 to 24 years of age can, after signing a compromise, voluntarily enter the Armed Forces and receive a course.

Professional wrestling career =Early career= Vaughan started wrestling in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Pacific Northwest territory as Ricky Vaughan in 1984. He feuded with Bobby Jaggers. =World Class Championship Wrestling= In October 1985, when Mike Von Erich was unable to wrestle due to toxic shock syndrome, Vaughan went to World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) to take his place in the feud against the Fabulous Freebirds. He adopted the name Lance Von Erich and was billed as the son of Fritz Von Erich's \\"brother\\" Waldo. In reality, neither Vaughan nor Waldo were related to the Adkisson family or each other. Kevin Von Erich, as well as most of the family, was adamantly against bringing Vaughan in as another Von Erich, but Fritz was adamant, especially as Kevin and Kerry were wrestling two or three times a day in various places throughout the Texas territory. The deception made the Von Erichs look like liars to their fans, who normally saw them as good guys who could do no wrong. On October 28, 1985, Vaughan wrestled Ric Flair in Fort Worth, Texas, in the last NWA World title match in the World Class territory. The match ended in a no contest; World Class withdrew from the NWA in February 1986. On May 4, 1986 at The 3rd Annual Von Erich Parade of Champions he teamed with Kerry Von Erich and Steve Simpson to defeat The Fabulous Freebirds for the WCWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. On September 1, 1986, he entered in a tournament for the vacant WCWA World Tag Team Championship with Chris Adams. The team made it to the finals where they were defeated by Matt Borne and Buzz Sawyer. Lance got his revenge on November 17, 1986, when he teamed with The Dingo Warrior to capture the titles back from Borne and Sawyer. In October 1986, he wrestled a tour for New Japan Pro Wrestling, most notably his disqualification victory against Kengo Kimura on October 9. When demands for more money in 1987 were not met by Fritz, Vaughan jumped to a rival territory, Wild West Wrestling. In a rare breach of kayfabe, Vaughan's non-relationship to the family was exposed by Fritz on television in retaliation. =Final years= Because the Von Erich surname was a registered trademark, Vaughan wrestled under the ring name Fabulous Lance after leaving World Class. He subsequently wrestled in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council after Wild West Wrestling folded. In May 1993, after a hiatus, Vaughan returned and was back wrestling as Lance Von Erich for promotions such as International Wrestling Federation in Florida and International World Class Championship Wrestling in New York. In December 1993, he wrestled a tour of India. In 1994, he wrestled a tour of South Africa for England's All-Star Wrestling. In 1996, he wrestled a tour of Malaysia for the National Wrestling Alliance, before retiring. Personal life Prior to becoming a wrestler, Vaughan was a real estate agent and he competed in weight-lifiting competitions. After wrestling, he owned health clubs in South Africa.

Biography William Chapman Ralston was born at Wellsville in Columbiana County in eastern Ohio, son of Robert Ralston III and Mary Wilcoxen Chapman. He was known as \\"Chap\\" when he was young. With riches derived from Nevada's Comstock Lode, he became one of the richest and most powerful men in California. He founded the Bank of California and was known for having a nothing-is-impossible attitude. Projects He built Ralston Hall in Belmont, California as a summer home, however his wife Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Fry and their four children lived there all year round. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is now part of the campus of Notre Dame de Namur University. The 1875 Palace Hotel The April 1906 Palace Hotel Fire He built the California Theatre on Bush Street in San Francisco, which opened on January 18, 1869. His dream was the construction of the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, California at the corner of New Montgomery and Market. He spent $5M on its construction, draining his banking empire in the process. John Painter Gaynor was the architect, and had been instructed by Ralston to study European luxury hotels for inspiration. The hotel opened on October 2, 1875. The hotel had early elevators or \\"rising rooms\\" and electric call buttons in the rooms. The hotel survived the 1906 earthquake, but was destroyed in the fire that followed. It was rebuilt and reopened in 1909. There is still a Ralston Room in the hotel, off the main corridor to the left. In 1871, following a severe drought in California, he initiated work on the surveying for an irrigation scheme in the San Joaquin Valley, and his lobbying was successful in securing the passage through Congress in 1873 of an Act to set up a Water Commission to advise on the irrigation of California. He was also involved in Philip Arnold's diamond-mining hoax of 1872. The collapse of his financial empire In 1875, his financial empire collapsed as a result of the combination of the expense of building the Palace Hotel, the failure of his attempt to buy and then resell the Spring Valley Water Company, the after- effects of the Panic of 1873, and a crash in the stock value of the Bank of California. The crash occurred just weeks before the opening of the Palace Hotel.Smith, G.H., 1943, The History of the Comstock Lode, 1850‚Äì1997, Reno: University of Nevada Press, Death and legacy The day after the collapse, his body was found in the San Francisco Bay. He was the victim of either a stroke during his regular swim or suicide. About 50,000 people were said to have watched his funeral procession, and 8,000 of his friends were said by Robert Brereton to have attended the public meeting held in Union Hall on September 8, 1875 to express the community's loss. His partner, U.S. Senator William Sharon, acquired many of his assets, including the Palace Hotel and Ralston Hall. =Namesakes= Ralston Avenue is one of the principal roads in Belmont, California. Ralston Street in Reno, Nevada is named for William Ralston. There are Ralston Avenue exits from both Highway 92 and Highway 101. Ralston Middle School, Ralston Hall, and the William Chapman Ralston Award are all named for him. A small mining town in southwest New Mexico was named Ralston City in honor of William Ralston, its largest investor, but has since been renamed Shakespeare. A very small (pop. 70) town in Iowa is named Ralston. Ralston Lane in Redondo Beach ,CA 90278. is named for William Chapman Ralston. The town of Modesto was to be named for Ralston; he declined, however, and it was called Modesto as one of the Spanish-speaking workers at the naming ceremony for that town said he was \\"muy modesto\\" or very modest. Modesto is home to Ralston Tower, an 11-floor building for the elderly. It is the second-tallest building in the city. =Popular culture= Ralston was portrayed by Ronald W. Reagan in a 1965 episode of Death Valley Days, \\"Raid on the San Francisco Mint.\\" The episode dramatizes an 1869 event in which Ralston gets the head of the mint drunk in order to persuade him to authorize an exchange of bullion for coins. Vaughn Taylor was cast as financier and adventurer Asbury Harpending. In a 1968 Death Valley Days episode, \\"The Great Diamond Mines\\", narrated by Robert Taylor, the role of Ralston was played by Tod Andrews, who is deceived by two prospectors who claim to have a functioning diamond mine in the desert.

It simulates a flying taxi controlled by thrusters. The game uses sampled speech, including \\"Hey taxi!,\\" \\"Pad one please,\\" \\"Thanks,\\" and \\"Up please.\\" These are said in a variety of voice pitches, creating the feeling of different taxi customers. Gameplay Screenshot In addition to thrusters, the taxi has landing gear that can be switched on or off. Switching landing gear on disables the side thrusters, but landing without landing gear destroys the taxi. The taxi also crashes when colliding with the environment, landing with high velocity or not landing properly (i.e. having only one of the gear stands on the platform while having the other in midair). There are 24 different levels, in sequential order, and the player has to complete all of them. In each level, there is a set of numbered platforms. At regular intervals, a customer materializes out of nowhere, on a randomly selected platform. The player has to fly their taxi to that platform, whereupon the customer will enter the taxi, saying which platform he wants to go to. When the player takes him to that platform, he will pay the taxi fee and tip based upon how fast the trip takes and the smoothness of the landing. After each numbered platform has been successfully visited, the next customer will say \\"Up please\\", whereupon the gate at the top of the level will open. Flying through the gate completes the level. One must also be careful not to land on or hit the customer with the taxi, not only because he will angrily yell \\"HEY!\\" and then disappear, before appearing somewhere else on the platform, but also deduct money from your total earned. This is increasingly difficult on smaller platforms where the platform will barely fit the customer and the taxi. Each level features a different setting or theme (such as a treat-strewn candyland or a snowy winter landscape), and most have some special feature to hinder the player's job. Some of the features include a table tennis ball bouncing across the level, snowflakes falling from the sky, a series of radar masts interfering with the controls, or teleports that send the player to a random location. The taxi also has a limited fuel supply. The fuel level resets at the end of each level, but on some of the more complicated screens it is necessary to refuel. This is accomplished by flying to a special platform marked with an \\"F\\" and containing a gas pump. The player must pay for fuel out of the money he has earned. Passengers do not make allowances for pitstops, and their tip will continue to decrease as the player tanks up. The taxi's fuel consumption is based upon the time spent in the air, not how much the thrusters are used, so if a player needs to get from one side of the screen to the other, it consumes less fuel (though is more dangerous) to accelerate halfway across the screen and then reverse thrust, than to use one small thrust to move slowly across the screen and occasional upward thrusts to maintain altitude. After completing all levels, the player gets to a special \\"mystery level\\", in which the player is greeted with the message \\"Welcome to... MUSEWORLD\\" and three platforms, each with a figure relating to another Muse Software game: an ambulance representing Rescue Squad (1983, also John Kutcher), the soldier with Hakenkreuz for Castle Wolfenstein (1981, Silas S. Warner), and a shooting robot relating to RobotWar (1981, Silas S. Warner). Development Kutcher wrote Space Taxi while a freshman at Hopkins University. The physics in the game were influenced by Lunar Lander. Legacy Space Taxi was cloned several times for the Amiga, once keeping the original name and once as AirTaxihttp://airtaxigame.com/. A similar game on the PC was called Ugh!, where the player controls a caveman with a flying contraption. For Windows Phone a remake of the first eight levels was published in 2012 as Sketch Taxi. Space Taxi 2, an authorized sequel to Space Taxi, was released by Twilight Games in 2004. It is no longer available Space Cab is a tribute to Space Taxi created for the Atmega 32u4 based Arduboy game system. Space Cab can also be played through online emulation.

Career as writer =Writing for stage and radio= While practicing law in Hartsdale, New York, he began to write plays. Great Scott (1929), Give Us This Day (1933), and In Time to Come (1941) were produced on Broadway.Internet Broadway Database. His radio work in the 1930s as a writer for the CBS Mercury Theater of the Air included the Orson Welles radio drama The War of the Worlds (1938), which allegedly caused nationwide panic among some listeners for its documentary-like portrayal of an invasion of spaceships from Mars. Koch later wrote a play about the panic, Invasion from Mars, which was later adapted into the 1975 TV movie, The Night That Panicked America, in which actor Joshua Bryant plays Koch. =Screenwriting and blacklisting= Koch began writing for Hollywood studios. His first accepted screenplay was made into a 1940 film. Koch contributed to the popular film Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart, which he co-scripted with writers Julius and Philip Epstein in 1942, and for which he received an Academy Award in 1944. He also wrote Shining Victory (1941) and Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948), his favorite screenplay. In 1943, at the request of Jack L. Warner of Warner Bros., Koch wrote the screenplay for Mission to Moscow (1943). The movie subsequently spawned controversy because of its positive portrayal of Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union. After the war, Koch was fired by Jack Warner after Koch was denounced as a Communist. He was then criticized by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) for his outspoken leftist political views. Koch was blacklisted by Hollywood in 1951. After being blacklisted, Koch moved with his wife Anne (an accomplished writer in her own right) and their family to Europe and eventually took up residence in the United Kingdom with other blacklisted writers, where they wrote for five years for film and television (The Adventures of Robin Hood among them) under the pseudonyms \\"Peter Howard\\" and \\"Anne Rodney\\".

The village hosts a large department store, Gek√•s. It is the largest store in both Sweden and Scandinavia, and the growth of the store has made Ullared more or less synonymous with low prices among Swedes. A large number of stores, usually in the lower price range, have been established in the village since the early 1990s. History Historical railway crossing Two railways built in the late 19th century and early 20th century, the Falkenberg railway (Falkenberg‚ÄìLimmared, also called Pyttebanan) and Wb√ÑJ (Varberg‚Äì√Ñtran 1911‚Äì1961), had a station in Ullared, which gave it an advantage compared to surrounding villages. The railways closed around 1960. The following decade saw a lot of housing construction and the establishment of many shops and an increase in publishing services. Pyttebanans hike and bicycle path Portions of the Pyttebanan is today restored as hiking and bicycle path. Signs along the path show the history of the railway. Today's track starts in Ullared running towards Fridhemsberg. At the entry of Fridhemsberg it crosses the road. Here a building still holds the old sign \\"Fridhemsberg\\"s station. Further the track crosses small rivers and streets. It is a well maintained track not only popular in summer. Building of today's municipality The municipality merged with K√§llsj√∂ and Fagered in the 1950s, during the reform by which parish sized municipalities merged to form new units. The next reform in 1971 lead to the village becoming a part of Falkenberg Municipality. The council adopted a general plan for the village in 2005.Ullared - Falkenbergs kommun The plan assign √Ñngaberg (an area behind the school) as suitable for residential buildings. Areas to the east of the village are assigned to retailing. A new road is planned between county road 154 and Gek√•s, in order to relieve traffic congestion on the central parts of the village. There are long term plans to change the route of county road 154. Facilities Apelskolan is a school with about 500 pupils, aged 6 to 15. The village also has a clinic, motel, fire station, care home, slalom slope and a campsite. The village obtains water from √Ñngaberg. The area behind Gek√•s' parking is today Sweden's largest all-year-round campground. There are spaces for RVs, tents as well as cabins for rent. Nearby a lake is located for swimming. Buses transfer campers to Gek√•s and back. Gek√•s continuously expands and dominates the small village of Ullared. In 2016 new parking lots with multiple stories opened to meet the number of visitors. A small hill of granite has been removed to build this parking. Gek√•s, founded by G√∂ran Karlsson in 1963, is considered as Scandinavia's largest shopping center. Geography Several lakes surround Ullared: Kinnasj√∂n, Sonner√§ngssj√∂n and Musasj√∂n. A stream, H√∂gvads√•n, and its tributary, Hj√§rtareds√•n, flows through the village. The village is surrounded by hills, and therefore requires an auxiliary transmitter in order to receive terrestrial television. The northern part of the village, \\"Furet\\", is dominated by detached houses, as is the southern and western parts. The centre is dominated by retailing and there is a minor industrial estate in the southern part called Hedens industriomr√•de. Climate Ullared has a hybrid climate between maritime and continental. Since the station's inception, it has been arguably the wettest in Sweden. The inland position renders vast temperature swings a possibility under conditions favourable to those, such as summer highs above during heat waves and winter nights below . In winter, freeze-thaw cycles are common, with both rain and snow being frequent. Summer thunderstorms are rather common in the area due to the convection between various air masses. Economy Ullared is dominated by retailing, with not just Gek√•s, but also a large number of other retailers, of different sizes. In total, there are 1,300 workplaces, and as a result commuting is common.

It is one of the most desolate parts of the Sahara Desert. Geographic features Tanezrouft is a barren plain extending to the west of the Hoggar mountains and to the southeast of the sandy Erg Chech. It is composed of differing materials: the Tanezrouft contains mostly sandstone deposits, whereas the Hoggar formations are metamorphic rocks. The Tanezrouft's sandstone hills contain steep canyon walls, some rising to 500 meters elevation. Numerous sand dunes rise from sandy stretches, interspersed with sandstone outcrops. The terrain shows stark evidence of long-ago water erosion (when the Sahara Desert's climate was much wetter; present annual rainfall is much less than 20 mm). In the present era the terrain is being shaped by wind erosion, which occurs much faster than in other areas, since there is little or no vegetation to hold the surface in place. The area is known for aridity and extreme heat, and high temperatures in summer can easily reach 52 ¬∞C (125.6 ¬∞F) or more.

It is the administrative center of the Buchach Raion, and rests south-east of Lviv, in the historic region of Halychyna (Galicia). The city was located in Habsburg Monarchy (1772‚Äî1804), Austrian empire (1804‚Äî1867), Austro-Hungary (1867‚Äî1918), West Ukrainian People's Republic (1918‚Äî1919), and Poland (1919‚Äî1939). History The earliest recorded mention of Buchach is in 1260 by Bartosz Paprocki in his book \\"Gniazdo Cnoty, zkƒÖd herby Rycerstwa Polskiego sw√≥j poczƒÖtek majƒÖ\\", Krak√≥w, 1578.Bartosz Paprocki, Gniazdo Cnoty, zkƒÖd herby Rycerstwa Polskiego sw√≥j poczƒÖtek majƒÖ... Krak√≥w: drukarnia Andrzeia Piotrkowczyka 1578, s. 609. pol. The validity of this date was reasonably refuted by the Polish scientist J√≥zef Apolinary Rolle.Dr. Antoni J.: Zameczki podolskie na kresach multa≈Ñskich. T. I : Kamieniec nad Smotryczem. Warszawa: nak≈Çadem Gebethnera i Wolffa, 1880, s. 10. pol. In 1349, the region of Halychyna (Galicia) became part of the Kingdom of Poland. As a part of Ruthenian Voivodeship remained in Poland from 1434 until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland). It was during this time that the area experienced a large influx of Polish, Jewish and Armenian settlers. In the late 14th century, Polish nobleman (szlachta), Micha≈Ç Awdaniec, Abdank coat of arms became the owner of the town on 1360-s or 1370-s. On July 28, 1379, Micha≈Ç Awdaniec founded a Roman Catholic parish church, and built a castle. agreed to grant Magdeburg rights to Buchach (Buczacz): it was first Magdeburg-style city, located in the Halych Land. In the early 15th century, the Awdaniec family of Buchach changed its last name into Buczacki, after its main residence. Frequent invasions of the Crimean Tatars brought destruction to the town, and in 1515, it once again received the Magdeburg rights. In 1558 Katarzyna Tworowska nee Buczacka get the king's grant for market in Buchach. In 1580, local castle was rebuilt: the castle was twice besieged by the Tatars (1665, 1667), who finally captured it in 1672, during the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1672‚Äì1676). Buchach was a temporary residence of Mehmed IV; here, on October 18, 1672, the Treaty of Buchach was signed between Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire. According to this treaty, Poland handed the provinces of Ukraine and Podolia to Turkey. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Buchach belonged to the Potocki family. Miko≈Çaj Bazyli Potocki, the Starosta of Kaniv, Bohuslav, the son of Stefan Aleksander Potocki, Voivode of Belz, who became a Greek-Catholic about 1758, built here Buchach cityhall with a 35-meter tower (near 1751), a late Baroque Roman Catholic Church of Assumption of Mary (1761‚Äì1763), and rebuilt the castle, destroyed by the Turks. With the unification of Poland and Lithuania in 1569, the newly united kingdom extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Owing to its importance as a market town, Buchach had become a prominent trading centre linking Poland and the Ottoman Empire. The old town hall of Buchach, a joint work of architect Bernard Meretyn and sculptor Johann Georg Pinsel. In 1772, Eastern GaliciaDue to polish authors, Red Ruthenia. together with other areas of south-western Poland, became a part of Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria ‚Äî a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as part of the First Partition of Poland. Industry came to Buchach around the end of the 19th century. Among the small- scale industries there included a brickworks, and candle and soap factory, (modern) flour mills, a textile plant, and a necktie factory. The town also boasted a brewery and a winery. The largest factory was established early in the 1900s, when the Hilfesverein concern of Vienna set up a plant for the manufacture of wooden toys in Buchach employing some 200 workers, mainly young girls. In 1912 the Stanislaviv-based Savings and Credit Union opened a branch in Buchach, and this served as a bank for local industrialists and business. Buchach remained a part of Austria and its successor states until the end of the First World War in 1918. The town was briefly a part of the independent West Ukrainian People's Republic before it was captured by the Republic of Poland in July 1919 after Ukrainian-Polish War.Andrzej Chojnowski, Ukrainian- Polish War in Galicia, 1918‚Äì19 in the Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 5 (1993) Also, between August 10 and September 15, 1920, it was occupied by the Red Army (see Polish-Soviet War). In the Second Polish Republic, Buchach was the seat of a county (powiat) in Tarnopol Voivodeship. In the 1920s, Buchach was inhabited by Jews (~60%), Poles (~25%), and Ukrainians (~15%). Before World War II, as many as 10,000 Jews (half of the local population) lived in Buchach. During the Nazi occupation of western Poland in 1939-early 1941, more Jewish refugees arrived in the town. On September 18, 1939, during the Soviet Invasion of Poland, Buchach was occupied by the Red Army, and incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR (see Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact). Before they left, the Soviets murdered civilians, mostly Ukrainian, and left them in the jails of Buchach and Czortkow. During the Soviet occupation, many Jews and Christians were deported to the Soviet Union. Other Jews fled east when the Germans arrived. After the Soviets left, but before the Germans arrived in July 1942, Ukrainian militia looted and murdered Jewish residents of the town. Then in August, the Ukrainians assisted the German police in a mass shooting of 400 or so Jewish professionals and craftsmen. After the initial mass murder in August 1941, the Jewish community remained relative intact, living in a ghetto, until October 1942, when the Gestapo, aided by Ukrainian and Jewish police, rounded up nearly 2000 Jews, shot hundreds, and sent about 1600 to Belzec. Some survivors report that the Ukrainian mayor was fair to the Jews until fall 1941 when control reverted to the German security police and their Ukrainian auxiliaries. In November, 2500 more were sent to Belzec and more were shot in Buchach. In February 1943, about 2000 were led to Fodor Hill where they were shot and pushed into mass graves. Megargee reports that there was so much blood that the city's water supplies were polluted. The final major Aktion took place in April when 4000 Jews were shot on Fedor Hill and others in the streets. In May 1943, Buchach was proclaimed Judenfrei town. During this time, some Jews were able to hide in the forests or join partisan bands. A few hid with Polish or Ukrainian friends. When Buchach was liberated by the Soviet army in March 1944, about 800 Jews were still alive. However, a counter offensive brought the Germans back to Buchach a few weeks later and the Germans hunted down the Jews. They were assisted by townspeople, many of whom were eager to point out hiding places. Property formerly owned by Jews was now in their hands and they feared Jewish revenge. When the Soviet army returned in July, fewer than 100 Jews had survived. Several of Buchach's survivors have published memoirs of this period, and a diary of Arah Klonicki-Klonymus who tried to hide in the forests with his wife and baby but was murdered is also well known. A detailed analysis of the murders of the Jews in Buchach in light of its history is told by Omar Bartov, Anatomy of a Genocide: The Life and Death of a Town Called Buczacz. In 1945, its Polish residents were resettled into the lands of western Poland that had previously been German, and Communist authorities closed the parish church, turning it into a storage facility. Bones of the members of the Potocki family, kept in the church cellar, were thrown out, and later buried at the local cemetery. In 1965, the neighboring village of Nahirianka was annexed to Buchach. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Buchach became a part of independent Ukraine, and new, Ukrainian government returned the church to its rightful owners. There is no longer a Polish or Jewish community in Buchach. Coat of arms The coat of arms of Buchach originated from the Pi≈Çawa coat of arms, which was used by the Potocki family.

Professional wrestling career =Early career (1982‚Äì1984)= Haynes started wrestling in 1982 at the age of 28. He trained in Stu Hart's Dungeon pro wrestling school and briefly wrestled in Hart's Stampede Wrestling under his given name, forming a tag team with Bruce Hart. He started wrestling as Billy Jack in the Pacific Northwest territory but had to change his name when Tom Laughlin (who starred in the movie Billy Jack) threatened to sue him. He added his real last name to the gimmick and continued to work as a babyface. It is rumored that Haynes served time for manslaughter before becoming a pro wrestler.https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/midcard-faces-billy-jack-haynes/ =Championship Wrestling from Florida and Pacific Northwest Wrestling (1984‚Äì1986)= He feuded heavily with Rip Oliver until 1984, when he had a run in Championship Wrestling from Florida where he feuded with Kendo Nagasaki for the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship winning the title from him. They then had a brief run in World Class Championship Wrestling in 1985, managed by Sunshine. Due to internal conflict between Fritz Von Erich and Billy, he was written out of the organization, jobbing to Rip Oliver in a storyline where Rip bloodies and injured Billy. He rarely stayed put in any federation that he went to. During that time he faced off against the debuting Shawn Michaels. He started splitting his time between Portland Wrestling and CWF and wrestled with partner Wahoo McDaniel and won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship and in Jim Crockett Promotions where they feuded with Ole and Arn Anderson. He had just begun a feud with The Barbarian over who was the strongest man in the territory when he abruptly left the company after a confrontation with Jim Crockett in his office which became physical. =World Wrestling Federation (1986‚Äì1988)= In 1986, Haynes went to the World Wrestling Federation and feuded with Randy Savage over the Intercontinental Championship and then with Hercules Hernandez over who was stronger, more muscular, and who had a better version of the full nelson (their mutual finishing maneuver). Their feud in the WWF peaked with what was dubbed \\"The Battle of the Full Nelsons\\" at WrestleMania III, where the two men battled to a double count-out. After the bell, Hercules' manager Bobby Heenan kneed Haynes in the back while he had Hercules in a full nelson out on the floor. Haynes chased Heenan into the ring where Hercules blindsided him with his trademark chain, hitting Haynes multiple times and (Kayfabe) cutting his forehead (in reality, Haynes had bladed himself with a small razor hidden in the tapes around his wrists after the first hit. He was actually seen on camera taking the razor out of his wrist tapes while chasing Heenan around the ring). In the months to follow, the two had a series of \\"chain matches,\\" where they were attached at the wrist by a foot long chain which could also be used as a weapon during the match. Haynes later teamed with fellow Oregon native Ken Patera who had returned to the WWF. Haynes saved Patera from a beating at the hands of Hercules and Harley Race after Patera's return match. The pair would later feud with Demolition after a television match where Demolition left Haynes, Patera, and Brady Boone (who played Haynes' cousin) beaten and lying in the ring. Haynes' departure from the WWF has been a subject of controversy considering dramatic changes in the story as Haynes repeated it. In one version, he says he quit the WWF after refusing to do a job in his hometown of Portland, Oregon.http://www.rfvideo.com/index.asp?PageAction=Custom&ID;=204 Another account of the same incident reported that he actually wrestled the match with the finish reworked and then was fired afterwards. =Later career (1988‚Äì1996)= Haynes went back to Oregon in 1988 and wrestled in their independents, including forming his own promotion, Oregon Wrestling Federation. In the summer of 1989, he returned to Portland and immediately feuded with The Grappler. By the end of the year, he would form an alliance with former rival Rip Oliver and his son Larry. On April 14, 1990, he turned on the Olivers during a match with The Grappler, The Equalizer, and Brian Adams, turning heel for the first time in his career. As a heel, he feuded with the Olivers, Scott Norton, and Scotty the Body. In October 1990, he did several shows for Herb Abrams' Universal Wrestling Federation, where they built up another strongman feud between Haynes and Ken Patera. In May 1991, Haynes returned to the major promotions when he appeared under a mask in World Championship Wrestling as Black Blood in Kevin Sullivan's stable. Soon after The Great American Bash, he was fired in July 1991, due to a pay dispute. At the time he was fired, he suffered a severe knee injury. Instead of recuperating, he went back to Portland, where he feuded with top babyface Steve Doll and Demolition Crush. After PNW shut down in 1992, Haynes took time off to recover from his knee injury he suffered in WCW, which took eighteen months to fully recover from. His first matches back was in June 1994, where he wrestled shows that were co-promoted by PNW's successor Championship Wrestling USA and Mexico's Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n in Vancouver, Washington. He showed up next in the United States Wrestling Association in 1995 and retired in early 1996. Personal life On March 16, 2013, Haynes was hospitalized because he was suffering from an aortic aneurysm, and liver and kidney issues. In October 2014, the Portland Tribune reported that Haynes filed a lawsuit in federal court against WWE, alleging \\"egregious mistreatment of its wrestlers for its own benefit, as well as its concealment and denial of medical research and evidence concerning traumatic brain injuries suffered by WWE wrestlers.\\" This litigation was taken after research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which was attributed to causing the deaths of Chris Benoit in 2007 and Andrew Martin in 2009. Haynes also sought for the court to grant class action status for hundreds of former wrestlers and to force WWE to establish a medical trust fund to pay for wrestlers who suffer from injuries that took place in a WWE ring. Former WWE stars Vito Lograsso and Adam Mercer filed a class action lawsuit against WWE in January 2015 while being represented by the same lawyer as Haynes, Konstantine Kyros. In March 2016, the suit was dismissed by Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant. At the time of dismissal, dozens of former WWE wrestlers had joined a class action lawsuit under Kyros's counsel. On July 8, 2019, Kyros and the wrestlers (now totaling 67 wrestlers and estates of deceased wrestlers) filed their latest appeal in the class-action lawsuit known as Haynes, Laurinatis, et. al., v.

He is often credited with introducing the bouzouki into Irish music in the mid-1960s. Music career =Sweeney's Men= Known as \\"The Bard of Dalymount\\", he was a co-founder of the band Sweeney's Men with Andy Irvine and 'Galway Joe' Dolan (who was later replaced by Terry Woods). Sweeney's Men broke the mould of Irish music and are credited with starting the folk revival there in the late 1960s. The most famous innovation of Sweeney's Men is probably Moynihan's introduction of the bouzouki, originally a Greek instrument, into Irish music, albeit with a different tuning: GDAD' (one octave lower than the open-tuned mandolin), instead of the modern Greek tuning of CFAD'. However, the original three-course bouzouki used in early Rebetika was also tuned DAD. In his book, The Humours of Planxty, Leagues O'Toole documented that Moynihan bought his first bouzouki from a friend called Tony Ffrench, who had brought it back to Ireland from Greece but decided he couldn't play it, or didn't want to. At first, the other Sweeney's weren't too keen on Moynihan's new instrument, until the evening when he and Irvine worked out an intricate harmony for bouzouki and mandolin while rehearsing Rattlin' Roarin' Willy:Sleeve notes from Sweeney's Men CD, Castle Communications Plc, ESM CD 435, 1996. Later, Moynihan swapped this Greek, round back bouzouki for a pre-war Gibson mandolin. During a subsequent trip to London, he bought a flat back bouzouki from instrument maker John Bailey, who had made it as an experiment after measuring an authentic bouzouki in one of London's Greek restaurants. The group made two albums, Sweeney's Men and The Tracks of Sweeney. The latter was recorded without Irvine, who had taken himself off to the Balkans. Both albums are available on Transatlantic Records. =Planxty, De Dannan and Fleadh Cowboys= In 1973, Moynihan briefly joined Planxty for their album Cold Blow and the Rainy Night. After Planxty, Moynihan replaced Irvine in De Dannan in 1976 and can be heard on their second album, Selected Jigs, Reels & Songs, released in 1977 but never re-issued on CD. Also in 1976, he recorded with Maddy Prior & June Tabor (the Silly Sisters) and with Tony Hall. For a time, he also fronted the Fleadh Cowboys, a popular band in 1980s Dublin. =Solo gigs and Moonshine= Moynihan performs regularly at the Cobblestone Pub, Smithfield, Dublin. In 2006, Moynihan could also often be seen playing old-time Appalachian music with a trio based in east-Clare and calling themselves 'Frankie, Johnny and Sweetheart' (a pun on the song title Frankie and Johnny). The other members were Swedish Lena Ullmann on clawhammer banjo and American Frank Hall on fiddle; in 2007, they renamed themselves Moonshine.Johnny Moynihan by Leagues O'Toole, July 17, 2009. From the 'Ramblinghouse' website. Retrieved on 11 November 2013 =Reunions= Moynihan reunited with Irvine for a one-off concert in Galway in 2001. It was considered doubtful if he and Irvine would ever play together again. However, they reunited once more, this time billed as Sweeney's Men, for a one-off gig in Rostrevor, County Down on 22 July 2007, with Paul Brady deputising for Joe Dolan who was unwell. Another Sweeney's Men reunion took place when Moynihan, Irvine and Woods performed together again on 16 and 17 June 2012, as part of Irvine's 70th birthday concerts at Vicar Street, in Dublin. It worked so well that they have resumed gigging regularly in Ireland during late 2012 and again in 2013. The world of Moynihan and Sweeney's Men is best summed up in Andy Irvine's song My Heart's Tonight in Ireland from his Rain on the Roof album, available from Irvine's own website.Rain on the Roof by Andy Irvine, 1996. From Andy Irvine's website. Retrieved on 11 November 2013 More information about Moynihan and his career with Sweeney's Men and Planxty can be found in O'Toole's book. Personal life He was famously associated with the folk singer Anne Briggs in the mid-1960s and both of them traded off their mutual inclination for wild behaviour. He plays backing bouzouki on several Anne Briggs songs.

The road was part of the traditional route of the Roman Triumph that began on the outskirts of the city and proceeded through the Roman Forum. In the 5th century BC, the road was supported by a super-structure to protect it from the rain. Later it was paved and during the reign of Nero it was lined with colonnades. The road provided the setting for many deeds and misdeeds of Rome's history, the solemn religious festivals, the magnificent triumphs of victorious generals, and the daily throng assembling in the Basilicas to chat, throw dice, engage in business, or secure justice. Many prostitutes lined the street as well, looking for potential customers. From the reign of Augustus, the Via Sacra played a role in the Apotheosis ceremony by which deceased Roman Emperors were formally deified. The body of the Emperor, concealed under a wax death mask, was carried on a pall from the Palatine hill down the Via Sacra into the Forum, where funeral orations were held before the procession of Knights and Senators resumed its course to the Campus Martius. Course While the western stretch of the Via Sacra which runs through the Forum follows the original ancient route of the road, the eastern stretch between the end of the forum and the Colosseum, which passes underneath the Arch of Titus, is a redirection of the road built after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64. In the Republic and Early Empire, the route forked to the north near the House of the Vestals and passed through a saddle in the Velian Hill, now occupied largely by the Basilica of Maxentius and the modern Via dei Fori Imperiali. As part of his rebuilding program following the fire, Nero essentially straightened the road by redirecting it between the Velian and Palatine Hills, creating grand colonnades on either side for shop stalls and commerce.

This approach implies confidence that the value of the investments will be higher in the future. Investors must not be affected by recency bias, emotions, and must understand their propensity to risk aversion. Investors must buy financial instruments that they expect to appreciate in the long term. Buy and hold investors do not sell after a decline in value. They do not engage in market timing (i.e. selling a security with the goal of buying it again at a lower price) and do not believe in calendar effects such as Sell in May. Buy and hold is an example of passive management. It has been recommended by Warren Buffett, Jack Bogle, Burton Malkiel, John Templeton, Peter Lynch, and Benjamin Graham since, in the long run, there is a high correlation between the stock market and economic growth.{{cite web  url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/070715/pros-cons- passive-buy-and-hold-strategy.asp  title=Pros & Cons Of A Passive Buy And Hold Strategy  first=ZAW THIHA  last=TUN  work=Investopedia  date=August 22, 2019}] Efficient-market hypothesis According to the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), if every security is fairly valued at all times, then there is really no point to trade. Some take the buy and hold strategy to an extreme, advocating that you should never sell a security unless you need the money. However, Warren Buffett is an example of a buy and hold advocate who has rejected the EMH in his writings, and has built his fortune by investing in companies when they were undervalued. Lower costs Others have advocated buy-and-hold on purely cost-based grounds. Costs such as the bid‚Äìask spread are incurred on all transactions, and the buy and hold strategy involves the fewest transactions for a constant amount invested, all other things being equal. Taxation law also has some effect; long-term capital gain taxes may be lower than those incurred from short term trading, and tax may be due only when and if the asset is sold. See Stock market cycles and Market timing. Market timing can cause poor performance.copied from wikipedia article Market timing Return-Chasing Behavior At the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, YiLi Chien, Senior Economist wrote about return-chasing behavior. The average equity mutual fund investor tends to buy MUTUAL FUNDS with high past returns and sell otherwise. Buying MUTUAL FUNDS with high returns is called a ‚Äúreturn- chasing behavior.‚Äù Equity mutual fund flows have a positive correlation with past performance, with a return-flow correlation coefficient of 0.49. Stock market returns are almost unpredictable in the short term. Stock market returns tend to go back to the long-term average. The tendency to buy MUTUAL FUNDS with high returns and sell those with low returns can reduce profit.copied from the wikipedia article Market timing Active Managers fell below their benchmarks Active Managers do not practice \\"Buy and Hold.\\" At least 80% of active managers fell below their respective benchmarks across all domestic equity categories over 15 years.

Originally named after the Archangel St Michael, it is the second-largest city in the Ko≈°ice Region and the seat of the Michalovce District. The city is located on the shore of Lake Sirava, approximately east of the capital Bratislava and immediately adjacent to the border with Ukraine. Michalovce is mostly recognized for its adjacent lakes and volcanic mountains, which generates tourism, and for agriculture as well as the passing Druzhba pipeline. According to the latest census, the population of the town stood at 40,255, with a metropolitan population of 109,121, which ranks it among the largest population centers in eastern Slovakia. History = Early history = The city of present-day Michalovce along with the adjacent lowlands was settled in from the Palaeolithic era. Archaeologists have found prehistoric Homo sapiens skeletons in the region, as well as numerous objects and vestiges by the foot of the Vihorlat mountains, dating from the Neolithic. During the Late Bronze Age, which meant the period of processing bronze as the main metal, the surrounding area was an important cultural and trading center within the Carpathian Basin and, together with the area of the southern Tisa River Basin, played an important part forging relations with areas outside of the Carpathians. The history of Michalovce was significantly influenced by presence of Celtic tribes, starting from the Gallic expansions in the 4th century BC, and later by the Romans. Slovak historians claim that Slavs arrived in the area in the fifth century, first being a part of the empire of the Avars. Although there is no evidence, Slovak historians claim that the area was part of the Great Moravian empire in the ninth century. It is probably unlikely. The town of Michalovce is the place where the legendary Prince Laborec died and was buried according to legends. From the tenth century onwards, the region was part of Hungary. However when the Magyar tribes arrived in the late 800s, the entire region was sparsely populated and there were few actual settlements. Much of Slovak history is based on conjecture, legends and nationalism. After the Ottoman conquest in south central Hungary in the sixteenth century, Hungary was divided, and present-day Michalovce became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, and later Royal Hungary. The town grew significantly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Since the Austrian-Hungarian Ausgleich of 1867, it achieved the status of a large community, and shortly afterward became the seat of one of the districts of Zempl√©n County. = Modern history = The 19th century brought back significant development of the town. In 1828 there were 49 craftsman workshops representing all 22 kinds of craft production of the crafts licences in the region of Zemplin. Until 1874 there were a few industrial factories of local importance in the surroundings of Michalovce (starch factories, distilleries, mill-houses, brickworks) with a limited number of work opportunities. The construction of the railway linking Michalovce with Medzilaborce in 1874, as well as the construction of the first railway linking Hungary with Galicia in 1871, had a profound impact on the production, business, and regional development in and around Michalovce. More food-processing factories and industrial factories ‚Äì a brewery, two brickworks and a steam millhouse ‚Äì were established. Starting in 1876 doctors were employed in the town, as the ≈†tefan Kukura Hospital was established that year. In 1896 the Hungarian language newspaper Felso Zempl√©n was published. In 1805 a common school is founded, which later changed into a state school. In 1804 a post office was established, and in 1873 a printing office was established. In 1885, by a decision of the municipal council, a fire brigade was founded, and the first public lighting was provided. Unemployment, being a widespread side- effect of the 18th century, resulted in the emigration of mainly farmers. Many left to seek work in the coal mining industry in Pennsylvania, United States, giving rise to a large Rusyn American community there. After World War I, in 1918 (confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920), Michalovce, along with some other parts of Zempl√©n County, became part of the then-formed Czechoslovakia. In late summer and early autumn (august/september) 1944, 3500 Jewish inhabitants were deported from Michalovce. Since 1993, with the breakup of Czechoslovakia, Michalovce has been part of Slovakia. In 1996 it was made the seat of the Michalovce District. The previous agricultural character of Michalovce was changed by a number of newly established industrial factories after 1945. In the 1950s and 1960s, factories processing agricultural products, and textile, engineering and construction companies arose. These included Agricultural Business and Supply Company, East-Slovak Dairy, East- Slovak Bakery and Confectionery, Slovak Malt Plant, East-Slovak Poultry Plant, Clothing Company and Odeta, a production company. During the early 1960s, construction of the Druzhba pipeline was a major source of employment. Geography The town lies in the Ko≈°ice Region, in the Eastern Slovak Lowland on the Laborec river, historically belonging to Zempl√©n County. The town is about east of Ko≈°ice and west of Uzhhorod, Ukraine. Geographical features nearby include the Vihorlat Mountains and the Zempl√≠nska ≈°√≠rava lake. Nearby is the biggest lake of the Vihorlat Mountains, Morsk√© oko, Vinn√© castle and Vinn√© lake. Demographics In 1910, Michalovce had 6120 residents, of whom 3792 were Hungarian, 1586 Slovak and 542 German. The religious makeup was 38.6% Roman Catholic, 32.3% Jewish and 23.2% Greek Catholic. After World War II, due to the Presidential Benes decrees, almost the entire population of the region's ethnic Hungarians and Germans (including the region's native Carpathian Germans) were forcibly expelled. Those remaining were assimilated and subjected to Slovakization. According to the 2001 census, the town had 39,948 inhabitants. 94.57% were Slovaks, 2.24% were Roma, 0.73% were Czechs and 0.47% were Ukrainian. The religious makeup was 53.92% Roman Catholics, 19.65% Greek Catholics, 9.73% people with no religious affiliation and 5.19% Orthodox. According to the 2011 census, the town had 40,027 inhabitants. 79.53% of the inhabitants were Slovaks, 3.09% were Roma, 0.39% were Czechs and 0.36% were Ukrainians. 15.47% did not specify a nationality. The religious makeup was 42.07% Roman Catholics, 16.50% Greek Catholics, 3.96% Orthodox, 3.97% Evangelicals, 10.33% with no religious affiliation and 18.30% who did not specify affiliation. Education The city of Michalovce is home to many secondary schools and some university colleges. Of the seven secondary schools, the most well-known and prestigious is the Pavol Horov Gymnasium. The other gymnasium is Gymnazium na ulici ƒΩudovita ≈†t√∫ra 26. Health care The largest health care provider in the municipality is the ≈†tefan Kukura Hospital in Michalovce, with 712 beds.

Individuals have different profit objectives, and their individual skills make different tactics and strategies appropriate. Some choices involve a tradeoff between risk and return. Most investors fall somewhere in between, accepting some risk for the expectation of higher returns.  Strategies  * No strategy: Investors who don't have a strategy have been called Sheep.Sheep Definition  Investopedia Arbitrary choices modeled on throwing darts at a page (referencing earlier decades when stock prices were listed daily in the newspapers) have been called Blind Folded Monkeys Throwing Darts [no source]. This famous test had debatable outcomes. * Active vs Passive: Passive strategies like buy and hold and passive indexing are often used to minimize transaction costs. Passive investors don't believe it is possible to time the market. Active strategies such as momentum trading are an attempt to outperform benchmark indexes. Active investors believe they have the better than average skills. * Momentum Trading: One strategy is to select investments based on their recent past performance. Stocks that had higher returns for the recent 3 to 12 months tend to continue to perform better for the next few months compared to the stocks that had lower returns for the recent 3 to 12 months.Applying Deep Learning to Enhance Momentum Trading Strategies in Stocks  Lawrence Takeuchi, Yu-Ying (Albert) Lee There is evidence both for and againstPerformance Chasing: A Losing Strategy - TheStreet TheStreet.com this strategy. * Buy and Hold: This strategy involves buying company shares or funds and holding them for a long period. It is a long term investment strategy, based on the concept that in the long run equity markets give a good rate of return despite periods of volatility or decline. This viewpoint also holds that market timing, that one can enter the market on the lows and sell on the highs, does not work for small investors, so it is better to simply buy and hold. * Long Short Strategy: A long short strategy consists of selecting a universe of equities and ranking them according to a combined alpha factor. Given the rankings we long the top percentile and short the bottom percentile of securities once every re-balancing period. * Indexing: Indexing is where an investor buys a small proportion of all the shares in a market index such as the S&P; 500, or more likely, an index mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This can be either a passive strategy if held for long periods, or an active strategy if the index is used to enter and exit the market quickly. * Pairs Trading: Pairs trade is a trading strategy that consists of identifying similar pairs of stocks and taking a linear combination of their price so that the result is a stationary time-series. We can then compute Altman_Z-score for the stationary signal and trade on the spread assuming mean reversion: short the top asset and long the bottom asset. * Value vs Growth: Value investing strategy looks at the intrinsic value of a company and value investors seek stocks of companies that they believed are undervalued. Growth investment strategy looks at the growth potential of a company and when a company that has expected earning growth that is higher than companies in the same industry or the market as a whole, it will attract the growth investors who are seeking to maximize their capital gain. * Dividend growth investing: This strategy involves investing in company shares according to the future dividends forecast to be paid. Companies that pay consistent and predictable dividends tend to have less volatile share prices. Well-established dividend-paying companies will aim to increase their dividend payment each year, and those who make an increase for 25 consecutive years are referred to as a dividend aristocrat. Investors who reinvest the dividends are able to benefit from compounding of their investment over the longer term, whether directly invested or through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP). * Dollar cost averaging: The dollar cost averaging strategy is aimed at reducing the risk of incurring substantial losses resulted when the entire principal sum is invested just before the market falls. * Contrarian investment:http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/buffett-bear-market- strategies.asp A contrarian investment strategy consists of selecting good companies in time of down market and buying a lot of shares of that company in order to make a long-term profit. In time of economic decline, there are many opportunities to buy good shares at reasonable prices. But, what makes a company good for shareholders? A good company is one that focuses on the long term value, the quality of what it offers or the share price. This company must have a durable competitive advantage, which means that it has a market position or branding which either prevents easy access by competitors or controls a scarce raw material source. Some examples of companies that response to these criteria are in the field of insurance, soft drinks, shoes, chocolates, home building, furniture and many more. We can see that there is nothing ‚Äúfancy‚Äù or special about these fields of investment: they are commonly used by each and every one of us. Many variables must be taken into consideration when making the final decision for the choice of the company. Some of them are: **The company must be in a growing industry. **The company cannot be vulnerable to competition. **The company must have its earnings on an upward trend. **The company must have a consistent return on invested capital. **The company must be flexible to adjust prices for inflation. * Smaller companies: Historically medium-sized companies have outperformed large cap companies on the Stock market. Smaller companies again have had even higher returns. The very best returns by market cap size historically are from micro-cap companies. Investors using this strategy buy companies based on their small market cap size on the stock exchange.

Gen. Mordechai \\"Motta\\" Gur (, May 6, 1930 ‚Äì July 16, 1995) was an Israeli politician and the 10th Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces. During the Six-Day War (1967), he commanded the brigade that penetrated the Old City of Jerusalem and broadcast the famous words, \\"The Temple Mount is in our hands!\\" (, Har HaBayit BeYadeinu). As Chief of Staff, he had responsibility for planning and executing Operation Entebbe (1976) to free Jewish hostages in Uganda. He later entered the Knesset and held various ministerial portfolios. Gur wrote three popular children's books and three books about military history. Military career Gur was born in Jerusalem and later joined the Palmach Haganah (the underground armed group of the Jews in the British Mandate of Palestine). He continued serving in a military capacity with the founding of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the Israeli War of Independence in 1948. In the IDF, Gur served in the Paratroopers Brigade most of his career and became one of the symbols of the \\"red beret\\" brigade. During the 1950s he was a company commander under the command of Ariel Sharon. He was wounded during a counter-terror raid in Khan Yunis in 1955 (Operation Elkayam) and received a recommendation of honor from Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan. In 1957 he was appointed as adjutant to the brigade commander. After serving in this position Gur went to study at the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Guerre in Paris. After two years in France, he returned and was appointed as the commander of the Golani Brigade (1961‚Äì1963) and commanded the counter-terror raid in Nukiev. He brought over the traditions and attitude of the Paratroopers, raised morale, and helped instill an espirit de corps in Golani for which the brigade is still famous. In 1965 he was appointed as the head of the operations branch in the general staff of the IDF. He later also served as a commander of the IDF commanders' school. Paratroopers on the Mount of Olives before entering the Old City of Jerusalem. In 1966 Gur was appointed as the commander of the 55th Paratroopers Brigade (Reserve), which he led during the Six-Day War. Gur and his troops were part of the assault force which wrested Jerusalem from the Jordanians, and which were the first to visit the Western Wall and the Temple Mount. The pictures of paratroopers crying at the Wall and Gur's audio recording in the communication networks, \\"The Temple Mount is in our hands!\\" (, Har HaBayit BeYadeinu!), became one of the most touching symbols of the war both to the Israeli public and those abroad. After the war he was promoted to Brigadier General's rank and was appointed as the IDF commander in the Gaza Strip and northern Sinai Peninsula. In 1969 he was promoted to Major General and was appointed as the commander of the northern front, where Palestinian terrorists from the PLO, backed by Syria, attacked Israel's northern settlements. Gur led several counter-attacks to reign in the terror attacks, conquering the Shebaa farms from Syria in order to establish a defensive position to prevent border attacks. From August 1972 to December 1973 he served as the IDF military attache at Israel's Washington D.C., embassy. In January 1974 he was reappointed as the commander of the northern front. Following the retirement of General David Elazar due to the criticism of the Agranat Commission he was appointed in April 1974 as the 10th IDF Chief of Staff. In 1976, he was responsible for planning and carrying out Israel's rescue of 102 hostages from Entebbe Airport in Uganda. In 1977, Gur warned shortly before Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem that the trip might be a ruse to hide Egyptian plans for a war. He put the army on alert and was nearly fired for his lapse in judgment. In 1978, Gur guided a campaign in Lebanon to drive out Palestinian guerrillas. He served as chief of staff until 1978.  Civilian and political career  Following his retirement from the IDF, Gur was appointed as the general manager of Kur Mechanica company. In 1981 he was elected to the Knesset as a member of the Israeli Labor Party within the Alignment. Re-elected in 1984, he served as Minister of Health and was also a member of the Knesset's Security and Foreign Affairs Committee. Between 1986 and 1988 he served on the board of Solel Boneh, a construction company. In April 1988 he was appointed Minister without Portfolio, a position he retained following the 1988 elections until March 1990, when Labor pulled out of the coalition. After the Labor Party won the 1992 elections, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin appointed Gur to be Deputy Minister of Defense. In that role, Gur was responsible for preparing the Israeli economy for times of war and crisis and interacting with the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. Gur hoped to one day be prime minister, but cancer halted his political aspirations.  Death  In 1995, Gur became seriously ill with terminal cancer. He committed suicide with a handgun on July 16, 1995 at the age of 65. Gur left a note saying he did not want to be a burden to his family. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin mourned him as \\"a special person, sensitive and strong, a soldier and a civilian, a lover of books and of writing, and above all, a friend.\\" Gur was buried with full military honors in Tel Aviv.  Legacy  Area 21, a military base in the Sharon plain, was renamed in his honour (Camp Motta Gur). A Metronit station in Kiryat Ata is named after Gur. In Modiin a street and a school was named after Gur. Gur helped create the \\"Follow me\\" slogan of commanders in the Israel Defense Forces.

Olive oil is produced in the mesocarp cells, and stored in a particular type of vacuole called a lipo vacuole, i.e., every cell contains a tiny olive oil droplet. Olive oil extraction is the process of separating the oil from the other fruit contents (vegetative extract liquid and solid material). It is possible to attain this separation by physical means alone, i.e., oil and water do not mix, so they are relatively easy to separate. This contrasts with other oils that are extracted with chemical solvents, generally hexane.F. D. Gunstone, Vegetable Oils in Food Technology: Composition, Properties, and Uses, 2002, CRC Press, 351 pages The first operation when extracting olive oil is washing the olives, to reduce the presence of contaminants, especially soil which can create a particular flavor effect called \\"soil taste\\".  Olive presses  4th-to-8th-century village on the Golan Heights Grinder with two millstones and in the foreground several fiber disks Olive paste after stone crushing is being applied to fiber mats in Sicily Press with stack of fiber disks People have used olive presses since Greeks first began pressing olives over 5,000 years ago. Roman olive presses survive to the present time, with a notable collection present at Volubilis in Morocco.C. Michael Hogan, Volubilis, The Megaoithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) An olive press works by applying pressure to olive paste to separate the liquid oil and vegetation water from the solid material. The oil and vegetation water are then separated by standard decantation. This basic method is still widely used today, and it is still a valid way of producing high quality olive oil if adequate precautions are taken. First the olives are ground into an olive paste using large millstones at an oil mill. The olive paste generally stays under the stones for 30‚Äì40 minutes. This has three objectives: * Ensure that olives are well ground * Allow enough time for the olive drops to join to form the largest droplets of oil * Allow the fruit enzymes to produce some of the oil aromas and taste Olive oil mills very rarely use a modern crushing method with a traditional press. After grinding, the olive paste is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other, then placed into the press. Traditionally the disks were made of hemp or coconut fiber, but in modern times they are made of synthetic fibers which are easier to clean and maintain. These disks are then put on a hydraulic piston, forming a pile. Pressure is applied on the disks, thus compacting the solid phase of the olive paste and percolating the liquid phases (oil and vegetation water). The applied hydraulic pressure can go to 400 atm. To facilitate separation of the liquid phases, water is run down the sides of the disks to increase the speed of percolation. The liquids are then separated either by a standard process of decantation or by means of a faster vertical centrifuge. The traditional method is a valid form of producing high-quality olive oil, if after each extraction the disks are properly cleaned from the remains of paste; if not the leftover paste will begin to ferment, thereby producing inconsistencies of flavors (called defects) that will contaminate the subsequently produced olive oil. A similar problem can affect the grindstones that, in order to assure perfect quality, also require cleaning after each usage. = Advantages and disadvantages = Proper cleaning produces higher-quality oil. Grindstones, while ancient in design, are a suitable way to grind olives, because this method breaks up the drupe's pulp while only slightly touching the nut and the skin. This reduces the release of the oil oxidation enzymes present in these organs. In addition, in this extraction method, the introduction of water is minimal when compared to the modern one, thus reducing the washing-off of the polyphenols. The exhausted paste, called pomace, has a low content of water, making it an easier residue to manage. Advantages * Better grinding of the olives, reducing the release of oil oxidation enzymes * Reduced added water, minimizing the washing of polyphenols * Pomace with a low content of water easier to manage Disadvantages * Difficult to clean * Non-continuous process with waiting periods thus exposes the olive paste to oxygen and light * Requires more manual labor * Longer production time from harvest to pressing  Decanter centrifugation  The modern method of olive oil extraction uses an industrial decanter to separate all the phases by centrifugation. In this method the olives are crushed to a fine paste. This can be done by a hammer crusher, disc crusher, depitting machine or knife crusher. This paste is then malaxed for 30 to 60 minutes in order to allow the small olive droplets to agglomerate. The aromas are created in these two steps through the action of fruit enzymes. Afterwards the paste is pumped into an industrial decanter where the phases will be separated. Water is added to facilitate the extraction process with the paste. The decanter is a large capacity horizontal centrifuge rotating approximately 3,000 rpm, the high centrifugal force created allows the phases to be readily separated according to their different densities (solids > vegetation water > oil). Inside the decanter's rotating conical drum there is a coil that rotates more slowly, pushing the solid materials out of the system. Diagram of a working decanter. The three phases are separated according to their densities. The separated oil and vegetation water are then rerun through a vertical centrifuge, working around 6,000 rpm that will separate the small quantity of vegetation water still contained in oil and vice versa. = Three, two, and two and a half phases decanters = With the three phases oil decanter, a portion of the oil polyphenols is washed out due to the higher quantity of added water (when compared to the traditional method), producing a larger quantity of vegetation water that needs to be processed. The two phases oil decanter was created as an attempt to solve these problems. Sacrificing part of its extraction capability, it uses less added water thus reducing the phenol washing. The olive paste is separated into two phases: oil and wet pomace. This type of decanter, instead of having three exits (oil, water, and solids), has only two. The water is expelled by the decanter coil together with the pomace, resulting in a wetter pomace that is much harder to process industrially. Many pomace oil extraction facilities refuse to work with these materials because the energy costs of drying the pomace for the hexane oil extraction often make the extraction process sub-economical. In practice, then, the two phases decanter solves the phenol washing problem but increases the residue management problem. This residue management problem has been reduced by the collection of this wetter pomace and being transported to specialized facilities called extractors which heat the pomace between 45 ¬∞C and 50 ¬∞C and can extract up to a further 2 litres per 100 kilos of pomace using adapted two-phase decanters. The two-and- a-half-phase oil decanter is a compromise between the two previous types of decanters. It separates the olive paste into the standard three phases, but has a smaller need for added water and also a smaller vegetation water output. Therefore, the water content of the obtained pomace comes very close to that of the standard three-phase decanter, and the vegetation water output is relatively small, minimizing the residue management issues. Depending on the olives and processing, the Decanter or Tricanter can extract between 85 and 90% of the olive oil in the 1st extraction. The yield from olive oil manufacture can be increased even further with a 2nd extraction. The olive oil yield increases to as much as 96% by combining the 1st and 2nd extractions. Higher Yield due to the 2nd Extraction in Olive Oil Manufacture = Advantages and disadvantages = Advantages * Compact machinery: only one decanter required * Continuous and automated * Limited labor required * Highest percent of oil extraction * Vegetable water disposal less of a problem * Olive oil from two-phase centrifugation systems contains more phenols, tocopherols, trans‚Äë2‚Äëhexenal, and total aroma compounds and is more resistant to oxidation than oil from three-phase ones and from hydraulic presses Disadvantages * Expensive * More technical labor required * High energy consumption * Pomace may end up moist * Greater amount of vegetable water to be disposed of * Reduced antioxidants due to added water * Subject to wear from rocks, grit  Sinolea method  The Sinolea method to extract oil from the olives was introduced in 1972;Dimitrios Boskou, Olive Oil: Chemistry and Technology, Contributor American Oil Chemists Society, 2006, AOCS Press, 268 pages in this process, rows of metal discs or plates are dipped into the paste; the oil preferentially wets and sticks to the metal and is removed with scrapers in a continuous process. It is based on the different surface tension of the vegetation water and the oil, these different physical behaviors allow the olive oil to adhere to a steel plaque while the other two phases remain behind. Sinolea works by continuously introducing several hundreds of steel plaques into the paste thus extracting the olive oil. This process is not completely efficient leaving a large quantity of oil still in the paste, so the remaining paste has to be processed by the standard modern method (industrial decanter). = Advantages and disadvantages = Advantages * Higher polyphenol content of oil * Low temperature method * Automated * Low labor * Oil/water separation step is not needed * Low energy requirement Disadvantages * Often must be combined with one of the above methods in order to maximize oil extraction which requires more space and labor * Large surface areas can lead to rapid oxidation of the olive product * Sale of future machines currently outlawed in the European Union due to difficulty in cleaning large surface areas  First cold pressed ‚Äì cold extraction  Many oils are marketed as first cold pressed or cold extraction. \\"Cold\\" means no heat is added during extraction. \\"Pressed\\" means that the olives are crushed in a mill to extract the oil. In the EU, these designations are regulated by Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 of 13 June 2002 on marketing standards for olive oil. This article states that in order to use these designations the olive oil bottler must prove that the temperature of malaxation and extraction was under 27 ¬∞C (80 ¬∞F). For olive oil bottled outside EU countries, this regulation does not apply, and thus the consumer has no assurance that these statements are true. The temperature of malaxation and extraction is crucial due to its effect on olive oil quality. When high temperatures are applied, the more volatile aromas are lost and the rate of oil oxidation is increased, producing therefore lower quality oils. In addition, the chemical content of the polyphenols, antioxidants, and vitamins present in the oil is reduced by higher temperatures. The temperature is adjusted basically by controlling the temperature of the water added during these two steps. High temperatures are used to increase the yield of olive oil obtained from the paste.  Alternative configurations  Some producers, in order to maximise product quality, choose to combine the traditional grinding method, the stone mill, with a modern decanter. This technique produces more selective grinding of the olives, reduces the malaxation time olive paste, and avoids the complicated cleaning of the olive press fibre disks. Because the use of the stone mill requires a loading and unloading phase, this extraction method is discontinuous, i.e., there are times when all the machinery is stopped, therefore it is generally not used on a large commercial scale, being applied only by small scale olive mills producing high quality olive oil.  Consumer point of view  High quality olive oil can be obtained by all the methods if proper measures are taken. Olive oil quality is equally dependent on the quality of the olives themselves and on the time they have to wait from harvesting to extraction, in addition to the extraction method itself. The two main agents that cause the degradation of olive oil are oxygen and light. Once an olive is harvested, it should be pressed within 24 hours. Oxidation begins immediately upon harvesting. In the period between harvest and grinding, the fruits' enzymes are very active and increasingly degrade the endogenous oil, and therefore oil obtained after a longer wait is of lower quality, presenting higher acidity (free fatty acids percentage). In addition, if additional oxygen is allowed to interact with the olive paste during the extraction process, the acidity level will increase further. Sealed extraction methods are best to prevent the continued introduction of oxygen, as well as light to the oil. After extraction is complete, in most cases unfiltered olive oil appears somewhat cloudy, mainly due to the presence of minute amounts of water and suspended solids of olive pulp and seed. This type of oil is therefore sometimes called cloudy or veiled olive oil. It is common practice that unfiltered olive oils are then \\"racked\\" for a time, i.e. stored in cool stainless steel silos with a conical bottom that are pumped free of oxygen to enable the precipitation and separation of the two phases and facilitate later filtration; it will also contribute in the integrity and stability of the oil.  Future prospects  The future of olive extraction points to reducing the negative aspects of the present methods, decreasing the degradation oil produced by the extraction process in itself. * Reducing the oxidation by performing part of the process of malaxation and the extraction under a controlled nitrogen atmosphere * Extracting the nut of the olive before grinding, this will reduce the release of oxidative enzymes present in this organ, and yield a pomace that is free from wood residues, making it possible to be used in animal feeding * Reducing the addition of water to minimize the washing of polyphenols * Improving the sinolea method, through an increase in the efficiency of the adsorption of the oil to the plates, thus reducing the need for the use of standard methods of extraction See also * Amurca, a byproduct in olive oil extraction, historically used for many purposes Notes References * ‚ÄúPolyphenols in olive oils‚Äù.

New Echota is located in present-day Gordon County, in northwest Georgia, 3.68 miles north of Calhoun, and south of Resaca next to present day New Town also called Ustanali. The site has been preserved as a state park and a historic site, and it was designated as a National Historic Landmark District in 1973. The site is at the confluence of the Coosawattee and Conasauga rivers, which join to form the Oostanaula River, a tributary of the Coosa River. It is near Town Creek. Archeological evidence has shown that the site of New Echota had been occupied by ancient indigenous cultures for thousands of years prior to the Cherokee Native Americans. It was known as Gansagiyi or Gansagi; the Cherokee renamed it as New Echota in 1825 after making it the capital, in honor of their former chief town. History Prior to relocating to Gansagi and building the community of New Echota, the Cherokee had used the nearby town of Ustanali on the Coosawattee River as the seat of their tribe, beginning in 1788 after migrating south from Tennessee and South Carolina under pressure from European-American settlement. Ustanali had been established in 1777 by refugees from the Cherokee Lower Towns in northwestern South Carolina. In that year, Old Tassel and several other Cherokee leaders were murdered by whites while under the flag of truce, while visiting representatives of the short- lived State of Franklin. In response, warriors across the frontier increased attacks on European-American settlers. The Chickamauga Cherokee, a band led by Dragging Canoe, were already carrying out armed resistance to European- American settlement. Following the murders, Little Turkey was elected chief of the Cherokee, although they did not have a centralized form of government. The people moved the seat of the Cherokee council from Chota to Ustanali. New Echota was named after Chota, the former capital of the Overhill Cherokee, those who lived to the west of the Appalachian Mountains and were associated with the region of the Overhill Towns. A common English name for New Echota was \\"Newtown\\" or \\"New Town.\\" These names are still used for the area around the State Park. Later Anglo-American settlers called the area \\"The Fork\\" and \\"Fork Ferry\\" because of transportation at the confluence of the rivers. The Cherokee Phoenix By 1819 the government of the Cherokee Nation was meeting in New Echota. On November 12, 1825, New Echota was officially designated as the capital of the Cherokee Nation. They had organized a council, and supreme court to adjudicate their justice issues. The tribal council began a building program that included construction of a two-story Council House, and a Supreme Court. Later they built the office (printer shop) for the Cherokee Phoenix, the first Indian-language and Cherokee newspaper. Elias Boudinot was the chief writer and editor. Samuel Worcester, a missionary and printer, laid out the first Native American newspaper. Boudinot wrote it in both English and Cherokee, using for the latter the new syllabary created in 1820 by Sequoyah, with type cast by Worcester. Private homes, stores, a ferry, and mission station were built in the outlying area of New Echota. The town was quiet most of the year, but Cherokee Council meetings provided the opportunity for great social gatherings. During these meetings, the town filled with several hundred Cherokee, who arrived by foot, horseback, or in stylish carriages. Vann's Tavern, a tavern built by James Vann. Relocated to New Echota in 1955.Final New Echota Form . Georgia DNR, Historic Preservation Division. Retrieved 16 July 2017. In 1832, after Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act, Georgia included Cherokee territory in its Sixth Land Lottery, allocating Cherokee land to white settlers. The Cherokee Nation had never ceded the land to the state. Over the next six years, the Georgia Guard operated against the Cherokee, evicting them from their properties. By 1834, New Echota was becoming a ghost town. Council meetings were moved to Red Clay, Cherokee Nation (now Tennessee). The United States urged the Cherokee to remove to Indian Territory, offering lands in exchange for their lands in Georgia. On December 29, 1835, a small group of Cherokee (100‚Äì500 Cherokee known as Ridgeites or the Treaty Party, who represented a minority of Cherokee) signed the Treaty of New Echota in the home of Elias Boudinot. Signers included Major Ridge, John Ridge, and Andrew Ross, a brother of John Ross, the principal chief. Believing that the negotiation would allow them to preserve some rights for the Cherokee, they agreed to cede their remaining lands and to removal in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee were to have sovereignty in that western territory. Despite objections from John Ross, who represented the large majority of Cherokee to the US government, the Senate ratified the treaty. The US government eventually forced most of the Cherokee out of the Southeast. In 1838 the U.S. Army, under the command of Winfield Scott, began the forced removal of Cherokee from the state of Georgia. A Cherokee removal fort was located at New Echota, called Fort Wool. This held Cherokee from Gordon and Pickens counties until their removal. As the first group of Cherokee began their exodus to Rattlesnake Springs, Cherokee Nation (4 miles south of Charleston, Tennessee), the Cherokee from counties south and east of the area also were housed here. New Echota Historic Site After the Cherokee were fully removed in 1838, their capital remained abandoned for more than 100 years. Many of the structures disappeared, though some of the houses continued to be used. Most notable was the house of Samuel Worcester, who was called \\"the Messenger,\\" and a missionary to the Cherokee. When its landowners deeded land to be commissioned to the state for preservation, the Worcester House, the largest remaining structure, had been vacant for two years. It had deteriorated in that time. From 1930 to 1950 the site was designated by Congress as the New Echota Marker National Memorial. In March 1954, the archeologist Lewis Larsen from the Georgia Historical Commission, and five associates were assigned to oversee the work of excavating New Echota. The team uncovered evidence not only of the Cherokee settlement in New Echota, but also of much earlier indigenous cultures. They asked the National Park Service archeologist Joe Caldwell and two more workers to join them for the next two months as they continued excavation. The group recovered a Spanish coin dated 1802, crockery, household wares, bootery remains, a small quantity of lead, and 1700 other artifacts. They identified 600 items as having belonged to the Cherokee. In addition to the standard finds and remains of many buildings, Larsen and Caldwell astonished the world by discovering much of the type syllabary that was once used to print the Cherokee Phoenix. On March 13, 1957, following the news of these archeological finds, the State of Georgia authorized reconstruction of the town of New Echota as a state park. They reconstructed such buildings as the Council House, the Supreme Court, the printer shop, a building of the Cherokee Phoenix, a common Cherokee cabin representing a home of an average family, and a middle-class Cherokee home, including outbuildings. Vann's Tavern, which had been owned by Chief James Vann, is a restored building, for which modern nails and replacement wooden parts were used. It was relocated from Forsyth County, Georgia (Chief Vann had owned 14 taverns across the state of Georgia), as the original New Echota Vann Tavern was destroyed. The park contains the site of the former Elias Boudinot house, which serves as a memorial to Boudinot. The Worcester House was restored to its 19th-century condition. Together the buildings of the complex form an open-air museum. Other sites are not open to the public, as they are now on private property. Across from the New Echota park are two farmhouse sites, formerly owned by white men who had married Cherokee women. These sites are now part of an Elks Club golf course. The New Echota Historical Park was opened to the public in 1962. Inside the office of the Cherokee Phoenix were displayed 600 pieces of type which had been used for the first American Indian newspaper. Later some type was moved to the museum and research facility which was built by the park. The Newtown Trail is a 1.2 mile interpreted trail that takes tourists to Town Creek (inside the center of New Echota), where the majority of the Cherokee had camped when the Council was in session. In 1973, the Department of Natural Resources, also known as Georgia State Parks and Historic Sites, took over New Echota Park; it continues to operate and maintain this historic site. The site was designated in 1973 by the US Department of Interior as a National Historic Landmark, the highest recognition in the United States.

The Wild Angels, released by American International Pictures (AIP), stars Fonda as the fictitious Hells Angels San Pedro, California chapter president \\"Heavenly Blues\\" (or \\"Blues\\"), Nancy Sinatra as his girlfriend \\"Mike\\", Bruce Dern as doomed fellow outlaw \\"the Loser\\", and Dern's then real-life wife Diane Ladd as the Loser's on-screen wife, \\"Gaysh\\". Small supporting roles are played by Michael J. Pollard and Gayle Hunnicutt and, according to literature promoting the film, members of the Hells Angels from Venice, California. Members of the Coffin Cheaters motorcycle club also appeared. In 1967 AIP followed this film with Devil's Angels, The Glory Stompers with Dennis Hopper, and The Born Losers. Plot 'Heavenly Blues' is the leader of the Angels motorcycle gang from San Pedro, California. 'Loser' is his best friend. 'Mike' is Blues' \\"old lady\\". The story begins in a quest to find Loser's stolen motorcycle. The plot is simply a buildup to a climax in the last half-hour of the film which is Loser's funeral. Loser's funeral is the showpiece of the film. In between sprees of sex, drugs, rock and roll, booze, loud revving Harley chopper motorcycle engines, bongo drums and fights, the Angels ride out to Mecca, California in the desert to look for Loser's stolen motorcycle. One of the Angels finds a brake pedal, which he says is a piece of Loser's motorcycle, in a garage that is the hang-out of a Mexican group. The two groups brawl, with the Angels apparently winning. The police arrive and the Angels escape but Loser gets separated from the others and is left behind. He steals a police motorcycle but is not able to lose the policeman who is pursuing him or evade the roadblock that the police have in place. Eventually one of the officers shoots Loser in the back, putting him in the hospital. Blues leads a small group of Angels to sneak Loser out of the hospital. A nurse hears a noise and comes into the hospital room. One of the Angels assaults her. Blues pulls the Angel away, forcing him to stop. The nurse having seen Blues and identifies him to the police. (It is never resolved whether the nurse identifies Blues in error as the man who attacked her, or if she identified him only as one of the people who got the Loser out of the hospital). Without proper medical care, Loser dies. The Angels forge a death certificate for Loser and arrange for a church funeral in Sequoia Grove, Loser's rural hometown. Blues tells The Angels to go to Sequoia Grove on their bikes, in ones and twos, using different roads and do not show their club colors while traveling. The Angels arrive at Sequoia Grove, assemble at the church and carry in Loser's casket which is draped with a Nazi flag. The funeral preacher arrives at the church; he looks at the assembled motorcycle gang and Loser, lying in repose in his coffin, with disdain. He undertakes a funeral sermon; it is a eulogy consisting entirely of funeral oratory cliches. This pathetic eulogy angers Blues and he interrupts the preacher's gibberish shouting, ‚ÄúOh no, preach, not children of God, but Hell‚Äôs Angels‚Äù. Whereupon, the Angels decide to have a \\"party\\" in the church. They remove Loser from his coffin, they sit him up as \\"a guest of honor\\" and place a joint in his mouth. They tie up the preacher and put him into the casket. A wild orgy ensues. Blues disappears behind the church's pulpit and apparently has sex with a woman. Finishing his business, he rises up from behind the pulpit, perfectly attired, and he tells his gang that it is time to bury Loser. The Angels, some riding their bikes, others walking and carrying Loser's casket, move through the town in a funeral procession to the Sequoia Grove Cemetery. At the cemetery, the people from the town mysteriously show up outside the gate. While the Angels were peacefully gathering around Loser's grave, a town youth throws a large rock, hitting one of the Angels, which provokes a brawl between the Angels and the townspeople. Police sirens are heard approaching in the background. Everyone scatters. The Angels mount their bikes and rapidly leave. Blues' girlfriend, Mike, begs him to leave. She tells Blues that his reaction to Loser's death is, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like you went with him‚Äù. But Blues refuses to leave and tells her to get on the bike of another member of the gang and go. With resignation, Blues says to Mike, \\"There's nowhere to go.\\" Blues, left alone in the graveyard, puts on a pair of gloves and takes a shovel in hand. He slowly begins shoveling dirt into the open grave to bury his friend Loser. Cast * Peter Fonda as Heavenly Blues * Nancy Sinatra as Mike * Bruce Dern as Joe 'Loser' Kearns * Diane Ladd as Gaysh * Buck Taylor as Dear John * Norman Alden as Medic * Michael J. Pollard as Pigmy * Frank Maxwell as funeral preacher Production =Writing= Roger Corman became interested in making a film about the Hells Angels after seeing a photo of a biker funeral in the January 1966 issue of Life magazine . Corman approached AIP, Charles B. Griffith was hired to write a screenplay.\\"It was a Life magazine photograph that gave me the idea for The Wild Angels,\\" Corman recalled in his autobiography How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime. \\"The photo, in a January 1966 issue, showed a group of Hell's Angels on their choppers going to the funeral of one of their members. I brought the project to AIP and they went forward with a treatment titled All the Fallen Angels.\\" Turner Classic Movies, Film Article: \\"The Wild Angels\\" by Jim Stafford. Griffith's first draft was a near-silent movie which contrasted the bikers with the story of a police motorcycle cop. Corman did not like it and had Griffith rewrite it. Corman still was not happy and gave it to Peter Bogdanovich to rewrite.Mark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996 pp. 243‚Äì245 Bogdanovich had met Corman socially and agreed to write an adventure script in the vein of Lawrence of Arabia or Bridge on the River Kwai \\"only cheap\\"; Corman pulled Bogdanovich off that project and paid him $300 to work on Wild Angels. Bogdanovich later estimated he rewrote 80% of the script.\\"Exclusive Interview: Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich\\". Blu-ray.Com, March 26, 2012. Accessed 3 June 2013. He later directed second unit and did various other odd jobs. =Casting= George Chakiris and Peter Fonda were originally cast in the lead roles. However Chakiris could not ride a motorcycle so he was replaced by Fonda; with Bruce Dern taking Fonda's original role.  Reception  Film critic Leonard Maltin called The Wild Angels \\"OK after about 24 beers\\". It opened the Venice Film Festival in 1966, to tepid response. In a 2009 interview, Corman told Mick Garris that the US State Department tried to prevent the film from being shown in Venice on the grounds that it \\"did not show America the way it is\\".POST MORTEM: Roger Corman But the film was shown there anyway. Corman took chances with this subject matter and the Charles B. Griffith‚Äìauthored screenplay, without being overly graphic, paid dividends commercially: The Wild Angels earning $7 million in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada, the highest-grossing low-budget film at the time. The film had admissions in France of 531,240 people.Box office information for Roger Corman films in France at Box Office Story The movie's success established Fonda as \\"a counter culture film star\\". The film holds a 61% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews. Legacy While promoting another of his 1960s counterculture movies, The Trip, and autographing a movie still from The Wild Angels depicting Bruce Dern and him sharing one motorcycle, Fonda conceived the film Easy Rider. Edited samples of dialogue from the film, where Fonda's character Blues explains his attitude toward life to the preacher at Loser's funeral was used at the start of Mudhoney's 1989 track In 'n' Out of Grace (from Superfuzz Bigmuff) and later Primal Scream's 1990 single Loaded (from Screamadelica). Some of the same sample of dialogue was also featured in the launch trailer of the video game Need for Speed (2015). Audio of Fonda's speech was also sampled repeatedly in the Edgar Wright film The World's End, as well as repeated by Simon Pegg's character Gary King at the end of the movie. DVD The Wild Angels was released to DVD by MGM Home Video on April 1, 2003 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD, on September 11, 2007 as part of The Roger Corman Collection (movie number seven of a set of eight), and to Blu-ray by Olive Films (under license from MGM) on February 17, 2015.

In 1971 he defeated Andr√© the Giant in Al-Shaab Stadium in Baghdad, under the auspices of his former friend at high school Saddam Hussein.The Sheik of Baghdad: Tales of Celebrity and Terror from Pro Wrestling's General Adnan Triumph Books 2005 He competed in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). On December 7, 1976, he won the WWWF World tag team championship with Chief Jay Strongbow. In 1981, Adnan Al-Kaissie joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA), in 1990 he joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF formerly WWWF), where he managed Sgt. Slaughter under the name \\"General Adnan\\". He competed at SummerSlam 1991 with his partners Sgt. Slaughter and Col. Mustafa in a Handicap match with Sid Justice as special guest referee against Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior.  Early life  Adnan Al-Kaissy was born Adnan Bin Abdulkareem Ahmed Al-kaissy El Farthie in Baghdad, Iraq. According to his autobiography, he came from a fairly distinguished family, with his father being an imam (Muslim preacher). One of his high school classmates was Saddam Hussein. He had an amateur wrestling career in Iraq and attended Oklahoma State University.  Professional wrestling career  =Early career= Al-Kaissy began wrestling in the state of Oklahoma in 1959 under the ring name \\"Adnan Kaissey\\". Kassey wrestled for Pacific Northwest Wrestling in the 1960s and in the World Wide Wrestling Federation in the 1970s under the Native American gimmick Billy White Wolf and won the World Tag Team Titles with Chief Jay Strongbow. Needing neck surgery, Kassey agreed to work an injury angle where he had his neck broken by Ken Patera via the Swinging Neckbreaker on TV. After he left the territory for his neck surgery, the 'Indians' were stripped of their titles. He wouldn't return until the early 1990s, using his real name, as a manager. In 1967, Adnan, who had married an American woman, became a United States citizen.http://www.mikemooneyham.com/2005/09/25/the-sheikh-of-baghdad/ During the 1970s, he took professional wrestling to Iraq under the direction of Saddam Hussein. In one such match, he defeated Andr√© the Giant in Baghdad and he defeated the Scottish Ian Campbell and the Canadian champion George Gordienko in Baghdad. In 1978, he wrestled in Hawaii and was the master of the \\"Indian Death Match\\" until his arch-rival, Tor Kamata, defeated him. Not long after, he returned briefly to Iraq with the intent of introducing pro wrestling. By this time, his old classmate Saddam was ruler of the country. By his own account, it was a difficult time, for although Kaissey was very popular and had some success introducing professional wrestling to Iraq, Saddam was already becoming paranoid about potential rivals, and he saw Kaissey in this light. Kaissey fled back to the US and never returned, though he kept contact with his family in Baghdad. =New Japan Pro-Wrestling and Florida (1974‚Äì1981)= In 1974, Adnan debuted in New Japan Pro-Wrestling as the Sheik of Sheiks of Baghdad, he teamed with Nikolai Volkoff and they tried to win the NWA North American Tag Team but they failed after losing the Best Two Out Of Three Falls match against Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi at Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium in Aichi, Japan. Later he feuded with the likes of Antonio Inoki, Seiji Sakaguchi, Kantaro Hoshino, Osamu Kido, Haruka Eigen. After he left NJPW, Adnan returned to the United States, where he wrestled in Eddie Graham's promotion Championship Wrestling from Florida under his real name. =American Wrestling Association (1981‚Äì1989)= In 1981, with tensions between the US and Middle East running high, he debuted in the American Wrestling Association as \\"Sheik Adnan El Kaissey,\\" where his stated goal was to win the AWA title from champion Nick Bockwinkel. He failed at that task, so he then enlisted Jerry Blackwell, now wearing a sheik's outfit and renamed Sheik Ayatollah Jerry Blackwell, to team with him to try to win the AWA tag team titles. That failed, too, so Adnan bought Ken Patera from manager Bobby Heenan to team with Blackwell, and Adnan would act as Blackwell and Patera's manager. The team of Blackwell and Patera captured the AWA World tag team title from Greg Gagne and Jim Brunzell. Adnan had to quit wrestling when he was injured, which is the real reason Patera was brought in to team with Blackwell. On April 23, 1983, at the AWA Super Sunday, he teamed with Blackwell in a tag team match against Verne Gagne and Mad Dog Vachon which they lost. In 1986 at AWA WrestleRock he lost to Verne Gagne in a steel cage; he then teamed with Boris Zhukov in a tag team match against The Midnight Rockers (Marty Jannetty & Shawn Michaels). Kassie later left the AWA, but returned on a November 26, 1988, card in Bloomington, Minnesota, when he managed The Iron Sheik (who he would also later manage in the WWF) in a match against Sgt. Slaughter.Inside Wrestling, March 1989 issue, p.15. Al-Kassie with Saddam Hussein in the early 1970s =World Wrestling Federation (1990‚Äì1992)= In the World Wrestling Federation, during the summer of 1990, he allied with Sgt. Slaughter as \\"General Adnan,\\" and managed him during his pro-Iraqi gimmick in a feud with Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior. During this feud, Slaughter won the WWF title from the Warrior at the 1991 Royal Rumble, and lost it a couple of months later to Hogan at WrestleMania VII. The pair were then joined by Slaughter's former nemesis, The Iron Sheik to form the Triangle Of Terror/Desert Power (Corps of Destruction) who was renamed Colonel Mustafa. Adnan also headlined SummerSlam 1991 with Slaughter and Mustafa against Hogan and Warrior. During the build-up to Survivor Series 1990, the WWE showed what they claimed were \\"classified top secret photos released by the Pentagon/CIA\\" that featured General Adnan with Saddam Hussein. After Slaughter turned face, Adnan continued to manage Col. Mustafa until leaving the WWF shortly after Royal Rumble 1992. Al-Kaissie is also featured as a playable character in the WWE 2K15 video game; in where he appears as a downloadable character as part of the \\"Path of the Warrior\\" Showcase. He was once again featured as a playable character in WWE 2K16. =Later career= After WWF he then joined American Wrestling Federation (AWF) where he managed \\"The Rat Pack\\" of Bob Orton Jr, Mr. Hughes & Manny Fernandez. He also managed Hercules Hernandez. He formerly managed his own company, the World All-Star Wrestling Alliance, which he co-owned with Ken Patera. On November 22, 2006, he appeared on Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes describing his encounters with a young Saddam Hussein. Autobiography On June 30, 2005 Triumph Books published his memoirs in The Sheik of Baghdad: Tales of Celebrity and Terror from Pro Wrestling's General Adnan.

A member of the New Zealand National Party, Groser was a Member of Parliament between 2005 and 2015, and a cabinet minister between 2008 and 2015. He resigned from Parliament on 19 December 2015 to take up the role of New Zealand's ambassador to the United States of America. Early years He was born in Perth, Scotland and came to New Zealand with his parents in 1958. After completing his education at Victoria University of Wellington he served as a policy adviser in a number of key departments including Treasury, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Prime Minister's Advisory Group under Robert Muldoon. In the 1980s he was appointed New Zealand's chief agricultural negotiator in the GATT Uruguay round before being promoted to Chief Negotiator midway through negotiations. He subsequently became New Zealand's ambassador to Indonesia from 1994 to 1997. Since then Groser has served as New Zealand's Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and as the WTO's chairman of agricultural negotiations. He was heavily involved in the Doha round of discussions. Member of Parliament In 2005 Groser opted to leave the civil service and run for Parliament. He was selected to stand as a list-only candidate for the National Party in the 2005 election. He was placed 13th on the list and as a result was comfortably elected. After the 2008 election he was given a Cabinet position with the Conservation and Trade portfolios. Groser made international headlines in late 2012 when he said that the New Zealand Government would not sign up for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Tim Groser said the 15-year-old agreement was outdated, and that New Zealand was \\"ahead of the curve\\" in looking for a replacement that would include developing nations. Groser speaking at the WTO Director- General selection process in 2013 In December 2012, the New Zealand Government announced that it was supporting Groser's bid to become the next Director- General of the World Trade Organization, a position which became vacant at the end of May 2013 with the retirement of Pascal Lamy. Groser's bid was eventually unsuccessful and the Brazilian diplomat Roberto Azev√™do was elected as the Director General of the WTO on May 2013. On 22 March 2015, Edward Snowden's The Intercept news website claimed that New Zealand's signals intelligence agency, the Government Communications Security Bureau, had spied on other WTO directorship contenders on behalf of Groser. Known targets included candidates from Brazil, Costa Rica, Ghana, Jordan, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, and South Korea. Despite no official announcement having been made, New Zealand media reported earlier in 2015 that Groser was \\"widely expected\\" to replace Mike Moore as ambassador to the United States. This was confirmed by prime minister John Key on 7 December 2015, with Groser relinquishing his roles on 14 December. Groser will take up his post as ambassador in early 2016. In July 2015, Groser said he believed reasonable people were being \\"whipped up into a frenzy\\" over issues like pharmaceutical costs and investor- state dispute settlement by people who, for ideological reasons, oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. He resigned from Parliament on 19 December 2015 to take up the role of New Zealand's ambassador to the United States of America. Personal life Groser converted to Islam to marry Milda Emza, an Indonesian Muslim and his second wife, in 1996, during his tenure as ambassador to Indonesia. They are no longer married.

It became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans drafted by Gosplan. GOELRO is the transliteration of the Russian abbreviation for \\"State Commission for Electrification of Russia\\" (–ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∫–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∏—è –ø–æ —ç–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏). The Commission and Plan were initiated and supervised by Vladimir Lenin. Lenin's belief in the central importance of electrification to the achievement of communism is represented by his statement that The Commission was established by the Presidium of the VSNKh on February 21, 1920 in accordance with February 3, 1920 VTsIK resolution on the electrification plan development.Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., entry on \\"–ì–û–≠–õ–†–û\\", available online here The director of the Commission was Gleb Krzhizhanovsky. About 200 scientists and engineers participated, including Genrikh Graftio, Ivan Alexandrov, Mikhail Shatelen and others. By the end of 1920 the Commission devised the \\"Russian SFSR Electrification Plan\\" (), that was approved subsequently by the 8th Congress of Soviets on December 22, 1920 On GOELRO Plan ‚Äì at Kuzbassenergo and accepted by the Sovnarkom (Soviet government) on December 21, 1921. The Plan represented a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country. Lenin's stated goal for it was \\"...the organization of industry on the basis of modern, advanced technology, on electrification which will provide a link between town and country, will put an end to the division between town and country, will make it possible to raise the level of culture in the countryside and to overcome, even in the most remote corners of land, backwardness, ignorance, poverty, disease, and barbarism.\\"Lenin \\"Collected Works\\", vol. 30, page 335. Implementation The GOELRO Plan was implemented during a 10- to 15-year period. According to the Plan, the territory of the Russian SFSR was divided into eight regions, with distinct development strategies due to specific features of each region: Southern Region, Central Industrial region, Northern Region, Ural Region, Volga Region, Turkestan Region, Caucasus Region and Western Siberia Region. 85th anniversary of GOELRO plan ‚Äì Management at the website of RAO UES The Plan included construction of a network of 30 regional power plants, including ten large hydroelectric power plants, and numerous electric-powered large industrial enterprises. It was intended to increase the total national power output per year to 8.8 billion kWh, as compared to 1.9 billion kWh in Imperial Russia in 1913. Soviet propaganda claimed that the plan was basically fulfilled by 1931. In reality, only three out of ten hydroelectric stations were built by 1930: the Volkhov, the Svir, and the Dnieper Hydroelectric Stations. The goal of 8.8 billion kWh nevertheless was reached in 1931, and national power output continued to increase significantly, reaching 13.5 billion kWh by the end of the first five-year plan in 1932, 36 billion kWh by 1937, and 48 billion kWh by 1940. Ivan Alexandrov later directed the Regionalisation Commission of Gosplan which divided the Soviet Union into thirteen European and eight Asiatic economic regions, using rational economic planning rather than \\"the vestiges of lost sovereign rights\\".Ekonomicheskoe raionirovanie Rossii, Gosplan, Moscow 1921 The term \\"Ilyich's lamp\\" (–ª–∞–º–ø–æ—á–∫–∞ –ò–ª—å–∏—á–∞) for an electric bulb, a reference to Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, is a reminder of the Plan period.

It is one of several dialects in the Western Desert language group. Origin and meaning of Luritja The name luritja is thought to derive from the Arrernte word lurinya, 'foreigner'. It appears to have originally been applied by Arrernte speakers to people of the Western Desert Language group who had relocated onto Arrernte lands in the process of moving (or being moved) from remote desert areas to the region closer to Alice Springs. Over time younger generations have taken on the term as their ethnonym, possibly unaware of its origin. Area The Luritja lands include areas to the west and south of Alice Springs, extending around the edge of Arrernte country. The area surrounding Papunya, including Mount Liebig is often referred to as Papunya Luritja, both in land and language, while areas to the south-east around Aputula and Maryvale are often referred to as Titjikala Luritja (Maryvale is the name of the cattle station on Titjikala land). The area around Ulpanyali and Watarrka National Park (Kings Canyon) is also referred to as Luritja country and the dialect of Luritja spoken there is referred to as Southern Luritja (It's identical to Titjikala Luritja). The variety of Luritja spoken at Kintore is often referred to as Pintupi/Luritja. Pintupi-Luritja Papunya Luritja Papunya Luritja is the variety of Luritja spoken around the community of Papunya, and also west through Mount Liebig to Kintore. Like Luritja generally, Papunya Luritja is a dialect of the Western Desert Language and is closely related to the Pintupi language of the area around Kintore and further west. Papunya Luritja has probably also been influenced by western varieties of Arrernte as well as Warlpiri. Titjikala Luritja This variety is also a dialect of the Western Desert Language spoken in Titjikala. While it is quite similar to Papunya Luritja, it shows notable differences probably having been derived mostly from Pitjantjatjara as well as being influenced by Antakarinya and the more southern varieties of Arrernte. Population The total population of Luritja people (including Papunya Luritja) is probably in the thousands making them the third largest of the Central Australian Aboriginal populations, behind Arrernte and Pitjantjatjara. Artwork The Luritja area relies heavily on the sale of artwork, and Luritja artwork has a large number of famous artists, and many companies that specifically cater for the sale of Luritja art. The Papunya Tula company in particular is world- renowned for its artists, most of whom reside at Papunya and Kintore.

He won the Belmont Stakes twice as a jockey and 8 times as a trainer. He had 34 champion horses to his credit, more than any other trainer in the Hall of Fame. Early life and education Rowe was born in the environs of Richmond, Virginia, and went to work at a racetrack as a boy of 10 years old. He went from an apprentice rider to being considered the leading jockey in the U.S. at age 14, a position he kept from 1871 to 1873. Career With age came weight, and in 1875, at the age of 18, Rowe retired from racing as a jockey. He began working for the Davis & Hall racing stable as an assistant to the trainer, David W. McConn. Rowe eventually became head trainer for the stable. In 1879, Rowe joined the Dwyer Brothers Stable. On May 17, 1881, with the future Hall of Fame horse Hindoo, he became the youngest trainer to win the Kentucky Derby. Hindoo won eighteen straight races that year. The Dwyers pushed their horses hard, in a manner that would be unacceptable and illegal today. Rowe quit the Dwyers in 1885 in a dispute regarding over-racing their horses, especially the mare Miss Woodford. Rowe trained for Alfred F. Walcott's Fairfax Stable, after which he was a public or freelance trainer until 1889. While he ran his own stable one of his clients was August Belmont. In 1891, Rowe was hired as the race starter at minor racetracks. In January 1892, he was hired by the Board of Control as starter for the Monmouth Park Association, Coney Island Jockey Club, Brooklyn Jockey Club, and the New York Jockey clubs.\\"James Rowe\\", New York Times, January 6, 1892 In 1899, Rowe became head trainer for the racing operations of James R. Keene. In 1911, he took charge of the racing stable of Harry Payne Whitney, for whom he trained his second Kentucky Derby winner. Rowe was the leading money winner in horse racing in 1908, 1913, and 1915, the year the Whitney stables' Regret became the first filly to win the Kentucky Derby. Regret was named 1915's Horse of the Year. She was later elected to the Racing Hall of Fame. Rowe had four second-place finishes with horses in the Preakness Stakes and won it with Broomspun in 1921. Despite his many victories in important races, it is for the performance of his horses in the Belmont Stakes that Rowe is most remembered. Between 1883 and 1913, he won the Belmont Stakes 8 times, more than any other trainer in history. One of those victories came in 1908 with a horse named Colin, who went unbeaten during his 15-race career. Rowe considered Colin to be the greatest horse he had ever trained. He once said that for his epitaph he wanted only these words: \\"He trained Colin.\\" Legacy Following the formation of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1955, James Rowe Sr. was inducted posthumously.

He is best known for his appearances with the Continental Wrestling Association, Jim Crockett Promotions and World Championship Wrestling in the 1970s and 1980s. Professional wrestling career =National Wrestling Alliance (1973‚Äì1987)= Dennis Condrey was born in Florence, Alabama, and started wrestling in 1973 in the Tennessee area, wrestling for promoter Nick Gulas. He would also wrestle in the Mid-Atlantic area as well. In July 1974, he won the NWA Tri-State Tag Team Championship with his brother-in-law, Joe Turner. Three months later, he would win the NWA Tri-State Heavyweight Championship. By the end of 1974, Condrey teamed up with Phil Hickerson, and became known as the Bicentennial Kings, and was managed by \\"Kangaroo\\" Al Costello. In March 1977, he began wrestling for Jerry Jarrett's promotion in Memphis. Four months later, he would make his first international trip to Canada, wrestling in the Maritimes. In 1978, Condrey went to Alabama's Southeast Championship Wrestling. After the Bicentennial Kings broke up in 1979, Condrey formed the Big C's with Don Carson. In 1980, after Carson retired, Condrey teamed up with Randy Rose, and formed the Midnight Express, alongside Norvell Austin. They dominated the tag team scene there until Condrey left for Mid-South wrestling in 1984. Once in Mid-South, Condrey formed a new version of the Midnight Express with Bobby Eaton with Jim Cornette as their manager. They also started a legendary feud with the Rock 'n' Roll Express that carried over into the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions in 1985. In early 1986, Condrey and Eaton won the NWA World Tag Team Titles from the Rock 'n' Roll Express on Superstars on the Superstation and feuded with them until Condrey left the promotion in early 1987. He literally left overnight, giving no notice to Cornette, Eaton, or the NWA. =American Wrestling Association (1987)= Condrey would reunite with former partner Randy Rose in the AWA under manager Paul E. Dangerously. \\"Loverboy\\" Dennis and \\"Ravishing\\" Randy called themselves \\"The Original Midnight Express\\", and claimed the right to the name, which had since been used by Condrey and Eaton (and later by \\"Beautiful\\" Bobby Eaton and \\"Sweet\\" Stan Lane) in the NWA. They would defeat Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee for the AWA World Tag Team titles on October 30, 1987, in Whitewater, WI. They would have a two-month title reign, losing the titles to the returning Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) on December 27, 1987 in Las Vegas, Nevada. =Return to the NWA World Championship Wrestling (1988‚Äì1989)= After wrestling the independents, Condrey returned to the NWA in November 1988, alongside Randy Rose and Paul E. Dangerously. During the November 5 episode of World Championship Wrestling, Jim Cornette received an anonymous phone call. The caller ridiculed Cornette over Eaton and Lane's loss of the NWA World Tag Team titles to the Road Warriors on October 29. Cornette recognized the caller and basically asked him to come say it to his face. At that point, Dangerously and the Original Midnight Express hit the ring and proceeded to pummel Cornette and Stan Lane, who was wrestling in a singles match. By the time Bobby Eaton showed up, it was three on one. Cornette showed up the next week on TBS carrying his blood stained suit jacket and the feud was on. The teams wrestled at Starrcade '88, but nothing was solved. The Midnights vs. Midnights would be the hottest feud in the NWA for months, building up to a 6-man tag match involving the managers on pay-per-view in February 1989. The one who got pinned would have to leave the promotion. However, due to changes in ownership, the NWA was going through booking upheaval with Dusty Rhodes being replaced as head booker by George Scott. Jim Crockett, Jr. already had a problem with Condrey due to his previous overnight disappearance and Scott had previous animosity with Rose, so Scott's appearance as top booker made for the catalyst to bury both teams and the feud. The feud was cooled off and the \\"loser leaves town\\" match was going to be used to kick one of them out of the territory once and for all and continue to bury the other. At the last minute, Dennis Condrey once again decided to leave the NWA, rather than take his PPV payoff and give Crockett and Scott the satisfaction. Jack Victory was brought in as his replacement and the match went forward. =Continental Wrestling Federation and International Championship Wrestling (1989‚Äì1990)= Condrey returned to Alabama (now known as Continental) in the Spring of 1989. On July 22, 1989, Condrey defeated Tom Prichard to win the CWF Heavyweight Championship, before losing the title back to Prichard on December 6. He would also form a short-lived tag team called the \\"Lethal Weapons\\" with Doug Gilbert. Together, they went to the New England area to wrestle for International Championship Wrestling. On December 30, 1989, they defeated Phil Apollo and Vic Steamboat, who was subbing for Apollo's partner Eric Sbraccia, who no-showed, to win the ICW Tag Team Championship. They held onto the belts until March 1990, when they left the promotion. Condrey retired shortly thereafter. =Independent circuit (2004‚Äì2011)= Condrey came back to team with Eaton in 2004 and, along with Stan Lane, they have been wrestling as the Midnight Express in the independents and feuding with the Rock 'n' Roll Express and The Fantastics. Condrey signed to World Wrestling Entertainment in March 2010 as a developmental trainer. He was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling and works with the rookies on the NXT roster. Condrey retired in 2011, after wrestling his last match on October 15, against Bill Mulkey at the AWE Night of Legends.

Released weekly on DeadEndDays.com, the series combined elements of farcical comedy, classic serial adventure, social commentary, and modern zombie horror genres. The year-long story followed the adventures of a number of individuals in a world wherein a human-zombie war has been narrowly averted and corporate marketing interests are just starting to target the undead as a viable demographic. Comprising 48 episodes, each five to ten minutes long, the series ran from October 2003 to November 2004, and attracted a cult following due to its black humor and commentary on modern marketing culture. Creators Dead End Days was created by producer Brad Fox, director Matthew Hoos, and screenwriter Jason Patrick Rothary, childhood friends from Calgary, Alberta. Before the project, each had become involved, in various capacities, in the Canadian film and live theatre industries. Plot summary In a post- war society wherein a zombie invasion has been narrowly averted, humanity is left scrambling to cope with the remaining zombie \\"demographic\\" that now forms a part of daily life. When a grasping-at-straws advertising campaign for \\"Brains Cola\\" turns into a runaway success, zombies become the new target for all manner of brain-themed products, as companies rush to capitalize on their untapped buying power. Eric is an apathetic video store clerk trafficking in black market classic horror movies. Ashley is a frustrated life insurance agent deluged with undead policy holders. Sam and Bridget are freelance zombie hunters desperate for a gig. And Bruce is an irritatingly cheerful previously- deceased-rights activist. All five characters struggle to find their place in this strange new world and collectively uncover a sinister plot by a multinational corporation looking to plunge the world into another zombie- human war, regardless of the cost. Conclusion The series concluded in November 2004. The co-creators of Dead End Days have gone on to create the breakfast-based online sitcom Cerealized.com, as well as several music video and short film projects. On the Rocket Ace Moving Pictures fan message boards they have confirmed they are also working on several secret short and feature film projects. Related products Dead End Days was released as a 4-DVD box set on February 13, 2006. It includes all 52 regular and bonus episodes, cast and crew commentaries, bloopers, outtake reels, and a featurette on the art design of the series. Dead End Days: The Complete Scriptbook, by series writer Jason Patrick Rothery, was published on October 31, 2005, it includes the original scripts for all 48 canonical episodes (and some alternate and variant drafts of key episodes), a selection of behind the scenes photographs, as well as essays on serialized writing by Rothery, and other contributors to the show.

Construction by the United States Army began in June 1941. The first aircraft landed there in January 1942, as a link in the North Atlantic air ferry route in World War II. The base had a peak population of about 4,000 American servicemen, and it is estimated that some 10,000 aircraft landed there en route to the war in Europe and North Africa. Soon after the United States entered the war, the War Department decided to deploy Major General Carl Spaatz's Eighth Air Force to Britain, putting the North Atlantic ferry route facilities constructed by the Corps to an early test. Radioing from Bluie West 1, while crossing the Atlantic in mid-June 1942, Spaatz ordered the movement to begin. The P-38 and P-39 fighters, piloted by combat crews who had been given special training in long-distance flying, were escorted by the longer-range B-17 bombers. With stops at the Canadian-built base at Goose Bay in Labrador, Bluie West 1 in Southern Greenland, and Reykjavik or Keflavik in Iceland, the aircraft could fly from the new Presque Isle Army Airfield in northern Maine to Prestwick Airport in Scotland with no leg of the journey longer than . Other important bases in Greenland were Bluie West Eight near the present-day town of Kangerlussuaq, and Bluie East One on the almost-uninhabited east coast. Bad weather is frequent in Southern Greenland, and Narsarsuaq is virtually surrounded by high mountains, making the approach to the steel-mat runway exceedingly difficult. The usual approach was a low-level flight up a fjord. Because the runway slopes up west to east, landings were (and still are predominantly) made to the east, with take-offs to the west, regardless of the wind direction. BW-1's importance declined post World War II, but the U.S. Air Force maintained it as Narsarsuaq Air Base during the early Cold War years, when it served as a refuelling station for jet fighters and for helicopters crossing the North Atlantic. The runway by this time had been paved with concrete. Jets require a longer take-off run than do propeller-driven aircraft, and the air base used a small tugboat to move icebergs out of the way of planes taking off over the basin west of the runway. There is a detailed account of a visit to BW-1 in the early days of World War II by Ernest K. Gann, in the book Fate Is The Hunter. The advent of aerial refueling, and the opening of the larger Thule Air Base in northern Greenland, made the base redundant, and it was turned over to the Danish government of Greenland in 1958. It is currently known as Narsarsuaq Airport and served by regular flights from Reykjav√≠k, Iceland during the summer season, as well as by commuter aircraft from Kangerlussaq and other Greenlandic airfields. There is no control tower, and ceiling is required, on all approach procedures.

He was a professor at the University of Belgrade's Law School and member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Within the frame of ancient Greek culture, he studied philosophy, law, politics and history, but also modern political theory and ethics. A majority of his works are within the field of philosophy and method of sociology, history of political theories and political science. In the past two decades, his work was mainly devoted to the study of Nietzsche and Heidegger. ƒêuriƒá studied law, philosophy and classic philology in Belgrade, where he obtained his PhD with the thesis on Ideas of the Natural Law in Greek Sophists (1954). He was professor at Law School from 1954 until 1973, when, for political reasons, he was removed from the University. In 1954 he was appointed as Research Fellow at the University of Belgrade's Law School, where he was later promoted to Assistant Professor in 1957, Associate Professor in 1964, and full Professor in 1969. He taught History of Political Theory, General Sociology and Methodology of Social Science.Mihailo Djuriƒá biography, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Trial and imprisonment In 1972, Mihailo ƒêuriƒá was expelled from the University, tried and sentenced to 9 months in prison for his criticism of the 1971 Constitutional Amendments as well as his opposition to demolishing of the Petar Petroviƒá Njego≈° chapel on Mount Lovƒáen. The discussion at the Law Faculty was delivered in a public discussion within the University building and the article on Njego≈° in a literary review written in opposition to the destruction. During his trial and imprisonment, many public figures expressed their opposition to then Yugoslav communist government, among them philosopher Ernst Bloch. After the release from prison ƒêuriƒá was formally employed at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade, from 1974 until 1989, when he returned to University. From his release from prison (1972), he was also a visiting professor at the Universities of Vienna, Berlin and Augsburg.Jasna Dragovic-Soso: Saviours of the Nation: Serbia's Intellectual Opposition and the Revival of Nationalism, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, Oct 9, 2002 page 44 In 1991, after rehabilitation, he returned to Law School. For many years ƒêuriƒá was a member of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy, the Scientific Council of which he chaired from 1986 until 1998. Nietzsche and Heidegger Starting from 1980s, ƒêuriƒá's writings both in Serbian and in German fundamentally contributed to our understanding of the works of Nietzsche and Heidegger and the crucial link between these two philosophers. While his Nietzsche and the Metaphysics (1984) and The Challenge of Nihilism (1986) concentrate mainly on Nietzsche, the On the Need of Philosophy Today: Philosophy between East and West is mainly a book about Heidegger and his reading of Nietzsche.

He is internationally renowned for his work on the foundations of probability, statistics, mathematical logic, and computer science. Since the late 1970s, Martin-L√∂f's publications have been mainly in logic. In philosophical logic, Martin-L√∂f has wrestled with the philosophy of logical consequence and judgment, partly inspired by the work of Brentano, Frege, and Husserl. In mathematical logic, Martin-L√∂f has been active in developing intuitionistic type theory as a constructive foundation of mathematics; Martin-L√∂f's work on type theory has influenced computer science.See e.g. . Until his retirement in 2009,Philosophy and Foundations of Mathematics: Epistemological and Ontological Aspects. A conference dedicated to Per Martin-L√∂f on the occasion of his retirement . Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study, Uppsala, May 5‚Äì8, 2009. Retrieved 2014-01-26. Per Martin-L√∂f held a joint chair for Mathematics and Philosophy at Stockholm University.Member profile, Academia Europaea, retrieved 2014-01-26. His brother Anders Martin-L√∂f is now emeritus professor of mathematical statistics at Stockholm University; the two brothers have collaborated in research in probability and statistics. The research of Anders and Per Martin-L√∂f has influenced statistical theory, especially concerning exponential families, the expectation-maximization method for missing data, and model selection.For details, see the #Statistical models section of this article. Per Martin-L√∂f is an enthusiastic bird-watcher; his first scientific publication was on the mortality rates of ringed birds.. Randomness and Kolmogorov complexity In 1964 and 1965, Martin-L√∂f studied in Moscow under the supervision of Andrei N. Kolmogorov. He wrote a 1966 article The definition of random sequences that gave the first suitable definition of a random sequence. Earlier researchers such as Richard von Mises had attempted to formalize the notion of a test for randomness in order to define a random sequence as one that passed all tests for randomness; however, the precise notion of a randomness test was left vague. Martin-L√∂f's key insight was to use the theory of computation to define formally the notion of a test for randomness. This contrasts with the idea of randomness in probability; in that theory, no particular element of a sample space can be said to be random. Martin-L√∂f randomness has since been shown to admit many equivalent characterizations -- in terms of compression, randomness tests, and gambling -- that bear little outward resemblance to the original definition, but each of which satisfies our intuitive notion of properties that random sequences ought to have: random sequences should be incompressible, they should pass statistical tests for randomness, and it should be impossible to make money betting on them. The existence of these multiple definitions of Martin-L√∂f randomness, and the stability of these definitions under different models of computation, give evidence that Martin- L√∂f randomness is a fundamental property of mathematics and not an accident of Martin-L√∂f's particular model. The thesis that the definition of Martin-L√∂f randomness \\"correctly\\" captures the intuitive notion of randomness has been called the \\"Martin-L√∂f-Chaitin Thesis\\"; it is somewhat similar to the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis.Jean-Paul Delahaye, Randomness, Unpredictability and Absence of Order, in Philosophy of Probability, p. 145‚Äì167, Springer 1993. Following Martin-L√∂f's work, algorithmic information theory defines a random string as one that cannot be produced from any computer program that is shorter than the string (Chaitin‚ÄìKolmogorov randomness); i.e. a string whose Kolmogorov complexity is at least the length of the string. This is a different meaning from the usage of the term in statistics. Whereas statistical randomness refers to the process that produces the string (e.g. flipping a coin to produce each bit will randomly produce a string), algorithmic randomness refers to the string itself. Algorithmic information theory separates random from nonrandom strings in a way that is relatively invariant to the model of computation being used. An algorithmically random sequence is an infinite sequence of characters, all of whose prefixes (except possibly a finite number of exceptions) are strings that are \\"close to\\" algorithmically random (their length is within a constant of their Kolmogorov complexity).  Mathematical statistics  Per Martin-L√∂f has done important research in mathematical statistics, which (in the Swedish tradition) includes probability theory and statistics. = Bird-watching and sex determination = The Dunlin (Calidris alpina) Per Martin-L√∂f began bird watching in his youth and remains an enthusiastic bird-watcher.George A. Barnard, \\"Gone Birdwatching\\", New Scientist, 4 December 1999, magazine issue 2215. As a teenager, he published an article on estimating the mortality rates of birds, using data from bird ringing, in a Swedish zoological journal: This paper was soon cited in leading international journals, and this paper continues to be cited. In the biology and statistics of birds, there are several problems of missing data. Martin-L√∂f's first paper discussed the problem of estimating the mortality rates of the Dunlin species, using capture-recapture methods. A second problem of missing data arises with studying the sex of birds. The problem of determining the biological sex of a bird, which is extremely difficult for humans, is one of the first examples in Martin-L√∂f's lectures on statistical models. = Probability on algebraic structures = Martin-L√∂f wrote a licenciate thesis on probability on algebraic structures, particularly semigroups, a research program led by Ulf Grenander at Stockholm University.Martin-L√∂f, P. The continuity theorem on a locally compact group. Teor. Verojatnost. i Primenen. 10 1965 367‚Äì371.Martin-L√∂f, Per Probability theory on discrete semigroups. Z. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verw. Gebiete 4 1965 78‚Äì102Nitis Mukhopadhyay. A Conversation with Ulf Grenander. Statist. Sci. Volume 21, Number 3 (2006), 404‚Äì426. = Statistical models = Martin- L√∂f developed innovative approaches to statistical theory. In his paper \\"On Tables of Random Numbers\\", Kolmogorov observed that the frequency probability notion of the limiting properties of infinite sequences failed to provide a foundation for statistics, which considers only finite samples. Much of Martin-L√∂f's work in statistics was to provide a finite-sample foundation for statistics.  Model selection and hypothesis testing  The steps of the EM algorithm on a two component Gaussian mixture model on the Old Faithful dataset In the 1970s, Per Martin-L√∂f made important contributions to statistical theory and inspired further research, especially by Scandinavian statisticians including Rolf Sundberg, Thomas H√∂glund, and Steffan Lauritzen. In this work, Martin-L√∂f's previous research on probability measures on semigroups led to a notion of \\"repetitive structure\\" and a novel treatment of sufficient statistics, in which one-parameter exponential families were characterized. He provided a category-theoretic approach to nested statistical models, using finite-sample principles. Before (and after) Martin-L√∂f, such nested models have often been tested using chi-square hypothesis tests, whose justifications are only asymptotic (and so irrelevant to real problems, which always have finite samples).  Expectation maximization method for exponential families  Martin-L√∂f's student, Rolf Sundberg, developed a detailed analysis of the expectation-maximization (EM) method for estimation using data from exponential families, especially with missing data. Sundberg credits a formula, later known as the Sundberg formula, to previous manuscripts of the Martin-L√∂f brothers, Per and Anders.Rolf Sundberg. 1971.

Dempster, Nan Laird, and Donald Rubin, which was published in a leading international journal, sponsored by the Royal Statistical Society. Logic Franz Brentano =Philosophical logic= In philosophical logic, Per Martin-L√∂f has published papers on the theory of logical consequence, on judgments, etc. He has been interested in Central-European philosophical traditions, especially of the German-language writings of Franz Brentano, Gottlob Frege, and of Edmund Husserl. =Type theory= Martin-L√∂f has worked in mathematical logic for many decades. From 1968 to '69 he worked as an Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago where he met William Alvin Howard with whom he discussed issues related to the Curry‚ÄìHoward correspondence. Martin-L√∂f's first draft article on type theory dates back to 1971. This impredicative theory generalized Girard's System F. However, this system turned out to be inconsistent due to Girard's paradox which was discovered by Girard when studying System U, an inconsistent extension of System F. This experience led Per Martin-L√∂f to develop the philosophical foundations of type theory, his meaning explanation, a form of proof-theoretic semantics, which justifies predicative type theory as presented in his 1984 Bibliopolis book, and extended in a number of increasingly philosophical texts, such as his influential On the Meanings of the Logical Constants and the Justifications of the Logical Laws. The 1984 type theory was extensional while the type theory presented in the book by Nordstr√∂m et al. in 1990, which was heavily influenced by his later ideas, intensional, and more amenable to being implemented on a computer. Martin-L√∂f's intuitionistic type theory developed the notion of dependent types and directly influenced the development of the calculus of constructions and the logical framework LF. A number of popular computer-based proof systems are based on type theory, for example NuPRL, LEGO, Coq, ALF, Agda, Twelf, Epigram, and Idris.

She was Princess of Lucca and Piombino (1805-1814), Grand Duchess of Tuscany (1809-1814) and Countess of Compignano by appointment of her brother. She was the fourth surviving child and eldest surviving daughter of Carlo Buonaparte and Letizia Ramolino. A younger sister of Napoleon Bonaparte, she had elder brothers Joseph and Lucien, and younger siblings Louis, Pauline, Caroline and Jerome. As Princess of Lucca and Piombino, then Grand Duchess of Tuscany, she became Napoleon's only sister to possess political power. Their relations were sometimes strained due to her sharp tongue. Highly interested in the arts, particularly the theatre, she encouraged them in the territories over which she ruled. Life =Youth= √âlisa Bonaparte as a child (Lorenzo Bartolini) √âlisa was born in Ajaccio, Corsica. She was christened Maria-Anna, but later officially adopted the nickname \\"√âlisa\\" (her brother Lucien, to whom she was very close in childhood, nicknamed her Elisa). In June 1784, a bursary allowed her to attend the Maison royale de Saint-Louis at Saint-Cyr, where she was frequently visited by her brother Napoleon. Following the French Revolution, the Legislative Assembly decreed the Maison's closure on 16 August 1792 as it shut down institutions associated with the aristocracy. √âlisa left on 1 September with Napoleon to return to Ajaccio. Around 1795, the Bonaparte family relocated to Marseille. There √âlisa got to know Felice Pasquale Baciocchi (who later adopted the surname Levoy). A Corsican nobleman and formerly a captain in the Royal Corse, he had been dismissed from his rank with the outbreak of the French Revolution. =Marriage and family= √âlisa married Levoy in a civil ceremony in Marseille on 1 August 1797, followed by a religious ceremony in Mombello, where Napoleon had a villa. He had moved there with his family in June 1797. Concerned about Baciocchi's reputation as a poor captain, Napoleon had some initial reservations about his sister's choice of spouse. Their religious ceremony was held on the same day as her sister Pauline's marriage to general Victor-Emmanuel Leclerc. In July, Baciocchi was promoted to Chef de bataillon, with the command of the citadel at Ajaccio. In 1799, the extended Bonaparte family moved to Paris. √âlisa set up home at 125 rue de Miromesnil, in the Quartier du Roule, where she held receptions and put on plays. During the rise of the Consulate, she and her brother Lucien held an artistic and literary salon at the H√¥tel de Brissac, at which she met the journalist Louis de Fontanes, with whom she had a deep friendship for several years. On 14 May 1800, on the death of Lucien's first wife, Christine Boyer, √âlisa took Lucien's two daughters under her protection. She placed Charlotte, the eldest, in Madame Campan's boarding school for young women at Saint- Germain-en-Laye. At the start of November 1800, Lucien was reassigned from his job as Minister of the Interior to Madrid as French ambassador to the court of the King of Spain. He took √âlisa's husband, F√©lix Baciocchi, as his secretary. √âlisa remained in Paris, but maintained a regular correspondence with her brother. On 18 May 1804, the French Senate voted in favour of setting up the First French Empire, and √âlisa and Napoleon's other sisters were established as members of the Imperial family, both taking the style \\"Imperial Highness\\" (\\"Altesse imp√©riale\\"). Felice Baciocchi was promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade and later made a senator. =Princess of Piombino and Lucca= Coat of arms of Princess Bonaparte Her separation from her husband in 1805 was seen favorably by Napoleon (though he soon rejoined her after her promotion to Lucca). On 19 March 1805, Napoleon awarded her the Principality of Piombino, which had been French property for some years and was of major strategic interest to Napoleon due to its proximity to Elba and Corsica. Felice and √âlisa took the titles Prince and Princess of Piombino. In June 1805, the oligarchic Republic of Lucca, which had been occupied by France since late 1799, was made a principality and added to Felice and √âlisa's domain, their entry into Lucca and investiture ceremony following on 14 July 1805. Napoleon had contemptuously called Lucca the \\"dwarf republic\\", due to its small size in terms of territory, but despite this it was a bulwark of political, religious, and commercial independence. Most of the power over Lucca and Piombino was exercised by √âlisa, with F√©lix taking only a minor role and contenting himself with making military decisions. The inhabitants of Lucca, under French occupation and begrudging the loss of their independence, knew √âlisa ironically as \\"la Madame\\" and had little sympathy for Napoleon, √âlisa, or their attempts to \\"Frenchify\\" the republic. Very active and concerned with administering the area, √âlisa was surrounded at Lucca by ministers who largely remained in place right to the end of her reign. These ministers included her Minister of Justice, Luigi Matteucci, her Minister of the Interior and Foreign Affairs, Francesco Belluomini (replaced in October 1807 by his son Giuseppe), her finance ministers, Jean-Baptiste Froussard (head of the cabinet) and, later, Pierre d'Hautmesnil (with the budget portfolio). She also set up a court and court etiquette inspired by those at the Tuileries. On 31 March 1806 Napoleon withdrew Massa and Carrara from the Kingdom of Italy to add to √âlisa's possessions. Carrara was one of the biggest white marble suppliers in Europe and √âlisa bolstered her prestige by establishing an Acad√©mie des Beaux- Arts, designed to host the greatest sculptors and thus make Carrara an exporter of marble statues, which had a greater value than the raw marble. She also set up the Banque √âlisienne to give financial aid to sculptors and workers on marble taxes. She reformed the clergy at Lucca and Piombino from May 1806, during which reforms she nationalised their goods and lands and closed down convents which did not also function as hotels or schools. She also carried out legislative reform in Lucca, producing laws inspired by the Code Napoleon (such as the notable \\"Codice rurale del Principato di Piombino\\", issued on 24 March 1808) and producing a new penal code which was promulgated in 1807 and first reformed in 1810. In 1807 she set up the Committee of Public Charity for distributing charity funds, made up of clergy and lay-people, and also instituted free medical consultations for the poor so as to eradicate the diseases then ravaging Lucca's population. She demolished Piombino's hospital to build a new one in the former monastery of Sant' Anastasia, with the new building opening in 1810, and also set up the Casa Sanitaria, a dispensary in the town's port. On 5 May 1807, decreed the established of the \\"Committee for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts and Commerce\\" to encourage and finance the invention of new machines and new techniques to increase the territories' agricultural production and experimental plantations such as those of mulberries at Massa, where an √âcole Normale de la Soie (Silk School) was created on 16 August 1808. √âlisa also set up many teaching establishments in Lucca and, in 1809, a \\"Direction G√©n√©rale de l'Instruction Publique\\" (General Department of Public Education). On 1 December 1807 she set up the \\"Coll√®ge F√©lix\\", the only boys' secondary school in the principality. For girls, she began by fixing set curricula for convents that also operated as schools, then set up a body of \\"dames d'inspection\\" to verify that these curricula were being adhered to. Teaching of girls aged 5 to 8 was made compulsory, though the laws were not always well applied. On 2 July 1807, √âlisa founded the \\"Institut √âlisa\\" within the limits of a former convent for noble-born girls, to produce well-educated and cultivated future wives. On 29 July 1812, √âlisa set up an establishment for young poor girls, the \\"Congregazione San Felice\\", though this did not long outlive √âlisa's fall. As with Napoleon, √âlisa set up city improvement works in her territories, mainly to expand the princely palaces. These works were hotly contested, especially in Lucca, where the expansion of the princely palaces necessitated the demolition of the Church of San Pietro in March 1807. She also razed an entire block in Lucca to build a piazza in the French style in front of her city residence (now the seat of the province and the prefecture). That block had included the Church of San Paolo with the venerated image of the Madonna dei miracoliImage and so its demolition seriously affected the city's medieval architecture and almost sparked a revolt. At Massa, she demolished a cathedral on 30 April 1807. The palace at Lucca was fully redecorated and the gardens improved, with the creation of a botanical garden with a menagerie and aviary in 1811. She also began road construction, notably the \\"route Friedland\\" to link Massa and Carrara, with work beginning on 15 August 1807 but becoming delayed and only completed in 1820. Lucca's status as a spa town was also bolstered by her improvement of the architecture and decor of the town's baths. She began construction of an aqueduct into Lucca in 1811, but this too was only completed after her fall. =Grand duchess of Tuscany= Elisa, as Grand Duchess of Tuscany, supported Napoleon‚Äôs desire to unify Italy under Bonapartist rule. On 21 March 1801, Lucien Bonaparte and the King of Spain signed the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso, which restored Louisiana to France and in exchange established the Kingdom of Etruria by dividing Tuscany. The new kingdom was initially put in the charge of the infante Maria Louisa and her husband, Louis of Etruria, but he soon proved to be a poor ruler and deceased soon after in 1803. Thus, on 29 October 1807, Napoleon signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau with the Spanish court. This transferred Tuscany to France, and, in November of that year, Marie-Louise left the kingdom. From 12 May 1808, Tuscany was entrusted to an intermediary governor, Abdallah Jacques Menou, a French soldier who had converted to Islam during Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, but his way of life and lack of interest in the territory's affairs forced Napoleon to recall him on 5 April 1809. √âlisa wished to become Governess of Tuscany in 1808, but she contracted an illness late in the year that prevented her from taking part in state affairs. She recovered in February 1809. A decree was officially created between the second and third of March that year which established the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, made Florence its capital and √âlisa its grand duchess. However, the terms of the decree required √âlisa to enforce the decisions of Napoleon and his ministers and denied her the power to modify any of these decisions. This was a significant difference compared to the relative autonomy √âlisa enjoyed in Lucca and Piombino. The decree also promoted F√©lix to the rank of g√©n√©ral de division. On 2 April 1809, √âlisa arrived in Florence, where she was coldly received by the nobility. Her arrival coincided with a revolt against compulsory conscription that ended after a mayor and a judge were assassinated. The conscription and many new taxes imposed on Tuscany by Napoleon were sources of conflicts in the region. As at Lucca, √âlisa tried to nationalise the goods of the clergy and closed many convents. She continued her patronage of arts and science. In 1809, she commissioned the sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini to create busts of her immediate family. The first two volumes of the \\"Annali del Museo Imperiale di Fisica e Storia Naturale\\" of Florence were dedicated to her, in 1808 and 1809. The observatory at that museum of physics and natural history was the ancestor of Florence's present-day Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri. √âlisa later became unwillingly involved in Napoleon's removal of Pope Pius VII. Pius opposed the Empire's annexation of the Papal States, and he refused to renounce his temporal powers. Pius then excommunicated Napoleon in the bull Quum memoranda on 10 June 1809. In response to this intransigence, Napoleon selected a general, √âtienne Radet, to remove the pope and eliminate a figure that could rally opposition against the Empire and his regime. The removal occurred on the night of 6 July 1809, and in the pope traveled toward Savona in the days following his ouster. The pope passed by Florence where √âlisa did not welcome him in person and also asked Pius to leave the region soon as possible, so as not to displease her brother by being seen as welcoming his enemy. √âlisa's relations with Napoleon became increasingly strained. Napoleon frequently recalled √âlisa for any irregularity in her execution of his orders in Tuscany. On 17 March 1810, √âlisa arrived in Paris for Napoleon's marriage to Marie-Louise of Austria, but Napoleon took advantage of her visit to reclaim the payments from his grants of Massa and Carrara. When √âlisa returned to Tuscany, she found Napoleon still sought to claim payment of these grants via his envoys. √âlisa refused to pay a second time, arguing that the territories had too few resources to pay Napoleon's demanded 200,000 lira. Napoleon threatened to seize Carrara from √âlisa and also demanded Lucca raise men by conscription. Lucca was previously spared this burden prior to May 1811, and Napoleon's demands eroded √âlisa support in Lucca. √âlisa returned to Lucca from Florence and restored the villa now known as the Villa Reale di Marlia, despite the cold reception of the local community. =Fall and exile= In 1813, with Napoleon facing the allied coalition after his Russian campaign, Caroline Bonaparte's husband Joachim Murat, King of Naples, abandoned his brother-in-law and joined the Austrian cause by leading the Neapolitan to Rome. √âlisa was forced to abdicate as Grand Duchess of Tuscany in favor of Grand Duke Ferdinand III's restoration and leave Tuscany for Lucca. The Neapolitans captured Massa and Carrara in March. An Anglo-Austrian force under Lord William Bentinck captured Lucca soon after, forcing the pregnant √âlisa to flee on the night of 13 March 1814. √âlisa made several short stays in Italy and France, notably seeking support in Marseille to return to Italy as a private individual. The former duchess' requests were denied, but she was able to stay in Austria for a time thanks to the efforts of her brother, J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, before moving to the Villa Caprara in Trieste. Napoleon was exiled to Elba on 13 April 1814 under the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and √âlisa was arrested on 25 March (??) and interned in the Austrian fortress of Br√ºnn. She was freed at the end of August and authorized to stay in Trieste with the title of Countess of Compignano. √âlisa acquired a country house at Villa Vicentina near Cervignano after her release and financed several archaeological digs in the region. She contracted a fatal illness in June 1820, probably at an excavation site, and died on 7 August at the age of 43. √âlisa became the only adult sibling of Napoleon Bonaparte not to survive the emperor. She was buried in the San Petronio Basilica of Bologna. Marriage and issue She married Felice Pasquale Baciocchi Levoy, a member of Corsican nobility, on 1 May 1797, created Prince Fran√ßais, Duke of Lucca and Prince of Piombino and Prince of Massa-Carrara and La Garfagnana. They were parents of four children: *Felix Napol√©on Baciocchi Levoy (1798‚Äì1799). *Elisa Napol√©one Baciocchi Levoy (1806‚Äì1869); married Philippe, Comte Camerata-Passione√Ø de Mazzoleni (1805‚Äì1882), and had one son: **Charles F√©lix Jean-Baptiste Camerata-Passionei di Mazzoleni (1826‚Äì1853) *J√©r√¥me Charles Baciocchi Levoy (1810‚Äì1811). *Fr√©d√©ric Napol√©on Baciocchi Levoy (1814‚Äì1833).

He is best known for establishing the dominance of the KKE over other left-wing elements, and for his flexibility and forming alliances with the conservatives. Early life Florakis was born on 20 July 1914 in the village of Paliozoglopi, located near Agrafa in the Itamos municipality, in the Karditsa Prefecture, Greece. He joined the Communist Party of Greece in 1941. An EAM-ELAS partisan during the resistance to the Nazi occupation in World War II, Florakis was on the losing side of the Greek Civil War that followed the liberation of the country, and subsequently left the country. After the Civil War On his return to Greece in 1954 he was arrested. During his life he spent 18 years in detention or jail - including being put in internal exile by the Greek colonels in the beginning of the 1967-74 military dictatorship. First elected to parliament in 1974 after the Metapolitefsi, Florakis led KKE as its general secretary from 1972 until 1989, when, though still fit for the job, he announced his decision to step down from the party's top post and proposed Grigoris Farakos as his successor.  The Synaspismos era  Florakis did not retire from politics, however. In the same year he retired from the leadership of the KKE, he was approved as the president of the newly founded Synaspismos or Coalition of the Left. Synaspismos was an attempt to reconcile Greece's two main communist factions, which arose in 1968 out of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring. That show of brute strength led many Greek communists to break with the Moscow-oriented KKE and to join one of the factions that emerged. Synaspismos was created partly at the instigation of Florakis, and drew members from both the KKE and the KKE-Interior Eurocommunists. It also became an umbrella for other leftist groups and disaffected supporters of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement of Andreas Papandreou, which lost the general election in 1989. In 1991, as it became increasingly clear that Soviet communism would not last, a rift arose within the KKE between those who supported continuing efforts towards a reconciliation with the Euro-communists through Synaspismos, and orthodox communists who felt that communism was threatened internationally and favoured a return to ideological roots. Florakis sided with the latter and at the 13th KKE conference in early 1991 ‚Äîeven before the fall of Mikhail Gorbachev and the dissolution of the Soviet Union‚Äî the party officially withdrew all support from Synaspismos and Florakis was elected honorary president of the KKE.  Death  Florakis died of heart failure at his home in Athens on 22 May 2005. Florakis' body lay in state at the KKE headquarters in Perissos on May 24‚Äì25 where thousands of party members and sympathisers queued to pay their respects. Party leader Aleka Papariga addressed a civil funeral on the evening of May 25 which was attended by the President of Greece Karolos Papoulias, prime minister Costas Karamanlis, parliament speaker Anna Benaki-Psarouda, opposition Pasok party leader George Papandreou, Left Coalition leader Alekos Alavanos, Cypriot communist party AKEL leader and Cyprus parliament speaker Dimitris Christofias, many ministers and MPs and other dignitaries. He was interred on May 26 at the Agios Ilias cemetery in his native village.  Awards  Florakis received many awards during his lifetime for his multiple achievements and political activities: * Order of Friendship of Peoples, from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union * Order of Karl Marx, from the German Democratic Republic * Dimitrov Prize, from the People's Republic of Bulgaria * Order of Lenin, from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1984 Further reading * Wilsford, David, ed.

Islam was introduced to Kazakhstan in the 7th to 12th centuries. Besides lamb, many other traditional foods retain symbolic value in Kazakh culture. Kazakh culture is largely influenced by the Turkic nomadic lifestyle. Kazakh culture seems also to be strongly influenced by the nomadic Scythians. Because animal husbandry was central to the Kazakhs' traditional lifestyle, most of their nomadic practices and customs relate in some way to livestock. Traditional curses and blessings invoked disease or fecundity among animals, and good manners required that a person ask first about the health of a man's livestock when greeting him and only afterward inquire about the human aspects of his life. The traditional Kazakh dwelling is the yurt, a tent consisting of a flexible framework of willow wood covered with varying thicknesses of felt. The open top permits smoke from the central hearth to escape; temperature and draft can be controlled by a flap that increases or decreases the size of the opening. A properly constructed yurt can be cooled in summer and warmed in winter, and it can be disassembled or set up in less than an hour. The interior of the yurt has ritual significance; the right side is generally reserved for men and the left for women. Yurts are also frequently used as a decorative motif in restaurants and other public buildings. Modern Influences Today's Kazakhstan is a modern culture, thriving in the post- Soviet era. The traditional Kazakh lifestyle has blended with influences from Western societies, as well as those from Kazakhstan's Russian and Chinese neighbors. Religion Islam is the largest religion in Kazakhstan, followed by Russian Orthodox Christianity. By tradition the Kazakhs are Sunni Muslims, and the Russians are Russian Orthodox. Approximately 70% of the population is Muslim. The majority are Sunni of the Hanafi school, including ethnic Kazakhs, who constitute about 60% of the population, as well as by ethnic Uzbeks, Uighurs, and Tatars.Kazakhstan - International Religious Freedom Report 2008 U.S. Department of State. Retrieved on 2009-09-07. Less than 25% of the population is Russian Orthodox, including ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. Other religious groups include Judaism, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, Hare Krishnas, Buddhism, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Cuisine A platter of horse meat served traditionally as an appetizer. Traditional Kazakh cuisine revolves around lamb and horse meat, as well as a variety of dairy milk products. For hundreds of years, Kazakhs were herders who raised fat-tailed sheep, Bactrian camels, and horses, relying on these animals for transportation, clothing, and food. The cooking techniques and major ingredients have been strongly influenced by the nation's nomadic way of life. For example, most cooking techniques are aimed at long-term preservation of food. There is a large practice of salting and drying meat so that it will last, and there is a preference for sour milk, as it is easier to save in a nomadic lifestyle. In recent years, there has been an influx of young westernised Kazakh chefs into the heart of Nur-Sultan, including the now famous Rania Ahmed who spent her early years training in West London‚Äôs Michelin Star restaurants. This has resulted in a new breed of cuisine which blends traditional savoury Kazakh dishes with European fast food, such as betinjantabs, proving very popular with younger generations. Besbarmak, a dish consisting of boiled horse or lamb meat, is the most popular Kazakh dish. Besbarmak is usually eaten with a boiled pasta sheet, and a meat broth called shorpa, and is traditionally served in Kazakh bowls called kese. Other popular meat dishes are kazy (which is a horse meat sausage that only the wealthy could afford), shuzhuk (horse meat sausages), kuyrdak (also spelled kuirdak, a dish made from roasted horse, sheep, or cow offal, such as heart, liver, kidneys, and other organs, diced and served with onions and peppers), and various horse delicacies, such as zhal (smoked lard from horse's neck) and zhaya (salted and smoked meat from horse's hip and hind leg). Pilaf (palaw) is the most common Kazakh rice dish, with vegetables (carrots, onions, and/or garlic) and chunks of meat. The national drinks are kumys (fermented mare's milk) and tea.  Traditions  Kazakhs are known for their hospitality, and so many Kazakh traditions are based on this ethnic feature. Some traditions have been lost, but some have been rediscovered. Below are some of the traditions that continue to play a role in the modern Kazakh society: Konakasy (Kazakh: “õ–æ–Ω–∞“õ–∞—Å—ã; \\"konak\\" - guest, \\"as\\" - food) - a tradition to welcome a guest and make his stay as enjoyable as one can by providing food, lodge, entertainment. Depending on the circumstances under which a guest had come from, he is either called \\"arnayy konak\\" (Kazakh: –∞—Ä–Ω–∞–π—ã “õ–æ–Ω–∞“õ) - a specially invited guest, \\"kudayy konak\\" (Kazakh: “õ“±–¥–∞–π—ã “õ–æ–Ω–∞“õ) - a casual traveller, or \\"kydyrma konak\\" (Kazakh: “õ—ã–¥—ã—Ä–º–∞ “õ–æ–Ω–∞“õ) - an unexpected visitor. Korimdik (Kazakh: –∫”©—Ä—ñ–º–¥—ñ–∫; \\"koru\\" - to see) - a tradition of presenting a person with a gift to congratulate him on a gain in his life. The custom is called korimdik, if a gain is related to a person or an animal (e.g. seeing a person's daughter-in-law or a newborn animal for the first time), and baygazy (Kazakh: –±–∞–π“ì–∞–∑—ã), if the gain is material. Shashu (Kazakh: —à–∞—à—É - to scatter) - a tradition to shower heroes of an occasion with sweets during some festivity. Kazakhs believe that collected delights bring luck. Bata (Kazakh: –±–∞—Ç–∞ - blessing) - a form of poetic art, typically given by the most respected or the eldest person to express gratitude for the provided hospitality, give blessing to a person who is about to enter a new phase in life, go through a challenging experience or travel. Tusau kesu (Kazakh: —Ç“±—Å–∞—É –∫–µ—Å—É - to cut ties) - a tradition to celebrate the first attempts of a child to walk. The legs of a child are tied with a string of white and black colors symbolizing the good and the bad in life. The tie is then cut by a female relative who is energetic and lively in nature, so that the child acquires her qualities. After the string has been cut, it is burnt. Kyz uzatu (Kazakh: “õ—ã–∑ “±–∑–∞—Ç—É) - the first wedding party organized by the parents of a bride. The literal translation is \\"to see off a daughter\\". Betashar (Kazakh: –±–µ—Ç–∞—à–∞—Ä; \\"bet\\" - face, \\"ashu\\" - to open) - the custom (often done at the wedding) to lift a veil from the face of a bride. Today it is mullah who is invited to perform an improvised song, in which he mentions relatives of the groom. During his performance, a bride has to bow every time she hears a name. After the song, a mother of the groom lifts the veil. Shildehana (Kazakh: —à—ñ–ª–¥–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∞) - celebration of a birth of a child. Suinshi (Kazakh: —Å“Ø–π—ñ–Ω—à—ñ) - a tradition to give present to someone who has brought good news. Languages The official language is Kazakh, a Turkic language closely related to Nogai and Karakalpak. Another widely spoken language is Russian. The recent language policy suggests trilingualism as an important factor for future development of the country. Literature Abay Qunanbayuli lived from August 10, 1845 to July 6, 1904 Abay Qunanbayuli was a great Kazakh poet, composer and philosopher.  Art  Each year Kazakh artisans participate in the ‚ÄúSheber‚Äù competition. The competition is part of the program \\"Development of crafts and the revival of folk arts and crafts in Kazakhstan\\", which began in 2006 to increase the competitiveness of Kazakh artisans‚Äô products domestically and internationally.

Movies In September 2006, the government announced that it is funding distribution of a multimillion-dollar movie called \\"Nomad\\", about the new-created by Kazakhstan government history of the nation. The movie started in 2003, and has been plagued with multiple development problems, finally released in 2006. Since that time such movies like \\"Mongol\\", \\"Tulpan\\", and \\"Kelin\\" have been released. All three films were submitted for the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Languages Film.Wikipedia pages List of Kazakhstani submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film The movie 'Tulpan' won the Prix Un Certain Regard at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.Wikipedia pages Tulpan The speechless movie \\"Kelin\\" made the shortlist of the 82.Academy Awards.

Kazakhstan has achieved some success in international competitions in weightlifting, ice hockey, and boxing. Kazakhstan won eight medals in the 2004 Summer Olympics, the largest tally for any nation in Central Asia. Football is the most popular sport in Kazakhstan. The Football Federation of Kazakhstan (FFK) is the sport's national governing body. The FFK organises the men's, women's, and futsal national teams. The Kazakhstan Super League is the top-level competition for the sport in the country. Cycling is Kazakhstan's most successful sport. A lot of professional cyclists that compete on the European circuit come from Kazakhstan. Most notable is Alexander Vinokourov, whose achievements include two Paris‚ÄìNice's, third place in the 2003 Tour de France, and the Amstel Gold Race. Vinokourov leads which is supported by a coalition of Kazakh companies. This team is registered as a UCI ProTeam and competes in major races, including the Tour de France. Rugby union is a popular sport in Kazakhstan, with over 10,000 fans consistently turning up to watch the Kazakhstan national rugby union team play. Recent big wins over Sri Lanka and the Arabian Gulf Rugby Team have given the Kazakhstan side the reason to believe that they could have been contenders to qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Kazakhstan has yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup tournament. Ruhani Zhangyru President Nursultan Nazarbayev outlined six specific projects designed to start the spiritual modernisation of Kazakhstan in his keynote article ‚ÄúCourse towards the Future: Modernisation of Kazakhstan's Identity,\\" which was released in April 2017. The projects include the following: * a step-by-step transition of the Kazakh language to the Latin alphabet and the New Humanitarian Knowledge * 100 New Textbooks in the Kazakh Language * Tugan Zher * Sacred Geography of Kazakhstan * Modern Kazakh Culture in the Global World * 100 New Faces of Kazakhstan. The program also includes translation of the contemporary Kazakh literature and poetry into the UN's six languages. The official presentation of the Anthology took place in Almaty in April 2019. The presentation of the Anthology translated into English was held at the British Library in London on September 25, 2019. The Cambridge University Press along with the British literary translation experts translated and published the Kazakh literature collections in English. An important part of the program is the Seven Facets of the Great Steppe doctrine, which described by President Nazarbayev. The article described the seven facets of the Great Steppe: culture of horsemanship, ancient metallurgy of the great steppe, animal style, Golden Man, cradle of the Turkic world, the Great Silk Road and the land of apples and tulips.

Avid discontinued this product, stating: \\"Effective September 1, 2007, Avid is discontinuing the Avid Free DV application offer, and has no immediate plans to make an updated version available.\\" It was intended to give editors a sample of the Avid interface to use in deciding whether or not to purchase Avid software, so when compared with other Avid products its features were relatively minimal. When it was available it was not limited by time or watermarking, so it could be used as a non-linear editor for as long as desired. Comparisons When compared with other consumer-end non-linear editors such as iMovie and Windows Movie Maker, it sported more powerful video processing tools, but lacked the ease-of-use and shallow learning curve emphasized in similar programs because it had the full interface of the professional Avid system. However, Avid did offer a number of flash-based tutorials to help new users learn how to use the program for capturing, editing, clipping, processing, and outputting audio/video, among other things. Limitations The limitations of Avid Free DV included that it allowed only two video and audio tracks, had fewer editing tools than other Avid products, had few import and export formats, and allowed capture and output of standard-definition DV only, via firewire. Avid Free DV projects and media were not compatible with other Avid systems. As the name implied, Avid Free DV was available as a free download, although users were required to complete a short survey on the Avid website before they were given a download link and key. In addition to using Free DV to evaluate Avid prior to purchase, it could also act as a stepping stone for people wishing to learn to use Avid's other editing products, such as Xpress Pro, Media Composer and Symphony. While additional skills and techniques are necessary to use these professionally geared systems, the basic operation remains the same. Operating systems Avid Free DV was available for Windows XP and Mac OS X: Officially supported Mac OS X versions: Panther versions up to 10.3.5, and Tiger versions up to 10.4.3 only.

Sverresborg (Norwegian:Sverresborg i Trondheim) or Sverre Sigurdsson's castle (Kong Sverres borg) was a fort and residence built in the medieval city of Nidaros (later Trondheim) by King Sverre Sigurdsson. The fortification was built in support of Sverre Sigurdsson's struggle against his rival King Magnus Erlingsson to claim the throne of Norway. The site now forms part of the Sverresborg Tr√∏ndelag Folk Museum, an open-air museum for the region of Tr√∏ndelag. Location Defense of the city of Trondheim and the location of Sverresborg was based on three key topographical features: #The city is located on a peninsula bordered on the east and south by the river Nidelva and on the north by the Trondheimsfjord #The neck connecting the peninsula to the mainland was quite narrow and could be easily fortified #A glacially-carved- rock hill just to the south dominates the city and provides an easily fortified site (location of Sverresborg) Heklungs War In 1177, Sverre Sigurdsson, who would later rule as king of Norway from 1184-1202, led the rebel Birkebeiner (Birkebeinerne) forces to Tr√∏ndelag where Sverre was hailed as king at √òretinget, the Thing (assembly) for Tr√∏ndelag. This was an important symbolic event as new Norwegian kings traditionally had been elected there. After this, the Birkebeins moved south and wintered in √òsterdalen. The next spring, the Birkebeins returned to Tr√∏ndelag, attacking the city of Nidaros (now Trondheim). Defeated, they fled south until they met and beat the army of reigning King Magnus Erlingsson in Ringerike. Encouraged, the Birkebeins again moved north to Tr√∏ndelag and remained in Nidaros during the winter of 1178. During the spring of 1179, Magnus arrived with his army. The two armies met on June 19 in the Battle of Kalvskinnet (Slaget p√• Kalvskinnet) with the result being a clear victory for Sverre, securing his grip on Tr√∏ndelag. Magnus Erlingsson again attacked Tr√∏ndelag in the spring of 1180. Sverre held Tr√∏ndelag from Nidaros, which was then protected by a wooden palisades extending from the river to the fjord across the neck of the peninsula connecting the town to the mainland. In the Battle of Ilevollene (Slaget p√• Ilevollene), just outside Nidaros, the Heklungs were again defeated. The two forces met again in 1181 in the Battle of Nordnes (Slaget i Bergen 1181) which resulted in a minor victory for Sverre. But Magnus exploited Sverre‚Äôs absence from Tr√∏ndelag when in November he raided and burned the Birkebeiner fleet located there. Sverre was forced to return or risk losing his one secure foothold. During the summer of 1182, Magnus made an attempt to take Nidaros by siege, but was repulsed with grave losses when the Birkebeins launched a surprise night attack. Castle construction In the winter of 1182/1183 Sverre initiated construction of Sverresborg (one of the earliest Norwegian fortresses) to provide him a more secure and more easily defended base from which reside and operate from. The location selected was easily fortified, hard to approach, and could be defended by a small force. The stone for the fortification was available only 0.6 km away in the quarry which had been used for construction the cathedral at Nidaros. Since the Archbishop of Nidaros, who had aligned with King Magnus, was in exile in England from 1180 to 1183, the stonemasons were also available. Work proceeded quickly, and Sverre, along with a detachment of his men, moved out to the castle during Lent in 1183. The sea Battle of Fimreite in 1184 proved to be final struggle between the Birkebeins and the Heklunger; King Magnus drowned. King Sverre, after a six years of struggle, became the uncontested king of Norway. But the peace was not to last for long. Bagler war In 1188 the town of Nidaros, which had been vacated by King Sverre‚Äôs men, was attacked. His opposition stormed into the city and a bloodbath followed. The wooden fortress was torn down and the castle burnt and left in ruins. It is not known precisely when it was restored, but the Sverris saga indicates the castle had been restored by 1197. King Sverre died in Bergen on 8 March 1202. Sverresborg is last mentioned in the time of King Sverre‚Äôs paternal grandson, King Haakon Haakonson in 1263, when he allowed the walls of Sverresborg to be broken down. The main 'town square' in Sverresborg Tr√∏ndelag Folk Museum today Sverresborg Tr√∏ndelag Folk Museum In 1914 the area surrounding the ruins of King Sverre's medieval castle was appropriated for the site of the new open-air museum. Today the castle ruins are adjoining the Sverresborg Tr√∏ndelag Folk Museum. The museum had started in 1909, when a group of enthusiasts decided to gather buildings and objects characteristic of the area for purposes of preservation. The area around the fortress ruins was set aside for purposes of building a museum and the collection has grown steadily since then.

Life  Kress came to Vienna in 1873, where he developed the first modern delta-flying hang glider in 1877. This hang-glider was a major achievement for the time, when many engineers still struggled with the development of \\"heavier-than-air\\" non-powered aircraft. He also displayed rubber band powered flying models called the 'Aeroveloce' in 1877 and 1880. During the turn of the century he was one of the world-wide contestants for the creation of a break-through powered airplane. In 1900 he developed the control stick for aircraft, but did not apply for a patent (instead, a patent was awarded to the French aviator, Robert Esnault-Pelterie who applied for it in 1907). Kress' aircraft, the Drachenflieger, was constructed for water takeoff and achieved some brief hops in 1901 at the Wienerwaldsee near Vienna. A longer controlled flight was not possible because the engine (made by Daimler) was twice as heavy as Kress had specified in his order, and could be operated only at half of its nominal power output. During one of his attempts at flight taking off from water, his plane was destroyed when it became entangled on debris floating in the lake.Connections, Episode 6 Part 5 of 5 (1976).

Early life Hergesheimer was born on February 15, 1880 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was educated in a Quaker school, and he graduated from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Career Hergesheimer published his first novel, The Lay Anthony, in 1914. Three Black Pennys, which followed in 1917, chronicled the fictional lives of three generations of Pennsylvania ironmasters and cemented the author's style of dealing with upperclass characters through a floridly descriptive style he referred to as \\"aestheticism.\\" Three Black Pennys was also the first original American novel published by the newly formed Alfred A. Knopf publishing house. Hergesheimer also received critical recognition for his novels Java Head (1919), Linda Condon (1919), and Balisand (1924). Hergesheimer's reputation fluctuated wildly in his own lifetime, from a peak of acclaim and popularity in the 1920s to almost total obscurity by the time of his death. Java Head, a miscegenation story told from multiple viewpoints that is generally considered his best novel, was a considerable popular success, and his flamboyant, ornate, highly descriptive style (which can be seen to best effect in works like the travelogue San Cristobal de la Habana) was considered elegant and powerful. Hergesheimer's manner of writing, known at the time as the \\"aesthetic\\" school (in which he was frequently paired with James Branch Cabell), remained in demand throughout the 1920s (with F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby being the most durable example of a book written in this style). Sinclair Lewis's novel Babbitt includes an extensive passage in which the title character reads from Three Black Pennys. A 1922 poll of critics in Literary Digest voted Hergesheimer the \\"most important American writer\\" working at the time. Hergesheimer's works of long-form and short fiction sold well with both male and female readerships; a 1929 teaser in for an upcoming serialized story in Cosmopolitan, for example, called Hergesheimer a writer \\"who understands women better than any writer alive today.\\" On the other hand, John Drinkwater wrote that \\"His constant complaint is that women readers, with their craving for sentimentality, are a blighting influence upon the American fiction of the age.\\"John Drinkwater, 1931, The Outline of Literature, p. 834. (New York: G.P. Putnam's Son) Tastes changed decisively in the 1930s, however, with both critics and writers favoring a more terse, tough-guy style. Hergesheimer's gift for flowery writing did not translate well in this new environment, and by the middle of the decade his popularity had fizzled. His last novel The Foolscap Rose, appeared in 1934. H.L. Mencken's diary describes Hergesheimer's frustration at the decline of his popularity and the lack of interest by his publishers, and according to one literary legend, when Hergesheimer asked why nobody was interested in his books anymore, Mencken replied, \\"I don't know, Joe. I'll always enjoy watching you swing from tree to tree.\\" Hergesheimer's reputation has not recovered from this low point, although he still has some champions. The weakness in his method can be seen in books like Cytherea, wherein the author's aesthetic concerns overwhelm all other aspects of the writing, resulting in thin plot and characterization and a certain precious quality in the descriptions. Indeed, Clifton Fadiman considered his novels to be \\"deficient in mere brain-power.\\" On the other hand, his descriptive writing occasionally holds great power. When asked in 1962 what was his favorite American novel, Samuel Beckett replied \\"one of the best I ever read was Hergesheimer's Java Head.\\" His short story \\"Tol'able David\\" was made into a highly successful and acclaimed 1921 silent film. Other notable film adaptations include Java Head (US, 1923), The Bright Shawl (US, 1923), Wild Oranges (1924), and Cytherea (1924), and Java Head (UK, 1934).

E. J. Brouwer and Arend Heyting, and independently by Andrey Kolmogorov. It is also sometimes called the realizability interpretation, because of the connection with the realizability theory of Stephen Kleene.  The interpretation  The interpretation states what is intended to be a proof of a given formula. This is specified by induction on the structure of that formula: *A proof of P \\\\wedge Q is a pair where a is a proof of P and b is a proof of Q. *A proof of P \\\\vee Q is a pair where a is 0 and b is a proof of P, or a is 1 and b is a proof of Q. *A proof of P \\\\to Q is a function f that converts a proof of P into a proof of Q. *A proof of \\\\exists x \\\\in S : \\\\varphi(x) is a pair where a is an element of S, and b is a proof of \\\\varphi(a). *A proof of \\\\forall x \\\\in S : \\\\varphi(x) is a function f that converts an element a of S into a proof of \\\\varphi(a). *The formula eg P is defined as P \\\\to \\\\bot, so a proof of it is a function f that converts a proof of P into a proof of \\\\bot. *There is no proof of \\\\bot (the absurdity, or bottom type (nontermination in some programming languages)). The interpretation of a primitive proposition is supposed to be known from context. In the context of arithmetic, a proof of the formula s=t is a computation reducing the two terms to the same numeral. Kolmogorov followed the same lines but phrased his interpretation in terms of problems and solutions. To assert a formula is to claim to know a solution to the problem represented by that formula. For instance P \\\\to Q is the problem of reducing Q to P; to solve it requires a method to solve problem Q given a solution to problem P.  Examples  The identity function is a proof of the formula P \\\\to P, no matter what P is. The law of non-contradiction eg (P \\\\wedge eg P) expands to (P \\\\wedge (P \\\\to \\\\bot)) \\\\to \\\\bot: * A proof of (P \\\\wedge (P \\\\to \\\\bot)) \\\\to \\\\bot is a function f that converts a proof of (P \\\\wedge (P \\\\to \\\\bot)) into a proof of \\\\bot. * A proof of (P \\\\wedge (P \\\\to \\\\bot)) is a pair of proofs , where a is a proof of P, and b is a proof of P \\\\to \\\\bot. * A proof of P \\\\to \\\\bot is a function that converts a proof of P into a proof of \\\\bot. Putting it all together, a proof of (P \\\\wedge (P \\\\to \\\\bot)) \\\\to \\\\bot is a function f that converts a pair ‚Äì where a is a proof of P, and b is a function that converts a proof of P into a proof of \\\\bot ‚Äì into a proof of \\\\bot. There is a function f that does this, where f(\\\\langle a, b \\\\rangle) = b(a), proving the law of non-contradiction, no matter what P is. Indeed, the same line of thought provides a proof for (P \\\\wedge (P \\\\to Q)) \\\\to Q as well, where Q is any proposition. On the other hand, the law of excluded middle P \\\\vee ( eg P) expands to P \\\\vee (P \\\\to \\\\bot), and in general has no proof. According to the interpretation, a proof of P \\\\vee ( eg P) is a pair where a is 0 and b is a proof of P, or a is 1 and b is a proof of P \\\\to \\\\bot. Thus if neither P nor P \\\\to \\\\bot is provable then neither is P \\\\vee ( eg P).  What is absurdity?  It is not, in general, possible for a logical system to have a formal negation operator such that there is a proof of \\"not\\" P exactly when there isn't a proof of P ; see G√∂del's incompleteness theorems. The BHK interpretation instead takes \\"not\\" P to mean that P leads to absurdity, designated \\\\bot, so that a proof of ¬¨P is a function converting a proof of P into a proof of absurdity. A standard example of absurdity is found in dealing with arithmetic. Assume that 0 = 1, and proceed by mathematical induction: 0 = 0 by the axiom of equality. Now (induction hypothesis), if 0 were equal to a certain natural number n, then 1 would be equal to n+1, (Peano axiom: Sm = Sn if and only if m = n), but since 0=1, therefore 0 would also be equal to n + 1\\\\. By induction, 0 is equal to all numbers, and therefore any two natural numbers become equal. Therefore, there is a way to go from a proof of 0 = 1 to a proof of any basic arithmetic equality, and thus to a proof of any complex arithmetic proposition. Furthermore, to get this result it was not necessary to invoke the Peano axiom that states that 0 is \\"not\\" the successor of any natural number. This makes 0=1 suitable as \\\\bot in Heyting arithmetic (and the Peano axiom is rewritten 0 = Sn -> 0 = S0). This use of 0 = 1 validates the principle of explosion.  What is a function?  The BHK interpretation will depend on the view taken about what constitutes a function that converts one proof to another, or that converts an element of a domain to a proof. Different versions of constructivism will diverge on this point. Kleene's realizability theory identifies the functions with the computable functions. It deals with Heyting arithmetic, where the domain of quantification is the natural numbers and the primitive propositions are of the form x=y. A proof of x=y is simply the trivial algorithm if x evaluates to the same number that y does (which is always decidable for natural numbers), otherwise there is no proof. These are then built up by induction into more complex algorithms. If one takes lambda calculus as defining the notion of a function, then the BHK interpretation describes the correspondence between natural deduction and functions.

The screenplay by Frank Fenton is based on a story by Louis Lantz, who borrowed his premise from the 1948 Italian film Bicycle Thieves.Hirsch, Foster, Otto Preminger: The Man Who Would Be King. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 2007. , p. 202 It was made in Technicolor and CinemaScope and released by 20th Century Fox. Plot Set in the Northwestern United States in 1875, the film focuses on taciturn widower Matt Calder (Robert Mitchum), who has recently been released from prison after serving time for killing one man while defending another. He arrives in a boomtown tent city in search of his nine-year-old son Mark (Tommy Rettig), who was left in the care of dance hall singer Kay (Marilyn Monroe) after the man who brought him there, as Matt had arranged, abandoned him. Matt promises Mark, a virtual stranger to him, the two will enjoy a life of hunting, fishing and farming on their homestead. Robert Mitchum with Tommy Rettig in a scene from the film Kay's fiance, gambler Harry Weston (Rory Calhoun), tells her they must go to Council City to file the deed on a gold mine he won in a poker game. They head downriver on a log raft, and when they encounter trouble in the rapids near the Calder farm, Matt and Mark rescue them. Harry offers to buy Matt's rifle and horse so as to reach Council City by land. When Matt refuses, Harry knocks Matt unconscious and steals both horse and rifle. Kay chooses to stay behind to take care of Matt and Mark, and the three are stranded in the wilderness. When hostile Indians attack the farm, the three are forced to escape down the river on Harry's raft. That night they set up camp by the river, and Matt and Kay argue about the wisdom of pursuing Harry. Matt asks why Kay would choose to marry a man who had endangered a child, whereupon she reminds him that Harry never killed a man like Matt did. Mark overhears their discussion, and Matt is forced to reveal the truth about his past to his son, who is unable to comprehend why his father acted as he did. As the three continue their journey, Kay comes to appreciate Matt's bravery and the tender way he cares for both her and Mark. Along the way, they are forced to deal with a series of trials and tribulations, including a mountain lion attack; gold prospectors Sam Benson and Dave Colby, who are after Harry for stealing their claim; and a second Indian war party. After a difficult ride through the worst of the rapids, the three arrive in Council City and confront Harry. Harry shoots at Matt, prompting Mark to shoot Harry in the back, using a rifle that he was inspecting in the general store. As a result, Mark comes to understand why his father had to shoot a man in a similar fashion so many years before. Afterwards, Kay finds a job at the local saloon. While she is singing there, Matt walks into the saloon and throws Kay over his shoulder to take her back to his farm along with Mark. She happily leaves with him. The final scene is Kay throwing her high heeled showgirl shoes from their buckboard into the street, a renunciation of her old life. Cast *Robert Mitchum as Matt Calder *Marilyn Monroe as Kay Weston *Tommy Rettig as Mark Calder *Rory Calhoun as Harry Weston *Douglas Spencer as Sam Benson *Murvyn Vye as Dave Colby Production =Pre-production= Otto Preminger was preparing for the opening of The Moon Is Blue when 20th Century Fox executive Darryl F. Zanuck assigned him to direct River of No Return as part of his contract with the studio. Because of their previous experience with Westerns, producer Stanley Rubin had wanted William Wellman, Raoul Walsh, or Henry King to helm the film, and he was concerned Preminger, who he felt was better suited for film noir melodrama or sophisticated comedy, would be unable to rise to the task of directing a piece of Americana. Preminger himself had no interest in the project until he read the screenplay and saw potential in the story. He also approved of Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe, who already had been cast in the lead roles.Hirsch, p. 202-203 Zanuck decided the film should be made in CinemaScope and increased the budget accordingly. Much of it would be filmed in Banff, Jasper National Parks, Lake Louise in Alberta and the Salmon River in Idaho where the story actually takes place. Preminger and Rubin flew to the area to scout locations. During their time there, Rubin grew fond of the director and began to feel that rather than viewing it as a contractual obligation, Preminger had a real interest in making the film.Hirsch, p. 203 Rubin scheduled twelve weeks of preproduction, during which Monroe rehearsed and recorded the musical numbers written by Ken Darby and Lionel Newman, and forty-five days for filming. =Filming= The cast and crew departed for Calgary in late June 1953. From there they traveled by special train to the Banff Springs Hotel, which would serve as their base during the Canadian filming.Hirsch, p. 204 Monroe was accompanied by Natasha Lytess, her acting coach. Preminger clashed with the woman from the very start. She insisted on taking her client aside and giving her direction contrary to that of Preminger, and she had the actress enunciating each syllable of every word of dialogue with exaggerated emphasis.Brennan, Brian, Romancing the Rockies: Mountaineers, Missionaries, Marilyn, and More. Calgary: Fifth House 2005. , pp. 177 Preminger called Rubin in Los Angeles and insisted Lytess be banned from the set, but when the producer complied with his demand, Monroe called Zanuck directly and asserted she couldn't continue unless Lytess returned. Zanuck commiserated with Preminger but, feeling Monroe was a major box office draw he couldn't afford to upset, he reinstated Lytess. Angered by the decision, Preminger directed his rage at Monroe for the rest of the production.Hirsch, p. 205Preminger, Otto, Preminger: An Autobiography. New York: Doubleday 1977. , pp. 127-128 During the difficult shoot, Preminger also had to contend with frequent rain, Mitchum's heavy drinking, and an injury to Monroe's ankle that kept her off the set for several days and ultimately put her in a cast.Brennan,p. 178-179 Monroe nearly drowned while filming. She had donned chest-high hip waders during rehearsal to protect her costume. She slipped on a rock, the waders filled with water, and she was unable to rise. Mitchum and others jumped in the river to rescue her but her ankle was sprained as a result.The Argus Aug 15, 1953 p. 4 Young Tommy Rettig seemed to be the director's sole source of solace. He respected Rettig's professionalism and appreciated the rapport he developed with Monroe, which often helped keep her on an even keel. When Lytess began to interfere with Rettig's performance, thereby undermining his confidence, Preminger let the cast and crew know about her behavior and was delighted to find they finally began to support him in his efforts to remove her from the set.Hirsch, p. 205Preminger, p. 129 In early September, filming shifted to Los Angeles for interior scenes and close- ups for a river sequence. The latter was filmed in a tank, whereas stunt doubles were used in the long shots filmed on location in Idaho in the actual River of No Return, the Salmon River. Monroe was on crutches, and Preminger had to work around her as much as possible. Despite frequent disagreements with Rubin, Preminger completed the film on September 29, on schedule and within the budget.Hirsch, pp. 205-207 The film was one of the first films to use a blood squib to simulate realistic bullet impact. This occurs when Harry (Rory Calhoun) is shot dead in the film's climax. As such, the film beats Run of the Arrow (1957) - which is often credited with being the first to use blood squibs - by three years. This movie was the first to be filmed in CinemaScope in Canada. River of No Return was the first film released by 20th Century-Fox to feature the \\"CinemaScope extension\\" fanfare before the opening credits. Written by Alfred Newman, it's a rerecording of his original 1933 fanfare, with the extra few bars that play under the credit \\"20th Century-Fox presents A CinemaScope Production\\". After Fox switched to Panavision in 1967, they went back to their old fanfare, so the extension fanfare wasn't used again until it was revived by George Lucas to play before the opening credits to Star Wars. This time, those few extra bars played under the credit \\" A Lucasfilm Production\\". Since then it's been re-recorded a few times but remains to this day the intro to every film released by that studio. =Post- production= During post-production, Preminger departed for Europe, leaving editor Louis R. Loeffler and Rubin to complete the film. Jean Negulesco was called in to film a few retakes. The dailies reconfirmed Rubin's belief that Preminger had been the wrong choice for the project. He felt the director had failed to capture the Western aura, had ignored key elements in the plot, and had perfunctorily directed action sequences, leaving them looking staged and static. In several cases, studio and location shots didn't match.Hirsch, pp. 205-207 Preminger's experience on the film convinced him he never wanted to work as a studio employee again, and he paid Fox $150,000 to cancel the remainder of his contract.Hirsch, p. 207Preminger, p. 132 In later years, Monroe claimed River of No Return was her worst film, and Preminger spoke bitterly about her in numerous interviews. It wasn't until January 1980, when being interviewed for the New York Daily News, that he conceded, \\"She tried very hard, and when people try hard, you can't be mad at them.\\"Hirsch, pp. 208-209 Release The River of No Return had its world premiere in Denver, Colorado on April 29, 1954; and released theatrically in the United States in New York on April 30, 1954 and in Los Angeles on May 5.RIVER OF NO RETURN (1954) 90-91 mins  Adventure  May 1954.

The mountainous scenery is spectacular, but so, in her own way, is Miss Monroe. The patron's preference, if any, probably will depend upon which he's interested in. Certainly, scriptwriter Frank Fenton has done the best he could to arrange for a fairly equal balance of nature and Miss Monroe ... And that should not be too lightly taken. For Director Otto Preminger has thrown all the grandeur and menace of these features upon the eye-filling CinemaScope screen. A sickening succession of rapids, churned into boiling foam, presents a display of nature's violence that cannot help but ping the patron's nerves. The raft tumbling through these rapids is quite a sight to see. And layouts of Rocky Mountain landscapes are handsome in color, too. But Mr. Mitchum's and the audience's attention is directed to Miss Monroe through frequent and liberal posing of her in full and significant views.\\"New York Times review Variety said, \\"The competition between scenic splendors of the Jasper and Banff National Parks and entertainment values finds the former finishing slightly ahead on merit, although there's enough rugged action and suspense moments to get the production through its footage. In between the high spots, Otto Preminger's directorial pacing is inclined to lag, so the running time seems overlong.\\"Variety review TV Guide rated it out of four stars, calling it \\"a simple, frequently charming, and beautifully photographed film blessed with fine performances and great teamwork from Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe\\" and \\"an enjoyable, engaging little Western that never fails to entertain.\\"TV Guide review Film4 called it a \\"patchy drama which owes more to its gorgeous scenery and musical numbers than it does to anything else ... The plot doesn't convince, but Monroe, at the peak of her career, is more than easy on the eye ... Despite some pretty locations and occasional tension, there's little going on. A shallow river indeed.\\"Film4 review References External links  * Category:1954 films Category:1950s Western (genre) adventure films Category:American Western (genre) adventure films Category:American films Category:Films set in the 1870s Category:Films directed by Otto Preminger Category:Films scored by Cyril J.

Life Early became one of the first licensed female jockeys in the United States in 1968. In protest, male jockeys unanimously refused to ride in the first few races in which she was slated to compete at the Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky to prevent her from competing. In the midst of this controversy the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association signed Early to a contract to play basketball for the team. Early had not played basketball at any level. At just 5'3\\" and 112 pounds, she was also the smallest pro basketball player ever. Management, including Colonels owners Joseph and Mamie Gregory, ordered coach Gene Rhodes to play Early in a game. Rhodes was not amused and protested to management. Penny's moment came on Wednesday, November 27, 1968, against the Los Angeles Stars. Wearing a miniskirt and a turtleneck sweater with a number 3 on the back (to represent the three boycotted races at Churchill Downs), Early warmed up with the players and sat on the bench with the team. Early in the game, during a timeout, Rhodes reluctantly sent Early to the scorer's table, where she checked into the game. In the Kentucky backcourt she took the ball out of bounds and inbounded it to teammate Bobby Rascoe. He quickly called a timeout and the Colonels removed Early from the game to a standing ovation. Afterward, she signed hundreds of autographs. Later life Penny Ann was often accused of trying to gain publicity more so than mounts. She was so frustrated with maintaining her weight and getting enough mounts that she quit to become a trainer. In 1974, at the age of 30, she went on a strict diet and worked diligently to get her weight down; however, her comeback was short-lived when she broke her arm, ankle, wrist, and some ribs in a racing spill. Today Early, a divorcee and mother, continues to work with horses.

It is the home ballpark of Minor League Baseball's Kane County Cougars. History Elfstrom Stadium Northwestern Medicine Field was originally named after Philip B. Elfstrom, the former Kane County Forest Preserve President, and the person most responsible for bringing minor league baseball to Kane County. The stadium serves as the home of the Kane County Cougars, an Arizona Diamondbacks affiliated Class A minor league baseball team. The stadium was constructed in 1991, and in 2001 the Cougars set a league attendance record of 523,222. On May 3, 2012 or \\"5/3 day\\", the stadium was officially renamed Fifth Third Bank Ballpark. On June 18, 2012, it was the home for the 2012 Midwest League All-Star Game. It was the fourth All-Star held in the stadium; the first was in 2000. The ballpark was renamed Northwestern Medicine Field on November 15, 2016, in a five-year naming rights deal with Northwestern Medicine. Renovations In 2008, the stadium underwent a $10.5 million renovation project that added a second level seating area, covered concourse, and skybox suites among other amenities. It finished in time for the start of the 2009 baseball season. In 2014, the Cougars announced that additional capital improvements would be made in time for the 2015 baseball season, including a climate-controlled cage that will also have a weight room and a video-room, allowing access for Cougars and field staff to develop and evaluate players. Also under construction is a high-definition videoboard, which will show promotions, highlights, and instant replays, as well as construction of a premium seating area on the lower-seating bowl area of the ballpark. A pavilion will also be erected to be used predominately for music during game-day, as well as events such as the Cougars' Ballpark Concert Series and non-game-day events, as well. These forthcoming renovations are said to further \\"modernize\\" Fifth Third Bank Ballpark and to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the stadium as well.

The ballpark has had over 2 million fans in attendance during the RailCats' team history. History In February 2001, the Northern League's Board of Directors approved a request by Northwest Sports Ventures, LLC to start an expansion baseball team in Gary, Indiana. The team was scheduled to start play in the 2002 Northern League season. Later that year, a limited liability company named Victory Sports Group took the task to build a ballpark in downtown Gary. In July 2001, the City of Gary and Victory agreed on a 15-year lease that would facilitate the building of a state-of-the-art ballpark with construction scheduled to be completed in May 2002; the groundbreaking ceremony was held at this time. In September 2001, the ownership named this baseball team the Gary SouthShore RailCats, with their stadium to be called RailCats Stadium. In October 2001, the City of Gary and the construction and architectural companies involved in the building of the new ballpark announced that it would not be completed in time for the 2002 Northern League season. As a result, all the RailCats' games in their inaugural 2002 season were played on the road. During the 2002 season, the RailCats traveled more than and spent more than 800 hours on the road in buses. RailCats Stadium was completed in August 2002, with a dedication ceremony and open house held on August 8. The first baseball games played in this stadium were part of a Little League Baseball tournament held the following week. The stadium also hosted various Gospel and Blues events throughout the next few months. In May 2003, the RailCats' ownership and U.S. Steel sign a 10-year naming rights agreement, effectively renaming the ballpark U.S. Steel Yard. On May 26, 2003, the RailCats played their inaugural home opener in the new ballpark before a sellout crowd of 7,089; the first pitch was thrown at 3:28 pm Eastern Standard Time. The RailCats lost to the visiting Schaumburg Flyers 8‚Äì4 in 11 innings. The next day, on May 27, the first home run was hit in U.S. Steel Yard by outfielder Billy Brown; the RailCats recorded their first win in the new ballpark, defeating the Flyers 5‚Äì4. After drawing 26,648 fans in August 2003, the RailCats would compile a 2003 regular season attendance of 140,310 over 44 home games ‚Äì an average of 3,189 fans per game. In the 2004 Northern League season, the RailCats brought in a regular season attendance of 147,801 over 46 home games with an average of 3,213 fans per game. On 12 separate occasions attendance was over 4,000 fans, which included two sellout crowds. The RailCats finished the 2004 season with a record of 31‚Äì65. In the 2005 Northern League season, U.S. Steel Yard hosted the league's annual all-star game on July 19, which U.S. Steel sponsored. The Northern League's North Division defeated the South Division 5‚Äì1 in front of a crowd of 6,825 ‚Äì the second largest attendance U.S. Steel Yard's history. The 2005 season also saw the RailCats' first playoff berth; they eventually lost in the Northern League Championship Series to the Fargo- Moorhead RedHawks. In the 2009 Northern League baseball season, the RailCats drew 185,747 fans to U.S. Steel Yard ‚Äì an increase of 6,748 fans from the 2008 Northern League baseball season. In September 2009, the one millionth fan walked into the U.S. Steel Yard. 250px =Michael Jackson's memorial service= On July 10, 2009, a memorial service was held at U.S. Steel Yard for deceased pop musician and Gary native Michael Jackson. Over 6,000 fans attended the service, which also served as a musical tribute to the pop star, as local musicians played a few of Jackson's songs. At the service, Gary mayor Rudy Clay unveiled a granite plaque of Jackson.Michael Jackson: thousands pay tribute at birthplace memorial, The Telegraphy, retrieved on 11/07/2009 Originally, Clay talked to the Jackson family about having Michael's body on display in Gary for the service, saying that the service would be \\"fit for the prince of peace and a memorial that's fit for Gary, Indiana's favorite son, the greatest entertainer that ever lived\\". This was discussed as part of a plan to have Jackson buried in Gary. About 20 of Jackson's cousins attended the service, along with Michael's father Joe Jackson ‚Äì who showed up two hours into the service ‚Äì and Rev. Jesse Jackson. =2012 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament Regional= The Purdue Boilermakers chose U.S. Steel Yard to host their regional bracket of the 2012 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament. Besides Purdue, the Kentucky Wildcats, the Kent State Golden Flashes and the played in the Gary Regional on June 1‚Äì4, 2012, with Kent State winning to advance to the Eugene Super Regional.

The Beloit Memorial High School and Beloit American Legion baseball teams both play their home games there as well. History The ballpark's construction began in 1981 and was completed in April 1982. Its name was originally Telfer Park until the 1987 season, when it was named after Harry C. Pohlman, who was a long-time coach in the Beloit school system and in American Legion Baseball. He was also an original member of the Beloit Brewers board of directors.

New stadium In response to being placed on a preliminary list of one of 40 MiLB teams to be shut down as part of the 2021 MiLB contraction, the Beloit Snappers are currently in the process of building the new ABC Supply Stadium. The new stadium will be a professional baseball stadium rather than the high school effect that Pohlman Field currently gives which the Snappers hope will convince the MiLB to keep the team alive. Currently, it has not been confirmed whether or not the Beloit Memorial High School and Beloit American Legion will move into the new stadium but it is assumed that they will not.

He was Professor Emeritus of Molecular and Cell Biology at University of California at Berkeley. Gofman pioneered the field of clinical lipidology, and was honoured with the title of \\"Father of Clinical Lipidology\\" by the Journal of Clinical Lipidology in 2007. With Frank T. Lindgren and other research associates, Gofman discovered and described three major classes of plasma lipoproteins, fat molecules that carry cholesterol in the blood. The team he led at the Donner Laboratory went on to demonstrate the role of lipoproteins in the causation of heart disease. Gofman was instrumental in inducing the health physics scientific community both to acknowledge the cancer risks of ionizing radiation and to adopt the Linear No- Threshold (LNT) model as a means of estimating actual cancer risks from low- level radiation and as the foundation of the international guidelines for radiation protection. However his conclusions were that the dose-response relationship was not linear, but supra-linear Preventing Breast Cancer Second Edition: 1996. Gofman's earliest research was in nuclear physics and chemistry, in close connection to the Manhattan Project. He co-discovered several radioisotopes, notably uranium-233 and its fissionability ; he was the third person ever to work with plutonium, and, having devised an early process for separating plutonium from fission products at J. Robert Oppenheimer's request, he was the first chemist ever to try and isolate milligram quantities of plutonium. In 1963, Gofman established the Biomedical Research Division for the Livermore National Laboratory, where he was on the cutting edge of research into the connection between chromosomal abnormalities and cancer. Later in life, Gofman took on a role as an advocate warning of dangers involved with nuclear power. From 1971 onward, he was the Chairman of the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility. He was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \\"his pioneering work in exposing the health effects of low-level radiation\\" on Chernobyl disaster's area population.Mission Statement of the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility In his 1996 book Preventing Breast Cancer Second Edition: 1996, Gofman claimed that exposure to medical x-rays is responsible for about 75 percent of breast cancers in the United States. This order of magnitude has been somehow confirmed by the increase in breast cancer incidence following mammography screening in the USA and in France. Nuclear research John Gofman graduated from Oberlin College with a bachelor's in chemistry in 1939, and received a doctorate in nuclear and physical chemistry from Berkeley in 1943, where he worked as a graduate student under Glenn T. Seaborg, the discoverer of plutonium and later a chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission. In his PhD dissertation, Gofman described the discovery of radioisotopes protactinium-232, uranium-232, protactinium-233, as well as uranium-233 and the characterization of its fissionability. Seaborg had a very high opinion of Gofman : he called Gofman one of his \\"most brilliant students\\" when, in 1963, he appointed him to head the Biomedical Research Division at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory;J. Samuel Walker, Permissible Dose, p 38-39, 2000, University of California Press, he wrote that his PhD dissertation was \\"very brilliant\\".Glenn Seaborg and Benjamin Loeb, The Atomic Energy Commission under Nixon: Adjusting to Troubled Times, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993, p.123, cited in : Ioanna Semendeferi, \\"Exploiting Uncertainty in Radiation Limits: Monticello Dissenters, Health Physicists, and the Civilian Nuclear- Power Debate\\", University of Minnesota, 2003, p.84. Gofman shared three patents with collaborators on their discoveries : * n¬∞ 3,123,535 (Glenn T. Seaborg, John W. Gofman, Raymond W. Stoughton): The slow and fast neutron fissionability of uranium-233, with its application to production of nuclear power or nuclear weapons. * n¬∞ 2,671,251 (John W. Gofman, Robert E.

Gofman, George C. Pimentel): The columbium oxide process for the separation of plutonium in irradiated fuel from uranium and fission products. Gofman later became the group co-leader of the Plutonium Project, an offshoot of the Manhattan Project. Medical research Dr. Gofman earned his medical degree from the University of California, San Francisco, in 1946. After that, he and his collaborators investigated the body's lipoproteins, which contain both proteins and fats, and their circulation within the bloodstream. The researchers described low-density and high-density lipoproteins and their roles in metabolic disorders and coronary disease. This work continued throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. At Livermore : taking on the US Atomic Energy Commission =Establishment of LLNL's Medical Department= At the request of Ernest Lawrence, Gofman established the Medical Department at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in early 1954 and acted as the Medical Director until 1957 roughly two days a week while teaching at Berkeley the rest of the time. =Establishment of LLNL's Biomedical Research Division= AEC's response to public outcry In 1962, the US had resumed atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons at the Nevada test site in 1962. The State of Utah had set up its own network of monitoring facilities to test milk for radioiodine, since \\"data pertaining to the safety of the citizens of Utah was not forthcoming from the AEC\\",Scott Kirsch, \\"Harold Knapp and the Geography of Normal Controversy: Radioiodine in the Historical Environment\\", Osiris, 2nd Series, Vol. 19, Landscapes of Exposure: Knowledge and Illness in Modern Environments (2004), pp. 167-181 and the levels of radioactivity were found to be close to the limits prescribed by the Federal Radiation Council. The Commissioners of the AEC were \\"on the hot seat\\" and announced \\"a comprehensive, long-range program\\" to explore the effects of man-made radioactivity \\"upon plants, animals and human beings\\".John Gofman and Arthur Tamplin, \\"Population control through nuclear pollution\\", 1970, Nelson Hall co., p.54-56 At the request of the US Atomic Energy Commission and of LLNL's director John Foster, Gofman reluctantly accepted to establish the Biomedical Research Division for the LLNL in 1963. He served as the first director of the LLNL biomedical research division from 1963 to 1965 and as one of the nine associate directors of the entire lab until 1969. Immediate moves to hinder the Biomedical Research program The AEC had acted too fast in response to public outcry : one of the five Commissioners, James T. Ramey, had not been consulted before announcing the establishment of the Biomedical Research Division. Gofman reported that \\"Apparently it would have been too embarrassing, with the extensive AEC publicity about the program, to cancel it outright. Instead, the budget was cut even from the low starting value and we were given to understand, in no uncertain terms, that the program was not going to be supported at the level required to do the tasks outlined originally.\\" However, Gofman and colleagues \\"accepted the reduced program, knowing that [they] could certainly still do much of the important work on radiation hazards.\\" After the atmospheric test ban treaty was signed in June 1963 and the public pressure on AEC was released, \\"[t]he Joint Committee on Atomic Energy struck from the AEC budget the funds that were to be used to construct a Bio-Medical complex at Livermore. This was tantamount to the JCAE stating that the Livermore Bio-Medical Program was unnecessary, for without facilities to work in it was hard to envision much of a program being possible.\\" LLNL's director John Foster and Gofman had to struggle to obtain the initially promised funds. John Gofman and Arthur Tamplin, \\"Population control through nuclear pollution\\", 1970, Nelson Hall co., p.65-68 =The Knapp report on radioiodine from fallout in milk= In 1959, the geneticist Edward B. Lewis computed that children exposed to fallout from nuclear tests may have received very high doses of radioactivity from iodine-131 in cow milk. His estimates prompted the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy to request that the AEC produce a report on the risks of short-lived isotopes.Emory J. Jessee, PhD thesis, \\"Radiation Ecologies: Bombs, Bodies, and Environment during the Atmospheric Nuclear Weapons Testing Period, 1942-1965\\", p258-265, January 2013, Montana State University. In 1960, Harold A. Knapp, a mathematician working within the AEC Division of Biology and Medicine's Fallout Studies Branch, authored this report,Harold A. Knapp, June 6, 1960, \\"The Contribution of Short Lived Isotopes and Hot Spots to Radiation Exposure in the United States from Nuclear Test Fallout\\", NTA, NV00019168. but since it was finished during an international moratorium on atmospheric nuclear tests, it had no notable impact. Then, in 1962, while the USSR and the USA had resumed nuclear tests and the Limited Test Ban Treaty was being prepared in response to huge international pressure, Knapp took on the task of estimating the radioiodine exposure of Americans before 1958, at a time when milk was not monitored. Knapp conclusions were alarming, and blatantly departed from preceding AEC's reassurances that the public had never been exposed to harmful levels of radioactivity. He \\"showed that, from just one 1953 test, infants who had been living in a radiation hotspot around St. George, Utah, might well have received I-131 doses anywhere from 150 to 750 times existing annual permissible doses.\\" Scott Kirsch, \\"Harold Knapp and the Geography of Normal Controversy: Radioiodine in the Historical Environment\\", Osiris, 2nd Series, Vol. 19, Landscapes of Exposure: Knowledge and Illness in ModernEnvironments (2004), pp. 167-181. Beginning in fall 1962, the AEC resorted to diverse pretexts to block the publication of Knapp's findings. In spring 1963, Gofman, was solicited to participate in a so-called \\"Ad Hoc Working Group on Radioiodine and the Environment\\" assembled by AEC's Division of Operational Safety's director, Gordon Dunning. Gofman reported that \\"In essence, the message to [this] Committee [‚Ä¶] was ¬´ How can we stop this report - a report which will, in effect, make the AEC reports over the past 10 years look untrue? ¬ª\\".John Gofman and Arthur Tamplin, \\"Population control through nuclear pollution\\", 1970, Nelson Hall co., p.64-65 In spite of AEC's Headquarters' objections, the committee recommended publication of Knapp's report, which was finally published by the AEC in June 1963,Harold Knapp, \\"Iodine-131 in Fresh Milk and Human Thyroids Following a Single Deposition of Nuclear Test Fallout,\\" TLD-19266, Health and Safety, TID-4500, 24th ed. (Washington, D.C., 1 June 1963). followed by a summary in Nature.Harold Knapp, \\"Iodine- 131 in Fresh Milk and Human Thyroids follow- ing a Single Deposition of Nuclear Test Fall-Out, \\" Nature, 9 May 1964, 534-7, =Gofman and Tamplin= In 1964, Gofman raised questions about a lack of data on low-level radiation and also proposed a wide-ranging study of exposure in medicine and the workplace at a symposium for nuclear scientists and engineers. This helped start a national inquiry into the safety of atomic power. With his colleague Dr. Arthur R. Tamplin, Dr. Gofman then looked at health studies of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as other epidemiological studies, and conducted research on radiation's influences on human chromosomes. The two scientists suggested that federal safety guidelines for low-level exposures be reduced by 90 percent in 1969. The Atomic Energy Commission contested the findings, and \\"the furor made Dr. Gofman a reluctant figurehead of the anti- nuclear movement\\" according to The New York Times. In 1970, he testified in favor of a bill to ban commercial nuclear reactors in New York City and told the City Council that a reactor in an urban environment would be \\"equal in the opposite direction to all the medical advances put together in the last 25 years.\\" Gofman's major contribution to radiation-safety science Gofman and Tamplin were instrumental in inducing the health physics scientific community both to acknowledge the somatic (i.e. leukemia and cancer) risks of ionizing radiation, at a time when only the genetic risks were considered of significant concern, and to adopt the so-called Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model \\"as a means of numerically estimating actual cancer risks from low-level radiation\\", which \\"was a watershed event in radiation-safety science and politics\\".Ioanna Semendeferi, \\"Legitimating a Nuclear Critic: John Gofman, Radiation Safety, and Cancer Risks\\", Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences, Vol. 38, Number 2, p.300. The LNT model has since become the foundation of the international guidelines for radiation protection. Indeed, it was Gofman and Tamplin's argumented opposition to the Federal Radiation Council (FRC) radiation-safety guidelines who prompted the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on the recommendation made in December 1969 by Victor Bond, \\"a prominent health physicist and chairman of the NAS-NRC Subcommittee on Radiobiology of the Committee on Nuclear Science\\",Ioanna Semendeferi, \\"Legitimating a Nuclear Critic: John Gofman, Radiation Safety, and Cancer Risks\\", Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences, Vol. 38, Number 2, p.293. to gather its first BEIR (Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation) committee. According to an internal memo cited by Semendeferi, the BEIR I committee was to \\"thoroughly digest and carefully analyze various pertinent controversial models (Gofman and Tamplin)\\".Ioanna Semendeferi, \\"Legitimating a Nuclear Critic: John Gofman, Radiation Safety, and Cancer Risks\\", Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences, Vol. 38, Number 2, p.294. After two years of study, the BEIR I committee published its famous BEIR I report in November 1972. Although departing from Gofman and Tamplin's work on significant aspects, it nevertheless vindicated their arguments to a large extent. Semendeferi notes that \\"[t]he report's long bibliography cited almost all of Gofman and Tamplin's work. Echoing Gofman and Tamplin, the BEIR I Committee emphasized that the cancer effects of low-level radiation were of much greater concern than leukemia or genetic effects. The current radiation limit was \\"based on genetic considerations,\\" and the committee concluded that the FRC limit was therefore \\"unnecessarily high\\" and could safely be much lower.\\"Ioanna Semendeferi, \\"Legitimating a Nuclear Critic: John Gofman, Radiation Safety, and Cancer Risks\\", Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences, Vol. 38, Number 2, p.296. Semendeferi reports that, according to the radiobiologist and environmental health specialist Edward Radford, who was a member of the BEIR I committee and the chairman of the BEIR III committee, \\"Gofman deserved credit for raising the issue of the somatic ris's of low-level radiation as early as he did\\", but \\"never received the recognition he deserved for his contributions to radiation-safety science\\" because he was \\"stigmatized as an extreme antinuclear scientist\\". Opposition to nuclear power  Gofman retired as a teaching professor in 1973 and became a professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology. Gofman testified on the behalf of Samuel Lovejoy at Lovejoy's 1974 trial. Lovejoy was charged with malicious destruction of property for toppling a weather tower in Montague, Massachusetts, owned by Northeast Utilities. Lovejoy's actions were an act of protest against a proposed nuclear power plant, Montague Nuclear Power Plant, to be built on Montague Plains. Lovejoy was inspired by Gofman's book, Poisoned Power. Gofman used his low- level radiation health model to predict 333 excess cancer or leukemia deaths from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. Studies of the health effects of the Three Mile Island accident have so far (by 2013) not observed any excess mortality. A retrospective study of Pennsylvania Cancer Registry found an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in counties south of TMI and in high- risk age groups. The Talbott lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported finding only a few, small, mostly statistically non-significant, increased cancer risks within the TMI population. However, excess leukemia among males was observed. The ongoing TMI epidemiological research has been accompanied by a discussion of epidemiological methodology, such as problems in dose and illness classifications. Three months after the Chernobyl disaster, Gofman predicted that Chernobyl would cause \\"475,000 fatal cancers plus about an equal number of additional non-fatal cases, occurring over time both inside and outside the ex-Soviet Union\\". In contrast, even some 19 years later in September 2005, an official UN IAEA report claimed 4,000 deaths as the final estimated toll from Chernobyl. In their 2006 book Alexey V. Yablokov and other Russian and East European researchers estimated that Chernobyl caused a million deaths through 2004, nearly 170,000 of them in North America. The book's English translation Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment was published by the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009. The book cites \\"5,000 mainly Slavic-language scientific papers the IAEA overlooked\\", notwithstanding the fact that 13 of the authors of the Chernobyl Forum were from Ukraine, Russia or Belarus.https://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/WHO%20Report%20on%20Chernobyl%20Health%20Effects%20July%2006.pdfChernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment\\" M. I. Balonov criticized the methodology of the book. M. I. Balonov criticized the methodology of the book's estimation of Chernobyl's excess deaths and radiation-induced health effects and claimed the numbers were exaggerations which \\"could lead quite unnecessarily to a panic reaction\\". Rosalie Bertell has asserted the above estimates of Gofman (1986) and Yablokov (2006) are too conservative. After a speech Gofman gave on nuclear waste at a national conference of activists in the summer of 1990, Charles Butler approached him for help. Butler was a retired physicist living in the Mojave Desert town of Needles, California, and was looking for help to stop the proposed low-level nuclear waste facility at Ward Valley. Gofman referred him to the Abalone Alliance Clearinghouse in San Francisco. With less than two weeks before the closure of the Environmental Impact Statement, the Alliance was able to mount a letter writing campaign that helped delay the EIS for an additional 90 days. This initial delay gave activists the time to form Don't Waste California and build a grassroots campaign that eventually stopped Ward Valley from opening. Gofman also did work on the Diablo Canyon Power Plant. Support to nuclear deterrence Gofman considered that \\"nuclear deterrence is important\\", for he did not believe that comprehensive test bans were enforceable ; thus he favored underground atomic bomb tests while acknowledging that \\"They are harmful, a little will leak out. A small number of people will get hurt.\\" He claimed \\"I don't understand the disarmament movement\\". More precisely, he was of the opinion that if the US were to disarm unilaterally, \\"the Soviet leaders may well try to make [the US] a slave state. [‚Ä¶] There will surely never be a solution to human problems by any coercion or force. But there will also never be a solution through unarmed freedom as long as powerful bullies exist who will use force.\\"Pat Stone, John Gofman: Nuclear and Anti-Nuclear Scientist, Mother Earth News, March‚ÄìApril 1981 Birth and death Gofman was born in Cleveland, Ohio to Jewish parents, David and Sarah Gofman, who immigrated to the USA from czarist Russia in about 1905.

Little is known of his family apart from the fact that he was born in Lancaster as the son of a local tradesman and was the eldest of six children, his grandfather being a Catholic priest in Kirkby Lonsdale where his father was born. As a boy he showed a love of the arts and had been employed to draw heads and work devices until Dr. Campbell, a local Physician, having seen some of these works sent some sketches to his friend George Romney. The young Baynes was then sent to London to study under Romney at the expense of Dr. Campbell. In 1784, at the age of 18 he became a student at the Royal Academy. He wedded Mary Mann (1766-1845) in 1785 at Marylebone Church, London. Their son, Thomas Mann Baynes (1794-1854), was also a noted watercolour artist. The marriage was without the consent of Campbell his patron and this resulted in a loss of support for Baynes and the withdrawal of the opportunity for an Italian tour. Thrown on his own resources he obtained employment from the Polygraphic Society, a Woolwich based company formed for the reproduction of pictures. The company produced reproductions of celebrated works and having touched them up by hand, sold them at a fee. Baynes was to earn ¬£100 a year for this work. The failure of the company lead to his move to Chelsea, followed by moves to 38 Dean Street, Soho, 103 Wardour Street and finally 73 Castle Street near Oxford Street where he remained for 40 years until his death in 1837. A large proportion of his time was occupied in teaching drawing (in which he had a good practice) and working for architects such as Sir Jeffry Wyattville. Among his pupils were John Wood, who produced a portrait of Baynes, Sir Henry Sass who founded a school of art, \\"Sass's Academy\\", in Bloomsbury and J.D. Harding the landscape painter whose name is connected with the advancement of lithography. Baynes's teaching activities and his ever- expanding family (he has eight children) put pressure on his own landscape painting. He was, however, a constant exhibitor of watercolours, and occasionally oils, at the Royal Academy between 1796 and 1837. He specialised in watercolour drawings of Norfolk, North Wales, Cumberland and later, Kent. Frequently he introduced figures and cattle. Both James Baynes and his wife were a members of the Sandemanian Church. The Sandemanians were a small, devoted and fundamentalist Christian sect that formed tightknit communities of small congregations across the UK and in Danbury, Connecticut. The London community boasted Michael Faraday amongst its Deacon Elders. In the north of England it is likely that Baynes was a member of one of the Cumbrian branches but on his move to London he made his confession of faith and became a full member of the London congregation (Paul's Alley in the Barbican) in June 1792, some nine months after Michael Faraday's birth. Baynes drew landscapes while traveling in England and Wales. His sketch books show that he visited the South of England in 1802, Wales and the West of England in 1810, Cumberland in 1815 and Kent in 1816. James Baynes died of an 'affection of the heart' on 12 May 1837. Both he and his wife Mary are buried in St. Johns Wood Cemetery, London. Works James Baynes' works include: *The Well in Carisbrook Castle (31.5 x 28, ink and wash) *Castle Ruins with Figures (45.4 x 62.4, watercolour on paper) *Caernarvon Castle across the River (37.7 x 53.8, watercolour on paper) *City Street Corner Scene with Figures (26.03 x 18.16, watercolour on paper) *Figures on a Lakeland Track (18 x 29, watercolour on paper) Bibliography *Groves, Algernon: A Dictionary of Artists Who Have Exhibited Works in the Principal London Exhibitions 1760-1893, Kingsmead reprints, 1970. *Cantor, Geoffrey: Michael Faraday, Sandemanian and Scientist, Macmillan, 1991.

Members of the genus are commonly known as Mexican orange due to the similarity of their flowers with those of the closely related orange, both in shape and scent. They are native to southern North America, from Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and south through most of Mexico. In its generic name Humboldt and Bonpland honoured Swiss botanist Jacques Denis Choisy (1799‚Äì1859). Description The species grow to tall. The leaves are opposite, leathery, glossy, palmately compound with 3-13 leaflets, each leaflet long and broad. C. ternata has three broad leaflets, while C. dumosa has up to 13 very narrow leaflets. The flowers are star-shaped, diameter, with 4-7 white petals, 8-15 stamens and a green stigma; they are produced throughout the late spring and summer. The fruit is a leathery two to six sectioned capsule. Uses Choisya 'Aztec Pearl' Choisya species are popular ornamental plants in areas with mild winters, grown primarily for their abundant and fragrant flowers. The foliage is also aromatic, smelling of rue when bruised or cut. The flowers are also valued for honeybee forage, producing abundant nectar.

The Epilimnion ‚Ö°. The Metalimnion ‚Ö¢. The Hypolimnion The scales are used to associate each section of the stratification to their corresponding depths and temperatures. The arrow is used to show the movement of wind over the surface of the water which initiates the turnover in the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. Lake stratification is the tendency of lakes to form separate and distinct thermal layers during warm weather. Typically stratified lakes show three distinct layers, the Epilimnion comprising the top warm layer, the thermocline (or Metalimnion): the middle layer, which may change depth throughout the day, and the colder Hypolimnion extending to the floor of the lake. Definition The thermal stratification of lakes refers to a change in the temperature at different depths in the lake, and is due to the change in water's density with temperature. Cold water is denser than warm water and the epilimnion generally consists of water that is not as dense as the water in the hypolimnion. However, the temperature of maximum density for freshwater is 4 ¬∞C. In temperate regions where lake water warms up and cools through the seasons, a cyclical pattern of overturn occurs that is repeated from year to year as the cold dense water at the top of the lake sinks. For example, in dimictic lakes the lake water turns over during the spring and the fall. This process occurs more slowly in deeper water and as a result, a thermal bar may form. If the stratification of water lasts for extended periods, the lake is meromictic. In shallow lakes, stratification into epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion often does not occur, as wind or cooling causes regular mixing throughout the year. These lakes are called polymictic. There is not a fixed depth that separates polymictic and stratifying lakes, as apart from depth, this is also influenced by turbidity, lake surface area, and climate. The lake mixing regime (e.g. polymictic, dimictic, meromictic) describes the yearly patterns of lake stratification that occur during most of the years. However, short-term events can influence lake stratification as well. Heat waves can cause periods of stratification in otherwise mixed, shallow lakes, while mixing events such as storms or large river discharge, can break down stratification. The accumulation of dissolved carbon dioxide in three meromictic lakes in Africa (Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun in Cameroon and Lake Kivu in Rwanda) is potentially dangerous because if one of these lakes is triggered into limnic eruption, a very large quantity of carbon dioxide can quickly leave the lake and displace the oxygen needed for life by people and animals in the surrounding area. De-stratification In temperate latitudes, many lakes that becomes stratified during the summer months, de-stratify during cooler windier weather with surface mixing by wind being a significant driver in this process. This is often referred to as \\"autumn turn-over\\". The mixing of the hypolimnium into the mixed water body of the lake recirculates nutrients, particularly phosphorus compounds, trapped in the hypolimnion during the warm weather. It also poses a risk of oxygen sag as a long established hypolimnion can be anoxic or very low in oxygen Lake mixing regimes can shift in response to increasing air temperatures. Some dimictic lakes can turn into monomictic lakes, while some monomictic lakes might become meromictic, as a consequence of rising temperatures. Many types of aeration equipment have been used to thermally de-stratify lakes, particularly lakes subject to low oxygen or undesirable algal blooms. In fact, natural resource and environmental managers are often challenged by problems caused by lake and pond thermal stratification. Fish die-offs have been directly associated with thermal gradients, stagnation, and ice cover. Excessive growth of plankton may limit the recreational use of lakes and the commercial use of lake water. With severe thermal stratification in a lake, the quality of drinking water also can be adversely affected. For fisheries managers, the spatial distribution of fish within a lake is often adversely affected by thermal stratification and in some cases may indirectly cause large die-offs of recreationally important fish. One commonly used tool to reduce the severity of these lake management problems is to eliminate or lessen thermal stratification through aeration. Aeration has met with some success, although it has rarely proved to be a panacea.  Anthropogenic Influences  Every lake has a set mixing regime that is influenced by lake morphometry and environmental conditions. However, human influences in the form of land use change, warming temperatures, and changes to weather patterns have been shown to alter the timing and intensity of stratification in lakes around the globe. These changes can further alter the fish, zooplankton, and phytoplankton community composition, in addition to creating gradients that alter the availability of dissolved oxygen and nutrients. There are a number of ways in which human land use change influences lake stratification and subsequently water conditions. Urban expansion has led to the construction of roads and houses in close proximity to previously isolated lakes, a factor that has ultimately resulted in increased runoff and pollution. The addition of particulate matter to lake bodies can lower water clarity, resulting in stronger thermal stratification and overall lower average water column temperatures, which can eventually affect the onset of ice cover. Water quality can also be influenced by the runoff of salt from roads and sidewalks, which often creates a benthic saline layer that interferes with vertical mixing of surface waters. Further, the saline layer can prevent dissolved oxygen from reaching the bottom sediments, decreasing phosphorus recycling and affecting microbial communities. On a global scale, rising temperatures and changing weather patterns can also affect stratification in lakes. Rising air temperatures have the same effect on lake bodies as a physical shift in geographic location, with tropical zones being particularly sensitive. The intensity and scope of impact depends on location and lake morphometry, but in some cases can be so extreme as to require a reclassification from monomictic to dimictic (ex Great Bear Lake). Globally, lake stratification appears to be more stable with deeper and steeper thermoclines, and average lake temperature as a main determinant in the stratification response to changing temperatures. Further, surface warming rates are a much higher magnitude than bottom warming rates, again indicating stronger thermal stratification across lakes. Changes to stratification patterns can also alter the community composition of lake ecosystems. In shallow lakes, temperature increases can alter the diatom community while in deep lakes, the change is reflected in the deep chlorophyll layer taxa. Changes in mixing patterns and increased nutrient availability can also affect zooplankton species composition and abundance, while decreased nutrient availability can be detrimental for benthic communities and fish habitat.

Byrd in 1926, but it is disputed whether they made it there. The Bennett (DD-473) was launched on 16 April 1942 at the Boston Navy Yard, sponsored by Mrs. Floyd Bennett, the widow of Aviation Machinist Bennett. She was commissioned on 9 February 1943 with Commander Edmund B. Taylor in command. History The Bennett arrived at Pearl Harbor on 31 May, and she then spent the next two months patrolling in the Hawaiian Islands. After escorting a convoy to Efate in the New Hebrides, she acted as a plane guard and patrolled out of Efate (27 August through 28 October). Moving to the Solomon Islands 4 November, she patrolled and escorted convoys until 5 April 1944. Included in her service in the Solomon Islands was support of the Cape Torokina, Bougainville landings (on 1 November 1943 on the western side of the island) and Green Island (on 15 February 1944) landings, and bombardments of the Japanese base at Kavieng on New Ireland, (on 18 February 1944) and Rabaul, New Britain (29 February). The Bennett next steamed north to take part in the invasions of Saipan (14 June through 1 July) and of Guam (2nd through 16 August). Returning to the Central Pacific later in the month she supported the invasion of the Palaus (Peleliu) (6 through 25 September), and then she returned to San Francisco for upkeep work, arriving on 25 October 1944. The Bennett returned to Pearl Harbor on 24 December, and she remained in Hawaiian waters for the next month. Then she steamed west to take part in the invasion of Iwo Jima (19 February through 5 March 1945), where she was slightly damaged by a dud bomb (1 March). On 1 April she was a unit of the forces taking part in the invasion of Okinawa. At 08:50, on 7 April, she was hit by an Imperial Japanese Navy kamikaze plane, damaging the forward engine room, and knocking out all of her electrical power. Seven sailors ultimately died from their injuries, and fourteen survived serious injuries. The Bennett was able to make it to the small naval base at Kerama Retto under her own power, and on the following day she departed for Saipan under tow of the fleet tugboat . After emergency repairs, she steamed to Puget Sound Navy Yard where she underwent further repairs (May though August 1945). In August she reported to Adak, in the Aleutian Islands, and then she made one voyage to Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula, with weather personnel (28 August through 26 September). Returning to San Diego, she was placed in commission in reserve on 21 December 1945, and out of commission in reserve on 18 April 1946. Brazilian service Stricken 1 August 1973. Bennett was transferred to Brazil 15 December 1959, where she was renamed Para√≠ba. The ship was stricken by the Brazilian Navy and scrapped in 1978.

Guinness converted its Dundalk brewery into a modern lager production plant with the guidance of Dr. Herman Muender, a distinguished German brewer. Various names were considered for the brand, including Atlas, Cresta and Dolphin, before Harp was chosen. The brand was marketed with the Brian Boru harp as its emblem. By 1961 a consortium of brewers, Courage, Barclay & Simonds, Scottish & Newcastle, Bass, Mitchells & Butlers and Guinness, grouped together as Harp Lager Ltd to brew and market the beer. Courage's Alton Brewery, where Courage Director's had been brewed, was rebuilt to produce the lager in Great Britain. By 1964, the product was being sold on draught and led in its category for sales.

It was also released on the SNES in 1993, under the name Super Putty in North America and Europe and as in Japan. A release on the Commodore Amiga CD32 was made in 1994, also under the name Super Putty. Despite the extra buttons present on the CD32's controller, the CD32 version made no use of them. The game received positive reviews upon release, notably for the Amiga version.  Story  Putty Moon, the place where Putty lives, has been taken over by an evil wizard named Dazzledaze. Dazzledaze planned to capture the Putties and ship them to Earth as gum. To save his friends and oust the evil wizard, Billy Putty enlists the help of some robots (\\"bots\\") to build a skyscraper that will reach up to Putty Moon.  Gameplay  In Putty, the player controls a blue blob with eyes. Putty has many moves that he could use to attack enemies or to navigate around the level. These abilities include being able to stretch out upwards, downwards, left and right to access far-off ledges. He also has the ability to inflate. This allows him to provide a cushioned landing for any falling bots. Over-inflation also acts as a \\"smart bomb\\", with Putty bursting, killing all of the enemies on the screen, whilst reducing his health in the process. Putty is able to form part of himself into a fist, allowing him to punch left or right to dispatch enemies. Putty is also able to melt into the floor, making him invulnerable and also allowing him to absorb enemies, recovering a small amount of health in the process. With certain enemies in the game, such as the clockwork orange, once Putty has absorbed one he is then able to morph into the enemy's shape to use its abilities. A final ability of Putty's is being able to create a mug of coffee from part of himself, which will distract bots and make them stand still. The levels in Putty are laid out vertically, with the screen scrolling up and down. The levels contain regular platforms, as well as \\"solid\\" ledges that Putty can not move through, and other special tiles including electric platforms and bounce pads. The aim of each level is to rescue a set number of bots within the time limit. In the early sections of the game, the bots simply stand around the level. Putty has to absorb them, and carry them to the level's goal (either a flying saucer or an elevator). Later on in the game, the bots will jump around platforms, often falling to their death. Invariably each level also contains various enemies. These enemies include Terminator carrots, Scouse sausages and sword-wielding spacemen. The enemies will attempt to hurt Putty in various ways. The attacks from some of the enemies will also hurt any bots that Putty is carrying at the time. If a bot is hurt four times it is killed, causing the player to have to find another bot to absorb. Putty is also able to use powerups that are scattered around each level. These range from simple points bonuses to temporary invulnerability, to Uncle Ted. Once this latter powerup is collected, a man with a Hammond Organ named Uncle Ted appears, and proceeds to play a tune, causing all of the enemies in the level to freeze. Sequels The sequel Putty Squad was initially only released for Super NES and only in PAL territories. It features Putty fighting alongside nemesis Dweezil the cat against other mischievous enemies to rescue other red putties. It also features a two-player mode, with the second player taking control of a red putty. Versions of the game were completed and reviewed, but not published, for the Amiga and the Sega Mega Drive, with only a demo version for the Amiga being released on two magazine coverdisks. The complete Amiga version was finally released in December 2013 as a free Christmas gift from System 3, available on their website.Season's Greetings from System 3 to all of the Amiga Community... A Christmas Gift The Mega Drive version was also released in October 2015 by a Sega-16 user who get hold of a working prototype. A PC MS-DOS version was also projected by System 3 and a demo version was released on magazine disks, but in the end this version was not even finished by the developer. Overall, the original version received favourable reviews and scored highly among many Amiga reviewers. On August 12, 2010, System 3 announced that a new version of Putty Squad will be available on PS3, iPhone, iPad and PSP. The game was eventually released for PSVita, PS4, PS3, 3DS, Windows 8 and Xbox Live Arcade. The remake received mixed to negative reviews from critics. In Retro Gamer issue 39 Mark Cale stated that he would be bringing the Putty series to the Nintendo DS and PSP in 2008 and more details would be announced later in 2008. He stated that System 3 were looking to bring a new game to the systems rather than a port of the two existing games. However, the games were never released or revealed.

They were jointly added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 under the name Military Drill Hall and Men's Gymnasium.Chart toppers: Best area gyms to watch a prep game, courtesy Marcus Jackson The News Gazette - February 28, 2012 History The one-story building now known as the Kenney Gym Annex, the easternmost of the two structures, was built in 1889-90 as the Military Drill Hall and was designed by Nathan Clifford Ricker. The interior was converted for use as a gymnasium in 1914, at which time it became known as the Annex to the Men's Gym building next to it. The conversion preserved the building's large column-free open space, which had been a necessity for military drilling. An eastern addition was made to the building in 1918.\\"NRHP Designation Report\\" The Kenney Gym, the two-story building to the west, was built in 1902 and was designed by Nelson Strong Spencer in the Renaissance Revival style,\\"H.E.

Prior to the opening of Huff Hall in 1925, Kenney Gym housed the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. It was also home to the women's volleyball program from 1974 until 1989 and the men's wrestling team until those teams moved to Huff Hall. From 1919 to 1925, Kenney Gym played host to the state finals of the Illinois High School Association boys' basketball tournament. Current use Kenney Gym Annex is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose arena.

The exact number of operatives was classified but was thought to be between 60 and 80, with an average age of 31. SSG could have been deployed to achieve specific, well-defined and often time critical results of strategic or operational significance which couldn't have been achieved through the use of conventional forces. Typical missions undertaken by SSG were to engage and destroy targets of great significance to the enemy, to rescue people captured by the enemy or held hostage, and to gather intelligence through combat. SSG's missions required its operators to covertly infiltrate and move inside hostile territory and remain undetected for very long periods. History In 1994 the S√§rskilda Skyddsgruppen (Special Protection Group, SSG) unit was founded, though the unit's existence wasn't made public until 1997. There were several reasons why the SSG was formed: one was the threat of foreign special forces, which intended to kill the senior military and civilian officials (for example politicians). The SSG was designed to perform operations which existing military regiments did not have the skills to carry out. The other was that in the early 1990s the missions of the Swedish Army were much more complex and sensitive than before. In 2002, Afghanistan, the SSG contributed to security and personal protection of the Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, returning from exile in Italy. The SSG along with other Special Operations Forces also trained Afghan military personnel. In November 2003, SSG along with FJS/IK (Para Ranger Rapid Reaction Company, later SIG) were sent to Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo), with members of French special forces CPA10 and 1er RPIMa for Operation Artemis. The mission was to stabilize the situation in the area around the town of Bunia and to stop the killing. Shortly after Operation Artemis, a new unit, S√§rskilda Inh√§mtningsgruppen (Special Reconnaissance Group, SIG) was founded out of the FJS/IK whose object was information gathering. On March 17‚Äì18, 2004, during the riots in Caglavica near Pristina in Kosovo, SSG operators conducted counter sniper operations. More than 30 SVD Dragunov sniper rifles were recovered in one hour after deputy battalion commander had granted them \\"every permission to fire in all of Kosovo\\". On November 25, 2005, four SSG operatives were wounded by an improvised explosive device (IED) during a reconnaissance mission in northern Afghanistan. Of the wounded, Jesper Lindblom died due to his injuries on December 9, 2005 and Thomas Bergqvist died after having been airlifted to a hospital in Europe. In 2008, SSG and SIG were deployed to Chad, to prepare for the Swedish contribution of marines to EUFOR. In 2011, the SSG and SIG were merged to create the S√§rskilda operationsgruppen (Special Operations Group, SOG). Recruitment and training SSG drew its personnel from officers (lower ranks might have undergone officer training to be able to serve in the unit) of all three branches of the military, however mainly from Life Regiment Hussars (K 3) (Airborne & Reconnaissance Infantry), Kustj√§garna (Marine Rangers), Army Ranger Battalion and each applicant must have passed a two- week-long grueling selection process. Before selection took place, the applicants were invited to attend a pre-selection weekend, where they would have been tested and given notice of the likelihood of failure or success and how to improve themselves. Selection might only have been attempted once unless there were certain mitigating circumstances that caused the applicant to fail. Because of its level of secrecy, the time it took to train a recruit had not been made public by the SSG but according to the armed forces¬¥ website, basic operator training took more than one year. Each soldier received common training including parachuting, scuba diving and protection. As an operative he would have also received special training within different areas such as HAHO/HALO parachuting, explosives, first aid, sniping and special weapons training. An SSG operative had the ability to insert and extract by several means such as on foot, paradrop, submerged, and by boat and vehicle. Women could have applied to the unit as Intelligence Operators. Training was often held in countries other than Sweden, and joint exercises with other countries special forces were frequent.

Early life Berry was born in Craigavon, County Armagh, and brought up in Tandragee, where he was educated at local state schools and colleges, following which he was employed in the textile industry. He joined the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) at the age of 16, the same age at which he began gospel singing in churches in the North Armagh and Banbridge areas. Political career With his high profile as a singer, Berry was elected, aged 22, the youngest MLA in the first Northern Ireland Assembly as a DUP representative for the Newry and Armagh constituency in the 1998 election and was re-elected in the 2003 election. He was elected to Armagh City and District Council in 2001, and re-elected in the 2005 elections. In the 2005 general election Berry was the DUP candidate for Newry and Armagh constituency. =Controversy= Just days before the election, the Sunday World newspaper claimed that Berry had met a man for a massage, with whom he had made initial contact via a gay chatroom, in a Belfast hotel room booked by Berry under a false name. Berry claimed that he was seeking treatment for a sports injury, and said he was considering legal action against the paper. He was not elected and was the only DUP candidate to experience a fall in their share of the vote in favour of the Ulster Unionist Party. Weeks later the DUP who, since 1977 have maintained a Christian fundamentalist stance on gay rights, and launched a campaign known as Save Ulster from Sodomy, suspended Berry from membership and commenced disciplinary proceedings. Berry launched a legal challenge but in February 2006 dropped these proceedings and resigned from the party. =Post-controversy career= An active member of the Orange Order, Berry was on the traditionalist, fundamentalist wing of the DUP. In the 2007 assembly election he stood as an Independent candidate, opposed to the DUP policy of implementing the St Andrews Agreement but failed to be elected. Berry continues to as a gospel singer, and has released three compilations. He is married to Lorna and now works in Tandragee as a local estate agent.

It opened in 1956 and is both the first and the oldest fully enclosed, climate-controlled shopping mall in the United States. Southdale Center has of leasable retail space, and contains 106 retail tenants. The mall is owned by Simon Property Group and the anchor stores are Macy's, Dave & Buster's, AMC Theatres, Juut Salon Spa, Southdale Library (opening 2022), Hennepin Service Center, and Life Time Athletic. Victor Gruen, the center's architect, designed the mall to challenge the \\"car-centric\\" America that was rising in the 1950s. Since its opening in 1956, Southdale has suffered through high vacancy rates and several store closures, but has been able to recover in recent years. Several additions have been performed on the building, including a 2011 renovation which involved the construction of a brand new food court. Southdale Center continues to use much of its original structure despite these renovations, and has been the host of several charity and community events throughout the years.  History  = Background = In 1943, architects Victor Gruen and Elsie Krummeck were asked to submit a proposal to envision a prototype of what a shopping center would ideally look like after World War II for \\"Architecture 194X\\", a competition in the Architectural Forum magazine. Prototypes by the pair emphasized the communal aspects of their proposed shopping center where services like the public library and the post office could be incorporated with the functions of retail. They also strived to make the centers visually appealing and inviting to encourage shoppers to stay longer. While stranded in Detroit during a snowstorm in 1948, Gruen approached Oscar Webber, head of Hudson's, the second largest department store in the nation at the time (behind Macy's in Manhattan). Gruen asked Webber to help fund a shopping center in the suburbs of Detroit with Hudson's as the main draw. Webber initially declined, but a year later Hudson's agreed to finance a set of malls including Northland Center as customers moved out of the city and into the suburbs. = 1952‚Äì57: Construction and grand opening = Through Oscar Webber, Gruen was introduced to the Dayton family, who owned an eponymous chain of stores after their father's death and were looking to expand and build a shopping center to accompany one of their stores in Edina, Minnesota. Webber insisted that the Dayton family work with Gruen to assist in their efforts. On June 17, 1952, The first plans unveiled for the shopping center were announced by Gruen and Donald Dayton, president of Dayton's. They estimated the cost to build the shopping center to be around $10 million. Public response to the announcement was generally positive, with many hailing the project as a utopia. In a near unanimous vote by the city of Edina, zoning ordinances were changed to constitute the mall. Gruen was a European-style socialist; he found individual stores in downtown venues to be inefficient, and the suburban lifestyle of 1950s America too \\"car-centric\\" and wanted to design a building that would be a communal gathering place, where people would shop, drink coffee, and socialize, as he remembered from his native Vienna. Southdale Center was loosely modeled on the arcades of several heavily populated European cities and purposely included \\"eye-level display cases\\" to \\"lure customers into stores\\". Gruen imagined that Southdale would eventually include \\"a medical center, schools and residences, not just a parade of glitzy stores.\\" In a joint statement to the Minneapolis Sunday Tribune (now the Star Tribune), Gruen and his economic consultant Lawrence P. Smith described the regional shopping center as a place that could \\"take care of today's needs and today's living\\" and would bring the community together by providing \\"a new outlet for that primary human instinct to mingle with other humans.\\" The neighborhood surrounding the center was specifically built to accompany the mall. Groundbreaking for Southdale took place on October 29, 1954; 800 construction workers were needed to build the three-story, , 500 acre center, which had 5,200 parking spaces, 72 available tenants, and cost $20 million to construct. Due to Minnesota's harsh climate in the winter, Gruen constructed the center with a roof and air-conditioning system capable of maintaining a comfortable temperature of year-round. The mall was originally anchored by Dayton's, Donaldson's, Walgreens, and Woolworth. Over 40,000 visitors attended the grand opening ceremony for the center on the morning of October 8, 1956. An additional 188,000 customers visited the mall throughout the following week. The center was constructed to successfully bring the community together by \\"gathering art, culture and entertainment under one roof with retail.\\" The Dayton's store was modeled after Dayton's flagship store in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In November 1956, organic architect Frank Lloyd Wright visited the mall as part of a tour of new buildings in Minnesota; he critiqued Southdale's overall design, stating \\"[the] garden court has all the evils of the village street and none of its charm,\\" further criticizing several other buildings in nearby Minneapolis. He unfavorably added that Gruen \\"should have left downtown, downtown.\\" = 1958‚Äì90: Additions, JCPenney opens, and new competition = Over the early years of Southdale, several tenants and restaurants opened in the center. A restaurant called Sidewalk Cafe, was an \\"outdoor\\"-themed restaurant, even though the venue was fully enclosed; Sidewalk Cafe was the first restaurant of its kind. JCPenney, a Plano, Texas- based department store, announced their interest in opening a location at Southdale Center. An addition to the mall was constructed, allowing JCPenney to open a store in 1972; it became Southdale's third anchor store, following Dayton's and Donaldson's. Along with the new anchor store came an entire new mall corridor connecting JCPenney to the original structure of the mall. During 1976, construction of a new shopping center directly across the street from Southdale occurred. The construction resulted in the Galleria Edina, an upscale shopping center; the new shopping mall increased competition with neighboring shopping centers. In 1987, Donaldson's announced the discontinuation of their chain of stores, which would shut one of the mall's original anchors. Instead, Donaldson's merged with Chicago-based department chain Carson Pirie Scott. = 1991‚Äì2008: Expansion, Dayton's merger, and store closures = In 1991, Dayton's announced plans to construct a significantly larger store directly north of their current location. These plans included the demolition of the original Dayton's store to be replaced with more stores, plus a larger \\"garden court\\", and the construction of various multi-level parking garages; these plans were eventually constructed and finalized in the early 1990s. On June 30, 1997, Southdale Center was sold to the O'Connor Group, a New York-based real estate company for $125 million. Around this time, Southdale converted their basement into a singular anchor store, which became Marshalls; surrounding the new anchor were several specialty shops and mall management offices. Dayton's acquired Marshall Field's and rebranded with the Marshall Field's nameplate in 2001.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/195672430/?terms= The former Trendz on Top area located on the third level During the early 2000s, following fear of competition from nearby Eden Prairie Center and Mall of America, Southdale announced further plans to renovate the center again. A complete remodeling of the center occurred in 2001, followed by a large addition to the southern half of the property; the addition included a sixteen screen movie theater along with an entertainment district of restaurants and shops called \\"The District on France\\". \\"The District on France\\" included several \\"upscale\\" dining options, including California Pizza Kitchen, The Cheesecake Factory, and Maggiano's Little Italy. A renovation of the less- traveled third floor also occurred, with the addition of teen-geared stores; this addition was called \\"Trendz on Top\\". Throughout the mid 2000s, Southdale began struggling with maintaining a low vacancy rate. The May Department Stores Company acquired Marshall Field's in 2004, and promptly closed the Twin Cities area Mervyn's.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/250303532/?terms= After the closure of Mervyn's in 2004, several tenants followed and ended their leases as well; national retailers like The Bombay Company, Crate & Barrel, Ritz Camera, and Select Comfort all announced closures of their Southdale locations. Talks of a Dick's Sporting Goods filling the space formerly leased by Mervyn's occurred, but those plans never took off and eventually dissolved. In 2006, Marshall Fields was rebranded as Macy's.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/250278793/?terms= = 2009‚Äì2016: Ongoing renovations = In February 2011, Simon Property Group announced that Southdale would soon be anchored by Herberger's, a local department store chain, and would lease the space previously used by Mervyn's. Along with this announcement came the mention of a brand new food court to replace the nearly vacant one on the less-traveled third floor, a housing development consisting of apartments and condominiums, and expanded retail. The food court's construction would include six tenants, which was later increased to eight tenants. However, the new food court forced the closure of one of Southdale's oldest tenants, Ralph's Shoe Service, which originally opened at the mall in 1957. Following several tenant terminations, the mall's Marshalls anchor announced that their Southdale location would move to a different shopping center in Bloomington, Minnesota. The new food court located by JCPenney was completed in 2012 and featured \\"upscale\\" dining options, such as Qdoba Mexican Grill and Smashburger; several other projects took place, such as cosmetic changes for the mall and the construction of new corridors. Since 2015, several stores and businesses have opened up locations at Southdale Center. Gordmans, a Nebraska-based discount retailer, filled the vacancy previously leased by Marshalls in July 2015; however closed just two years later after filing bankruptcy.https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OGG0p1GYnc0J:https://www.startribune.com/gordmans- in-burnsville-woodbury-to-close-unless-bankrupt-owner-can-find- buyer/570406522/+&cd;=2&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=us&client;=safari Other new openings were a Dave and Buster's restaurant, filling the vacancy of the original food court. A Homewood Suites by Hilton resort was approved by the City of Edina and constructed in the shopping center's northeast parking lot in late 2016. = 2017‚Äìpresent= Following the announcement of JCPenney closing nine stores throughout Minnesota, the Southdale Center location closed on July 31, 2017, after 45 years at Southdale. The former Penney's building was razed, and in its place was constructed a $43 million Life Time Fitness multi-level complex, featuring a roof top pool, which opened in 2019.https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:y_VCLhfuUbUJ:https://www.startribune.com/life- time-s-new-southdale-health-club-just-the-start-as-company-expands-more-into- apartments-mall-development-and-eventually- hotels/565901032/+&cd;=8&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=us&client;=safari Bon-Ton announced on April 17, 2018 that it would close and liquidate all Herberger's stores in their 200+ locations after two liquidators, Great American Group and Tiger Capital Group, won an auction for the company.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/421650276/?terms=herberger%27s On August 26, 2018, the Herberger's Southdale anchor location closed.

The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 The duo's debut single was \\"I Don't Wanna Break My Heart\\" (1984), released in a pink colored vinyl. The concept behind Bobbysocks! was to bring up to date songs from the 1950s with a swing mood, adding them a \\"modern\\" 1980s sound. That idea was fully applied on their first LP Bobbysocks!, which was a mixture of covers and brand new songs. The scheduled next single was going to be \\"Radio\\", but the plans were changed when the duo won the Eurovision Song Contest. \\"Let It Swing\\" topped the Norwegian singles chart, as well as it did in Belgium. It was a Top 10 in Sweden and Ireland, and a Top 20 in The Netherlands and Austria. It entered the UK singles charts on 25 May 1985, and rose to a high of N¬∫ 44; it remained in the charts for 4 weeks. It was also pressed in countries such as Germany, Japan and Australia. There were plans to release the single in USA, but it didn't happen at the end. In 1985, due to their ESC victory, Bobbysocks! were awarded the Peer Gynt Prize, which is awarded by the Stortinget, Norway's parliament. Another ESC consequence was the re-release of the Bobbysocks! LP with \\"Let It Swing\\" on it, reaching the Gold status. Their next album, Waiting for the Morning, was released in April 1986, preceded by the single of the same name, both becoming a huge success in Norway, peaking at N¬∫ 1 on the Norwegian singles and album charts. Walkin' on Air, was recorded in L.A. in 1987 and produced by Bill Maxwell. It went Gold in only 4 days, becoming their 3rd and final LP. Just before the release of \\"If I Fall\\", the album's lead single in Norway, the duo wanted to do something \\"decently crazy\\" as they revealed at the time, so they did a cover of \\"Swing it, magister'n\\", a song from 1940 originally sung by the Swedish singer and actress Alice Babs, releasing it as single in the summer of 1987. In 1988, Bobbysocks disbanded, after 4 successful years. However, Krogh and Andreassen still appeared time to time together on stage in Norway. They appeared at Congratulations, the 50th anniversary Eurovision concert in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October 2005. During May 2010, Bobbysocks did a short comeback to celebrate their 25th anniversary since their ESC victory in 1985, launching a compilation album called Let It Swing - The Best Of Bobbysocks!, which included 2 newly recorded songs and peaking at N¬∫ 13 on the Norwegian album charts, helping to gain brand new fans not only in Norway, but also in other countries all over the world.

Lake Nipigon is located approximately north of Nipigon. Nipigon is served by several transportation corridors: * Highway 11 * Highway 17, both part of the Trans- Canada Highway * Canadian Pacific Railway Geography The Nipigon River Bridge, originally opened in 1937, forms the narrowest transportation bottleneck between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in Canada. For about 15 km, Highway 11 runs within Nipigon River and a lake. Nipigon is located northeast of Thunder Bay, southwest of Geraldton and Beardmore, west of Marathon and northwest of Sault Ste. Marie. The crater on Mars named Nipigon Crater or Crater Nipigon is named after this town. Nipigon is surrounded with pine and other varieties of forests. The power line connecting from Lake Nipigon supplies electricity to Thunder Bay and area. The other power line runs between Thunder Bay and the rest of Ontario. Timbering has been common sporadically to the north, the northwest and further north within Lake Nipigon along with parts of the southwest which formed old forest roads to the northeast and north. The municipality of Greenstone lies to the north. A manufacturing plant lies to the south. Several other unincorporated municipalities were around Nipigon. A communications tower near Nipigon broadcasts a local radio station and television channels from Thunder Bay including CKPR (TBT), CFNO and CBQT. There are two bridges at the east end of town spanning the Nipigon River: one is a single-track railway bridge belonging to the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the other is a two-lane highway bridge constructed by the Province of Ontario. With the exception of the Canadian National Railway transcontinental rail line, the two bridges are the narrowest east-west land link in Canada's transportation system. Both Highways 11 and 17 and the Canadian Pacific Railway route all their traffic across those bridges. The Nipigon River Bridge is being replaced by a pair of two- lane cable-stayed bridges, the first of their kind in Ontario, with the future eastbound bridge having been finished in November 2015 and the second, westbound bridge, to be completed by 2018. On January 10, 2016, the first bridge heaved apart but did not collapse, resulting in traffic having to reroute through the United States. However, one lane was re-opened to traffic 17 hours later. Demographics Economy Nipigon Public Library The chief industries in Nipigon are forest products, fishing, and tourism. Nipigon is a setting off point for fishing excursions onto Lake Superior and the Nipigon River system leading up to Lake Nipigon. Fish varieties common to this area include Atlantic salmon, lake trout, speckled trout (the world's largest speckled trout was caught in the Nipigon River in 1915, weighing in at Dr. JW Cook's World Record Brook Trout Was Caught in 1915), rainbow trout, walleye, northern pike, bass, and perch.

Less than a month earlier workers at the mill had purchased it from Columbia Forest Products of Portland, Oregon. At the time of the sale, a $4-million modernization plan for the mill was also announced. More than 100 people were employed at the plant, which produced hardwood underlayment for vinyl, plywood and laminate flooring.Toronto Star, February 18, 2007, Leslie Scrivener, \\"A town called hope\\" Notable people from Nipigon Nipigon was the birthplace of two time world curling champion Allan A. \\"Al\\" (the Iceman) Hackner.

Biography =Early life= Tzur was born in the Zaslav in the Soviet Union (now Iziaslav in Ukraine) in 1923 as Tsvi Tsera Tsertenko, and made aliyah to Mandatory Palestine at the age of two. In 1936, at the peak of the Arab revolt and the 1936‚Äì1939 pogroms he joined the Haganah in order to help protect the Jews from Arab rioters. =Military career= With the outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Tzur was appointed battalion leader in the Givati Brigade, and participated in Operation Pleshet, among others. Tzur was the founder of the fast jeep reconnaissance company, Samson's Foxes, which fought on the southern front. After the end of the war, he undertook organizing roles and went to study manpower management in the United States. In 1956 he was promoted to the rank of Major General and was appointed as the commander of the central front. In 1958 he was appointed as deputy chief of staff and went for long period of study in France. He returned on September 1960. The following year he replaced Haim Laskov as the IDF chief of staff. =Chief of Staff= In January 1961 Tzur was appointed as the IDF Chief of Staff. One of his first actions was to appoint Major General Yitzhak Rabin as his deputy. Tzur's term was relatively quiet, except for border incidents with Syria, which shelled Israeli villages from the Golan Heights. The biggest IDF operation during Tzur's term was held on 16 March 1962, when the Golani Brigade raided Syrian outposts to the north of the Sea of Galilee in order to stop Syrian shelling. Seven Israeli soldiers and thirty Syrian soldiers were killed during the battle. However, the shelling was not stopped in the area and on 19 August 1963, Syrian forces murdered two civilians in Almagor. Tzur sought to draw quality manpower to the IDF and decided in June 1961 to provide officers with a private car for their personal usage. The model chosen was a Citro√´n 2CV. Tzur also prepared the IDF for a war with the Arab armies and built up the defense forces so that it could stop Arab attacks. In August 1961, the president of Egypt, Gamal Abdul Nasser, revealed that Israel had obtained Dassault Mirage III jet fighters in order to counter Egyptian Soviet-made MiG-19s. The Mirages proven themselves very well and served as the Israeli Air Force's main fighter for many years. The Mirages contributed substantially to Israel's victory in the Six-Day War and the elimination of the combined Arab airpower of Egypt, Syria and Jordan, as did other two notable acquisitions by Tzur, the Centurion tanks and MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile technology. Tzur retired from duty in December 1963. =Civilian and political career= After his retirement Tzur was appointed as the general manager of Mekorot, Israel's national water company. Under pressure from Moshe Dayan to enter the political fray, in the 1965 elections he was elected to the Knesset on the Rafi list, David Ben-Gurion's party. However, he resigned from the Knesset after just a month, and was replaced by Amos Degani,Knesset Members of the Sixth Knesset Knesset website before returning to work in Mekorot. With the appointment of Dayan as Minister of Defense in May 1967, Tzur was asked to assist Dayan and served as an adviser to the Minister of Defense for seven years. After that, Tzur served at several managing positions, including the Israeli Aircraft Industries, the shipping company Zim, and \\"Hevra LeYsrael\\". Tzur was active in public affairs until his last days, and on 29 April 2004 he signed a letter in support of Ariel Sharon's disengament plan. He died in December that year.

Because the town is considered the \\"Canoeing Capital of Canada\\", many canoe symbols are seen around town. Atikokan (Ojibwe for \\"caribou bones\\") is a town in the Rainy River District in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. The population was 2,753 as of the 2016 census. The town is one of the main entry points into Quetico Provincial Park and promotes itself as the \\"Canoeing Capital of Canada\\". Atikokan was originally established as a Divisional Point for the Canadian Northern Railway. The town of Atikokan is an enclave within the Unorganized Rainy River District. It is officially located within the Central Time Zone, but uses UTC‚àí05:00 year round, therefore in practice it is located in Eastern Standard Time Zone and does not observe daylight saving time. History =Early history= The original settlers to the Atikokan area were the \\"Oschekamega Wenenewak\\" (The people of the cross ridges) Ojibwa / Chippewa. They lived by themselves until the arrival of Jacques de Noyon in 1688. His journey was critical for the expansion and exploration of the Atikokan area.Vita, Alan (1974). A History of Atikokan, 75th Anniversary Booklet Committee. =19th century to mid-20th century= The road to Atikokan Palliser Gladman-Hind suggested the first real road in the area, he intended for it to go as far as possible starting from Arrow Lake, and after the road's end travellers would take a waterway to Fort Frances. Simon Dawson, on the other hand, thought the road could go from Dog Lake, to Thunder Bay, then using a series of dams, would allow even the larger boats to travel along the route of Dog River, Savanne River, Lac des Mille Lacs, via Pickerel Lake and Sturgeon Lake. The government, ignoring both plans, decided to build a road west of Lac des Mille Lacs, down the Seine River and finally into Rainy Lake. In 1859, Simon James Dawson was hired to begin the route, but the plan was held up due to poor economic conditions in the east. In 1867, after Confederation, there became an increased need for communication to the west. Construction of the Dawson Trail began in Prince Arthur's Landing in 1868. Construction was sped up in 1869 as the Riel Rebellion resulted in the need to transport troops. The first residents Tom Rawn and his wife, Mary, were the first residents of Atikokan of European descent, arriving by canoe in 1899. Rawn was lured to Atikokan by both the allure of gold in the area and because of plans by the Canadian Northern Railway to build a divisional point. Tom moved here because he heard there was need of shelter for the workers on the railway. Within a year of moving to Atikokan, Tom Rawn built the Pioneer Hotel, which had 18 rooms on its second story. In 1900, he was the first to strike a claim for iron ore in the Steep Rock area. In 1937, when Julian Cross discovered ore, it seemed Atikokan had potential for becoming a real town. The first real showing was the construction of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on Clark Street. Pitt Construction arrived later to construct roads. Their new way of making roads with machines amazed old-timers, who were used to making them using a pick, shovel and wheelbarrow. In 1950, the population had grown to 3,000 people. The first businesses in Atikokan could buy lots on Main Street for $10 an acre, but the prices soon skyrocketed to $100 per square foot. Even with high costs, stores, restaurants, banks and other establishments sprang up very quickly. The second bank to open was the Toronto-Dominion, the third, the Royal Bank of Canada is the only remaining bank. =Economic history= Fur trade era During the fur trade era, major fur transportation and trading routes used by the voyageurs passed through the waters and portages south of what would later be Atikokan.Fur Trade Canoe Routes of Canada/ Then and Now by Eric W. Morse Canada National and Historic Parks Branch, first printing 1969.The Voyageurs Highway Nute, Grace Lee. Minnesota Historical Society June, 1941 Standard Book Number 87351-006-2, Library of Congress Card Number 65-63529 Mining The potential for Steep Rock iron mine was revealed in 1897 by a non-resident geologist, William McInnis. Nothing was done until the winter of 1929‚Äì1930, when Julian Cross started interviewing iron and steel companies to try to unlock Steep Rock's potential. He finally convinced a company from Duluth, Minnesota, led by Robert Whiteside to take the job. In 1932, Dr. McKenzie and Tom Rawn staked out the entire South East bay of Steep Rock. They then found a spot, sunk a shaft and found it was rich with high grade hematite. The mine was quickly abandoned as they had trouble keeping water out of it. In 1940, Rawn sold 109 claims located west of Steep Rock to Midwest Iron Mining Corporation, and in March of that year, with 60 claims in his name, created Rawn Iron Mines Ltd. Four months later, on July 23, Rawn went out prospecting near Sapawe, and never returned. Parties searched for weeks, but his remains were never found. An aboriginal person discovered The Hammond Reef Mine in 1894 on the shore of Sawbill Lake, about 30 miles from Atikokan and showed it to John Hammond. A 10 stamp mill was built there in 1897 and 30 more stamps were added along with a hydro electric power house. It closed in 1899 because the results were disappointing. It then reopened in 1938. Forestry Timber was first noticed in the area as early as the 1870s. There were 31 surveys, with 21 being in Quetico Provincial Park and 10 being in the Clearwater and White Otter Castle area. The first attempt at harvesting timber in the area was in 1886. A sawmill was located on the height of land east of the French Portage. The strip between Lac La Croix and French Lake held great potential for logging of red and white pine, however, the barren shores around Saganaga show that there were many fires there, with approximately one sixth of the total area having been destroyed by fires. These forest fires were usually caused by the carelessness of troops that passed through the area years before on the Dawson Trail. H.C. Smith described the aftermath as \\"gigantic, half burned dead pines, which, towering in the air, add so much to the wildness and desolation of the scene\\" and \\"too often caused by the carelessness of explorers, prospectors, and hunters; The Indians are very careful to extinguish their fires during the dry season ... it is regretted that the fatal carelessness of the others cannot be checked.\\" He noted that the pine in the unburnt area was excellent. The best trees were said to be found on Trout, Darkey, and Brent Lakes, and the farthest Southeast end of Sturgeon Lake. =Recent history= Before the 2nd World War, mineral exploration in the area determined the presence of a large, high grade, iron ore deposit at the bottom of Steep Rock Lake. After the war a large water diversion project on the Seine River system was undertaken to enable the draining and dredging of Steep Rock lake in order to develop open-pit mining operations. Two large mines (Steep Rock Iron Mines and Caland Ore Co.) commenced operations in the late 1950s and continued for more than 30 years. When the mines closed in the early 1980s the town of Atikokan suffered economically but continued to survive on natural resource-based industries and tourism. In 1994, a 10 megawatt hydroelectric generating station (Valerie Falls Power) was developed on the Seine River diversion that had facilitated the opening of the mines 40 years earlier. From 2012 until 2014, the Atikokan Generating Station was converted from a coal-fueled to a hundred percent biomass-fueled plant. On February 1, 2013, Resolute Forest Products announced its plans to develop a new single-line random-length sawmill located in the Atikokan area, to be operational in 2014. The plan would create 90 direct jobs in Atikokan, with the additional benefit of supplying residual forest products to nearby pulp and paper mills. Climate Atikokan has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb) with four distinct seasons. Winters are long, cold and snowy while summers are warm. Precipitation is higher during the summer months and lower during the winter months. The highest temperature ever recorded in Atikokan was on July 11 & 12, 1936. This is the highest temperature ever recorded in the province of Ontario. Atikokan shares this record with Fort Frances. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 19 January 1943 and 15 February 1939. Demographics Economy Atikokan's main employers are the Atikokan Generating Station located 20 kilometres north of the community, the general hospital, Quetico Provincial Park and (collectively) its canoeing outfitters. Ontario Power Generation (OPG) has been one of Atikokan's main employers since the early 1980s. Constructed as a fossil-fuel burning facility, the Atikokan Generating Station burned coal shipped from Saskatchewan until 2012. It was then converted to a biomass plant, re-opening in 2014. Formerly, Fibretech, a fibre board processing plant in Atikokan closed, but was converted by Rentech Inc. to produce wood pellets to supply the newly converted biomass generating station. The Sapawe lumber mill located approximately 30 km from Atikokan reopened under management of Resolute Forest Products. The mill employs 108 workers. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited is planning a new gold mine and ore processing facility at its Hammond Reef site approximately 30 kilometers north of Atikokan. A revised environmental assessment was approved in 2018, building on work by previous owner Osisko Mining Corporation. Two main open pits are planned, and the adjoining plant will process 60,000 tonnes of ore per day. Agnico Eagle planned to assess the economic viability of the mine in 2019. Transportation The town is located off Highway 11, between Thunder Bay and Fort Frances. A CN Rail branch line runs along the south side of town. When Atikokan opened its first rail line, fares were $15. Atikokan Municipal Airport is located to the northwest of the town. Recreation Little Falls, a scenic water body within the town limits. Atikokan was selected as the host site for the 2003 edition of 'Raid the North Extreme', a televised 6 day multi-sport expedition race that visits wilderness locations across Canada. A key factor in the selection was the proximity to Quetico Provincial Park.Adventure Sports Magazine article \\"3rd Time's a Charm\\", Oct 2003 Quetico Park, located about 20 minutes south from the town of Atikokan, is a protected park with a route of lakes that was once traveled by the voyageurs. In 2018 the Town of Atikokan completed a project to connect and renovate the existing Atikokan Municipal Swimming Pool and Community Arena. The resulting modern facility was named the Atikokan Recreation & Wellness Centre which features a 14,580 square foot ice surface, 25 meter long pool, and multi-purpose room with adjoining kitchen available for private rentals. A large portion of recreation in Atikokan is at the town's Charleson Recreation Area. The area is named for the Canadian Charleson Iron Mine (a subsidiary of Charleson Iron Mining Co. of Minnesota), which was an iron ore mine operating there between 1958 and 1964. In 2005 the Charleson Recreation Area Committee formed to consolidate the various groups that use the area into a working committee that would develop the area for further recreation use by town residents and to enhance tourism potential. The committee continues to meet monthly to discuss and implement maintenance and improvements. Major Annual events in Atikokan include the Atikokan Bass Classic, a smallmouth bass tournament for teams of all kinds, the Poker Run and Annual Sno-Ho Rally held by the Atikokan Sno-Ho Snowmobiling Club and the Atikokan Mud Slingers 4x4 Races, where drivers can show off their trucks and skills to try and make it through a 300-foot mud track at Charleson Recreation Centre. Little Falls Recreation Centre is the home of Little Falls Golf Club and Little Falls Curling Club. Little Falls Golf Club is a 9-hole course that is double tee'd so players have the option of a 9 or 18 hole game. Little Falls Curling Club has a four sheet rink and hosts various bonspiels throughout the season. Just 9 km North of town, off of Highway 622, is Atikokan's Mount Fairweather Ski Hill. Mount Fairweather opened in 1967 for downhill skiing and snowboarding and continues to operate weekends and holidays from December to March (weather permitting). Mount Fairweather is a 106-meter drop with 12 name runs and operates both a rope tow lift and a T-bar lift. The chalet has helmets, boots, and skis available for use for free on a first come first served basis and also offers a canteen, washrooms, comfortable seating, and an outdoor sun deck. The Town of Atikokan also operates parks, playgrounds, three skating rinks, Bunnell Park Campground, the Pioneer Club (a drop in centre for seniors), toboggan hill (the previous location of the Mount Fairweather Ski Hill), and two baseball diamonds. Other clubs and activities in Atikokan include: Atikokan Minor Hockey Association, Atikokan Figure Skating Club, Beaten Path Nordic Trails, Mount Fairweather Alpine Skiing, Atikokan Sno-Ho Snowmobiling Club, Atikokan Bowling Association, Atikokan Public Library programs, Atikokan Native Friendship Centre (ANFC) and Quetico Provincial Park's Natural Heritage Education outreach programs.

Catmore is in the Berkshire Downs and the centre of the village is about above sea level. The 2001 Census recorded a population of only 28, making Catmore the least populous parish in Berkshire. In the 2011 Census the Office for National Statistics did not publish Catmore's population separately, but combined it with the neighbouring civil parish of Farnborough. But Catmore remains a separate civil parish, governed by its own parish meeting. Toponym The toponym \\"Catmore\\" is derived from the Old English for \\"wild-cat lake\\". The earliest known records of it are from AD 916 and 931 in the Cartularium Saxonicum, where it appears as Catmere, Catmeringa and Catm√¶ringa. In the same body of charters it is recorded again in AD 951 as Catmeres gem√¶re and Catbeorh. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Catmere. It evolved via Catmor in the 12th century, Cattermere in the 14th century, Catmard in the 15th century and Cattmere in the 17th century before reaching its present form. Manor In the time of Edward the Confessor (reigned 1042‚Äì66) a Saxon called Ezui held the manor. The manor was devastated in the Norman Conquest of England. The Domesday Book of 1086 records that what was left of the manor was held by the Norman baron Henry de Ferrers. Under the de Ferrers, Catmore became part of the Honour of Tutbury. Two centuries later Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby took part in a rebellion against Edward III. He was defeated at Chesterfield in 1266, imprisoned, and all his properties were confiscated by the Crown. In 1267 Edward III created Edmund Crouchback 1st Earl of Lancaster and granted him many of the de Ferrers estates, including those of the Honour of Tutbury. In 1399 Henry Bolingbroke, 2nd Duke of Lancaster became Henry IV and the House of Lancaster's estates were merged with those of the Crown. Catmore Farm House was the manor house. It was built in the 14th century, extended in the 15th century and again in the 16th century. It is built partly of brick and partly with a timber frame. It is a Grade II* listed building. Parish church St Margaret's parish church seen from the southeast The Church of England parish church of Saint Margaret is a Norman building from the latter half of the 12th century. Surviving original Norman work includes the north and south doorways and the font. The north doorway is now blocked and the font has been halved in height. The Knights Hospitaller held the advowson of St Margaret's by the time of Richard I (reigned 1189‚Äì99). They retained it until Henry VIII had the Order in England suppressed as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The nave was re-roofed in 1607. It has collar beams and wind braces and the date is carved on some of its timbers. By 1850 the building had been heavily restored and numerous Norman Revival features more ornate than the original work had been added. These include the east window of two round-headed lancets. There is no known record of the date of the work or the name of the architect. St Margaret's has one bell, cast by Henry Bagley. The Bagley family ran a bell foundry at Chacombe in Northamptonshire from 1605 until 1785, and for shorter periods also cast bells at Ecton in Northamptonshire and Witney in Oxfordshire. The church is a Grade I listed building. The Diocese of Oxford declared it redundant on 1 December 1973 and it vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 13 April 1999. It is open daily to visitors.

The district is divided into seven regions and, in addition to the general schools, it also operates 25 alternative schools and programs. The district has limited involvement with charter schools, and with the exception of providing some bus service, does not have any involvement with the private schools in the county. , the district is the fifth largest in the United States. History The Clark County School District began in 1956 when the Nevada Legislature mandated consolidation of all state school districts into 17 county school districts. This change meant that 14 separate school districts in Clark County would become part of the new Clark County School District. R. Guild Gray, superintendent at the time of the former Clark County School District No. 2, stated before a Board of School Trustees meeting on February 1, 1956 that the district would be larger than political subdivision in the state of Nevada. Gray believed the district would be larger than the state highway department with 1,300 employees and an annual budget of $7,250,000. Prior to 1956, each of the individual school districts in the county ran independent of each other, serving their respective cities and/or CDPs. When the district began in 1956, enrollment was just over 20,000 and Clark County had about 103,000 residents. The district would continue to face challenges in the coming years. Funding was its biggest challenge and had been for many years as it contended with explosive population growth. Growth Due to the large number of families moving into the Las Vegas area, the school district saw tremendous growth in student enrollment from the 1990s through 2007. Several bond issues were approved by the voters to help the district deal with this growth. This has resulted in many new schools being constructed. In some years, as many as 16 schools have opened. 320,400 students were enrolled during the 2015-2016 school year. This resulted in a very high demand for teachers to staff the classrooms. As a result, the district had to be creative in finding teachers to hire including recruiting of teachers from other states and other countries. In 2008, the statewide recession impacted the district. In 2012, voters failed to pass a school construction bond.Las Vegas Schools Goran from Growing Pains; by Adam Nagourney, New York Times, 7 October 2014 By 2014, the district was overwhelmed with new students as the economy recovered. Elementary schools were operating at 117.6% of planned capacity, with some schools at almost 200%. If a 2016 bond passes, officials hope new schools might be built by 2020. Performance Zones Beginning in the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, CCSD schools were reorganized into Performance Zones. As of the 2012‚Äì2013 school year, there were 13 geographic Performance Zones and one additional \\"Turnaround Schools\\" Performance Zone. Then in the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, there were 16 performance zones and assistant chiefs. Board of Trustees The school district is governed by a seven-member board of trustees elected from sections of the county. The superintendent of schools is Dr. Jes√∫s F. Jara who was appointed by the board in May 2018. School board members serve staggered four year terms.

Jara, 2018‚Äìpresent Transportation Since the district operates in a valley that has had air quality concerns, it currently operates most of its bus fleet with a fuel mixture containing 20% biodiesel. Due to its location in the Mojave desert, there is not much native material that can be used to create biodiesel fuel, so the district partnered with Biodiesel Industries to use the grease from area restaurants as an additive. Due to tourism, the area generates twice the national average of 3 gallons of grease per resident per year, making this a reliable feed source for biodiesel fuel. A student must register for school transportation when they register for school. A routing and scheduling program determines student transportation eligibility, assigns bus stops to eligible students, and notifies parents of the arrangements. It is not uncommon to expect older students, middle school and high school, to walk to and from school with distances up to three miles one way. For these students, air quality is a concern, as is heat. Temperatures at the beginning of the school year have been known to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It is suggested that students susceptible to health conditions related to heat and/or air-quality receive transportation to school. School buildings To reduce construction costs, most schools are being built to standard designs. These designs are adapted to the various sites to deal with different topographies and site sizes. While most elementary schools are single story buildings, the district has built some demonstration schools using two story plans so that smaller sites could be used allowing schools to be located in built up areas that do not have space for a traditional single story design. New school buildings after 2016 are using the two story designs. Many middle schools built during the 1960s and 1980s were built in circular designs. An example of this design is the one story, 9-month middle school, B. Mahlon Brown Junior High School in Henderson. These schools are usually with one directional hallways with several different \\"wings\\" with each hosting different subjects (i.e., 100's Language Arts, 200's Mathematics, 300's Science). During the 2010-2011 school, all schools converted to a 9-month school year due to budget shortfalls. Two campuses were converted back to year-round schedules beginning in the 2013-2014 school year. For the 2014-2015, 10 additional elementary school campuses were converted to the year-round schedule. This conversion was due entirely to overcrowding in these school buildings. The district also adds portable classrooms, which are modular buildings, at many schools to provide additional space for classes. The district had contracted with Edison Schools to operate several schools in an effort to improvement performance at those selected schools. The contract was terminated at the end of the 2013-2014 school year.

The Kennet and Avon Canal passes through the settlement with Aldermaston Lock near the centre while the Great Western Railway passes at the northern side where Aldermaston railway station is also located. The A340 road from Basingstoke passes through the village crossing the canal over a single file lift bridge and joins the A4 road which runs just north of the village. Kennet and Avon Canal / River Kennet The River Kennet was made navigable between Reading and Newbury and opened as the Kennet Navigation in 1723. The section running through Aldermaston Wharf is a canal navigation (from Frouds Lane Marina to Ufton Bridge) with the original River Kennet continuing approx 1/2 mile south of the canal. A wharf was constructed here (to the immediate east of the current lift bridge) and a trading community developed around it. In addition carpenters were required to service the locks and bridges. On completion of the Kennet and Avon Canal in 1810, local trade flourished even more with exports of timber products, malt and flour and imports of coal, groceries and manufactured goods. Canal trade continues at Aldermaston, primarily in leisure and tourism. A visitor and tea room is operated adjacent to a marina and boat hire business. When the Great Western Railway bought the canal in the 1850s a canal spur was constructed to the railway sidings to allow transfer of goods between canal and rail. Some of this has now been infilled.Aldermaston Lock information board Strange's Brewery was sited just south of the lock. In the late 18th century the brewery was owned by Francis Strange. The brewery was sold in 1952 and demolished. Housing developments The village has grown significantly through new housing developments over the last 25 years.

It was most active between 1999 and 2003, with reunion shows in 2005 and 2011. The band's core members were Andrew Broder, Martin Dosh, JG Everest and Bryan Olson. Style Lateduster was considered a Minneapolis \\"supergroup\\" because all four members were active in other successful bands and projects. They were also considered pioneering in their combination of live and electronic instrumentation, and their unconventional use of instruments such as turntables, looping pedals, and fender rhodes electric piano in the \\"post-rock\\" genre. Lateduster composed and performed instrumental mood music with a combination of live drums, guitars, turntables, fender rhodes, and keys run through a myriad of effects and live looping pedals. History Formed in Minneapolis in 1999, Lateduster was originally an instrumental sextet called Cropduster, with a symmetrical lineup of two guitars, two full drum kits and two DJs on four turntables. By the beginning of 2000, they had pared themselves down to a four-piece and began honing their sound into intricately arranged chamber music. In 2000, they recorded and released the first of three \\"handmade\\" EPs, independently released on their own Firetrunk Records label. In 2002, the best tracks from these early recordings were remastered and compiled on the first album Lateduster, which included two newly recorded songs. During the summer and fall of 2002, Lateduster completed the second album Five Easy Pieces, which was released on Firetrunk in 2002. Over the winter of 2002 to 2003, the band continued work on a new original soundtrack to the 1925 silent German Expressionist film Variet√©, which they had performed live at the Sound Unseen Film Festival in 2001. In 2003, Lateduster released the first DVD Plain Old Andrea, With A Gun, a collaborative project with Alaska-born choreographer Emily Johnson and her contemporary dance company Catalyst. After three years of performing and recording, and self-releasing 5 CDs and a DVD, Lateduster went on hiatus in Spring 2003 after Andrew Broder left the group and Bryan Olson moved to San Francisco. The various members then went on to be part of several other music projects, Fog, Hymie's Basement, Dosh, Andrew Bird, Neotropic, Sans Le Systeme, The Cloak Ox, Roma di Luna, Vicious Vicious and the Catalyst dance company. In 2003, Merck Records discovered Lateduster‚Äôs music, and decided to do the first major label release of their music in fall 2004 as Easy Pieces, a compilation of previously released material.

It was hosted by Terry Wogan and Gaby Roslin. The opening titles featured Roslin dressed up like a movie star driven to the studio in a limo and walking on red carpet to the door. Meanwhile, Wogan, carrying a briefcase, rode a rickety old bicycle across London and parked it outside the back door before quietly entering the building through said back door. The show was not well known for the guests who appeared on it, but rather for its many bloopers or double entendres (such as the instance when a number of various sized tennis balls were located around the studio to mark that year's Wimbledon tournament, and when introducing Pat Cash as a guest Roslin announced \\"And I'm sure you can guess from the size of those balls who's coming up next!\\") History =Early episodes= Intended to compete head-to-head with ITV1's This Morning, it was much hyped before its launch. The first show included Jonathan Ross as its main guest. The early episodes tried to capture the atmosphere of Wogan's BBC Radio 2 breakfast show. They even had a butler for Wogan, named Bulstrode, who in reality was one of the show's producers, usually there to serve him drinks (of the alcoholic kind). Roving reporter Danny McCall (a former Brookside actor) featured in a section called \\"Live Loot\\". From Monday to Thursday, he would go to a certain location in the UK and go to someone's house trying to get them to sell something to him. He had ¬£100 each day to bribe them with. The first person he visited on the first show was future regular Danny Baker. On Friday, the four items collected over the week would be given away to viewers. The show also featured a daily competition called \\"Kids in Headphones\\" in which a child of primary school age was shown with a pair of headphones on, singing along to a tune playing in the headphones. Viewers had to identify the tune to win a prize, with winners drawn at the end of the show. In later episodes, winners were put into a draw to win a television and a selection of DVDs, which gave rise to a crude running gag from Roslin about the size of the television. (\\"42 inches! Oh boy!\\") A regular on the show was Johnny Ball. At the beginning of each show from Monday to Thursday, he would take down three questions sent in by viewers and go off to research the answers. At the end of the show, he would come back and answer them. The third question always involved a rather more long-winded answer, explained using props. In the autumn of 2003, Ball took a holiday, and was replaced by Danny Baker. The following Monday, Johnny returned, but on Tuesday Baker returned to take up the role permanently. He proceeded to make the slot his own, even adding a catchphrase (\\"And now back to my friends!\\"). He would answer three or four questions, and try and perform a silly trick or other gimmick instead of the prop answer that Johnny Ball did. In later episodes, if he ran out of time, he would put back questions to be answered on future shows. However, there was one question he kept putting back, forgetting to answer it the next day, and on every subsequent day; \\"What is the world's most potent aphrodisiac?\\" One of the most memorable moments of the show's short history came when Baker placed a piece of soap in a microwave oven. Although an oven glove had been provided for protection, Baker failed to use it, resulting in him burning his hand when he took the plate out of the microwave to the great amusement of the audience, before removing the glass plate from the microwave which promptly shattered on the floor. The clip is a well-known out-take. =Rating failings= The show's ratings failed to match those of This Morning, despite several tweaks to the format. The show also drew criticism for seemingly having someone other than the two hosts of the title presenting the show every other week. Embarrassingly, the show's highest ratings of all came when Wogan was not present, and Jimmy Tarbuck was hosting alongside Roslin. When Roslin was unavailable, she was usually replaced by Jenny Powell. The show was called \\"Terry & Gaby\\", but because of this guest host situation, it also became: *Les & Gaby (Les Dennis) *Lionel & Gaby (Lionel Blair) *Jimmy & Gaby (Jimmy Tarbuck) *Terry & Jenny (Jenny Powell ‚Äì several times) *Terry & Linda (Linda Barker) *Donny & Gaby (Donny Osmond ‚Äì on Children in Need day) *Danny & Gaby (Danny Baker ‚Äì that week had no questions since Danny was too busy hosting to answer them) *Richard & Gaby (Richard Whiteley ‚Äì who kept getting the phone-in number wrong) The low ratings finally led to the show being axed after 200 episodes. Another notable point, however, is that the only time the show ever made the news, was after its 199th episode, on which Anne Robinson was a guest. This was supposedly her first television appearance since her much talked-about alleged facelift. Many observers noticed how different she looked from more recent programmes, and suggested that she'd had cosmetic surgery, which she denied. The next day, on the morning of the final episode, the story was all over the newspapers, some of them displaying \\"before and after\\" pictures of Anne on the front page, ensuring that at least the show didn't go out with a total whimper. The last episode of The Terry & Gaby Show was broadcast on 26 March 2004. Hailed as yet another \\"television flop\\" by Chris Evans' production company UMTV, Evans himself had the last word. The last show ended with a shot of Evans standing at a market stall (called \\"Chris's Fruit & Veg\\"), eating an apple, and then turning to the camera, saying \\"F*** it, we had a go, didn't we?\\". This is a joke on the fact that when the show launched, Evans said he would return to running a fruit & veg stall if the program failed.

It is situated just to the west of the village of Cold Ash and to the north of Thatcham in the West Berkshire district. Etymology The name Ashmore Green is probably of Saxon origin, meaning \\"Ash Tree covered Moor\\". The ash tree held significance for the Saxons due to the mythical Yggdrasil and the ash tree being sacred to the god W≈çden. Ash trees are common in Berkshire, as is reflected in other settlement names such as nearby Cold Ash, Ashampstead, as well as Ashford Hill and Ashmansworth in bordering Hampshire and Ashbury in Oxfordshire. History Ashmore Green is first mentioned in a deed in 1549 from John Winchcombe (Jack O'Newbury) to his son Henry. It is believed the Parliamentary Army stayed in fields near Ashmore Green during the Second Battle of Newbury in 1644. Ashmore Green was first noted on a map in 1761 spelled \\"Ashmoor Green\\". The area was largely moorland and heath until it began to be populated in the 1800s. In 1886 a baptist chapel was built in the centre of Ashmore Green, on Stoney Lane. It was closed in the 1960s. In 1894 Ashmore Green became part of the Cold Ash civil parish. The population of the Ashmore Green and Cold Ash area nearly doubled between 1900 and 1939, with major expansion after WW2. The local pub, The Sun in the Wood, built around 1900, closed in 2018.

Biography Jackson was born in Dingle, Liverpool, Lancashire. After leaving school he went to Walton Technical College to train as an electrician. Jackson was inspired by the skiffle sound of Lonnie Donegan, and then by Buddy Holly and other U.S. rock and rollers. He founded the skiffle group the Martinis. Nicknamed Black Jake, he joined the guitar duo the Searchers, which had been formed by John McNally and Mike Pender in 1959. The band soon expanded further to a quartet with the addition of the drummer Chris Curtis. Jackson built and learned to play a customised bass guitar. Learning his new job on the four-stringed instrument proved too difficult to permit him to continue singing lead so he made way for a new singer, Johnny Sandon, in 1960. They played in Liverpool's nightclubs and the beer bars of Hamburg, Germany. Brian Epstein considered signing them but he lost interest after seeing a drunken Jackson fall off the stage at the Cavern Club. Sandon moved on in February 1962 and the band were signed by Pye Records in mid-1963 when the Beatles' success created demand for Liverpudlian acts. Jackson was lead singer and played bass on the band's first two United Kingdom hits, \\"Sweets for My Sweet\\" and \\"Sugar and Spice\\", but was not the vocalist on the band's biggest hit \\"Needles and Pins\\". He was featured on both \\"Don't Throw Your Love Away\\" and \\"Love Potion No. 9\\". In 1964 the band toured the United States, including an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. Jackson was unhappy with the band's move away from rock and roll to a softer, more melodic sound and felt that he was not getting appropriate attention. He left the group in July 1964 in some acrimony and immediately moved to London and put together a new band, the Vibrations, which had an organ-based sound instead of the Searchers' guitar based one. After leaving the Searchers Jackson spent ¬£200 () on cosmetic surgery on his nose. He said at the time that he had had a lifelong complex about his nose to the extent that he could not mix socially. The surgery had followed psychiatric treatment. That same year he revealed that his 1960 marriage to Margaret Parry had been effectively over for two years. The Vibrations toured the UK with the Hollies, Marianne Faithfull and other acts. They released four singles on the Pye Records label but only the first had any success. In 1965 they changed their name to the Tony Jackson Group but the fourth single also failed and Pye dropped them. The band then signed to CBS without improvement and they found that there were few bookings in the UK so they toured southern Europe until even that withered. Disillusioned and out of options, Jackson left the music business. Jackson took a variety of jobs including Spanish night club manager, entertainments representative, furniture salesman, disc jockey and golf club manager. In the 1980s he tried to establish a Searchers revival band, but was unable to compete effectively with the other two that already existed. In 1991, Tony Jackson and the Vibrations reformed and an album of Jackson's material after the Searchers was released. The resuscitation of his career was short-lived, however, although he did appear four times with Mike Pender's Searchers between 1992 and 1995. That ended in 1996 when he was convicted of threatening a woman with an air pistol after an argument over a phone booth, and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. The arthritis in his hands became so bad that he had to abandon even recreational guitar playing. In 2002 he said, \\"The spirit's willing, but the body's knackered.\\" Death  Towards the end of his life he suffered from diabetes, heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver from a lifetime of heavy alcohol consumption. Jackson died on 18 August 2003 in a Nottingham hospital, he was 65.

Radical ions are encountered in organic chemistry as reactive intermediates and in mass spectrometry as gas phase ions. Positive radical ions are called radical cations whereas negative radical ions are called radical anions. Notation In organic chemistry, a radical ion is typically indicated by a superscript dot followed by the sign of the charge: M^{\\\\bullet +} and M^{\\\\bullet -}. In mass spectrometry, the sign is written first, followed by the superscripted dot: M^{+\\\\bullet} and M^{-\\\\bullet}.  Radical anions  Many aromatic compounds can undergo one-electron reduction by alkali metals. For example, the reaction of naphthalene with sodium in an aprotic solvent yields the naphthalene radical anion - sodium ion salt. In an ESR spectrum this compound shows up as a quintet of quintets (25 lines). In the presence of a proton source the radical anion is protonated and effectively hydrogenated as in the Birch reduction. The electron is transferred from the alkali metal ion to an unoccupied antibonding p-p –ø* orbital of the aromatic molecule. This transfer is usually only energetically favorable if the aprotic solvent efficiently solvates the alkali metal ion. Effectiveness for this is in the order diethyl ether < THF < 1,2-dimethoxyethane < HMPA. In principle any unsaturated molecule can form a radical anion, but the antibonding orbitals are only energetically accessible in more extensive conjugated systems. Ease of formation is in the order benzene < naphthalene < anthracene < pyrene, etc. On addition of a proton source, the structure of the resulting hydrogenated molecule is defined by the charge distribution of the radical anion. For instance, the anthracene radical anion forms mainly (but not exclusively) 9,10-dihydroanthracene. An example of a non-carbon radical anion is the superoxide anion, formed by transfer of one electron to an oxygen molecule. A very effective way to remove any traces of water from THF is by reflux with sodium wire in the presence of a small amount of benzophenone. Benzophenone is reduced to the ketyl radical anion by sodium which gives the THF solution an intense blue color. However, any trace of water in THF will further reduce the ketyl to the colourless alcohol. In this way, the color of the THF signals the dryness and the distilled THF contains less than 10 ppm of water.The Benzophenone Ketyl Still Pot - [www.rhodium.ws] This treatment also effectively removes any peroxides in the THF. Radical anions of this type are also involved in the Acyloin condensation. Cyclooctatetraene is reduced by elemental potassium all the way to the dianion because the 10 electron system is aromatic. Quinone is reduced to a semiquinone radical anion. Semidiones are derived from the reduction of dicarbonyl compounds.  Radical cations  Cationic radical species are much less stable. They appear prominently in the mass spectrometry. When a gas-phase molecule is subjected to electron ionization one electron is abstracted by an electron in the electron beam to create a radical cation M+.. This species represents the molecular ion or parent ion. A typical mass spectrum shows multiple signals because the molecular ion fragments into a complex mixture of ions and uncharged radical species. For example, the methanol radical cation fragments into a methenium cation CH3+ and a hydroxyl radical. In naphthalene the unfragmented radical cation is by far the most prominent peak in the mass spectrum. Secondary species are generated from proton gain (M+1) and proton loss (M-1). Some compounds containing the dioxygenyl cation can be prepared in bulk. =Organic conductors= Radical cations figure prominently in the chemistry and properties of conducting polymers. Such polymers are formed by the oxidation of heterocycles to give radical cations, which condense with the parent heterocycle. For example, polypyrrole is prepared by oxidation of pyrrole using ferric chloride in methanol: :n C4H4NH + 2 FeCl3 ‚Üí (C4H2NH)n \\\\+ 2 FeCl2 \\\\+ 2 HCl Once formed, these polymers become conductive upon oxidation.\\"Polypyrrole: a conducting polymer; its synthesis, properties and applications\\" Russ.

Biography Porƒôbski was born in Vilnius, in what was then Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire to an ethnic Polish family. He entered the Sea Cadets Corps in Petrograd in 1889 and graduated as a midshipman in 1892. Russian Navy career Porƒôbski attended mine warfare school on commissioning into the Imperial Russian Navy, and from 1895 to 1899 served aboard the on which he voyaged to the Mediterranean and then to the Far East with a visit to Nagasaki, Japan in 1896. He was promoted to lieutenant on April 13, 1897, after his return to Russia, and continued his studies in mine warfare. He was then assigned to the from 1899-1901. On December 1, 1901, he became the executive officer on the cruiser , whose construction he had been sent to oversee at the Schichau-Werke shipyards in Danzig, Germany. Assigned with Novik to the Russian Pacific Fleet, he was promoted to Captain Lieutenant on April 17, 1905. Novik played an active role in the Russo-Japanese War, especially at the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of Korsakov. After the end of the war, Porƒôbski was promoted to lieutenant commander on December 6, 1906 and was assigned to the Russian Baltic Fleet. He briefly commanded the new cruiser in 1909. From 1909-1913, Porƒôbski was captain of the minelayer Yenisei. He was promoted to the rank of captain on November 26, 1912. During the early stages of World War I, from 1913‚Äì1916, Porƒôbski was captain of the battleship with the Russian Black Sea Fleet and active in combat operations off of Bulgaria. Porƒôbski was promoted to rear admiral on April 19, 1916 and reassigned to command the cruiser squadron of the Black Sea Fleet. He went into the reserves from November 1916, but was recalled in early 1917, and was placed in command of the fortifications guarding the Gulf of Finland. He then served as head of the Maritime Department for the Northwestern Front. Polish Naval career With the Russian Revolution, Porƒôbski was released from service with the Russian Navy, and quickly moved to the newly independent Poland, arriving in Warsaw in November 1918. He founded the predecessor of the Maritime and Colonial League, an organization dedicated to the establishment of a Polish Navy and an overseas colonial presence. From 1919, he joined the Department of Maritime Affairs in the Ministry of National Defense, initiating the Polish Merchant Navy and the Polish Naval Academy in 1920, as well as the purchasing of the training sailing-ship \\"Lw√≥w\\", and the expansion of the military harbor in Gdynia. He also participated in the symbolic Poland's Wedding to the Sea performedby Polish president General J√≥zef Haller in early 1920. During the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War (February 1919 ‚Äì March 1921), Porƒôbski commanded naval units on the Vistula River. In 1921, he was granted the rank of vice admiral, and served as chairman of Maritime Affairs in the Department of the Navy. However, in 1925, he became embroiled in a political scandal involving the purchase of obsolete naval mines and was forced to resign his post. He retired from public service in 1927, and in 1928 criminal investigation against him by the Military Prosecutor's Office was discontinued. Porƒôbski died on January 21, 1933 in Warsaw after a long illness and was buried in the PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery.

He is best known as the drummer of the Dutch rock band, Golden Earring, a position he has held since 1970. Biography When Zuiderwijk was twelve he started playing the guitar, but switched to drums two years later. He has been a drummer in a number of bands; his high school band Ren√© & His Alligators, plus Hu & the Hilltops and Livin' Blues. He was asked to replace Golden Earring drummer Sieb Warner in 1970. Since then, apart from brief line-ups of five (with Robert Jan Stips and later Eelco Gelling), Golden Earring has consisted of the same four friends (Zuiderwijk, George Kooymans, Barry Hay and Rinus Gerritsen). Zuiderwijk is known to add a drum solo to each performance, which he concludes by launching himself over his drum kit. In September 1992, Zuiderwijk and his Golden Earring bandmates joined at least a thousand other drummers to play \\"Radar Love\\" on the Maasvlakte in Rotterdam. In 1999 he was invited by War Child to teach children in the Bosnian town Mostar, to play drums. In 2000 he went on tour with Percossa Percussion as members of Golden Earring took a year off. The theatre show \\"Alle gekheid met een stokje\\" consisted of sketches, drum escapades and stories.

He headed the United States Coast Survey and the Bureau of Weights and Measures. Biography Hassler was born in Aarau, Switzerland. He was employed on the trigonometrical survey of Switzerland before he emigrated to the United States in 1805. He was acting professor of mathematics at West Point from 1807 to 1810. He was employed by the federal government of the United States by 1811 in an effort to begin a Coast Survey.Philbrick, Nathaniel (2003) Sea of Glory: America's Voyage of Discovery: the U.S. Exploring Expedition Viking Penguin pg 22-23, 26-29 An Act of Congress on February 10, 1807 had appropriated $50,000 to pay for the beginning of the work. Afterward, he became the first superintendent of the United States Coast Survey in 1816. Two years later, the United States Congress passed the control of the Coast Survey to the army, principally, where it lingered until 1832. Hassler became the head of the Bureau of Weights and Measures in the Treasury Department where he carried out the early work of establishing the standards of weights and measures in the United States, with the involvement of fellow Swiss immigrant Albert Gallatin, who in 1827 brought from Europe a troy pound of brass which was made the standard of mass in 1828. Besides several textbooks of science, Hassler produced a publication in 1828 titled System of the Universe in two volumes. Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler memorial in Laurel Hill Cemetery Hassler undertook a complete investigation of the national standards in 1830. Perhaps the most meaningful national standard to be adopted in 1830 was the gallon at 231 cubic inches. In the United States, however, each State retained the rights to employ its own set of standards of weights and measures. Since 1830, a great deal of national legislation has been enacted, with much of it addressing the acceptance or the rejection of the metric system. The United States Bureau of Standards was created by an Act of Congress on March 3, 1901. As mentioned above, the Coast Survey languished for 14 years from 1818 to 1832. In 1823, 1824, and 1825, the Navy Department tried to establish a hydrographic office. Also, the Survey was a source of discussions in Congress, which finally passed a law on July 10, 1832 that resulted in the removal of the Survey away from the army and the navy. Hassler was appointed the superintendent of the Survey on August 9, 1832, and he served in that post until his death on November 20, 1843. The steamship owned by the Coast Survey was named the Hassler. \\"The unit of length to which all distances measured in the Coast Survey are referred is the French metre, an authentic copy of which is preserved in the archives of the Coast Survey Office. It is the property of the American Philosophical Society, to whom it was presented by Mr. Hassler, who had received it from Tralles, a member of the French Committee charged with the construction of the standard metre by comparison with the toise, which had served as unit of length in the measurement of the meridional arcs in France and Peru. It possesses all the authenticity of any original metre extant, bearing not only the stamp of the Committee, but also the original mark by which it was distiguished from the other bars during the operation of standarding. It is always designated as the Committee metre\\" (French : M√®tre des Archives). Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler's granddaughter, Mary Caroline Hassler Newcomb, married the much noted astronomer and mathematician Simon Newcomb. Simon and Mary Caroline Hassler Newcomb were themselves the grandparents of the also much noted professor of mathematics, Hassler Whitney. He died on November 20, 1843 and was interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

It allows code in a web browser to use Java functions running on a web server as if those functions were within the browser. The DWR project was started by Joe Walker in 2004, 1.0 released at August 29, 2005. Application *Code to allow JavaScript to retrieve data from a servlet-based web server using Ajax principles. *A JavaScript library that makes it easier for the web site developer to dynamically update the web page with the retrieved data. DWR takes a novel approach to Ajax by dynamically generating JavaScript code based on Java classes. Thus the web developer can use Java code from JavaScript as if it were local to the web browser; whereas in reality the Java code runs in the web server and has full access to web server resources. For security reasons the web developer must configure exactly which Java classes are safe to export (which is often called web.xml or dwr.xml). This method of remoting functions from Java to JavaScript gives DWR users a feel much like conventional RPC mechanisms like RMI or SOAP, with the benefit that it runs over the web without requiring web browser plug-ins. DWR does not consider the web browser / web server protocol to be important, and prefers to ensure that the programmer's interface is natural. The greatest challenge to this is to marry the asynchronous nature of Ajax with the synchronous nature of normal Java method calls. In the asynchronous model, result data is only available some time after the initial call is made. DWR solves this problem by allowing the web developer to specify a function to be called when the data is returned using an extra method parameter. This extra method is called CallBack Method. The value returned from the java function will be passed to the callback method. Here is a sample Callback: MJavaClassOnJs.getListProducts(selectedCategory,{ callback:function(returnedList){ dwr.util.addOptions(myComboId,returnedList,\\"productId\\",\\"productName\\") } }) The callback is that function inside the JSON object passed as an additional parameter to the remoted function. With version 2.0, DWR supports Comet (also called \\"Reverse Ajax) where Java code running on the server can deliberately send dedicated JavaScript to a browser.

The Hydropolis Underwater Hotel and Resort is a proposed underwater hotel in Dubai. Hydropolis should be the first multi-room underwater hotel in the world. It was planned in the Persian Gulf off Dubai through the mediation of the Austrian Citizen, DKfm. Hans Peter Pesenhofer following plans of Siemens IBC (Prof. Roland Dieterle) in cooperation with the German Designer Joachim Hauser (Bitterfeld) and with the approval of the DDIA. The hotel's original plan was to be located 20 meters underwater off the coast of Jumeriah beach. The hotel's plan is to cover an area of 260 hectares, which is equivalent in area to Hyde Park in London.[1] The construction cost for Hydropolis is approximately ‚Ç¨ 600 million Euro, which will make Hydropolis one of the most expensive hotels ever created.[2] The hotel design was created by Joachim Hauser and Professor Roland Dieterle, and is planned to be composed of three segments: a land station, a connecting train, and the underwater hotel. Joachim Hauser's and Prof. Roland Dieterle's architecture idea is to represent the connection between humans and water. The initial planned opening year was 2006, but due to financial reasons and disagreements with the DDIA (Dubai Development & Investment Authority), the project was canceled by the DDIA already on October 2004. Hydropolis Holdings LLC Dubai was holding the original intellectual property rights of Hydropolis.The original plan was to locate it underwater off the coast of Jumeirah Beach. The hotel's plan is to cover an area of .  Land station  The design of the land station is a wave-shaped 30,000 square meter building. The purpose of the land station is to provide a place for guests to board the soundless train to descend into the hotel. Secondary purposes for the land station include greeting guests, and use of the land station's facilities.tech-life.org The land station is planned to feature many facilities, including a marine research laboratory, a plastic surgery clinic, conference facilities, a restaurant, and a theater. The theater is intended to feature films about the evolution of life and about the history of underwater architecture. = Power and tunnel = The noiseless train will be located in a , transparent, double-track tunnel, made of plexiglass reinforced with concrete and steel. This train will be powered by an automated cable propulsion system. \\"Hydropolis Proposed Concept.\\" Spatial- Solutions. Web. 12 Nov. 2013. This automated cable propulsion system consists of a stationary motor and cables with the train cars fixed to the cables. The stationary motor for the train system will be located in the land station, and will be connected to cables running down the length of the tunnel. The train cars, fixed to these cables, will be moved up and down the tunnel solely from the power of the land motor. This system is advantageous because separating the motor from the train cars will decrease noise in the tunnel. This decreases noise because the motor is the main source of noise in this train system. With the motor separate from the train cars, noise in the cars and tunnel will be minimized. Another advantage of this system is that a separate motor results in less mechanical parts in the car, which also mean less repairs on the actual train cars. = Cars and logistic Systems = Rubber wheels were chosen over other types of wheel, such as steel, to minimize noise. Rubber wheels have a property of making little noise as they roll on surfaces such as plexiglass. The noiseless train will serve two purposes, transferring guests and supplying the underwater hotel. Supplies will be packed on land, and delivered efficiently to the hotel to minimize the space taken up by goods in the hotel. Cars transferring supplies will feature palettes, and cars transferring passengers will provide a view of the ocean. The guest transporting aspect of the train will have a maximum efficiency of 1000 people per hour.  Underwater hotel  The underwater hotel will be a jellyfish like structure. The underwater hotel will be located 20 meters underneath the surface of the ocean. To handle the underwater pressures, the hotel's main structure is a dome composed of plexiglass, reinforced with concrete and steel. The underwater hotel will be composed of 220 underwater suites with a cost of $5500 per night.Blain, Loz. \\"Dubai's Underwater Hotel Takes Shape.\\" Dubai's Underwater Hotel Takes Shape.

Bolting is the production of a flowering stem (or stems) on agricultural and horticultural crops before the crop is harvested, in a natural attempt to produce seeds and reproduce. These flowering stems are usually vigorous extensions of existing leaf-bearing stems, and in order to produce them, a plant diverts resources away from producing the edible parts such as leaves or roots, resulting in flavor and texture changes, withering, and in general, a poor quality harvest. Plants that have produced flowering stems in this way are said to have bolted. Crops inclined to bolt include lettuce, basil, beetroot, brassicas, spinach, celery, onion, and leek. Bolting is induced by plant hormones of the gibberellin family, and can occur as a result of several factors, including changes in day length, the prevalence of high temperatures at particular stages in a plant's growth cycle, and the existence of stresses such as insufficient water or minerals. These factors may interact in a complex way. Day length may affect the propensity to bolt in that some plants are \\"long day plants\\", some are \\"short day plants\\" and some are \\"day neutral\\" (see photoperiodism), so for example when a long day plant, such as spinach, experiences increasingly long days that reach a particular length, it will be inclined to bolt. Low or high temperatures can affect the propensity of some plants to bolt if they are experienced for sufficient periods at particular points in the life cycle of the plant; once these conditions have been met, plants that require such a trigger will subsequently bolt regardless of subsequent temperatures. Plants under stress may respond by bolting so that they can produce seeds before they die. Plant breeders have introduced cultivars of \\"bolt-proof\\" crops that are less prone to the condition.

Changes in taxonomic composition relate to physical and chemical changes that occur longitudinally. Zonation (from headwater to estuary) = Trout zone = This zone has a characteristic steep gradient, fast flowing water and cool temperature. The fast flow rate causes turbulence which keeps the water well oxygenated. Fish species found in this zone usually lay adhesive eggs that can stick to the substrate, this is to help prevent eggs being carried down stream by the water flow. Characteristic fish species are: * Brown trout (Salmo trutta) * Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) * Bullhead (Cottus gobio) * Loach (Barbatula barbatula) =Grayling zone= Similar in physical characteristics to the Trout zone, although the temperature is usually slightly higher. Fish species in this zone also lay adhesive eggs. Characteristic fish species include all of the above species, with the addition of; * Grayling (Thymallus thymallus) * Minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) * Chub (Leuciscus cephalus) * Dace (Leuciscus leuciscus) =Barbel zone= This zone is essentially lowland, but retains some characteristics of upland rivers. It has a gentle gradient with a moderate water flow and temperature. It also has a good oxygen content and a mixed substrate of silt and gravel in which plants can take root. Most of the fish species found in this zone lay their eggs in the vegetation on the river bed, this provides them with good protection and allows the eggs a good supply of oxygen given off from photosynthesis in the plants.

This zone has a silty substrate and is often turbid. Fish species found in this zone lay adhesive eggs in the weeds. Most upland fish species can not survive in this zone.

She was one of the last imperial spouses in the Roman west, during the Fall of the Western Roman Empire during Late Antiquity. In 455 she was taken prisoner in the Sack of Rome by Gaiseric, King of the Vandals, together with her mother Licinia Eudoxia and her elder sister Eudocia, spending several years in the Vandal Kingdom while Gaiseric promoted Olybrius's claim to the empire. Placidia and her mother were ransomed from Africa by Leo I, the eastern emperor, in . Placidia spent much of her life at Constantinople, where her daughter Anicia Juliana was born in and where she remained during her husband's brief reign as augustus in Rome. She was a nobilissma femina, known to have been living in Constantinople in 478 and 484. Family Placidia was the second daughter of Valentinian III and Licinia Eudoxia, younger sister of Eudocia, who became the wife of Huneric, son of Gaiseric, king of the Vandals. Both were named for their grandmothers: Eudocia for the maternal, Aelia Eudocia, and Placidia for the paternal, Galla Placidia.Stewart I. Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta: A biographical essay (Chicago: University Press, 1968), p. 247 Placidia is estimated to have been born between 439 and 443.Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, vol. 2 Ancestry Marriage In 454 or 455, Placidia married Anicius Olybrius, a member of the Anicii family, a prominent family with known members active in both Italia and Gaul. The exact relation of Olybrius to other members of the family is not known as his parents are not named in primary sources. Several theories exist as to their identity.T.S. Mommaerts and D.H. Kelley, \\"The Anicii of Gaul and Rome,\\" in John Drinkwater and Hugh Elton, Fifth-century Gaul: A Crisis of Identity? (Cambridge: University Press, 1992), p. 119 Originally Emperor Valentinian intended to marry Placidia to a young man named Majorian (the future emperor), whom Oost describes as having \\"distinguished himself in a subaltern capacity fighting in Gaul against the Franks under A√´tius' own command.\\"Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta, pp. 286f Doing so, according to Roman customs, would instantly link Majorian to the Imperial family and put him in line to succeed Valentinian. Once Flavius Aetius learned of this plan, he rusticated Majorian to his estates at some date before 451, and he was recalled to Rome only after Aetius' death. Aetius also attempted to consolidate his position \\"by compelling the Emperor to swear to friendship with him and to agree to betroth Placidia to his own younger son Gaudentius.\\"Oost, Galla Placidia Augusta, p. 287 Mommaerts and Kelley have proposed a theory that Petronius Maximus, the successor of Valentinian III on the Western Roman throne in 455, was behind the marriage of Placidia to Olybrius. They argue that Olybrius was likely a son of Petronius Maximus himself, reasoning that Petronius, once on the throne, would be unlikely to promote distant relatives as potential successors. According to Hydatius, Petronius arranged the marriage of his eldest stepdaughter Eudocia to Palladius, his eldest son and Caesar. They suggest that he followed suit in arranging the marriage of Placidia to one of his own younger sons, thus making the marriage of Placidia and Olybrius the third marriage between a member of the Theodosian dynasty and a member of the extended Anicii family within the same year. Vandal captivity According to the chronicler Malchus, \\"Around this time, the empress Eudoxia, the widow of the emperor Valentinian and the daughter of the emperor Theodosius and Eudocia, remained unhappily at Rome and, enraged at the tyrant Maximus because of the murder of her spouse, she summoned the Vandal Gaiseric, king of Africa, against Maximus, who was ruling Rome. He came suddenly to Rome with his forces and captured the city, and having destroyed Maximus and all his forces, he took everything from the palace, even the bronze statues. He even led away as captives surviving senators, accompanied by their wives; along with them he also carried off to Carthage in Africa the empress Eudoxia, who had summoned him; her daughter Placidia, the wife of the patrician Olybrius, who then was staying at Constantinople; and even the maiden Eudocia. After he had returned, Gaiseric gave the younger Eudocia, a maiden, the daughter of the empress Eudoxia, to his son Huneric in marriage, and he held them both, the mother and the daughter, in great honor\\"(Chron. 366).Ralph W. Mathisen, Petronius Maximus (17 March 455 - 22 May 455) Eudoxia was presumably following the example of her sister-in-law Justa Grata Honoria who had summoned Attila the Hun for help against an unwanted marriage. According to the chronicler Prosper of Aquitaine, Maximus was in Rome when the Vandals arrived. He gave anyone who could permission to flee the city. He attempted to flee himself but was assassinated by the imperial slaves. He had reigned for seventy-seven days. His body was thrown into the Tiber and never recovered. Victor of Tonnena agrees, adding that Pope Leo I negotiated with Gaiseric for the security of the city's population. Hydatius attributes the assassination to revolting troops of the Roman army, enraged at Maximus' attempted flight. The Chronica Gallica of 511 attributes the assassination to a rioting crowd. Jordanes identifies a single assassin as \\"Ursus, a Roman soldier\\". Sidonius Apollinaris makes a cryptic comment about a Burgundian whose \\"traitorous leadership\\" led the crowd to panic and to the slaughter of the Emperor. His identity is unknown, presumably a general who failed to face the Vandals for one reason or another. Later historians have suggested two high-ranking Burgundians as possible candidates, Gondioc and his brother Chilperic. Both joined Theodoric II in invading Hispania later in 455. Olybrius was in Constantinople at the time of the siege of Rome as noted by John Malalas. He was separated from his wife for the duration of her captivity. He reportedly visited Daniel the Stylite who predicted that Eudoxia and Placidia would return.Ralph W. Mathisen, Anicius Olybrius (April/May 472 -- [11 July 472] \\\\-- 22 October or 2 November 472) Empress Priscus and John of Antioch report that Gaiseric entertained the idea of placing Olybrius on the throne of the Western Roman Empire, at least as early as the death of Majorian in 461. Due to his marriage to Placidia, Olybrius could be considered both an heir to the Theodosian dynasty and a member of the Vandal royal family through marriage. In 465, Libius Severus died and Gaiseric again promoted Olybrius as his candidate for the Western throne. Procopius reported that Olybrius maintained a decent relationship with his Vandal supporter. According to the accounts of Priscus, Procopius, John Malalas, Theodorus Lector, Evagrius Scholasticus, Theophanes the Confessor, Joannes Zonaras and Cedrenus, Placidia can be estimated to have stayed a prisoner in Carthage for six to seven years. In 461 or 462, Leo I, Eastern Roman Emperor, paid a large ransom for Eudoxia and Placidia. Placidia seems to have spent the rest of her life in Constantinople. In 472, the Western Roman Emperor Anthemius was involved in a civil war with his magister militum and son-in-law Ricimer. According to John Malalas, Leo decided to intervene and send Olybrius to quell the hostilities. Olybrius had also been instructed to offer a peace treaty to Geiseric on his behalf. However, Leo had also sent Modestus, another messenger, to Anthemius asking him to arrange the deaths of both Ricimer and Olybrius. But Ricimer had placed Goths loyal to him at the ports of Rome and Ostia Antica and they intercepted Modestus, delivering him and his message to Ricimer himself. Ricimer revealed the contents of the message to Olybrius and the two men formed a new alliance against their former masters.Ralph W. Mathisen, \\"Anthemius (12 April 467 - 11 July 472 A.D.)\\" In April or May 472, Olybrius was proclaimed emperor and the civil war proper began. John of Antioch claims that Anthemius was supported by most of the Romans while Ricimer, by the barbarian mercenaries. Odoacer, leader of the foederati, joined the cause of Ricimer, and also Gundobad, the nephew of Ricimer. According to John Malalas and John of Antioch, Gundobad managed to slay Anthemius and end the conflict. They claim that Anthemius had been abandoned by his last followers and sought refuge in a church, but Gundobad killed him anyway. But the two chroniclers differ on the location of the event. Malalas places it in the Old St Peter's Basilica while the Antiochean places it in Santa Maria in Trastevere. However Cassiodorus, Marcellinus Comes and Procopius report that Anthemius was killed by Ricimer himself. The Chronica Gallica of 511 mentions both theories, uncertain of which of the two men had done the deed. With Anthemius dead, Olybrius became the sole Western Roman Emperor by default. Placidia became his Empress without actually leaving Constantinople, remaining there with their daughter. On 18 August, 472, Ricimer died of a \\"malignant fever\\". Paul the Deacon reports that Olybrius next appointed Gundobad as his Patrician. On 22 October or 2 November, 472, Olybrius himself died. John of Antioch attributes his death to dropsy. Cassiodorus and Magnus Felix Ennodius report the death without noting a cause. All report on how brief the reign was. In 478, Malchus reported that \\"ambassadors came to Byzantium from Carthage, under the leadership of Alexander, the guardian of Olybrius' wife [sc. Placidia]. He formerly had been sent there by Zeno with the agreement of Placidia herself. The ambassadors said that Huneric had honestly set himself up as a friend of the emperor, and so loved all things Roman that he renounced everything that he had formerly claimed from the public revenues and also the other moneys that Leo had earlier seized from his wife [sc. Eudocia]... He gave thanks that the emperor had honored the wife of Olybrius...\\"Malchus, fr. 13; translated by C.D. Gordon, Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), p. 125) Placidia is last mentioned c. 484. Placidia was probably the last Western Roman Empress whose name is still known. Glycerius and Romulus Augustus are not known to have been married. Julius Nepos had married a niece of Verina and Leo I, whose name is not mentioned in surviving records.Ralph W. Mathisen, Julius Nepos (19/24 June 474 - [28 August 475] \\\\- 25 April/9 May/22 June 480)  Children  Her only known daughter was Anicia Juliana, born c. 462, who spent her life at the pre- Justinian court of Constantinople. Juliana was considered \\"both the most aristocratic and the wealthiest inhabitant\\".Maas, Michael. The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Justinian. Cambridge University Press, 2005. Page 439.

Guilhem, it. Guglielmo) (c. 1115 - 1191) also known regnally as William III of Montferrat while also referred to as William the Old or William the Elder, in order to distinguish him from his eldest son, William Longsword, was seventh Marquis of Montferrat from c. 1136 to his death in 1191. William was the only son of Marquis Renier I and his wife Gisela, a daughter of William I, Count of Burgundy and widow of Count Humbert II of Savoy. It seems likely, given that he was still fit enough to participate in battle in 1187, that William was one of his parents' youngest children. He was described by Acerbo Morena as of medium height and compact build, with a round, somewhat ruddy face and hair so fair as to be almost white. He was eloquent, intelligent and good-humoured, generous but not extravagant. Dynastically, he was extremely well-connected: a nephew of Pope Callixtus II, a half-brother of Amadeus III of Savoy, a brother-in-law of Louis VI of France (through his half-sister Adelasia of Moriana), and cousin of Alfonso VII of Castile.  Dynastic marriage  William married Judith or Ita von Babenberg, daughter of Leopold III of Austria and Agnes of Germany, sometime before March 28, 1133. Judith was probably about 15 at the time. None of their surviving children seem to have been born before 1140 (there may have been older ones who died in infancy), and the youngest son was born in 1162. She died after 1168. They had five sons, four of whom became prominent in the affairs of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and of Byzantium: *William Longsword, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon, father of Baldwin V of Jerusalem *Conrad, King of Jerusalem *Boniface, his successor to Montferrat and founder of the Kingdom of Thessalonica *Frederick, who entered the Church and became Bishop of Alba (dates uncertain). *Renier, married into the Byzantine imperial family and three daughters: *Agnes, who married Count Guido Guerra III Guidi conte di Modigliana The marriage was annulled on grounds of childlessness before 1180, when Guido remarried, and Agnes entered the convent of Santa Maria di Rocca delle Donne. *Adelasia or Azala√Øs (d. 1232), who married Manfred II, Marquis of Saluzzo, c. 1182, and was regent for her grandson Manfred III. *An unidentified daughter, who married Albert, Marquis of Malaspina. The vida of the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras claims that there was another daughter, Beatrice, who m. Henry I del Carretto, Marquis of Savona, and that she is the Bel Cavalher (Fair Knight) of Vaqueiras's songs. However, the lyrics of Vaqueiras's songs (as opposed to the later vida) describe Beatrice as Boniface's daughter, and thus William's granddaughter. Otto (Oddone of Montferrat, d. 1251), who became Bishop of Porto, and Cardinal in 1227, has sometimes been identified as a son of William V, and confused with Frederick. However, his dates make it more likely that he was a son of William VI of Montferrat, whether legitimate or not is uncertain. William and Judith's powerful dynastic connections created difficulties in finding suitable wives for his sons, and too many potential spouses were related within prohibited degrees. In 1167, he unsuccessfully tried to negotiate marriages for his eldest sons to daughters of Henry II, King of England - but the girls were very young at the time and were related through Judith's descent from William V of Aquitaine. He then applied for sisters of William I, King of Scotland, who were not related, but were already married. Alliances with the Western and Eastern Empires William took part in the Second Crusade, alongside his half-brother Amadeus of Savoy (who died during the campaign), his nephew Louis VII of France, his brother-in-law Count Guido of Biandrate, and his wife's German and Austrian relatives. As supporters of the imperial party (later known as the Ghibellines), he and his sons fought with the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (Judith's nephew) in his lengthy struggle against the Lombard League. Following Barbarossa's capitulation with the Peace of Venice in 1177, William was left to deal with the rebellious towns in the area alone. Meanwhile, the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos sought support for his own politics in Italy. William broke with Barbarossa and formed an alliance with Manuel. His eldest surviving son, Conrad, was taken prisoner by Barbarossa's Chancellor, Archbishop Christian of Mainz, but then captured the chancellor in battle at Camerino. In 1179 Manuel suggested a marriage between his daughter Maria, second in line to the throne, and one of William's sons. As Conrad and Boniface were already married, the youngest son, Renier, was married off to the princess, who was ten years his senior. Renier and Maria were later killed during the usurpation of Andronikos, and the family rebuilt ties with Barbarossa. Crusade in Outremer In 1183, with the accession of his grandson Baldwin V, a minor, as co-King of Jerusalem, William, then probably in his late sixties, left the government of Montferrat to Conrad and Boniface, and returned to the east. He was granted the castle of St. Elias (present-day Taybeh). He fought in the Battle of Hattin in 1187, where he was captured by Saladin's forces. In the meantime, his second son, Conrad, had arrived at Tyre from Constantinople. Conrad was given the command of the defences. During the siege of Tyre in November that year, he is said to have refused to surrender as much as a stone of its walls to liberate his father, even threatening to shoot him with a crossbow himself when Saladin had him presented as a hostage. Eventually, Saladin withdrew his army from Tyre. In 1188, William was released unharmed at Tortosa, and seems to have ended his days in Tyre, with his son. He probably died in the summer of 1191: Conrad last describes himself as \\"marchionis Montisferrati filius\\" in a charter of May that year. Popular culture William de Montferrat is an assassination target in the video game Assassin's Creed (2007). In the game, de Montferrat is Liege Lord of Acre under King Richard and is portrayed as middle aged, rather than in his early eighties. References Sources xxi * Haberstumpf, Walter.

Lukacs attended a classical gymnasium, had an English language tutor, and spent two summers at a private school in England. He studied history at the University of Budapest.John Lukacs. Surrounded by Books. Chronicles: A magazine of American Culture, November 2, 2017. Archived During the Second World War, when German troops occupied Hungary in 1944, Lukacs was forced to serve in a Hungarian labour battalion for Jews. By the end of 1944, he had deserted from the battalion and was hiding in a cellar until the end of the war, evading deportation to death camps and surviving the siege of Budapest. According to his son, Lukacs never saw his parents again. After the war, Lukacs worked as the Secretary of the Hungarian-American Society.James W. Tuttleton. The Faith of a Catholic Intellectual.

Danubian Press, 1974. Note: Formed in 1921 at Budapest, the Hungarian-American Society aimed at promoting good relations between the two nations. In 1946, he received his doctorate in Budapest. On 22 July 1946, as it was becoming clear that Hungary would become a Communist state, he fled to the United States. He found employment as a part-time assistant lecturer at Columbia University in New York City. He then relocated to Philadelphia, where he worked as history professor at Chestnut Hill College (a women's college until 2003). He was a Visiting Professor at Princeton and Columbia Universities. He was a president of the American Catholic Historical Association and member of the Royal Historical Society.  Views  Being a proponent of a liberal democracy and an anti-Communist, Lukacs nevertheless wrote in the early 1950s several articles in Commonweal criticizing the approach taken by Senator Joseph McCarthy, whom he described as a vulgar demagogue. Lukacs saw populism as the primary threat to modern civilization. By his own description, he considered himself a reactionary. He identified populism as the essence of both National Socialism and Communism, denying the existence of generic fascism and asserted that the differences between the political regimes of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were greater than their similarities.Lukacs, John The Hitler of History New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 page 118 A major theme in Lukacs's writing is his agreement with the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville that aristocratic elites have been replaced by democratic elites, which obtain power via an appeal to the masses. In his 2002 book, At the End of an Age, Lukacs argued that the modern/bourgeois age, which began around the time of the Renaissance, is coming to an end.Lukacs, John At the End of An Age Yale University Press, 2003 page 3 The rise of populism and the decline of elitism is the theme of his experimental work, A Thread of Years (1998), a series of vignettes set in each year of the 20th century from 1900 to 1998, tracing the abandonment of gentlemanly conduct and the rise of vulgarity in American culture. Lukacs defends traditional Western civilization against what he sees as the leveling and debasing effects of mass culture. An Anglophile, Lukacs gives the highest historical importance to Winston Churchill. He considered Churchill to be the greatest statesman of the 20th century, the savior not only of Great Britain but also of Western civilization itself. A recurring theme in his writing is the duel between Churchill and Adolf Hitler for mastery of the world. Their moral struggle, which Lukacs sees as a conflict between the archetypical reactionary and the archetypical revolutionary, is the major theme of The Last European War (1976), The Duel (1991), Five Days in London (1999) and 2008's Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat, a book which features Churchill's first major speech as Prime Minister. Lukacs argues that Great Britain (and by extension the British Empire) could not defeat Germany by itself and that winning required the entry of the United States and the Soviet Union. He points out that by inspiring the British people to resist German air attacks and to \\"never surrender\\" during the Battle of Britain in 1940, Churchill laid the groundwork for the subsequent victory of the Allies. Lukacs had strong isolationist beliefs and unusually for an anti-Communist √©migr√© also had \\"surprisingly critical views of the Cold War from a unique conservative perspective\\".Stromberg, Joseph (2005-02-07) An Anti-Imperialist's Reading List: Part Two, Antiwar.com Lukacs claimed that the Soviet Union was a feeble power on the verge of collapse and contended that the Cold War was an unnecessary waste of American treasure and life. Likewise, Lukacs was critical of American intervention abroadGerald J. Russello. What You Need to Know About John Lukacs, Front Porch Republic, October 14, 2013. and also condemned the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In his book George F. Kennan and the Origins of Containment, 1944-1946 (1997), a collection of letters exchanged between Lukacs and his close friend George F. Kennan during 1994‚Äì1995, Lukacs and Kennan criticized the claim of the New Left that the Cold War was caused by the United States. However, Lukacs argued that while Joseph Stalin was largely responsible for the beginning of the Cold War, the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower missed a chance for ending the Cold War in 1953 after Stalin's death, which kept it on for many more decades. = The Hitler of History = From around 1977 onwards, Lukacs became one of the leading critics of the British author David Irving, whom Lukacs accused of engaging in unscholarly practices and having neo-Nazi sympathies. In a review of Irving's Hitler's War in 1977, Lukacs commented that as a \\"right-wing revisionist\\" who had admired some of Irving's early works, he initially had high hopes for Hitler's War, but he found the book to be \\"appalling\\".Lukacs, John \\"Caveat Lector\\" pages 946-950 from National Review, Volume XXIX, Issue # 32, August 19, 1977, pages 946-947 Lukacs commented that Irving had uncritically used personal remembrances by those who knew Hitler to present him in the most favorable light possible.Lukacs, John \\"Caveat Lector\\" pages 946-950 from National Review, Volume XXIX, Issue # 32, August 19, 1977, page 946 In his review, Lukacs argued that although World War II ended with Eastern Europe being left under Soviet domination, a victory that left only half of Europe to Stalin was much better than a defeat that left all of Europe to Hitler.Lukacs, John \\"Caveat Lector\\" pages 946-950 from National Review, Volume XXIX, Issue # 32, August 19, 1977, pages 949-950 Lukacs‚Äôs book The Hitler of History (1997), a prosopography of the historians who have written biographies of Hitler, is in part a critique of Irving‚Äôs work. Lukacs considered Irving to be sympathetic to the Nazis. In turn, Irving has engaged in what many consider to be antisemitic and racist attacks against Lukacs. Because Lukacs' mother was Jewish, Irving disparagingly refers to him as \\"a Jewish historian\\". In letters of 25 October and 28 October 1997, Irving threatened to sue Lukacs for libel if he published his book (The Hitler of History) without removing certain passages which were highly critical of Irving's work.Evans, Richard J (2001). Lying About Hitler. p. 27. The American edition of The Hitler of History was published in 1997 with the passages included, but because of Irving's legal threats no British edition of The Hitler of History was published until 2001. As a result of Irving's threat of legal action under British libel laws, when the British edition was finally published the passages containing the criticism of Irving's historical methods were expunged by the publisher. In The Hitler of History, inspired by the example of Pieter Geyl's book, Napoleon For and Against, Lukacs examines the state of Hitler scholarship and offers his own observations about Hitler. In Lukacs's view, Hitler was a racist, nationalist, revolutionary and populist.Lukacs, John The Hitler of History, New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 pages 218-219 Lukacs criticizes Marxist and liberal historians who claim that the German working class were strongly anti-Nazi and argues that the exact opposite was the case. Each chapter of The Hitler of History is devoted to a particular topic, such as whether Hitler was a reactionary or revolutionary; a nationalist or a racist; and he examines the roots of Hitler's ideology. Lukacs denies that Hitler developed a belief in racial purity in Vienna under the Habsburg monarchy. Instead, Lukacs dates Hitler's turn to antisemitism to 1919 in Munich, in particular to the events surrounding the Bavarian Soviet Republic and its defeat by the right-wing Freikorps. Much influenced by Rainer Zitelmann's work, Lukacs describes Hitler as a self-conscious, modernizing revolutionary. Citing the critique of National Socialism developed by German conservative historians such as Hans Rothfels and Gerhard Ritter, Lukacs describes the Nazi movement as the culmination of the dark forces which lurk within modern civilization. In Lukacs‚Äôs view, Operation Barbarossa was not inspired by anti-Communism or any long-term plan to conquer the Soviet Union as suggested by historians such as Andreas Hillgruber, who claims that Hitler had a stufenplan (stage-by-stage plan), but it was rather an ad hoc reaction forced on Hitler in 1940‚Äì1941 by Britain‚Äôs refusal to surrender.Lukacs, John The Hitler of History New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 pages 133 & 149-150 Lukacs argues that the reason Hitler gave for the invasion of Russia was the real one. He claimed that Britain would not surrender because Winston Churchill held out the hope that the Soviet Union might enter the war on the Allied side and so Germany had to eliminate that hope. However, other historians have argued that the reason was just a pretext.Lukacs, John The Hitler of History New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 pages 149-151 For Lukacs, Operation Barbarossa was as much anti- British as it was anti-Soviet. He argues that Hitler's statement in August 1939 to the League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig, the Swiss diplomat Carl Jacob Burckhardt (\\"Everything I undertake is directed against Russia\\"), which Hillgruber cited as evidence of Hitler's anti-Soviet intentions, was part of an effort to intimidate Britain and France into abandoning Poland.Lukacs (1997), p.147. Lukacs takes issue with Hillgruber's claim that the war against Britain was of \\"secondary\\" importance to Hitler compared to the war against the Soviet Union.Lukacs (1997), p. 149. Lukacs has also been one of the leading critics of Viktor Suvorov, who has argued that Barbarossa was a \\"preventative war\\" forced upon Germany by Stalin, who according to Suvorov was planning to attack Germany later in the summer of 1941. = Later work = In his book Democracy and Populism: Fear and Hatred (2005), Lukacs writes about the current state of American democracy. He warns that the populism he perceives as ascendant in the United States renders it vulnerable to demagoguery. He claims that a transformation from liberal democracy to populism can be seen in the replacement of knowledge and history with propaganda and infotainment. In the same book, Lukacs criticizes legalized abortion, pornography, cloning and sexual permissiveness as marking what he sees as the increasing decadence, depravity, corruption and amorality of modern American society. June 1941: Hitler and Stalin (2006) is a book-length study of the two leaders with a focus on the events leading up to Operation Barbarossa. George Kennan: A Study of Character (2007) is a biography of Lukacs' friend George F. Kennan, based on privileged access to Kennan's private papers. Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat (2008) is a continuation of his work on what Lukacs considered the greatness of Churchill. Last Rites (2009) continues the \\"auto-history\\" he published in Confessions of an Original Sinner (1990). The Future of History was published on 26 April 2011. In A Short History of the Twentieth Century (2013), Lukacs attempts to challenge the idea (common to both professional historians and experts in international relations) that the Cold War presented a bipolar system or a major strategic rivalry or conflict, instead arguing that the 20th century was one of American dominance. Citing the biographical example of Hitler as well as left- and right-wing populism in the United States, Lukacs also argues in the book that populism was the most destructive force of the 20th century and attempts to disentangle the concept of populism from its frequent (though, Lukacs argues, inaccurate) conflation with the inherent stances of left-wing politics. Private life In 1953, he married Helen Elizabeth Schofield, the daughter of a Philadelphia lawyer; the couple had two children. His wife died in 1971. He married his second wife, Stephanie Harvey, in 1974.2005 Schuylkill Oral History Project interview: Dr. John Lukacs, Transcribed by Nancy Loane, Edited by John Lukacs on October 25, 2017. Archived From this marriage, Lukacs had step-children; his second wife died in 2003. He married for a third time, but his marriage to Pamela Hall ended in divorce. After his retirement in 1994, Lukacs concentrated on writing. He resided in Schuylkill Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania and retained nearly 18,000 books in his home library. Lukacs died from congestive heart failure on May 6, 2019 at his home in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.

After European settlements had been made to the south and north, the colonial Province of Maryland was granted by King Charles I to Sir George Calvert (1579‚Äì1632), his former Secretary of State in 1632, for settlement beginning in March 1634. It was notable for having been established with religious freedom for Roman Catholics, since Calvert had publicly converted to that faith.Greenwell, Megan. \\"Religious Freedom Byway Would Recognize Maryland's Historic Role\\", Washington Post, August 21, 2008.Calvert, Cecilius. \\"Instructions to the Colonists by Lord Baltimore, (1633)\\", Narratives of Early Maryland, 1633‚Äì1684 (Clayton Coleman Hall, ed.), (NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1910), 11‚Äì23. Like other colonies and settlements of the Chesapeake Bay region, its economy was soon based on tobacco as a commodity crop, highly prized among the English, cultivated primarily by African slave labor, although many young people came from Britain sent as indentured servants or criminal prisoners in the early years. In 1781, during the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783), Maryland became the seventh state of the United States to ratify the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. They were drawn up by a committee of the Second Continental Congress (1775‚Äì1781), which began shortly after the adoption of a Declaration of Independence in July 1776, through to 1778. Later that year, these Articles were recommended to the newly independent sovereign states via their legislatures for the required unanimous ratification. This long process was held up for three years by objections from smaller states led by Maryland until certain issues and principles over the western lands beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River. These objections were resolved with the larger states agreeing to cede their various western claims to the authority of the new Congress of the Confederation, representing all the states, to be held in common for the laying out and erection of new states out of the jointly held Federal territories. Maryland then finally agreed to join the new American confederation by being one of the last of the former colonies ratifying the long proposed Articles in 1781, when they took effect. Later that same decade, Maryland became the seventh state to ratify the stronger government structure proposed in the new U.S. Constitution in 1788. After the Revolutionary War, numerous Maryland planters freed their slaves as the economy changed. Baltimore grew to become one of the largest cities on the eastern seaboard, and a major economic force in the country. Although Maryland was still a slave state in 1860, by that time nearly half of the African American population was already free, due mostly to manumissions after the American Revolution.Kolchin, Peter. American Slavery: 1619‚Äì1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, pp. 81‚Äì82 Baltimore had the highest number of free people of color of any city in the United States. Maryland was among the four divided border states that officially remained in the Union during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), although large numbers of Marylanders \\"went south\\" to fight for the seceded Confederacy. Pre-colonial history It appears that the first humans in the area that would become Maryland arrived around the tenth millennium BC, about the time that the last ice age ended. They were hunter- gatherers organized into semi-nomadic bands. They adapted as the region's environment changed, developing the spear for hunting as smaller animals, like deer, became more prevalent. By about 1500 BC, oysters had become an important food resource in the region. With the increased variety of food sources, Native American villages and settlements started appearing and their social structures increased in complexity. By about 1000 BC, pottery was being produced. With the eventual rise of agriculture, more permanent Native- American villages were built. But even with the advent of farming, hunting and fishing were still important means of obtaining food. The bow and arrow were first used for hunting in the area around the year 800. They ate what they could kill, grow or catch in the rivers and other waterways. Some of the historical Native languages of Maryland By 1000 AD, there were about 8,000 Native Americans, all Algonquian-speaking, living in what is now the state, in 40 different villages. By the 17th century, the state was populated by a mix of Iroquoian and Algonquian peoples. These were the Susquehannocks (west of the Delaware River), the Tuscarora and Tockwogh (on the Delmarva Peninsula between the Delaware and Indian Rivers), the Piscataway (surrounding the Potomac River from Washington D.C. south) and the Nanticoke (Delmarva Peninsula, south of the Indian River). John Smith labelled the Tuscarora as the Kuskarawock on an early map from 1606, but they shortly thereafter moved west to join the Meherrin and Nottoway in Virginia.See John Smith's map of Virginia on Wikimedia Commons. Meanwhile, the Tockwogh may have moved to New York and/or been given refuge by the Susquehannock. They are noted as the Akhrakovaetonon and Trakwaerronnons, which seems similar to Tockwogh. They were extinct as a people by the end of the 17th century, however.John Steckley, \\"The Early Map \\"Novvelle France\\": A Linguistic Analysis\\", Ontario Archaeology 51, 1990. The following Piscataway tribes lived on the eastern bank of the Potomac, from south to north: Yaocomicoes, Chopticans, Nanjemoys, Potopacs, Mattawomans, Piscataways, Patuxents, and Nacotchtanks. The area in which the Nacotchtank lived is now the District of Columbia. On the west bank of the Potomac river in what is now Virginia were the related tribes of the Patawomeck and the Doeg. Further west in the Appalachian Mountains, the Shawnee lived near Oldtown at a site abandoned around 1731. On the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake, from south to north, there were the Nanticoke tribes: Annemessex, Assateagues, Wicomicoes, Nanticokes, Chicacone, and, on the north bank of the Choptank River, the Choptanks. The Tockwogh tribe lived near the headwaters of the Chesapeake near what is now Delaware. They were driven further north by enemies and eventually broke apart, with some staying in the region, others merging with the Nanticoke and others, known as the Conoy, migrated west into West Virginia.John Heckewelder (Loskiel): Conoys, Ganawese, etc. explains Charles A. Hanna (Vol II, 1911:96, Ganeiens-gaa, Margry, i., 529; ii., 142‚Äì43,) using La Salle's letter of August 22, 1681 Fort Saint Louis (Illinois) mentioning \\"Ohio tribes\\" for extrapolation. Some appeared around the end of the 18th century at Fort Detroit in Michigan. John Smith's map of the Chesapeake area When Europeans began to settle in Maryland in the early 17th century, the main tribes included the Nanticoke on the Eastern Shore, and the Iroquoian speaking Susquehannock. Early exposure to new European diseases brought widespread fatalities to the Native Americans, as they had no immunity to them. Communities were disrupted by such losses. Furthermore, The Susquehannock, already incorrectly considered savages and cannibals by the first Spanish explorers, made massive moves to control local trade with the first Swedish, Dutch and English settlers of the Chesapeake Bay region. As the century wore on, the Susquehannock would be caught up in the Beaver Wars, a war with the neighboring Lenape, a war with the Dutch, a war with the English, and a series of wars with the colonial government of Maryland. Due to colonial land claims, the exact territory of the Susquehannock was originally limited to the territory immediately surrounding the Susquehanna River, however archaeology has discovered settlements of theirs dating to the 14th and 15th centuries around the Maryland-West Virginia border, and beyond. It could generally be assumed that most of Maryland's southern border is based on the borders of their own land. All of these wars, coupled with disease, destroyed the tribe and the last of their people were offered refuge from the Iroquois Confederacy to the north shortly thereafter. The closest living language to them are the languages of the Mohawk and Tuscarora Iroquois, who once lived immediately north and south of them. The English and Dutch came to call them the Minqua, from Lenape, which breaks into min-kwe and translates to \\"as a woman.\\" As to when they arrived, some early records detailing their oral history seem to point to the fact that they descended from an Iroquoian group who conquered Ohio centuries before, but were pushed back east again by Siouan and Algonquin enemies. They also conquered and absorbed other unknown groups in the process, which probably explains how languages like Tuscarora came to be so completely divergent from other Iroquoian languages. It also appears possible that the word \\"Iroquois\\" actually derived from their language.Nichols, John & Nyholm, Earl \\"The Concise Dictionary of Minnesota Ojibwe.\\" 1994 The Nanticoke seem to have been largely confined to Indian Towns, but were later relocated to New York in 1778. Afterwards, they dissolved, with groups joining the Iroquois and Lenape.Pritzker 441 Also, as Susquehannocks began to abandon much of their westernmost territory due to their own hardships, a group of Powhatan split off, becoming known as the Shawnee and migrated into the western regions of Maryland and Pennsylvania briefly before moving on.Carrie Hunter Willis and Etta Belle Walker, Legends of the Skyline Drive and the Great Valley of Virginia, 1937, pp. 15‚Äì16; this account also appears in T.K. Cartmell's 1909 Shenandoah Valley Pioneers and Their Descendants p. 41. At the time, they were relatively small, but they eventually made the Ohio River, migrating all the way into Ohio and merged with other nations there to become the powerful, military force that they were known to be during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Colonial Maryland Map of the Maryland colony = Establishment = George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, applied to Charles I for a royal charter for what was to become the Province of Maryland. After Calvert died in April 1632, the charter for \\"Maryland Colony\\" (in Latin Terra Mariae) was granted to his son, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, on June 20, 1632.\\"The Charter of Maryland : 1632\\", The Avalon Project, Lillian Goldman Law Library, Yale School of Law Some historians viewed this as compensation for his father having been stripped of his title of Secretary of State in 1625 after announcing his Roman Catholicism. Officially the colony is said to be named in honor of Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of King Charles I. Some Catholic scholars believe that George Calvert named the province after Mary, the mother of Jesus.Carl, Katy. \\"Catholics Give Thanks to God in Maryland\\", National Catholic Register, November 21, 2012 The name in the charter was phrased Terra Mariae, anglice, Maryland. The English name was preferred due to the undesired associations of Mariae with the Spanish Jesuit Juan de Mariana, linked to the Inquisition. depicts colonists meeting the people of the Yaocomico branch of the Piscatawy Indian Nation in St. Mary's City, Maryland, the site of Maryland's first colonial settlement. The painting represents traditionally-held elements of Maryland's centuries-old founding narrative, though some details‚Äîsuch as the clothing worn by natives‚Äîare not necessarily accurate.Archaeology, Narrative, and the Politics of the Past: The View from Southern Maryland, p. 52, UPCC book collections on Project MUSE, Julia A. King, Publisher, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2012, The presentation is a mythic depiction and is an assembly of traditional tales about Maryland's founding. Father Andrew White, a Jesuit missionary, is believed to be on the left; other elements may be as follows: in front of him Leonard Calvert, the colonists' leader and the son of the first Lord Baltimore, is clasping hands with the paramount chief of the Yaocomico. Gifts of food offered to the new colonists are in the right foreground. In the right background are moored the sailing ships the Ark and the Dove, the vessels that brought the first colonists to Maryland. As did other colonies, Maryland used the headright system to encourage people to bring in new settlers. Led by Leonard Calvert, Cecil Calvert's younger brother, the first settlers departed from Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, on November 22, 1633, aboard two small ships, the Ark and the Dove. Their landing on March 25, 1634, at St. Clement's Island in southern Maryland is commemorated by the state each year on that date as Maryland Day. This was the site of the first Catholic mass in the Colonies, with Father Andrew White leading the service. The first group of colonists consisted of 17 gentlemen and their wives, and about two hundred others, mostly indentured servants. After purchasing land from the Yaocomico Indians and establishing the town of St. Mary's, Leonard, per his brother's instructions, attempted to govern the country under feudalistic precepts. Meeting resistance, in February 1635, he summoned a colonial assembly. In 1638, the Assembly forced him to govern according to the laws of England. The right to initiate legislation passed to the assembly. In 1638 Calvert seized a trading post in Kent Island established by the Virginian William Claiborne. In 1644 Claiborne led an uprising of Maryland Protestants. Calvert was forced to flee to Virginia, but he returned at the head of an armed force in 1646 and reasserted proprietarial rule. A large broadside of the Maryland Toleration Act Maryland soon became one of the few predominantly Catholic regions among the English colonies in North America. Maryland was also one of the key destinations where the government sent tens of thousands of English convicts punished by sentences of transportation. Such punishment persisted until the Revolutionary War. The Maryland Toleration Act, issued in 1649, was one of the first laws that explicitly defined tolerance of varieties of Christianity. = Protestant revolts = St. Mary's City was the largest settlement in Maryland and the seat of colonial government until 1695. Because Anglicanism had become the official religion in Virginia, a band of Puritans in 1642 left for Maryland; they founded Providence (now called Annapolis).Owen M. Taylor, History of Annapolis (1872) p 5 online In 1650 the Puritans revolted against the proprietary government. They set up a new government prohibiting both Catholicism and Anglicanism. In March 1655, the 2nd Lord Baltimore sent an army under Governor William Stone to put down this revolt. Near Annapolis, his Roman Catholic army was decisively defeated by a Puritan army in the Battle of the Severn. The Puritan revolt lasted until 1658, when the Calvert family regained control and re-enacted the Toleration Act.Daniel R. Randall, A Puritan Colony in Maryland; Johns Hopkins University Studies in History and Political Science, ed. Herbert B. Adams, Fourth Series, issue VI; Baltimore: N. Murray for Johns Hopkins University, June 1886. In 1689, following the accession of a Protestant monarchy in England, rebels against the Catholic regime in Maryland overthrew the government and took power. Lord Baltimore was stripped of his right to govern the province, though not of his territorial rights. Maryland was designated as a royal province, administered by the crown via appointed governors until 1715. At that time, Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore, having converted to Anglicanism, was restored to proprietorship.Mereness (1901), pp. 37‚Äì43. The Protestant revolutionary government persecuted Maryland Catholics during its reign. Mobs burned down all the original Catholic churches of southern Maryland. The Anglican Church was made the established church of the colony. In 1695 the royal Governor, Francis Nicholson, moved the seat of government to Ann Arundell Town in Anne Arundel County and renamed it Annapolis in honor of the Princess Anne, who later became Queen Anne of Great Britain. Annapolis remains the capital of Maryland. St. Mary's City is now an archaeological site, with a small tourist center. Just as the city plan for St. Mary's City reflected the ideals of the founders, the city plan of Annapolis reflected those in power at the turn of the 18th century. The plan of Annapolis extends from two circles at the center of the city ‚Äì one including the State House and the other the established Anglican St. Anne's Church (now Episcopal). The plan reflected a stronger relationship between church and state, and a colonial government more closely aligned with Protestant churches. General British policy regarding immigration to all British America would be reflected broadly in the Plantation Act of 1740. Tobacco was the main export crop in the colonial era; it involved a great deal of hand labor, usually done by enslaved Africans, as shown here in a 1670 painting from Virginia =Mason‚ÄìDixon Line= Based on an incorrect map, the original royal charter granted to Maryland the Potomac River and territory northward to the fortieth parallel. This was found to be a problem, as the northern boundary would have put Philadelphia, the major city in Pennsylvania, within Maryland. The Calvert family, which controlled Maryland, and the Penn family, which controlled Pennsylvania, decided in 1750 to engage two surveyors, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, to establish a boundary between the colonies. They surveyed what became known as the Mason‚ÄìDixon Line, which became the boundary between the two colonies. The crests of the Penn family and of the Calvert family were put at the Mason‚ÄìDixon line to mark it. =Horse racing and gentry values= In Chesapeake society (that is, colonial Virginia and Maryland) sports occupied a great deal of attention at every social level. Horse racing was sponsored by the wealthy gentry plantation owners, and attracted ordinary farmers as spectators and gamblers. Selected slaves often became skilled horse trainers. Horse racing was especially important for knitting the gentry together. The race was a major public event designed to demonstrate to the world the superior social status of the gentry through expensive breeding and training of horses, boasting and gambling, and especially winning the races themselves.Nancy L. Struna, \\"The Formalizing of Sport and the Formation of an Elite: The Chesapeake Gentry, 1650‚Äì1720s.\\" Journal of Sport History 13#3 (1986). online Historian Timothy Breen explains that horseracing and high-stakes gambling were essential to maintaining the status of the gentry. When they publicly bet a large fraction of their wealth on their favorite horse, they expressed competitiveness, individualism, and materialism as the core elements of gentry values.Timothy H. Breen, \\"Horses and gentlemen: The cultural significance of gambling among the gentry of Virginia.\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1977) 34#2 pp: 239-257. online The Revolutionary period Maryland did not at first favor independence from Great Britain and gave instructions to that effect to its delegates to the Second Continental Congress. During this initial phase of the Revolutionary period, Maryland was governed by a series of conventions of the Assembly of Freemen. The first convention of the Assembly lasted four days, from June 22 to 25, 1774. All sixteen counties then existing were represented by a total of 92 members; Matthew Tilghman was elected chairman. Thomas Johnson, Maryland's first elected governor under its 1776 Constitution The eighth session decided that the continuation of an ad hoc government by the convention was not a good mechanism for all the concerns of the province. A more permanent and structured government was needed. So, on July 3, 1776, they resolved that a new convention be elected that would be responsible for drawing up their first state constitution, one that did not refer to parliament or the king, but would be a government \\"...of the people only.\\" After they set dates and prepared notices to the counties they adjourned. On August 1, all freemen with property elected delegates for the last convention. The ninth and last convention was also known as the Constitutional Convention of 1776. They drafted a constitution, and when they adjourned on November 11, they would not meet again. The conventions were replaced by the new state government which the Maryland Constitution of 1776 had established. Thomas Johnson became the state's first elected governor. On March 1, 1781, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was ratified and took effect with the confirmation signing of the Articles by two Maryland delegates in Philadelphia. The articles had initially been submitted to the states on November 17, 1777, but the ratification process dragged on for several years, stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims to uncolonized land in the west of the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River. Maryland was the last hold-out; it refused to ratify until larger states like Virginia and New York agreed to rescind their claims to lands in what became the old Northwest Territory and the Southwest Territory. Chevalier de La Luzerne, French Minister to the United States, felt that the Articles would help strengthen the American government. In 1780 when Maryland requested France provide naval forces in the Chesapeake Bay for protection from the British (who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay), he indicated that French Admiral Destouches would do what he could but La Luzerne also \\"sharply pressed\\" Maryland to ratify the Articles, thus suggesting the two issues were related. On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis. As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, \\"among engrossed Bills\\" was \\"signed and sealed by Governor Thomas Sim Lee in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation\\" and perpetual union among the states. The Senate then adjourned \\"to the first Monday in August next.\\" The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12, 1781. Marylander John Hanson (circa 1765 to 1770) was the first person to serve a full term as \\"President of the United States in Congress Assembled\\" under the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, used 1781 to 1789. No significant battles of the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783) occurred in Maryland. However, this did not prevent the state's soldiers from distinguishing themselves through their service. General George Washington was impressed with the Maryland regulars (the \\"Maryland Line\\") who fought in the Continental Army and, according to one tradition, this led him to bestow the name \\"Old Line State\\" on Maryland. Today, the Old Line State is one of Maryland's two official nicknames. The Second Continental Congress met briefly in Baltimore from December 20, 1776, through March 4, 1777 at the old hotel, later renamed Congress Hall, at the southwest corner of West Market Street (now Baltimore Street) and Sharp Street/Liberty Street. Marylander John Hanson, served as President of the Continental Congress from 1781 to 1782. Hanson was the first person to serve a full term with the title of \\"President of the United States in Congress Assembled\\" under the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. Annapolis served as the temporary United States capital from November 26, 1783, to June 3, 1784, and the Confederation Congress met in the recently completed Maryland State House. Annapolis was a candidate to become the new nation's permanent capital before the site along the Potomac River was selected for the District of the Columbia. It was in the old Senate chamber that General George Washington famously resigned his commission as commander in chief of the Continental Army on December 23, 1783. It was also there that the Treaty of Paris of 1783, which ended the Revolutionary War, was ratified by Congress on January 14, 1784. Major General William Smallwood, having served under General George Washington during the Revolutionary War, then Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, became the fourth American Governor of Maryland. In 1787, Governor William Smallwood called together and convened the state convention which adopted the new U.S. Constitution in 1788, becoming the seventh state to ratify the Constitution. This made Governor Smallwood, an American Major General of the Revolutionary War, the first Governor of Maryland under the U.S. Constitution. Maryland, 1789‚Äì1849 =Economic development= The American Revolution stimulated the domestic market for wheat and iron ore, and flour milling increased in Baltimore. Iron ore transport greatly boosted the local economy. By 1800 Baltimore had become one of the major cities of the new republic. The British naval blockade during the War of 1812 hurt Baltimore's shipping, but also freed merchants and traders from British debts, which along with the capture of British merchant vessels furthered the city's economic growth. Transportation initiatives The city had a deepwater port. In the early 19th century, many business leaders in Maryland were looking inland, toward the western frontier, for economic growth potential. The challenge was to devise a reliable means to transport goods and people. The National Road and private turnpikes were being completed throughout the state, but additional routes and capacity were needed. Following the success of the Erie Canal (constructed 1817‚Äì25) and similar canals in the northeastern states, leaders in Maryland were also developing plans for canals. After several failed canal projects in the Washington, D.C. area, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O;) began construction there in 1828. The Baltimore business community viewed this project as a competitive threat. The geography of the Baltimore area made building a similar canal to the west impractical, but the idea of constructing railroads was beginning to gather support in the 1820s. In 1827 city leaders obtained a charter from the Maryland General Assembly to build a railroad to the Ohio River. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) became the first chartered railroad in the United States, and opened its first section of track for regular operation in 1830, between Baltimore and Ellicott City. It became the first company to operate a locomotive built in America, with the Tom Thumb. The B&O; built a branch line to Washington, D.C. in 1835. The main line west reached Cumberland in 1842, beating the C&O; Canal there by eight years, and the railroad continued building westward. In 1852 it became the first rail line to reach the Ohio River from the eastern seaboard. Other railroads were built in and through Baltimore by mid-century, most significantly the Northern Central; the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore; and the Baltimore and Potomac. (All of these came under the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad.) Industrial Revolution Baltimore's seaport and good railroad connections fostered substantial growth during the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. Many manufacturing businesses were established in Baltimore and the surrounding area after the Civil War. Cumberland was Maryland's second largest city in the 19th century, with ample nearby supplies of coal, iron ore and timber. These resources, along with railroads, the National Road and the C&O; Canal, fostered its growth. The city was a major manufacturing center, with industries in glass, breweries, fabrics and tinplate. The Pennsylvania Steel Company founded a steel mill at Sparrow's Point in Baltimore in 1887. The mill was purchased by Bethlehem Steel in 1916, and it became the world's largest steel mill by the mid-20th century, employing tens of thousands of workers. =Educational institutions= In 1807, the College of Medicine of Maryland (later the University of Maryland Medical School) became the seventh medical school in the United States. In 1840, by order of the Maryland state legislature, the non-religious St. Mary's Female Seminary was founded in St. Mary's City. This would later become St. Mary's College of Maryland, the state's public honors college. The United States Naval Academy was founded in Annapolis in 1845, and the Maryland Agricultural College was chartered in 1856, growing eventually into the University of Maryland. =Immigration and religion= Since the abolition of anti-Catholic laws in the early 1830s, the Catholic population rebounded considerably. The Maryland Catholic population began its resurgence with large waves of Irish Catholic immigration spurred by the Great Potato Famine in Ireland (1845‚Äì49) and then continued through the first half of the 20th century.\\"Irish Immigrants in Baltimore: Introduction\\", Teaching American History in Maryland, Maryland State Archives, http://teaching.msa.maryland.gov/000001/000000/000131/html/t131.html Italian immigration\\"Italian Jesuits in Maryland : a clash of theological cultures (2007)\\", McKevitt, Gerald, Volume: v.39 no.1, pages 50, 51, 52; Publisher: St. Louis, MO : Seminar on Jesuit Spirituality, Call number: BX3701.S88x, Digitizing sponsor: Boston Library Consortium Member Libraries https://archive.org/details/italianjesuitsin391mcke and Polish immigrations also supplemented the Catholic population in Maryland. Baltimore was the third largest point of entry for European immigrants on the Eastern seaboard for much of this period. Although greatly increased, the Catholic population has never become a majority in the state. =War of 1812= The \\"Battle Monument\\" at courthouse square was constructed in 1815‚Äì1822 to commemorate the Battle of Baltimore, Battle of North Point, and the naval bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British Royal Navy. After the Revolution, the United States Congress approved construction of six heavy frigates to form a nucleus of the United States Navy. One of the first three, the USS Constellation, was constructed in Baltimore. Constellation became the first official U.S. Navy ship put to sea, deploying to the Caribbean Sea to participate in the Quasi-War against France. During the War of 1812 the British raided cities along Chesapeake Bay up to Havre de Grace. Two notable battles occurred in the state. The first was the Battle of Bladensburg on August 24, 1814, just outside the national capital, Washington, D.C. The British army routed the American militiamen, who fled in confusion, and went on to capture Washington, D.C. They burned and looted major public buildings, forcing President James Madison to flee to Brookeville, Maryland. The British next marched to Baltimore, where they hoped to strike a knockout blow against the demoralized Americans. Baltimore was not only a busy port but also suspected of harboring many of the privateers despoiling British ships. The city's defenses were under the command of Major General Samuel Smith, an officer and commander of the Maryland state militia and a United States Senator. Baltimore had been well fortified with excellent supplies and some 15,000 troops. Maryland militia fought a determined delaying action at the Battle of North Point, during which a Maryland militia marksman shot and killed the British commander, Major General Robert Ross. The battle bought enough time for Baltimore's defenses to be strengthened. After advancing to the edge of American defenses, the British halted their advance and withdrew. With the failure of the land advance, the sea battle became irrelevant and the British retreated. At Fort McHenry, some 1000 soldiers under the command of Major George Armistead awaited the British naval bombardment. Their defense was augmented by the sinking of a line of American merchant ships at the adjacent entrance to Baltimore Harbor in order to thwart passage of British ships. The attack began on the morning of September 13, as the British fleet of some nineteen ships began pounding the fort with rockets and mortar shells. After an initial exchange of fire, the British fleet withdrew just beyond the range of Fort McHenry's cannons. For the next 25 hours, they bombarded the outmanned Americans. On the morning of September 14, an oversized American flag, which had been raised before daybreak, flew over Fort McHenry. The British knew that victory had eluded them. The bombardment of the fort inspired Francis Scott Key of Frederick, Maryland to write \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" as witness to the assault. It later became the country's national anthem. Maryland in the Civil War See also: American Civil War, Origins of the American Civil War and History of slavery in Maryland =Maryland's mixed sympathies= 8th Massachusetts regiment repairing railroad bridges from Annapolis to Washington, which were destroyed with the support of Maryland political leaders, Confederate sympathizers Maryland was a border state, straddling the North and South. As in Virginia and Delaware, some planters in Maryland had freed their slaves in the years after the Revolutionary War. By 1860 Maryland's free black population comprised 49.1% of the total of African Americans in the state. After John Brown's raid in 1859 on Harper's Ferry, Virginia, some citizens in slaveholding areas began forming local militias for defense. Of the 1860 population of 687,000, about 60,000 men joined the Union and about 25,000 fought for the Confederacy. The political alignments of each group generally reflected their economic interests, with slaveholders and people involved in trade with the South most likely to favor the Confederate cause, and small farmers and merchants outside the major cities and in western Maryland allied with the Union. In the 1860 election, Lincoln received only one vote in Prince George's County, a center of large plantations. =Beginning of the war= Hicks The first bloodshed of the war occurred in Baltimore when the 6th Massachusetts Militia battled an attacking mob while marching between railroad stations on April 19, 1861. After that, Baltimore Mayor George William Brown, Marshal George P. Kane, and former Governor Enoch Louis Lowe requested that Maryland Governor Thomas H. Hicks, a slave owner from the Eastern Shore, burn the railroad bridges and cut the telegraph lines leading to Baltimore to prevent further troops from entering the state. Hicks reportedly approved this proposal. These actions were addressed in the famous federal court case of Ex parte Merryman. Maryland remained part of the Union during the Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln's strong hand suppressing violence and dissent in Maryland and the belated assistance of Governor Hicks played important roles. Hicks worked with federal officials to stop further violence. Lincoln promised to avoid having Northern defenders march through Baltimore while en route to protect the acutely endangered federal capital. The majority of forces took a slow route by boat. Massachusetts militia general Benjamin F. Butler used the water route after learning about the troubles in Baltimore. He commandeered the P. W. & B. Railroad ferryboat Harriet Lane at the Susquehanna River crossing between Perryville in Cecil County to Havre de Grace in Harford County. Avoiding the riotous city, he steamed down the Chesapeake Bay to anchor at night off the Naval Academy at Severn Point in Annapolis. He landed his troops of Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island militia over the protests of Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks (1798‚Äì1865). He put some on the old Navy training ship frigate, USS Constitution (\\"Old Ironsides\\") and moved it off shore beyond reach of easy attack. Recruiting some railroad workers and boilermakers among his soldiers, Butler had them rescue a small yard locomotive in the trainyards and use it to take cars full of soldiers up the Annapolis Line of the B&O; Railroad to Relay Junction near Ellicott City, where it joined the Main Line going west to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia or south to Washington. The Northern regiments used this route to reach the train station (now Union Station near the U.S. Capitol). They camped that evening in the Rotunda, which was not yet completed. An additional unit was sent up Pennsylvania Avenue to reinforce the White House, where the President greeted them with relief. Marylanders sympathetic to the South easily crossed the Potomac River to join and fight for the Confederacy. Exiles organized a \\"Maryland Line\\" in the Army of Northern Virginia which consisted of one infantry regiment, one infantry battalion, two cavalry battalions and four battalions of artillery. According to the best extant records, up to 25,000 Marylanders went south to fight for the Confederacy. About 60,000 Maryland men served in all branches of the Union military. Many of the Union troops were said to enlist on the promise of home garrison duty. Maryland's naval contribution, the relatively new sloop-of-war USS Constellation was flagship of the US Africa Squadron from 1859 to 1861 and continued in this role during the war. In this period, she disrupted the African slave trade by interdicting three slave ships and releasing the imprisoned slaves. The last of the ships was captured at the outbreak of the Civil War: Constellation overpowered the slaver brig Triton in African coastal waters. Constellation spent much of the war as a deterrent to Confederate cruisers and commerce raiders in the Mediterranean Sea. =Occupation of Baltimore= A Union artillery garrison was placed on Federal Hill with express orders to destroy the city should Southern sympathizers overwhelm law and order there. Following the riot of 1861, Union troops under the command of General Benjamin F. Butler occupied the hill in the middle of the night. Butler and his men erected a small fort, with cannon pointing towards the central business district. Their goal was to guarantee the allegiance of the city and the state of Maryland to the federal government under threat of force. This fort and the Union occupation persisted for the duration of the Civil War. A large flag, a few cannon, and a small Grand Army of the Republic monument remain to testify to this period of the hill's history. John Pendleton Kennedy, politician, author. Kennedy played a major role in bringing an end to slavery in Maryland. 1850 photograph. Because Maryland remained in the Union, it fell outside the scope of the Emancipation Proclamation. A constitutional convention in 1864 culminated in the passage of a new state constitution on November 1 of that year. Article 24 of that document outlawed the practice of slavery. A campaign by state politician John Pendleton Kennedy and others ensured that abolishment of slavery would be in the new document, and the issue was hotly contested for nearly a year throughout the state. In the end the elimination of slavery was approved by a 1,000-vote margin. The right to vote was extended to non-white males in the Maryland Constitution of 1867, which is still in effect today. =The war on Maryland soil= Battle of Antietam by Kurz and Allison The largest and most significant battle fought in the state was the Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg. The battle was the culmination of Robert E. Lee's Maryland Campaign, which aimed to secure new supplies, recruit fresh men from among the considerable pockets of Confederate sympathies in Maryland, and to impact public opinion in the North. With those goals, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, consisting of about 40,000 men, had entered Maryland following their recent victory at Second Bull Run. While Major General George B. McClellan's 87,000-man Army of the Potomac was moving to intercept Lee, a Union soldier discovered a mislaid copy of the detailed battle plans of Lee's army. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically (to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland), thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail if McClellan could move quickly enough. McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and position his forces based on it, thus endangering a golden opportunity to defeat Lee decisively. Dead Confederate soldiers from Starke's Louisiana Brigade, on the Hagerstown Turnpike, north of the Dunker Church The armies met near the town of Sharpsburg by Antietam Creek. Although McClellan arrived in the area on September 16, his trademark caution delayed his attack on Lee, which gave the Confederates more time to prepare defensive positions and allowed Longstreet's corps to arrive from Hagerstown and Jackson's corps, minus A. P. Hill's division, to arrive from Harpers Ferry. McClellan's two-to-one advantage in the battle was almost completely nullified by a lack of coordination and concentration of Union forces, which allowed Lee to shift his defensive forces to parry each thrust. Antietam National Battlefield today Although a tactical draw, the Battle of Antietam was considered a strategic Union victory and a turning point of the war. It forced the end of Lee's invasion of the North. It also was enough of a victory to enable President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect on January 1, 1863. He had been advised by his Cabinet to make the announcement after a Union victory, to avoid any perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union's winning the Battle of Antietam also may have dissuaded the governments of France and Great Britain from recognizing the Confederacy. Some observers believed they might have done so in the aftermath of another Union defeat. 1865‚Äì1920 =Post-Civil War political developments= Since Maryland had remained in the Union during the Civil War, the state was not covered by the Reconstruction Act, as were states of the former Confederacy. After the war, many white Maryland residents struggled to re-establish white supremacy over freedmen and formerly free blacks, and racial tensions rose. There were deep divisions in the state between those who fought for the North and those who fought for the South. Thomas Swann, the only Governor of Maryland elected under the state's 1864 constitution In the late 1860s, the whites of the Democratic Party rapidly regained power in the state and replaced Republicans who had been elected or appointed during the war. Support for the Constitution of 1864 ended, and Democrats replaced it with the Maryland Constitution of 1867. That document, which is still in effect today, resembled the 1851 constitution more than its immediate predecessor and was approved by 54.1% of the state's population. It provided for the reapportionment of the legislature based on population, not counties, which gave greater political power to more dense urban areas (and, by extension, to freedmen), but the new constitution deprived African Americans of some of the protections of the 1864 document. Austin Lane Crothers, the 46th Governor, supported the disfranchisement of black voters and poor whites In 1896, a biracial Republican coalition gained election of Lloyd Lowndes, Jr. as governor, and also achieved election of some Republican congressmen, including Sydney Emanuel Mudd, after Democratic dominance. Over the next several decades, the African-American population struggled in a discriminatory environment. The Democrat-dominated legislature tried to pass disfranchising bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911, but was rebuffed on each occasion, in large part because of black opposition and strength. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and had established themselves in several cities, where they had comparative security. In addition, immigrants comprised 15% of the voting population and opposed these measures. The legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrants. In 1910 the legislature proposed the Digges Amendment to the state constitution. It would have used property requirements to effectively disfranchise many African Americans as well as many poor whites (including new immigrants), a technique used by other southern states from 1890 to 1910, beginning with Mississippi's new constitution. The Maryland General Assembly passed the bill, which Governor Austin Lane Crothers supported. Before the measure went to popular vote, a bill was proposed that would have effectively passed the requirements of the Digges Amendment into law. Due to widespread public opposition, that measure failed, and the amendment was also rejected by the voters of Maryland. Nationally Maryland citizens achieved the most notable rejection of a black-disfranchising amendment. Similar measures had earlier been proposed in Maryland, but also failed to pass (the Poe Amendment in 1905 and the Straus Amendment in 1909). The power of blacks at the ballot box and economically helped them resist these bills and disfranchising effort.STEPHEN TUCK, \\"Democratization and the Disfranchisement of African Americans in the US South during the Late 19th Century\\" (pdf), Spring 2013, reading for \\"Challenges of Democratization\\", by Brandon Kendhammer, Ohio University The businessmen Johns Hopkins, Enoch Pratt, George Peabody, and Henry Walters were philanthropists of 19th-century Baltimore; they founded notable educational, health care, and cultural institutions in that city. Bearing their names, these include a university, free city library, music and art school, and art museum. =Progressive era reforms= In the early 20th century, a political reform movement arose, centered in the rising new middle class. One of their main goals included having government jobs granted on the basis of merit rather than patronage. Other changes aimed to reduce the power of political bosses and machines, which they succeeded in doing. In a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908, reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots (rather than those distributed and pre-marked by the parties); obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from \\"assisting\\" voters; initiated primary elections to keep party bosses from selecting candidates; and had candidates listed without party symbols, which discouraged the illiterate from participating. Although promoted as democratic reforms, the changes had other results sought by the middle class. They discouraged participation by the lower classes and illiterate voters. Voting participation dropped from about 82% of eligible voters in the 1890s to about 49% in the 1920s. Other laws regulated working conditions. For instance, in a series of laws passed in 1902, the state regulated conditions in mines; outlawed child laborers under the age of 12; mandated compulsory school attendance; and enacted the nation's first workers' compensation law. The workers' compensation law was overturned in the courts, but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910. The law become a model for national legislation a few decades later. The debate over prohibition of alcohol, another progressive reform, led to Maryland's gaining its second nickname. A mocking newspaper editorial dubbed Maryland \\"the Free State\\" for its allowing alcohol. =Great Baltimore Fire= The aftermath of the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904 The Great Baltimore Fire of 1904 was a momentous event for Maryland's largest city and the state as a whole. The fire raged in Baltimore from 10:48 a.m. Sunday, February 7, to 5:00 p.m. Monday, February 8, 1904. More than 1,231 firefighters worked to bring the blaze under control. One reason for the fire's duration was the lack of national standards in fire-fighting equipment. Although fire engines from nearby cities (such as Philadelphia and Washington, as well as units from New York, Wilmington, and Atlantic City) responded, many were useless because their hose couples failed to fit Baltimore hydrants. As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks. In the aftermath, 35,000 people were left unemployed. After the fire, the city was rebuilt using more fireproof materials, such as granite pavers. =The World War I era= Entry into World War I brought changes to Maryland. Maryland was the site of new military bases, such as Camp Meade (now Fort Meade), the Aberdeen Proving Ground, which were established in 1917, and the Edgewood Arsenal, which was founded the following year. Other existing facilities, including Fort McHenry, were greatly expanded. To coordinate wartime activities, like the expansion of federal facilities, the General Assembly set up a Council of Defense. The 126 seats on the council were filled by appointment. The council, which had a virtually unlimited budget, was charged with defending the state, supervising the draft, maintaining wage and price controls, providing housing for war- related industries, and promoting support for the war. Citizens were encouraged to grow their own victory gardens and to obey ration laws. They were also forced to work, once the legislature adopted a compulsory labor law with the support of the Council of Defense. =Culture= H. L. Mencken in 1932 H. L. Mencken (1880‚Äì1956) was the state's iconoclastic writer and intellectual trendsetter. In 1922 the \\"Sage of Baltimore\\" praised the state for its \\"singular and various beauty from the stately estuaries of the Chesapeake to the peaks of the Blue Ridge.\\" He happily reported that Providence had spared Maryland the harsh weather, the decay, the intractable social problems of other states. Statistically, Maryland held tightly to the middle ground‚Äì in population, value of manufacturers, percentage of native whites, the proportion of Catholics, the first and last annual frost. Everywhere he looked he found Maryland in the middle. In national politics it worked sometimes with the northern Republicans, other times with southern Democrats. This average quality perhaps represented a national ideal toward which other states were striving. Nevertheless, Mencken sensed something was wrong. \\"Men are ironed out. Ideas are suspect. No one appears to be happy. Life is dull.\\" Maryland in the 20th century =The Ritchie administration= Albert C. Ritchie, elected to his first of five terms in 1918, is probably the most popular governor in state history. In 1918, Maryland elected Albert C. Ritchie, a Democrat, governor. He was reelected four times, serving from 1919 to 1934. Ritchie was handsome, aristocratic, and very pro-business. He hired a management firm to streamline government operations and established a budget process controlled largely by economists. He also won approval for a civil service system, long been sought by reformers who wanted positions given on the basis of merit and not patronage; reduced the number of state elections by extending legislative terms from two to four years; and appointed citizens' commissions to advise on nearly every aspect of government. State property taxes dropped sharply under Ritchie, but so did state services. A powerful movie censorship board kept subversive ideas away from the masses. Three times, including 1924 and 1932, Ritchie was a candidate for President of the United States, arguing that Presidents Coolidge and Hoover were hopeless spendthrifts.Joseph B. Chepaitis, \\"Albert C. Ritchie in Power: 1920‚Äì1927\\". Maryland Historical Magazine (1973) 68(4): 383‚Äì404 Ritchie lost his bid for the Democratic Party's nomination for president in 1932. Despite a large demonstration of support at the convention, Franklin D. Roosevelt was nominated and went on to win the election. Ritchie continued to serve as governor until 1935.Dorothy Brown, \\"The Election of 1934: the 'New Deal' in Maryland,\\" Maryland Historical Magazine (1973) 68(4): 405‚Äì421 =The Great Depression, World War II, and aftermath= Maryland's urban and rural communities had different experiences during the Depression. In 1932 the \\"Bonus Army\\" marched through the state on its way to Washington, D.C. In addition to the nationwide New Deal reforms of President Roosevelt, which put men to work building roads and park facilities, Maryland also took steps to weather the hard times. For instance, in 1937 the state instituted its first ever income tax to generate revenue for schools and welfare. The state had some advances in civil rights. The 1935 case Murray v. Pearson et al. resulted in a Baltimore City Court's ordering integration of University of Maryland Law School. The plaintiff in that case was represented by Thurgood Marshall, a young lawyer with the NAACP and a native of Baltimore. When the state attorney general appealed to the Court of Appeals, it affirmed the decision. Because the state did not appeal the ruling in the federal courts, this state ruling under the U.S. Constitution was the first to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 Supreme Court decision that allowed separate but equal facilities. While the ruling was a moral precedent, it had no authority outside the state of Maryland. A hurricane in 1933 created an inlet in Sinepuxent Bay at Ocean City, making the then-small town attractive for recreational fishing. During World War II additional large defense facilities were established in the state such as Andrews Air Force Base, Patuxent River Naval Air Station, and the large Glenn L. Martin aircraft factory east of Baltimore. In 1952, the eastern and western halves of Maryland were linked for the first time by the long Chesapeake Bay Bridge, which replaced a nearby ferry service. This bridge (and its later, parallel span) increased tourist traffic to Ocean City, which experienced a building boom. Soon after, the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel allowed long-distance interstate motorists to bypass downtown Baltimore, while the earlier Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge allowed them to bypass Washington, D.C. Two beltways, I-695 and I-495, were built around Baltimore and Washington, while I-70, I-270, and later I-68 linked central Maryland with western Maryland, and I-97 linked Baltimore with Annapolis. Passenger and freight steamboat transportation, previously very important throughout the Chesapeake Bay and its many tributaries, came to an end in mid-century. In 1980, the opening of Harborplace and the Baltimore Aquarium made that city a significant tourist destination, while Charles Center, the World Trade Center, and the popular Camden Yards baseball stadium were constructed in the downtown area. Fells Point also became popular. The historic Annapolis waterfront area, previously a working-class fishing port, also became gentrified and a tourist destination. Baltimore's largest employer, the Bethlehem Steel factory at Sparrows Point, shrunk, and the General Motors plant closed, while Johns Hopkins University and Health Care System took Bethlehem's place as Baltimore's largest employer. There are over 350 biotechnology companies in the state. The Social Security ‚Äì Health Care Financing Administration, Bureau of Standards, U.S. Census Bureau, National Institutes of Health, National Security Agency,and Public Health Service have their headquarters in the state. Metrorail lines were constructed in Montgomery and Prince George's counties, while Baltimore opened its own Metro Subway as well as the north‚Äìsouth Baltimore Light Rail system. In addition to general suburban growth, specially planned new communities sprung up, most notably Columbia, but also Montgomery Village, Belair at Bowie, St. Charles, Cross Keys, and Joppatowne, and numerous shopping malls, the state's three largest malls being Annapolis Mall, Arundel Mills and the Towson Town Center. Community colleges were established in nearly every county in Maryland. Large-scale, mechanized poultry farms became prevalent on the lower Eastern Shore, along with irrigated vegetable farming. In Southern Maryland tobacco farming had nearly vanished by the century's end, due to suburban housing development and a state tobacco incentive buy-out program. Industrial, railroad, and coal-mining jobs in the four westernmost counties declined, but that area's economy was helped by expansion of outdoor recreational tourism and new technology jobs and industries. As the 21st century dawned, Maryland joined neighboring states in a new initiative to save the health of Chesapeake Bay, whose aquatic life and seafood industry are threatened by waterfront residential development, as well as by fertilizer and livestock waste entering the bay, especially from Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River. In addition, about of Maryland shore are eroded per year due to the land sinking and rising sea levels. In 2013, Maryland abolished capital punishment.

As a concept, with no particular reason for associating one gender over another, Shai was sometimes considered female, rather than the more usual understanding of being male, in which circumstance Shai was referred to as Shait (simply the feminine form of the name). His name reflects his function, as it means (that which is) ordained.The Daimon in Hellenistic Astrology: Origins and Influence By Dorian Gieseler Greenbaum As the god of fate, it was said that he determined the span of each man's life, and was present at the judgement of the soul of the deceased in the Duat. In consequence, he was sometimes identified as the husband of Mesenet, goddess of birth, or, in later years, of Renenutet, who assigned the Ren, and had become considered goddess of fortune. Because of the power associated in the concept, Akhenaten, in introducing monotheism, said that Shai was an attribute of Aten, whereas Ramses II claimed to be lord of Shai (i.e. lord of fate). During Ptolemaic Egypt, Shai, as god of fate, was identified with the Greek god Agathodaemon, who was the god of fortune telling. Thus, since Agathodaemon was considered to be a serpent, and the word Shai was also the Egyptian word for pig, in the Hellenic period, Shai was sometimes depicted as a serpent-headed pig, known to Egyptologists as the Shai animal.
