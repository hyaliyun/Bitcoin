Picioane attended Essendon Grammar and was captain of the Vic Metro Under 16s and Under 17s the played in the victorious Vic Metro at the 1997 AFL Under 18 Championships. Picioane started his career in 1998 with Adelaide but found it difficult to find a regular spot with a side that had won a premiership the previous season. He failed to play a senior game for Adelaide in 1999 and at the end of the season he was traded to Hawthorn for pick 79 in the upcoming draft. Playing mostly in the midfield, Picioane managed 58 games in his five years at Hawthorn before being delisted at the end of the 2004 season. Early in the 2004 season, Piciaone was with Danny Jacobs when Jacobs was caught drink driving. After initially lying about Picioane's involvement, both players were fined $5000 and suspended from playing for a week. He then joined North Melbourne for the 2005 season. Lance suffered a range of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, during his football playing days and this led him down a path of substance abuse. In 2012, he sought professional assistance, and, after going \\"cold turkey\\" from substances, he walked from Sydney to Melbourne (with his mother in a support vehicle) to raise awareness of mental illness. In 2013 he founded an organisation 'Love Me Love You' which aims to improve and empower the lives of young people with mental health and substance abuse issues. He is currently playing with Kerang in the Central Murray Football League. His father, Joe Picioane, was a soccer player who represented the Australia national soccer team in 1978 and 1979. He is of Romanian descent.

It was designed for MACLISP by Vaughan Pratt and subsequently ported to Common Lisp. The notation of CGOL is a traditional infix notation, in the style of ALGOL, rather than Lisp's traditional, uniformly-parenthesized prefix notation syntax. The CGOL parser is based on Pratt's design for top-down operator precedence parsing, sometimes informally referred to as a \\"Pratt parser\\". Semantically, CGOL is essentially just Common Lisp, with some additional reader and printer support. CGOL may be regarded as a more successful incarnation of some of the essential ideas behind the earlier LISP 2 project. Lisp 2 was a successor to LISP 1.5 that aimed to provide ALGOL syntax. LISP 2 was abandoned, whereas it is possible to use the CGOL codebase today. This is because unlike LISP 2, CGOL is implemented as portable functions and macros written in Lisp, requiring no alterations to the host Lisp implementation. Syntax Special notations are available for many commonly used Common Lisp operations. For example, one can write a matrix multiply routine as: for i in 1 to n do for k in 1 to n do (ac := 0; for j in 1 to n do ac := ac + a(i,j)*b(j,k); c(i,k) := ac) CGOL has an infix \`.\` operation (referring to Common Lisp's \`cons\` function) and the infix \`@\` operation (referring to Common Lisp's \`append\` function): a.(b@c) = (a.b)@c The preceding example corresponds to this text in native Common Lisp: (EQUAL (CONS A (APPEND B C)) (APPEND (CONS A B) C)) CGOL uses \`of\` to read and set properties: 'father' of x := 'brother' of relative of y The preceding example corresponds to this text in native Common Lisp: (PUTPROP X (GET (GET Y RELATIVE) 'BROTHER) 'FATHER) This illustrates how CGOL notates a function of two arguments: \\\\x,y; 1/sqrt(x**2 + y**2) The preceding example corresponds to this text in native Common Lisp: (LAMBDA (X Y) (QUOTIENT 1 (SQRT (PLUS (EXPT X 2) (EXPT Y 2))))) The syntax of CGOL is data-driven and so both modifiable and extensible.  Status and source code  CGOL is known to work on Armed Bear Common Lisp. The CGOL source code and some text files containing discussions of it are available as freeware from Carnegie-Mellon University's Artificial Intelligence Repository.  References  Pratt, Vaughan R.

He is known exclusively from the medieval Georgian chronicles which make him either 22nd or 24th in the royal list of Iberia and merely relates that Mihrdat was the son of Bakur I. Professor Cyril Toumanoff hypothesized that there was the other Iberian king, Amazasp III (r. 260-265), at that time, probably installed as an anti-king by Shapur I, Great King of Iran. This Amazasp is known from the Sassanid inscriptions, but is unattested in Georgian literary sources.Rapp, Stephen H.

Biography Lau was born in Hong Kong in 1955 to Lau Pak Chau (1922–2008), a public health inspector and amateur painter, and Tse Kwan Fong (1931–1988). He has 2 older brothers and 2 younger sisters. He graduated in Electrical Engineering at the University of Hong Kong in 1977. He obtained a master's degree from the Department of Electronics, the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1980. Subsequently, he published a paper on the analysis of constant-capacitance deep-level transient spectroscopy by negative feedback theory in 1982. For his PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Pennsylvania State University, Pennsylvania, USA in 1987 he worked on transparent conductive thin films like tin oxide, indium oxide and zinc oxide. Then he served as a post-doctoral student in the same laboratory to work on PECVD silicon nitride samples from IBM. New insight was gained regarding hysteresis in the C-V characteristics and how to suppress it in MNS (metal-nitride-silicon) capacitors. (Please see references [1]–[3].) Lau served as lecturer and then senior lecturer in the National University of Singapore from 1988 to 1997. Lau worked on gallium arsenide and gallium nitride devices and materials. He developed the \\"true oxide electron beam induced current\\" (TOEBIC) technique to study local defects in insulating thin films. TOEBIC can be applied to MOS capacitors. Dr. Lau's theory was that local defects in the oxide and local defects in silicon could be distinguished when electron beam induced current was performed on M/SiO2/Si capacitor structures. (Please see references [4]–[6].) He proposed to use PECVD silicon nitride / polyimide dual passivation for AlGaN/GaN HEMT (high electron mobility transistor). When PECVD silicon nitride is thick, there is mechanical stress problem. It may also have pinholes. Polyimide can be quite thick without stress problem but it is not a good barrier for moisture. Thick polyimide can cover up the pinholes in the PECVD silicon nitride below. The two combined together with polyimide on top of the nitride can be a practical and better approach. In addition, the dielectric constant of polyimide (about 3.5) is smaller than that of PECVD silicon nitride (about 7), resulting in less parasitic capacitance. (Please see references [7].) Dr. Lau also worked on Ohmic contact technology for GaN and AlGaN/GaN HEMT. He noticed that the presence of a small quantity of moisture in the rapid thermal annealing chamber is particularly bad for Ohmic contact on AlGaN/GaN HEMT wafers. However, this is less serious for Ohmic contact on GaN only. (Please see references [8].) Dr. Lau has also published a paper on low frequency noise in polysilicon emitter bipolar transistors in 1992. Basically, the application of a very thin layer of interfacial oxide between the polysilicon emitter and the single-crystalline emitter can help to increase the current gain. However, this approach will very significantly increase low frequency noise probably because of tunnelling 1/f noise. During 1997–1998, he worked on embedded DRAM technology in Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, Singapore. He studied the mechanism of under-sensitive test structures and over-sensitive test structures. He pointed out that if this is properly understood, electrical failure analysis can be more easily achieved by electrical testing at the test structure level instead of at the product engineering level. This will make the job of DRAM yield enhancement easier. Dr. Lau became an associate professor in the Nanyang Technological University since 2001. He was the first in making a correlation between the leakage current of ultrathin tantalum pentoxide (one of the high-κ dielectric) films with defect states detected by zero-bias thermally stimulated current. Most scientists cannot see any relationship between the leakage current in tantalum oxide (tantalum pentoxide) and the defect states detected by thermally stimulated current. For example, Dr. Yasushiro Nishioka (Japan) could not see any relationship between the leakage current and the defect states detected by thermally stimulated current (private communication). Dr. Lau managed to see the relationship between the leakage current and the defect states and published his theory in various papers. He invented \\"zero temperature gradient zero bias thermally stimulated current\\" as a method to detect defect states in ultrathin high-κ dielectric films. This was patented as US Patent 6909273 in 2005. (Please also see reference [9].) In addition, he has also developed a technique known as \\"two-scan zero-bias thermally stimulated current\\" when an insulator or semiconductor has some traps that can be filled at low temperature and some traps that can only be filled at relatively high temperature. (Please see reference [10].) He also worked on Cu/kow-κ back-end-of-line (BEOL) technology. (Please see reference [11].) He also wrote various papers on MOS transistors. For example, he worked on the application of strain engineering to CMOS technology. He pointed out that if tensile stress can increase the on current of n-channel MOS transistors, tensile stress will also increase the off current. Then he proposed a theory why tensile stress can improve n-channel MOS transistors even though there is an increase in the off current. A lady graduate student, Peizhen Yang, was recruited to work on research in this direction. (Please see references [12] & [13].) Similarly, his theory can be applied to the study of p-channel MOS transistors with the conventional <110> channel or the newer <100> channel. (Please see reference [14].) He also studied the reduction of boron lateral channelling (physics) due to switching from the conventional <110> channel to the newer <100> channel. Dr. Lau also studied the theory of electron mobility in Si-based MOSFET. In 2005, Dr. Lau pointed out as Lau's hypothesis that \\"remote Coulombic scattering\\" is only important in the subthreshold region and in the region slightly above threshold. (Please see reference [15].) Dr. Lau also explained the observation of anomalous narrow channel effect in very short p-channel MOSFET. This effect is relatively weak in n-channel MOSFET. An explanation why this effect is strong in PMOS but weak in NMOS has been proposed by Dr. Lau; p-type dopants like boron tends to segregate into the STI oxide while n-type dopants tend to accumulate at the STI oxide/Si interface. (Please see references [16] & [17].) Dr. Lau is also interested in quasi-ballistic transport in MOS transistors and has published his theory on it. (Please see reference [18].) Instead of a carrier saturation velocity according to convention velocity saturation theory, an effective saturation velocity can be defined. It turns out that the value of effective saturation velocity in real-life MOS transistors is similar to established values of the carrier saturation velocity. However, Dr. Lau pointed out that the effective saturation velocity can be a function of the gate voltage. Besides semiconductor materials and devices research, Dr. Lau also works privately on the research of traditional Chinese medicine, foot or hand reflexology, \\"unrefreshing sleep\\", chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, toothache, etc. For example, he noticed that there are two toothache mechanisms according to his personal experience: (A) Mechanism according to Western medicine and (B) Mechanism according to traditional Chinese medicine. He had direct experience of toothache that can be easily explained by Western medicine and also a kind of toothache that cannot be explained by Western dental theory but can be explained by traditional Chinese medicine. Thus the two mechanisms are not contradictory. They are actually complementary. The solution of the second kind of toothache is explained in various books on traditional Chinese medicine. However, those solutions are too complicated or inconvenient for an ordinary person living in the Western World; Dr. Lau has privately developed a much simpler and convenient solution (unpublished). Dr. Lau is also interested in the application of Oldenlandia diffusa (a Chinese herb) to treat some medical problems. He has also worked on the application of infrared spectroscopy to semiconductor materials. He has published a book Infrared Characterization for Microelectronics, World Scientific, Singapore, 1999. He has also developed some new insight regarding the application of Raman spectroscopy to health problems. He has also done some work on control theory and applied it to his research. The application of negative feedback control to a chaotic system is highly challenging. He has developed some insight on the practical feedback control of chaotic systems. Dr. Lau has developed a theory regarding the symmetry of the I-V characteristics of high-κ dielectric capacitor structures [19]. In addition, he has proposed an \\"extended unified Schottky-Poole-Frenkel theory\\" [20]. Furthermore, he observed Poole-Frenkel saturation experimentally [21]. =Personal= Dr. Lau married Sin Shuk Ying in 1989 and they had one daughter, Florence Lau Pui Yan born in 1991.

Early life and career Melissanidis was born in Munich, Germany to parents Evaggelos and Aikaterini, Greek nationals who were working in Germany. He has two siblings, Maria and Spiros.

Cheney, Catholic-Hierarchy.org, Grasse (Diocese), retrieved: 2017-06-12. It was originally suffragan to the Archbishop of Aix, and then to the Archbishop of Embrun.Gallia christiana III, p. 1145. The bishopric moved from Antibes to Grasse in 1244. It remained at Grasse Cathedral until the French Revolution. It was suppressed by the Concordat of 1801, its territory passing to the diocese of Nice. History The city of Antibes was a colony of the Greek city of Massilia (Marseille). The Romans included it in the Alpes Maritimae. In church organization, Antibes belonged to the Province of Alpes Maritimae, whose Metropolitan was the Archbishop of Aix.Gallia christiana I (Paris 1716), Notitia provinciarum (unpaginated prefatory matter). Its Metropolitan later, before 1056, became the Archbishop of Embrun.Gallia christiana III, Instrumenta p. 179. The first known Bishop of Antibes is Armentarius who attended the Council of Vaison in 442. Louis DuchesneDuchesne (1907), Fastes épiscopaux I, p. 101 n. 2. Duchesne is certain he was not bishop of Aix. considered it possible that the Remigius, who signed at the Council of Nîmes in 396C. Munier, Concilia Galliae, A. 314 – A. 506 (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 51. and in 417 received a letter from Pope Zosimus,Nothing in the letter indicates Remigius' diocese. Zosimus was pope only in 417 and 418. may have been Bishop of Antibes before Armentarius.In 1890, is clear that the first known bishop of Antibes was Armentarius. Ralph Matheson, however, believes that this Remigius was Remigius of Aix. On 19 July 1244, Pope Innocent IV transferred the seat of the diocese from the port city of Antibes to the interior city of Grasse, due to a depopulation of Antibes and the repeated attacks of pirates, propter insalubritatem aeris et incursus piratorum.Gallia christiana III, p. 1145. gives a date of 19 July 1243, but the Pope was not at Genoa in 1243; he was at Anagni awaiting his coronation. In 1181, King Idelfonso of Aragon granted Bishop Fulco of Antibes the seigneural rights over the city of Antibes.Tisserant, p. 114. The cathedral of Grasse was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and was supervised by a Chapter composed of (originally) five dignities (Provost, Sacristan, Archdeacon, 'capiscolo' [Scholasticus] and Archpriest) and four Canons (one of whom was designated the Theologus). The office of Provost, however, was abolished on 30 July 1692.Gallia christiana III, p. 1160-1161. Cf. Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 211 note 1. In 1752 there were 5 dignities and 10 canons, according to Ritzler- Sefrin, VI, p. 228 note 1. The office of Archdeacon of Grasse was established by Bishop Bernardo de Castronovo on 16 May 1421.Gallia christiana III, p. 1169. The terms of the decree were revised on 4 March 1422. The diocese of Grasse was suppressed by decree of the Legislative Assembly of France on 22 November 1790.Sénéquier, p. 46. The arrondissement of Grasse was separated from the diocese of Fréjus in 1886, and given to the bishopric of Nice which since unites the three former Dioceses of Nice, Grasse and Vence.

Hakonechloa macra, with the common names Hakone grass and Japanese forest grass, is the only species in the monotypic genus. It is endemic to Japan.Makino, Tomitarô ex Honda, Masaji. 1930. Journal of the Faculty of Science: University of Tokyo, Section 3, Botany 3: 113Tropicos, Hakonechloa Makino ex Honda Description Hakonechloa macra is a small, mostly shade-loving, clump-forming bunchgrass, slowly spreading in circumference. The stalks cascade in a graceful rounded fountain shape somewhat reminiscent of Pennisetum (fountain grass) but with the actual leaves resembling Chasmanthium. The species tends to be between 45 cm and 60 cm (18\\" to 24\\") in height. The leaves are thin and papery and resemble many forms of bamboo. They are very flexible and have a distinctive rustling sound when the wind blows that adds to their appeal. The foliage rises from the roots on thin wiry stalks. The leaf blades are green but many color variations exist. The papery texture keeps the foliage cool to the touch and often the surface is slightly puckered or rippled. The flowers bloom in midsummer from leaf nodes near the ends of the stalks. The flowers are light purple fading to tan then dropping off over the course of several weeks. Cultivation Hakonechloa macra is grown as an ornamental plant, for use in gardens and as a potted plant. The various cultivars of Hakonechloa macra are used as foliage plants in gardens in temperate climates. The species and the cultivars ‘Alboaurea’ and ‘Aureola’ have gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit. =Cultivars= The cultivars of Hakonechloa macra may be green, or boldly variegated in stripes of white, green, or yellow, or have solid colored leaves. Some cultivars tend to turn orange or red in colder weather. The cultivars often grow significantly shorter in height than the species. The height may also be somewhat dependent on soil moisture, nutrients, and length of growing season. The plant is tough enough to survive in USDA Zone 5, . It prefers even moisture and average humidity, but can tolerate minor dry spells and arid climates (with irrigation) with minimal damage. It is mainly used as an ornamental grass in Japanese style gardens, or to brighten shady areas of the garden. The graceful form tends to soften formal shady areas as well. Solid green leaves are the hallmark of the species. The green form is the fastest grower and tends to be slightly larger than most cultivars, and is mildly sun tolerant though it may burn if not given adequate shade. The foliage tends to be deep bright green and may have orange, red or purple tones to some degree in the fall.Big Dipper Farm, Grown on the Third Planet from the Sun, Hakonechloa Solid foliage colors Solid foliage color variations include: *Hakonechloa macra 'All Gold' This solid color variety has leaves that range from pale yellow to gold to deep lime green depending on sun exposure. The more sun the brighter the yellow tends to be. Too much sun will cause scorching. Plants in full shade will tend to be much greener and may be difficult to distinguish from other cultivars. *Hakonechloa macra 'Beni-Kaze' The leaves of Beni-Kaze, (Japanese for Red Wind) are green throughout most of the growing season but as cool weather approaches red pigments flush into the leaves turning them bright red to reddish-purple in autumn. It averages to in height. *Hakonechloa macra 'Nicolas'Hakonechloa plant named ‘Nicolas’ Developed in France by Olivier Bennato Chez, this cultivar is basically a dwarf version of Beni-Kaze, only reaching 15 cm (about 6\\") or 23 cm (9\\") in bloom (according to the US patent. This information is not cited by most sellers of this plant who state greater average heights, although my professional growing experience verifies the patent info). The cool season color varies from orange to red shades and is most pronounced in autumn. Variegated foliage colors Variegated foliage color variations include: *Hakonechloa macra 'Aureola' This is the most common variegated cultivar. The foliage is striped bright gold and apple green, with gold predominating which may tend toward pink in autumn. Height averages between and . This cultivar was the 2009 Perennial Plant Association's pick for Plant of the Year. Additionally, the Royal Horticultural Society have given this cultivar their prestigious Award of Garden Merit (AGM). *Hakonechloa macra 'Sunny Delight' This variety is a reversal of the variegation of 'Aureola'. The majority of the leaf is green with narrow yellow stripes and jetting toward the base of the blade giving it a much darker look than 'Aureola'. Height averages to . It is one of the more vigorous forms, as the variegation makes up less of the leaf area than many variegated forms. *Hakonechloa macra 'Albostriata' This cultivar is green with cream to pure white stripes along the leaves. Foliage variegation is similar to 'Sunny Delight'. The variegation shows little to no yellow and may blush pink in spring and in autumn, though it looks mostly green from a distance. This is one of the more vigorous variegated cultivars. Height averages to . *Hakonechloa macra 'Fubuki' One of the slowest and smallest varieties available, this grass is a reverse variegation of 'Albostriata'. The foliage of 'Fubuki' (or Blizzard in Japanese) is almost completely white with sparse green stripes and jetting. Like many nearly white plants, this cultivar is not very vigorous however it can be stunning in the landscape. It will burn in high light, and prefers a cool shady location. 'Fubuki' usually maxes out at about to . *Hakonechloa macra 'Naomi'Plant Genius Hakonechloa plant named \`Naomi\` This dwarf cultivar was discovered in the same French trial gardens as 'Nicolas'. The foliage is similar to 'Aureola' with cream to yellow variegation but the fall color is deep reddish purple. *Hakonechloa macra 'Stripe It Rich' This cultivar is a yellow and white variegated variety, essentially a variegated form of 'All Gold'. The foliage varies from lime green to yellow with white stripes and jetting. This is currently (2012) the most recently discovered cultivar. It averages about tall. =Propagation= Hakonechloa macra can be easily propagated by division. The rootball has many stalks coming up from a dense rhizomatous cluster of roots. Apparent on the rhizome are small buds that look like thorns. These are new shoots and with care they can be removed from the root cluster with a small segment of rhizome taking care to include connected roots. When planted and properly cared for, the grass will root and spread to form a clonal selection of the grass. Horticultural tissue culture may also be utilized by propagators with the appropriate equipment. Etymology Hakonechloa: Derived from Japanese and Greek, meaning ‘Hakone grass’. Named for the Hakone hot springs region near Mount Hakone in Honshu, Japan.Gledhill, David (2008). \\"The Names of Plants\\". Cambridge University Press. (hardback), (paperback). pp 189, 246 Macra: Derived from Greek, meaning ‘big’, ‘large, ‘long’, ‘deep’, ‘tall’, or ‘far’.

These institutes perform a large part of the applied research in the Netherlands, each within its own specific field of technology. As an independent non-profit organisation, the NLR is the aerospace-knowledge enterprise in the Netherlands and provides high-quality technical support to the aerospace sector. Organisation NLR perform research and develop technology in the field of aviation and space travel. Work under research contracts (national and international, government and industry) amounts to 75 percent of NLR's activities, the remaining 25 percent is funded by the Dutch government for basic demand-oriented research programmes and development of research equipment. Depending on the project NLR acts as a sole contractor or as a subcontractor co-operating with other institutes or partners from industry.  History  The RSL, the predecessor of NLR, was officially founded on 5 April 1919, shortly after the First World War. Although air power did not play a decisive role during this war, aeronautics had nevertheless progressed very rapidly during that period. Aeronautics developed slowly in the Netherlands during the first two decades of this century when compared to the neighbouring countries, as for example France. After the Armistice, 11 November 1918, the aeronautical community started to concentrate on the application of the newly obtained skills and experience. The Government appointed a committee to review the possibilities of aerial applications. The year 1919 saw many new initiatives. On Saturday 5 April 1919 (when Saturday was a normal working day), the new Laboratory of the RSL was officially opened in the presence of representatives of the Government in a building at the Navy Yard in Amsterdam. However, at this official opening there was already a laboratory in operation. The laboratory RSL was given an excellent start, although the human and material resources were limited. In his opening speech Prof. L.A. van Royen emphasized that the RSL should develop free and open communications with the aeronautical world and in turn the RSL should be assisted to come into contact with those who are interested in the activities of RSL. The interested parts should also be able to influence the activities of RSL. The RSL was originated at offices belonging to the Ministry of Defence mainly as a result of the aviation activities of the Army (since 1913) and the Navy (since 1917). The groundwork for the foundation of RSL started during World War I in 1917, when civil aviation in the Netherlands was non-existent. On 1 January 1920 the RSL was transfer from the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry of Public Works because after the war the defence spending was cut drastically and civil aviation appeared in the horizon. As early as 1922, the Minister of Public Works proposed to terminate RSL. The main argument was that the annual funding was considered extravagant. Fortunately nothing happened immediately and the dispute continued for many years. When in 1918 the RSL was planned, the location at the Navy Yard in Amsterdam was meant as a temporary site only. Prof. van Royen intended to establish a permanent laboratory in Delft, in close association with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). However, the university apparently was not too eager to accommodate the RSL, probably because of the problems encountered in the 1920s after the RSL became part of the Ministry of Public Works. Also, flight testing had become an important part of the activities and several people felt that a location close to Schiphol and Fokker was more important than being close to TU Delft. The RSL essentially developed along the lines as planned during 1918–1919, till it was converted in the independent Foundation NLL in 1937. The only major change in its formal task took place when a separate Department of Civil Aviation (RLD) was created to supervise airworthiness and aircraft operations in the Netherlands. However this did not have much effect on the technical content of the work of the RSL; it was a separation of responsibilities. This shift of responsibilities was related to the desire of the aircraft industry in the 1930s to have a national laboratory to which all interested parts would have access on an equal basis, according to Ir. A.J. Marx. The centre piece of the laboratory was an Eiffel type wind tunnel. The construction of the wind tunnel was complicated because with only limited information available, Dr. Ir. E.B. Wolff managed to produce an operational tunnel by March 1919 and it was shown at the official opening of the RSL. The tunnel – essentially a pipe with two open ends – had the air drawn from the room in which the tunnel was placed and it was exhausted into that same room at the other end. It must be assumed that he decided on an Eiffel type tunnel because of the size and limitations of the building and on the results published by Eiffel. Through this arrangement he achieved at least a facility of reasonable size and Reynolds Number. The tunnel had an open test section and, with a maximum power of 30 Horsepower, the mean velocity at the 1.6 meter diameter test section was 25 m/s. However, the uniformity of the flow across the test section was quite unsatisfactory and large fluctuations in time occurred. After investigations of the flow in the wind tunnel, several modifications were introduced. The result was that by July 1920 a fairly uniform and steady air flow of about 35 m/s in the test section was obtained. This tunnel was used extensively for a period of 20 years for a variety of aeronautical and non-aeronautical tests and, apart from smaller research facilities which were built at TU Delft, it was the only wind tunnel available for aeronautical development in the Netherlands till 1940. In the meantime Wolff and Koning carried out studies for new wind tunnel facilities. As a result, two closed type wind tunnels were built in the new laboratory at Sloterweg in Amsterdam that became fully operational in 1940. One was the LST 3 x 2 m² which was large enough to simulate powered aircraft flight and a smaller, the LST 1.5 x 1.5 m² tunnel for research purposes and non-aeronautical wind tunnel testing. They were the main low speed aerodynamics facilities for over 40 years till the DNW (the joint venture with the German sister organisation DLR) became operational in 1980, followed by the LST 3 x 2.25 m² of NLR, both in the Noordoostpolder. During the five years of the Second World War the total contract work-load of the laboratory decreased dramatically although the personnel increased by 40%.NLR Annual Reports of 1944 and 1945 However, it appears that a large number of subjects were studied in depth. When the Allied Forces entered the Netherlands in September 1944 the situation changed very dramatically. The food and fuel supply, already at a bare minimum, practically stopped. Everybody at the laboratory was mentally occupied with the problems of war, survival, food and fuel. It took several months after the Liberation Day on 5 May 1945 for the normal operations of the laboratory to become re-established. Although the laboratory did not incur physical damage during the war, it was not in good condition after the war. Above that, until 1952 there was a political climate unfavourable to NLL especially in terms of financial support for the expansion plans of the NLL that included a HST, among other facilities. The year 1950 marked the beginning of international co-operation and cross utilisation of facilities between NLL and ONERA. On 23 February 1955 a contract between AICMA-CIPS and NLL was signed which stipulated that NLL would make available the HST to members of AICMA for up to 50% of the available testing time. Later, in 1976, a two-nation aeronautical test facility, the DNW of Germany and the Netherlands, became a reality, and it took until 1988 when finally a four-nation (France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands) aeronautical test facility, the ETW, was opened. In 1957, after a period of deliberations and negotiations, an area of 2 square kilometres was purchased in the Noordoostpolder (NOP). In 1958 the first NLR employees started working there. Since then there has been a gradual shift of activities from Amsterdam the NOP and several buildings were added. On 5 April 2019 the Netherlands Aerospace Centre celebrate their 100th anniversary. At the same day they received the honorary title 'Royal'.

Sites A staff of approximately 650 people is employed at two sites, one located in Amsterdam, and the other in Marknesse (about 100 km north-east of Amsterdam). Over two-thirds of the staff are graduates from universities or technical colleges, with a large variety in specialised professions such as aerospace engineers, psychologists, mathematicians and physicists. Such variety is necessary for ensuring the broad expertise that is needed for coping with the most challenging problems in the aerospace sector. At its two sites NLR owns several sophisticated aerospace research facilities, including different wind tunnels, such as the Low Speed Wind tunnel, the Transonic and the Supersonic Wind Tunnel. Exploitation of these wind tunnels and the wind tunnels of DLR have been entrusted to the foundation German-Dutch wind tunnels (DNW), which also includes a large facility in the Noordoostpolder in which Germany and the Netherlands have a share of 50%. Facilities NLR has a laboratory airplane, a Cessna Citation II (PH-LAB), latter shared with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). { align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"center\\"  } NLR has developed different flight simulators for research on aircraft and helicopters. NLR conducts research on future concepts in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) using its advanced proprietary simulation platform, the NLR ATC Research Simulator (NARSIM). NARSIM consists of two physical instantiations, one for en-route ATC (NARSIM-Radar) and one for airport tower controllers (NARSIM-Tower) with a 360-degrees field-of-view visual system. NARSIM is also used for performance of technology verification and validation activities as well as air traffic controller training. NLR has installations in which airplane constructions on full scale, components and test samples can be tested. Equipment and software for development of construction of parts for airplanes and space vehicles are also available. For development and construction of composites a special laboratory has been arranged. Moreover, the NLR has instrumentation for flight tests, and several specialized apparatus for development of avionics. Facilities for testing antenna and conduction of so-called environmental tests are used to test several equipments. In the micromechanics workplace the NLR develops models and instruments for wind tunnel tests. The computer network of the NLR contains a supercomputer for the implementation of extensive aerodynamic and structural calculations.

All solid state micrometre sized supercapacitors; based on advanced superionic conductors i.e. nanoionic supercapacitors, have of late gained recognition as critical electron components of future sub-voltage and deep sub-voltage nanoelectronics and related technologies. Supercapacitors based on advanced superionic conductors were developed several decades ago, however the capacity density of their functional heterojunctions (disordered crystal structure) is 100 -10 microF/cm2 at frequencies ~0,01–1000 Hz. Low operation frequencies of such heterojunctions are the result of violations of fast ion transport conditions in molecular-thin double electric layer on the heterojunctions. The major approach to nanoionics of advanced superionic conductors is to retain the concentration and potential barrier heights to mobile ion jumps on functional heterojunctions at the level of those in the volume. Nanoionic supercapacitors should be devices with fast ion transport in double electric layer and record high capacity-frequency characteristics.

McDonald is the director of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory Collaboration and held the Gordon and Patricia Gray Chair in Particle Astrophysics at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario from 2006 to 2013. He was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics jointly with Japanese physicist Takaaki Kajita.  Early life  McDonald was born on August 29, 1943, in Sydney, Nova Scotia. He graduated with a B.Sc. in physics in 1964 and M.Sc. in physics in 1965 from Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. He then obtained his Ph.D. in physics in 1969 from the California Institute of Technology. McDonald cited a high school math teacher and his first-year physics professor at Dalhousie as his inspirations for going into the field of physics.  Academic career  McDonald worked as a Research Officer at the Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories northwest of Ottawa from 1969 to 1982. He became professor of physics at Princeton University from 1982 to 1989, leaving Princeton to join Queen's University where he became Professor from 1989 to 2013. McDonald was a visiting scientist at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva in 2004. In 2013 McDonald became Professor Emeritus of Queen's University in Kingston, Canada. He continues to be active in basic research in Neutrinos and Dark Matter at the SNOLAB underground Laboratory and as member of the Board of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. His visiting positions include CERN, University of Washington (1978), Los Alamos National Laboratory (1981), University of Hawaii (2004, 2009), University of Oxford (2003, 2009), Queen's University (1988).  Research  McDonald presenting himself and his research Physicists have been investigating whether or not neutrinos have mass. Since the late 1960s, experiments have hinted that neutrinos may have mass. Theoretical models of the Sun predict that neutrinos should be made in large numbers. Neutrino detectors on the Earth have repeatedly seen fewer than the expected number of neutrinos. Because neutrinos come in three varieties (electron, muon, and tau neutrinos), and because solar neutrino detectors have been primarily sensitive only to electron neutrinos, the preferred explanation over the years is that those \\"missing\\" neutrinos had changed, or oscillated, into a variety for which the detectors had little or no sensitivity. If a neutrino oscillates, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, then it must have a mass. In 1984, McDonald's collaborator Herb Chen at the University of California at Irvine suggested the advantages of using heavy water as a detector for solar neutrinos. Unlike previous detectors, using heavy water would make the detector sensitive to two reactions, one reaction sensitive to all neutrino flavours, the other sensitive to only the electron neutrino. Thus, such a detector could measure neutrino oscillations directly. Chen, McDonald, and collaborators formed the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) to exploit this idea in 1984. SNO was to be a detector facility using 1000 tonnes of heavy water located underground in a mine outside Sudbury, Ontario. Chen died of leukemia in November 1987, however. In August 2001, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, now led by McDonald, reported observations that directly suggested electron neutrinos from the Sun were oscillating into muon and tau neutrinos. McDonald is a co- recipient of the 2007 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics, the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics, and the 2015 Fundamental Physics Prize for the discovery of neutrino oscillations and demonstrating that neutrinos have mass.  Humanitarian work  In the spring of 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing shortages, McDonald became one of the leaders of a project to mass- produce mechanical ventilators at low cost. McDonald has stated that the idea came from discussions with his Italian colleagues about the similarities between the requirements of a ventilator and those of particle physics experiments. The design, called the Mechanical Ventilator Milano, is based on the Manley ventilator but uses modern electronics wherever possible. The details, first published on March 23 by about 150 collaborators, were released under the CERN Open Hardware License. The project received the support of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who anticipated an initial order of 30,000 to Canadian hospitals. Prototypes, which can be built for less than $1,000, are controlled remotely with an interface written in PyQt.

(c. 1485–1548) was an Italian Cardinal and papal legate. He was from a noble family in Milan, the eighth child of Giovanni Trivulzio di Borgomanero, a Councillor of the Dukes of Milan, and Angela (or Agnolina, or Anna) Martinengo of Brescia, and was the nephew of Cardinal Gianantonio (or Antonio) Trivulzio (1500-1508). Another uncle, Cardinal Antonio's brother Teodoro, was Governor of La Palice, of Genoa (from 1526), of Milan, and a Marshal of France. Giovanni and Angela had a daughter named Damigella or Domtilla who was famous for her learning.Ariosto, Orlando Furioso XLVI. 4. Cardinal Agostino Trivulzio had a nephew named Giovanni, who married Laura Gonzaga. Biography Before going to Rome he was Commendatory (Komtur) of the Benedictine Abbey of SS. Pietro and Paolo at Lodi Vecchio, and Abbot Commendatory of the Cistercian house of Aquafredda (Santa Maria Montisfrigidi) on Lake Como. Fabriczy, p. 187, 202. He was later appointed Cardinal Protector of the Cistercian Order. He was Chamberlain of Honor to Pope Julius II (1503-1513), and then Protonotary Apostolic de numero Participantium, a title he still held when appointed Cardinal.Gualterio, p. xxxv. But when Julius II allied himself with Venice and Spain against France in 1511, Trivulzio left the Papal Court and returned to Milan. The election of Pope Leo X (Medici) in 1513, however, changed the political scene, and Trivulzio returned to court.Fabriczy, p. 187. =Cardinal= In Pope Leo X's fifth Consistory for the creation of cardinals, on 1 July 1517, Agostino Trivulzio was one of thirty-one prelates who were created Cardinals. He was named a Cardinal-Deacon, and on 6 July assigned the Deaconry of S. Adriano, which had once been the ancient Roman Senate House.Gulik and Eubel, pp. 17 and 72. He was named Administrator of the diocese of Reggio Calabria in the Consistory of 24 August 1520 by Pope Leo X; he resigned in September after only one month in favor of his brother Pietro, who held the diocese for three years. Cardinal Agostino then resumed the Administratorship, which he held until 1529.Gulik and Eubel, p. 284. Cardella, p. 67. Obviously this was a family matter, and involved income, not the care of souls. He was named Bishop of Alessano on 3 June 1521, which he resigned in 1526.Gulik and Eubel, p. 103. Conclave of 1521-1522 Pope Leo X died on Sunday, 1 December 1521, at the age of 46. The Conclave to elect his successor should have begun in mid- December, but the Cardinals themselves fixed an opening date of 18 December. When it was learned, however, that the Cardinal of Ivrea, Bonifacio Ferrero, had been detained by Spanish troops at Pavia, the decision was taken to postpone the opening of the Conclave until 26 December. This gave all the participants plenty of time for pratticà (politicking). On Sunday the 22nd, the usual morning Congregation of the Cardinals took place at the house of the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Bernardino de Carvajal, but later in the day, a private meeting was held at the house of Cardinal Colonna, at which fourteen cardinals and representatives of four other cardinals participated. Their object was to stop the election of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, who was the favorite candidate of the Spanish. Among the dissenters were Cardinal Agostino Trivulzio and Cardinal Scaramuccia Trivulzio (\\"Como\\"), both members of the French faction. The large number of candidates (papabili) also worked against Medici by dividing the vote among a dozen or more hopefuls. Medici controlled around fifteen votes, and he was able to block any objectionable candidate by denying him the canonically required two-thirds of the votes; but he realized that he himself was not electable. It was not until 9 January 1522, after the tenth ballot had taken place, that a successful election was achieved, once it was revealed that the Emperor Charles V favored his Regent in Spain, Cardinal Adrian Dedel, Bishop of Tortosa.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1521-1522. Retrieved: 2016-05-14. F. Petruccelli della Gattina, Histoire diplomatique des conclaves Volume I (Paris: 1864), 512-526. Conclave of 1523 Pope Adrian VI died of kidney diseaseBergenroth I (1862), p. 583 no. 595. on 14 September 1523 at the age of sixty-six. The Conclave to elect his successor held its opening ceremonies on Thursday 1 October 1523 with thirty- five cardinals in attendance.Bergenroth I (1862), p. 589, no. 605. Both Trivulzio cardinals, Scaramuzzia and Agostino, were among them. The Conclave was enclosed on 2 October, though security was non-existent. Francis I expressed a preference for Cardinal Fieschi, or Cardinal Soderini (Volterra), or Cardinal Scaramuzzia Trivulzi (Como). Henry VIII supported Cardinal Wolsey, then Cardinal Medici, Cardinal Farnese and Cardinal Campeggio. The Emperor Charles V preferred Cardinal Colonna, who was a personal friend, then Cardinal Medici. His promised support for the English cardinal, Thomas Wolsey, consisted in an announcement by the Duke of Sessa that the Emperor supported Wolsey. But Wolsey was not in Rome, and the Cardinals had sworn never to elect an absentee again. Adrian of Utrecht had been more than enough for them. On 5 October the Cardinals completed their Electoral Capitulations. On the 6th, three French cardinals arrived, François de Castelnau de Clermont, Louis de Bourbon-Vendôme, and Jean de Lorraine, and they brought the news that King Francis was opposed to Cardinal de' Medici.Bergenroth I (1862), p. 593, no. 611. This produced a deadlock between the French and Imperialist parties finally broke on the night of 17/18 November, due to the capitulation of Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, a personal enemy of Medici, and Cardinal Giuliano de' Medici became Pope Clement VII.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1523. Retrieved: 2016-05-14. F. Petruccelli della Gattina, Histoire diplomatique des conclaves Volume I (Paris: 1864), 531-557. More benefices Cardinal Trivulzio was Administrator of the diocese of Bobbio, appointed on 26 September 1522 by Pope Adrian VI; he resigned in favor of his relative Ambrogio Trivulzio, who was appointed Bishop on 27 May 1524.Gulik and Eubel, p. 136. This was probably another case of a cardinalatial benefice being converted into a family position. He was also appointed Administrator of Toulon on 22 June 1524 by Pope Clement VII (Medici), in succession to the late Administrator Cardinal Niccolò Fieschi; Cardinal Trivulzio held the post until 7 June 1535, when he relinquished it to Antonio Trivulzio, the cousin of Cardinal Agostino and the nephew of Cardinal Scaramuccia Trivulzio.Gulik and Eubel, p. 315. Denis de Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana I (Paris 1715), p. 753, states that Antonio Trivulzio was appointed Commendatarius and Administrator Perpetuus on 3 March 1528. The date of 1528 is also given by He was Administrator of Le Puy in 1525, from 15 September to 18 October.Gulik and Eubel, p. 110. He was named Administrator of the diocese of Avranches on 2 May 1526, and he relinquished the post on 19 October 1526 to Jean de Lagniac, a member of the King's Council.Gulik and Eubel, p. 91. In 1524-1525 Cardinal Trivulzio built a villa to the east of Rome, near the source of the Aqua Adria, at Sulmone. It was furnished with gardens, and decorated with antique statuary.Fabriczy, pp. 194-197. =Diplomat= In the Consistory of 7 December 1526 Msgr. Trivulzio was named Legatus de latere of the Marittima and Campania,Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica Vol. 83 (Venezia 1856), p. 82. and sent to the Papal Army which was opposing the aggression of the Colonna forces led by Cardinal Pompeo Colonna in a revolution against Pope Clement VII. Toward the end of March Cardinal Trivulzio was sent to Gaeta to negotiate with the Spanish viceroy of Naples, Lannoy, about the return of some towns seized by Naples and about the return of the papal fleet.Brown, Calendar IV (1871), p. 49 no. 86. He returned to the Curia on 3 April 1527.Gulik and Eubel, p. 17, n. 1. When the forces of Spain, the German Landsknecht, and the Colonna stormed the walls of Rome on 7 May 1527, Cardinal Trivulzio was one of the sixteen cardinals who fled with Pope Clement VII to the apparent sanctuary of the Castel Sant'Angelo. The choice turned out to be a trap, a prison in which the Papal Court was held from May to November. After the 1527 sack of Rome, on 26 November, he was taken as a hostage for good papal behavior. He attempted to escape from the Castel S. Angelo as soon as the treaty was signed, putting on civilian dress and a cloak, but he was recognized and arrested; at the Pope's request, though, he was allowed the freedom of the Castel.Gayangos (ed.), Calendar Simancas III, part 2, p. 475. Creighton, p. 361. The Pope finally left the Castel on 6 December 1527 after seven months in captivity, and immediately headed for Capranica, on his way to Orvieto. The cardinals who were to be hostages were taken to Ostia to await a galley to transport them to Naples.Gayangos (ed.), Calendar Simancas III, part 2, p. 494-495, no. 259. The Imperial forces carried Cardinal Trivulzio off to detention in the Castel Nuovo in Naples.Julia Haig Gaisser, Pierio Valeriano on the Ill Fortune of Learned Men: A Renaissance Humanist, note p. 157. He and Cardinal Pisani were finally released in March 1529 after negotiations and concessions by Clement VII.Gregorovius, VIII, pp. 660-661. Cardinal Trivulzio was appointed Administrator of the diocese of Asti on 25 September 1528 by Pope Clement VII, and he relinquished the position on the appointment of a Bishop on 16 July 1529; when that bishop died in 1536, Cardinal Agostino again assumed the Administratorship, which he enjoyed until 1547.Gulik and Eubel, p. 121. He was subsequently a major pro-French figure in papal diplomacy. In April 1530 he was sent as Nuncio to France, on a mission that lasted a month.Catalogue des actes de François Ier Tome IX (Paris: Imprimerie nationale 1907) [Collection des ordonnances des rois de France], p. 126. The Cardinal was named Administrator of the diocese of Bayeux in 1531,He was named by King Francis and appointed Administrator by Pope Clement VII: Gallia christiana XI (Paris 1759), p. 387. Tirvulzio took possession by proxy on 16 November 1534 after the death of Bishop Pierre de Martigny some ten years earlier; he held the position until his death. Conclave of 1534 In September 1533 Pope Clement VII made a journey to Marseille, having arranged a marriage between his niece Catherine and the second son of King Francis, Henri, Duc d' Anjou. He also arranged to engage in serious peace talks with King Francis and the Emperor Charles. The marriage took place on 28 October in Marseille, but the peace talks, in which the Pope met repeatedly but separately with the two monarchs, produced no resolution of any of the issues. Cardinal Trivulzio was present at the wedding and peace conference.Giovanni Battista Gattico, Acta selecta caeremonialia II (Rome 1753), pp. 172-173. The Pope returned to Rome on 10 December, ill with a fever and stomach problems. In August 1534, Cardinal Trivulzio, who was keeping King Francis I informed about French business in the Roman Curia, wrote that the Pope was suffering from a serious illness and that the doctors believed he was in danger of death.Molini, Documenti di storia italiana II, no 398, p. 379 Clement VII died on 25 September 1534, having lived 56 years and four months, and having reigned for 10 years, 10 months, and 7 days. The Conclave to elect his successor began on the evening of 10 October, with thirty-two cardinals in attendance at the opening ceremonies, one of whom was Agostino Trivulzio. On the 11th, the various bulls governing conclaves were read out, including Pope Julius II's bull against simony, and the cardinals took solemn oaths to observe the bulls. They also voted to accept and authorize the Electoral Capitulations which had been drawn up for the Conclave of 1513, and to use an open ballot with an accessio when the voting began next day. Shortly after sunset on the 11th, however, the representatives of the Imperial and the French factions, Cardinals Ippolito de' Medici and Jean de Lorraine, met with Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, and informed him that there was agreement that he would be the next pope. They escorted him to the Pauline Chapel, where Cardinal Giovanni Piccolomini, the Sub-Dean, pronounced Farnese pope, with the unanimous agreement of the cardinals. The transaction was officially witnessed by the three Masters of Ceremonies, who were also Protonotaries Apostolic. The next morning, 12 October, a written vote was held, and Farnese was elected unanimously, as expected. He chose the name Paul III.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1534. Retrieved: 2016-05-14. Trivulzio was appointed Administrator of the diocese of Brugnato on 21 February 1539, until he resigned on 5 March 1548.Gulik and Eubel, p. 141. He was appointed Administrator of the diocese of Périgueux on 27 August 1541, on the resignation of the previous Administrator, Cardinal Claude de Longwy de Givry; he held the position until his death.Gulik and Eubel, p. 272. Gallia christiana II (Paris 1720), p. 1484, does not mention Trivulzio at all, but does note that his successor, Jean de Lustrac, was appointed bishop by King Henri II on 25 June 1548. Salvador Miranda, The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Biographical Dictionary - Consistory of July 1, 1517 In Consistory on 2 June 1536 Pope Paul III stated that he intended to send legates to the Emperor Charles V, to King Ferdinand, and to King Francis I for the sake of preserving the peace.Barbiche and Dainville-Barbiche, p. 153. He assigned Cardinals Marino Caraccioli, Francisco Quiñones, and Agostino Trivulzio to the task.Gulik and Eubel, p. 24 n. 8. Trivulzio received his credentials as Legate on 14 June; he had an interview with the Emperor at Savigliano, south of Turin, on 9 July. He arrived at the French Court at Lyon on 21 July, and departed on 16 October. He submitted his comprehensive report to the Pope on 4 November 1536.Catalogue des actes de François Ier Tome IX (Paris: Imprimerie nationale 1907) [Collection des ordonnances des rois de France], p. 127.

Playboating Playboating is sometimes performed on dynamic moving features such as haystacks (large boils) and whirlpools, or on flat water (this is often referred to as flatwheeling).

He was mostly active in Spain, as he was born when the kingdoms of Portugal and Spain were in a dynastic union. Life Manuel Machado was born in Lisbon and studied at the Claustra college of the Lisbon Cathedral with the renowned composer Duarte Lobo. He moved to Spain and in 1610 he became a musician of the royal chapel in Madrid, where his father, Lope Machado, was already a harpist. In 1639, he became a musician in the palace of Philip IV of Spain, and in 1642, he was rewarded \\"for his long years of service\\". Work Machado composed several sacred works, but he is better known for his secular 3- and 4-voice cantigas and romances in Mannerist style. Unfortunately, very few of his works have survived (most of them were destroyed during the 1755 Lisbon earthquake). His secular music is characterised by great skill in the flexible use of the meter and harmony to reflect the content of the poems. Machado's highly expressive word-painting, with rich chromatism, unexpected modulation and dissonant chords (such as augmented chords or inverted seventh chords, which would have caused considerable impact in his own time), associated with typical Petrarchan love lyrics, make his romances comparable in style and quality to the Italian late-period madrigals, such as those of Marenzio or Monteverdi. His known compositions are found in the most important songbooks of his time, such as the Cancionero de la Sablonara, which indicates that he probably enjoyed a considerable popularity. He died in Madrid. Recordings The following recordings include works by Machado: *1989 - O Lusitano - Portuguese vilancetes, cantigas and romances. Gérard Lesne and Circa 1500. Virgin Veritas 59071.

Szostak has made significant contributions to the field of genetics. His achievement helped scientists to map the location of genes in mammals and to develop techniques for manipulating genes. His research findings in this area are also instrumental to the Human Genome Project. He was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, along with Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol W. Greider, for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres. Education and early life  Szostak grew up in Montreal and Ottawa. Although Szostak does not speak Polish, he stated in an interview with Wprost weekly that he remembers his Polish roots.I want to get to know first steps of evolution - Interview with Jack Szostak (in Polish) \\"Moi pradziadowie wyemigrowali z Polski do USA.

Unfortunately, I do not speak Polish, but I eagerly confess to my Polish roots\\") He attended Riverdale High School (Quebec) and graduated at the age of 15 with the scholars prize. He graduated with a B.Sc in cell biology from McGill University at the age of 19. In 1970, as an undergraduate, he participated in The Jackson Laboratory's Summer Student Program under the mentorship of Dr. Chen K. Chai. He completed his PhD in biochemistry at Cornell University (advisor Prof. Ray Wu) before moving to Harvard Medical School to start his own lab at the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute. He credits Ruth Sager for giving him his job there when he had little yet to show. In 1984 Howard Goodman recruited him to Massachusetts General Hospital and the Department of Molecular Biology. He was granted tenure and a full professorship at Harvard Medical School in 1988.  Research and career Szostak has made contributions to the field of genetics. He is credited with the construction of the world's first yeast artificial chromosome. That achievement helped scientists to map the location of genes in mammals and to develop techniques for manipulating genes. His achievements in this area are also instrumental to the Human Genome Project. His discoveries have helped to clarify the events that lead to chromosomal recombination—the reshuffling of genes that occurs during meiosis—and the function of telomeres, the specialized DNA sequences at the tips of chromosomes. In the early 90s his laboratory shifted its research direction and focused on studying RNA enzymes, which had been recently discovered by Cech and Altman. He developed the technique of in vitro evolution of RNA (also developed independently by Gerald Joyce) which enables the discovery of RNAs with desired functions through successive cycles of selection, amplification and mutation. He isolated the first aptamer (term he used for the first time). He isolated RNA enzymes with RNA ligase activity directly from random sequence (project of David Bartel). Currently, his lab focuses on the challenges of understanding the origin of life on Earth, and the construction of artificial cellular life in the laboratory.http://exploringorigins.org/ Exploringorigins.org They have conducted detailed studies of mechanisms by which RNA templates may have replicated on early earth before the emergence of enzyme catalysts. In particular, they have focused on imidazole-activated ribonucleotides (phosphorimidazolides) as monomers capable of elongating a new RNA strand. Significantly, the Szostak group discovered that phosphorimidazolide-mediated template elongation occurs via 5'-5'-imidazolium bridged dinucleotide intermediates which accelerate polymerization. Phosphorimidazolides were first proposed to be critical for early-earth nucleotide polymerization by Leslie E. Orgel and colleagues. Beyond his research, he has delivered talks about the origin of life on Earth, as he did at the first Starmus Festival in the Canary Islands, in 2011. He subsequently joined the Starmus Board of Directors, and his 2011 lecture was published in the book Starmus: 50 Years of Man in Space. = Awards and honors = Szostak has received several awards and honors for his contributions. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, American Academy of Arts and Sciences and New York Academy of Sciences, and is a member of the Kosciuszko Foundation Collegium of Eminent Scientists of Polish Origin and Ancestry.

Composed in 1968–69 for orchestra and eight amplified voices, it is a musically innovative post-serial classical work, with multiple vocalists commenting about musical (and other) topics as the piece twists and turns through a seemingly neurotic journey of quotations and dissonant passages. The eight voices are not used in a traditional classical way; they frequently do not sing at all, but speak, whisper and shout words by Claude Lévi-Strauss, whose Le cru et le cuit provides much of the text, excerpts from Samuel Beckett's novel The Unnamable, instructions from the scores of Gustav Mahler and other writings. Leonard Bernstein states in the text version of his Charles Eliot Norton lectures from 1973 that Sinfonia was representative of the new direction classical music was taking after the pessimistic decade of the sixties . Premieres Originally commissioned by the New York Philharmonic for its 125th anniversary, Sinfonia was premiered on October 10, 1968 by the orchestra and The Swingle Singers, with Berio conducting. At the time, the work was still in four movements. In the months after the premiere Berio added a fifth movement, which was first played when Sinfonia was performed during the 1969 Donaueschingen Festival by the Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Ernest Bour, and subsequently in London at the July 22 Promenade concert, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Swingle Singers conducted by the composer . The New York Philharmonic first played the five movement version of Sinfonia on October 8, 1970, conducted by Leonard Bernstein, to whom the work is dedicated. Instrumentation The Sinfonia is scored for a large orchestra : ;Soloists: :8 voices ;Woodwinds :1 piccolo :3 flutes :2 oboes :1 cor anglais :1 clarinet in E :3 soprano clarinets in B :1 alto saxophone :1 tenor saxophone :2 bassoons :1 contrabassoon ;Brass :4 horns :4 trumpets in C :3 trombones :1 bass tuba ;Percussion :3 players: #timpani, glockenspiel, tam-tam (large), snare drum, bongos #marimba, tam-tam (medium), sizzle cymbal, bass drum, snare drum, tambourine, 3 wood blocks, whip, güiro, sleigh bell, triangle #vibraphone, tam-tam (small), cymbal, bass drum, snare drum, bongos, tambourine, castanets, güiro, sleigh bells, 2 triangles ;Keyboard :1 electric harpsichord :1 piano :1 electric organ ;Strings :1 harp :24 violins in three groups :8 violas :8 celli :8 double basses Movements The work is in five movements: The first movement primarily uses a French text source and the third movement primarily uses English text sources. The text for the second movement is limited to the phonemes of the title, \\"O Martin Luther King.\\" The remaining movements are primarily instrumental with occasional vocal elements. The overall form of the piece is an arch form with elements of the first movement reflected in the fifth and connections between the second and fourth. The third movement, a study of inter-relations, stands on its own. =First movement= In the first movement of Sinfonia, Berio uses texts from Le cru et le cuit (The Raw and the Cooked) by the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. The form of the piece is also inspired by Lévi-Strauss, who in his work on mythology had found that many myths were structured like musical compositions, with some myths having a \\"fugal\\" form and others resembling a sonata. One mythical transformation however, had a structure for which he was not able to find a musical equivalent , and Berio himself said that he used this form in his Sinfonia—though Lévi-Strauss did not initially notice this. Interviewed by Didier Eribon, Lévi-Strauss said: :[Y]ou know that Berio used The Raw and the Cooked in his Sinfonia. A part of the text is recited, accompanied by the music. I admit that I did not grasp the reason for this choice. During an interview a musicologist asked me about it, and I answered that the book had just come out and the composer had probably used it because it was at hand. Now, a few months ago Berio, whom I don't know, sent me a very disgruntled letter. He had read the interview, several years after the fact, and assured me that the movement of this symphony offered the musical counterpart of the mythical transformation I was revealing. He included a book by a musicologist who had demonstrated the fact. I apologized for the misunderstanding, which was, I said, the result of my lack of musical training, but I'm still baffled. =Second movement: O King= In 1968, Berio completed O King, a work dedicated to the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. . This movement exists in two versions: one for voice, flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano, the other for eight voices and orchestra. The orchestral version of O King was, shortly after its completion, integrated into Sinfonia. It uses a fair amount of whole tone scale motives (which also appears in the quote from Le Sacre du Printemps in the third movement). =Third movement= In the third movement of Sinfonia Berio lays the groundwork by quoting multiple excerpts from the third movement scherzo from Mahler's Symphony No. 2 and has the orchestra play a slightly cut-up, re- shuffled and occasionally re-orchestrated version of it. Many have described Berio's third movement as a \\"musical collage\\", in essence using an \\"Ivesian\\" approach to the entire movement (American composer Charles Ives in his Symphony No. 2 first used musical quotation techniques on a grand scale at the turn of the 20th century about 65 years earlier). The orchestra plays snatches of Claude Debussy's La Mer, Maurice Ravel's La Valse, Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, as well as quotations from Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, Johannes Brahms, Henri Pousseur, Paul Hindemith, and many others (including Berio himself) creating a dense collage, occasionally to humorous effect. When one of the reciters says \\"I have a present for you\\", the orchestra follows immediately with the introductory chord from Don, the first movement from Pli selon pli by Pierre Boulez. The quoted fragments are often chosen because they bear a rhythmic or melodic likeness to Mahler's scherzo. For example, Berio uses a violin line from the second movement of Alban Berg's violin concerto with chromatically descending sixteenth notes two measures before a similarly descending line appears in Mahler's scherzo. This is then accompanied by another violin descent, taken from Johannes Brahms' violin concerto . The text from Beckett at this point begins, \\"So after a period of immaculate silence there seemed\\", but, instead of continuing the quotation (\\"a feeble cry was heard by me\\"), Berio substitutes the words \\"to be a violin concerto being played in the other room in three quarters\\" and then, after the Berg quotation, alto 2 insists on \\"two violin concertos\\", at the point where Berg is interrupted by Brahms . The eight individual voices simultaneously recite texts from various sources, most notably the first page of Samuel Beckett's The Unnamable. Other text fragments include references to James Joyce, graffiti Berio noticed during the May 1968 protests in Paris, notes from Berio's diary , and stage direction by Mayakovsky. Berio himself describes the movement as a \\"Voyage to Cythera\\" in which a ship filled with gifts is headed towards the island dedicated to the goddess of love. Musical quotations A partial list of musical quotations used in the third movement of Sinfonia in order of their appearance: *Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra, fourth movement, \\"Peripetie\\" (violent scale from bars 2–3 played by the brass), in bars 1–6 * A brief quotation from the beginning of Mahler's Symphony No. 4 in bars 2–10 * Claude Debussy's La mer, second movement, \\"Jeux de vagues\\" (opening measures), in bars 4–5 *Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (Resurrection), third movement (the only quotation that is ongoing) entering in bar 7, from where it continues to the end of the movement, though not always audibly *Paul Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 4 *Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, flute solo from the Pantomime *Debussy's \\"Jeux de vagues\\" returns *Berlioz's idée fixe from the Symphonie Fantastique (played by the flutes and oboes), in bar 106 *Ravel's La Valse (orchestra plays octave motif with piccolo playing a chromatic scale) *Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps (the \\"Dance of the Earth\\" sequence at the end of the first tableau), bars 170–85 *Stravinsky's Agon (upper oboe part from the \\"Double pas de quatre\\" as well the castanet part from the “Bransle Gai”) *Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier (one of the waltzes composed for the opera) *another extract from Ravel's La Valse *a chorale by Johann Sebastian Bach *the end of the second movement of Bach's First Brandenburg Concerto *Alban Berg's Wozzeck (the drowning scene late in the third act) *Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, second movement (melody stated with the clarinets) *Resumption of Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 4 in the solo violin, starting in bar 429 *Another quotation from Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, ending in bar 448 *Brief recapitulation of the opening of the movement: Schoenberg's \\"Peripetie\\", Debussy's La Mer (this time from the third movement \\"Dialogue du vent et de la mer\\"), starting at bar 488 *Boulez's Pli Selon Pli, very first chord of the entire piece from the first movement (\\"Don\\") *Anton Webern's Cantata No. 2, Op. 31, fifth movement (opening), in bars 547–54 *Karlheinz Stockhausen's Gruppen for three orchestras (during the introductions of the vocalists near the end, bars 555–60) =Fourth movement= The brief fourth movement is a return to the tonality of the second, relatively serene after the frenetic third movement. It begins again with a Mahler quotation—the chorus taken from the end of the \\"Resurrection\\" symphony. The voices make use of various vocal effects, including whispers, syllabic fragments, and distortions of previous textual material. =Fifth movement= This movement was added by Berio a year later, intended to balance the first four. The movement revisits the text from the previous sections, organizing the material in a more orderly fashion to create what Berio calls \\"narrative substance.\\" It opens with a quotation from Lévi-Strauss that is at the same time a veiled reference to Mahler's second symphony: the fifth movement of Sinfonia opens with the words \\"rose de sang\\" (French for \\"rose of blood\\"), and the fourth movement of Mahler's symphony begins with the words \\"O Röschen rot!\\" (German for \\"O red rosebud!\\") .

During its lifetime the ground was known as Coventry Road; the name \\"Muntz Street\\" is a more recent adoption. It was the ground at which the teams of Birmingham City F.C. - under the club's former names of Small Heath Alliance, Small Heath and Birmingham - played their home games for nearly 30 years. It also served as the headquarters of the Small Heath Athletic Club. The Muntz Street ground, then situated on Birmingham's eastern edge and bordered on two sides by farmland, opened in 1877. It was a field with terracing round it which provided standing accommodation for roughly 10,000 spectators. A wooden stand was built and the terracing raised to expand the capacity to around 30,000, but eventually it proved too small for the football club's needs. They built a new stadium nearer the city centre, St Andrew's, which hosted its first game in December 1906. Muntz Street, by then in a heavily built-up area, was demolished in 1907 and the land used for housing. The street of the same name remains. Location and facilities Small Heath Alliance Football Club, founded in 1875, played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, in the Bordesley Green district of Birmingham, very near the site where the club's St Andrew's stadium would be built some thirty years later. In 1876, they made a temporary move to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, with a capacity estimated at 3,000; because the field was enclosed, admission could be charged. A year later they moved again, to a field in Small Heath, rented for an initial £5 a year from the family of Sam Gessey, a Small Heath player. The field had a capacity of 10,000 spectators, and was situated on the eastern edge of Birmingham's built-up area, just north of the main road to Coventry. It was bordered on two sides by developed streets, Muntz Street on the western side, Wright Street to the south; the other two sides of the enclosure adjoined farmland. Muntz Street and surroundings in 1890When it first opened, the ground had few facilities for either player or spectator. Uncovered terracing surrounded the pitch, and a hut acted as the players' changing room. A small but well-appointed covered wooden stand was built on the Coventry Road side, and over the years the terracing was enlarged to raise the capacity to around 30,000.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 57. In 1895, the football club bought the lease to the ground, which had 11 years remaining, for a sum of £275. Two years later, they paid £90 to their near neighbours, Aston Villa Football Club, for an old grandstand from Villa's former Wellington Road ground in Perry Barr. The club transported it piece by piece, and re-erected it as a terrace cover behind the goal at the Muntz Street end. No other major improvements were made, nor did the club ever move their administrative offices to the site, instead maintaining premises in Corporation Street, in Birmingham city centre. Muntz Street was readily accessible by public transport. In the early years, horse-drawn buses ran along the Coventry Road, linking Small Heath with the city centre and with other nearby districts. In 1882, the building of a tramline along the Coventry Road to Small Heath Park was authorised, and four years later, the Coventry Road steam tramway route was opened to a terminus near Dora Road, a few yards past the ground. In the early years of the 20th century, this line was converted for use by electric trams. Contemporary reports referred to the ground throughout its lifetime as Coventry Road. Writer and researcher Steve Beauchampé suggests that the Muntz Street name may have been adopted to distinguish it from St Andrew's, which was also built just off the Coventry Road. Club matches Graph of attendances for Football Alliance and Football League matches at Muntz StreetThe first game at Muntz Street, a friendly match against Saltley College, was played on 11 September 1877. Small Heath Alliance won 5–0, in front of \\"a handful\\" of spectators who contributed gate receipts of 6s 8d. This marked the start of a run of 22 games unbeaten at the new ground.Matthews, Encyclopedia, \\"Muntz Street\\", p. 160. The playing surface was notorious for its poor quality – bumpy and stony – and was referred to locally as the \\"celery trenches\\". The first meeting between Small Heath and Aston Villa – who went on to become the club's major rivals – took place in 1879; it resulted in a 1–0 home win, after which the Villa players described the pitch as \\"only suitable for pot-holing\\".Matthews, Encyclopedia, \\"Aston Villa\\", p. 17. In 1883, Wednesbury Old Athletic paid Small Heath £5 to switch the venue of a Walsall Cup tie away from Muntz Street; the club took the money, won the match and went on to win the competition, their first ever silverware.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 8. Nine years later, The Wednesday offered £200 to switch venues in a second-round FA Cup tie; the money was accepted, but without the success.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 9. Events surrounding the February 1905 First Division match with Aston Villa highlighted the ground's inadequacies. The official attendance was given as 28,000, though with the gates closed before kick-off, thousands climbed over walls or forced entrances in order to gain admission, and the actual attendance is estimated at anything up to 35,000. The Birmingham Daily Mail reported \\"a constant stream of vehicles to the ground, while the trams were disgorging their freights at Muntz Street every two or three minutes.\\" Inside, \\"the swaying of the mass of spectators rendered the placing of additional supports against the barriers a necessary precaution\\", and children were passed overhead and deposited on the pitch for their own safety. The following Monday the same newspaper commented that had space been available, another ten or fifteen thousand spectators might well have attended, as \\"hundreds of people found the doors closed against them, and probably there were thousands who would not go to the ground in view of the inevitable crush.\\" The size of the crowd preferring to attend the same day's Birmingham & District League match between the two clubs' reserve teams at Villa Park – at least 3,000 spectators – lent support to that view. Move to St Andrew's Muntz Street and surroundings in 1904A month later the club changed its name to Birmingham Football Club, to reflect its position as the only Football League club in the city.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 12. Football as a spectator sport was becoming increasing popular: a Birmingham Daily Post editorial pointed out that \\"Birmingham has not escaped this great wave of popularity, and the club bearing the name of the city has found itself compelled to seek a new home. Its old one at Small Heath was quite inadequate for the requirements of an important match\\". The rent had risen to £300 a year, and the landlords refused to sell the freehold, to renew the lease, which was nearing expiry, or to allow extensions to be made to the ground, which was by then surrounded by tightly-packed housing.Inglis, p. 44. The directors estimated that remaining at Muntz Street was losing the club as much as £2000 a year in revenue; the March 1906 cup-tie against Newcastle United produced receipts of £900 from a crowd restricted to 25,000, with \\"probably 60,000 people anxious to attend\\". Club director Harry Morris identified a site three-quarters of a mile (1 km) nearer the city centre where a new ground could be built, on wet, sloping wasteland where a disused brickworks stood, near the railway and St Andrew's Church. Within twelve months of a 21-year lease being signed, the new ground, which became known as St Andrew's, was ready for use.Matthews, Encyclopedia, \\"St Andrew's\\", p. 193. The last game at Muntz Street was played on 22 December 1906. Birmingham beat Bury 3–1 in the First Division in front of some 10,000 spectators. The last goal was scored by Arthur Mounteney, and the Birmingham Daily Post described how Within months the ground had been demolished, the land cleared and housing built in what became Swanage Road; no plaque commemorates the site. Other uses Despite the apparently poor quality of pitch and facilities the Birmingham County Football Association XI, comprising players from teams in the Birmingham area, played several representative football matches at Muntz Street. The ground twice hosted matches against the London Football Association, and between 1898 and 1906 four matches were played against teams representing the Scottish Football Association. Small Heath Athletic Club (later called Small Heath Harriers) established its headquarters at the Muntz Street ground from the club's foundation in 1891. Though primarily a cross-country and road-racing club, they also participated in track and field athletics, and during the summer months the athletes were allowed to train on the football pitch. Notes A. At the very bottom centre of the 1883 map linked here, Muntz Street leaves the Coventry Road heading north-east, crossed by Wright Street. Gessey's field is on the south-eastern side of Muntz St, adjacent to the north-eastern side of the short part of Wright St, and with open country to the other two sides. At the centre left of the map, above the words \\"Small Heath\\", and bounded by Coventry Road, Cattell Road, Kelynge Street (now Tilton Road), Garrison Lane and the railway, is the site of the future St Andrew's stadium. Lower down, parallel and very close to the left edge of the map, is Arthur Street, where Small Heath Alliance first played their matches.Map from , hosted at B. The Times described a fifth- round FA Cup tie \\"at the ground of the Small Heath Alliance in the Coventry- road, Birmingham\\" in 1886. As late as 1905, the Birmingham Evening Despatch wrote of Small Heath \\"only drawing\\" their match with Woolwich at Plumstead, having beaten them earlier in the season \\"at Coventry Road\\", and in the same year the Birmingham Daily Mail wrote that \\"no English Cup tie could arouse more interest in Birmingham than the meeting between Small Heath and Aston Villa at Coventry Road\\". C. Aston Villa F.C. played in the municipal borough of Aston Manor, which did not become part of the city of Birmingham until 1911.

MacLeod made his debut for the national side on 6 November 2004, in a match against Australia, and has received 24 caps in total, 15 as a substitute. MacLeod was in the Scotland squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, where he made five appearances (four as a substitute). On the morning of 25 February 2008, MacLeod was announced to have tested positive for banned substance terbutaline, only to be retrospectively cleared a few hours later after it was revealed to be nothing more than an administrative error. It was also announced later in the year that he had failed a doping test due to unusually high testosterone levels. He was later cleared as the rise in testosterone was due to a large amount of alcohol being consumed by the player the night before the test to celebrate the birth of his first child. MacLeod was released by the Scarlets by mutual consent on 29 January 2009. He then signed for Edinburgh later that day. In November 2010, MacLeod confirmed that he was moving to Japan. He has signed for the Kobe Kobelco Steelers for their upcoming 2011–12 Top League campaign. In the 2012–13 season, Macleod signed up to play for the Newcastle Falcons.

It is related to the drug MPPP, with an N-phenethyl group in place of the N-methyl substitution and an acetate ester rather than propionate. PEPAP is approximately 6-7 times more potent than morphine in laboratory rats. PEPAP presumably has similar effects to other opioids, producing analgesia, sedation and euphoria. Side effects can include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatening. PEPAP has been found to be a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, which makes it likely to cause adverse interactions with some other drugs, although the inhibitory potency of PEPAP is less than that of MPPP. Both cocaine and methadone are also CYP2D6 inhibitors and could, in theory, potentiate the effect. It is unlikely that the tetrahydropyridine byproducts that may be formed during the synthesis of PEPAP are neurotoxic in the same way as the MPPP byproduct MPTP. It appears that the N-methyl group of MPTP is required for neurotoxic activity. In animal experiments, only MPTP analogues that preserved the N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine structure were active as dopaminergic neurotoxins. Most structural changes, including replacing the N-methyl group with other substituents, abolished neurotoxicity. There is evidence that the clandestine manufacturers who produced MPPP in the 1970s, including the tainted batch, went on to produce PEPAP in an attempt to avoid using watched precursors or drug intermediates that were illegal.

The board is any subset of the squares of a rectangular board with m rows and n columns; we think of it as the squares in which one is allowed to put a rook. The board is the ordinary chessboard if all squares are allowed and m = n = 8 and a chessboard of any size if all squares are allowed and m = n. The coefficient of x k in the rook polynomial RB(x) is the number of ways k rooks, none of which attacks another, can be arranged in the squares of B. The rooks are arranged in such a way that there is no pair of rooks in the same row or column. In this sense, an arrangement is the positioning of rooks on a static, immovable board; the arrangement will not be different if the board is rotated or reflected while keeping the squares stationary. The polynomial also remains the same if rows are interchanged or columns are interchanged. The term \\"rook polynomial\\" was coined by John Riordan.John Riordan, Introduction to Combinatorial Analysis, Princeton University Press, 1980 (originally published by John Wiley and Sons, New York; Chapman and Hall, London, 1958) (reprinted again in 2002, by Dover Publications). See chapters 7 & 8. Despite the name's derivation from chess, the impetus for studying rook polynomials is their connection with counting permutations (or partial permutations) with restricted positions. A board B that is a subset of the n × n chessboard corresponds to permutations of n objects, which we may take to be the numbers 1, 2, ..., n, such that the number aj in the j-th position in the permutation must be the column number of an allowed square in row j of B. Famous examples include the number of ways to place n non-attacking rooks on: *an entire n × n chessboard, which is an elementary combinatorial problem; *the same board with its diagonal squares forbidden; this is the derangement or \\"hat-check\\" problem (this is a particular case of the problème des rencontres); *the same board without the squares on its diagonal and immediately above its diagonal (and without the bottom left square), which is essential in the solution of the problème des ménages. Interest in rook placements arises in pure and applied combinatorics, group theory, number theory, and statistical physics. The particular value of rook polynomials comes from the utility of the generating function approach, and also from the fact that the zeroes of the rook polynomial of a board provide valuable information about its coefficients, i.e., the number of non-attacking placements of k rooks.  Definition  The rook polynomial RB(x) of a board B is the generating function for the numbers of arrangements of non-attacking rooks: : R_B(x)= \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\min{(m,n)}} r_k(B) x^k where rk is the number of ways to place k non-attacking rooks on a board of m rows and n columns. There is a maximum number of non-attacking rooks the board can hold; indeed, there cannot be more rooks than the smaller of the number of rows and columns in the board (hence the limit \\\\min(m,n)).Weisstein, Eric W. \\"Rook Polynomial.\\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RookPolynomial.html = Complete boards = The first few rook polynomials on square n × n boards are (with Rn = RB): : \\\\begin{align} R_1(x) & = x + 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_2(x) & = 2 x^2 + 4 x + 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_3(x) & = 6 x^3 + 18 x^2 + 9 x + 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_4(x) & = 24 x^4 + 96 x^3 + 72 x^2 + 16 x + 1. \\\\end{align} In words, this means that on a 1 × 1 board, 1 rook can be arranged in 1 way, and zero rooks can also be arranged in 1 way (empty board); on a complete 2 × 2 board, 2 rooks can be arranged in 2 ways (on the diagonals), 1 rook can be arranged in 4 ways, and zero rooks can be arranged in 1 way; and so forth for larger boards. For complete m × n rectangular boards Bm,n we write Rm,n := RBm,n . The smaller of m and n can be taken as an upper limit for k, since obviously rk = 0 if k > min(m, n). This is also shown in the formula for Rm,n(x). The rook polynomial of a rectangular chessboard is closely related to the generalized Laguerre polynomial Lnα(x) by the identity : R_{m,n}(x)= n! x^n L_n^{(m-n)}(-x^{-1}).  Matching polynomials  A rook polynomial is a special case of one kind of matching polynomial, which is the generating function of the number of k-edge matchings in a graph. The rook polynomial Rm,n(x) corresponds to the complete bipartite graph Km,n . The rook polynomial of a general board B ⊆ Bm,n corresponds to the bipartite graph with left vertices v1, v2, ..., vm and right vertices w1, w2, ..., wn and an edge viwj whenever the square (i, j) is allowed, i.e., belongs to B. Thus, the theory of rook polynomials is, in a sense, contained in that of matching polynomials. We deduce an important fact about the coefficients rk, which we recall given the number of non-attacking placements of k rooks in B: these numbers are unimodal, i.e., they increase to a maximum and then decrease. This follows (by a standard argument) from the theorem of Heilmann and LiebOle J. Heilmann and Elliott H. Lieb, Theory of monomer-dimer systems. Communications in Mathematical Physics, Vol. 25 (1972), pp. 190–232. about the zeroes of a matching polynomial (a different one from that which corresponds to a rook polynomial, but equivalent to it under a change of variables), which implies that all the zeroes of a rook polynomial are negative real numbers.  Connection to matrix permanents  For incomplete square n × n boards, (i.e. rooks are not allowed to be played on some arbitrary subset of the board's squares) computing the number of ways to place n rooks on the board is equivalent to computing the permanent of a 0–1 matrix.  Complete rectangular boards  = Rooks problems = A precursor to the rook polynomial is the classic \\"Eight rooks problem\\" by H. E. DudeneyDudeney, Henry E. Amusements In Mathematics. 1917. Nelson. (republished by Plain Label Books: , also as a collection of newspaper clippings, Dover Publications, 1958; Kessinger Publishing, 2006). The book can be freely downloaded from Project Gutenberg site in which he shows that the maximum number of non-attacking rooks on a chessboard is eight by placing them on one of the main diagonals (Fig. 1). The question asked is: \\"In how many ways can eight rooks be placed on an 8 × 8 chessboard so that neither of them attacks the other?\\" The answer is: \\"Obviously there must be a rook in every row and every column. Starting with the bottom row, it is clear that the first rook can be put on any one of eight different squares (Fig. 1). Wherever it is placed, there is the option of seven squares for the second rook in the second row. Then there are six squares from which to select the third row, five in the fourth, and so on. Therefore the number of different ways must be 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320\\" (that is, 8!, where \\"!\\" is factorial).Dudeney, Problem 295 The same result can be obtained in a slightly different way. Let us endow each rook with a positional number, corresponding to the number of its rank, and assign it a name that corresponds to the name of its file. Thus, rook a1 has position 1 and name \\"a\\", rook b2 has position 2 and name \\"b\\", etc. Then let us order the rooks into an ordered list (sequence) by their positions. The diagram on Fig. 1 will then transform in the sequence (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h). Placing any rook on another file would involve moving the rook that hitherto occupied the second file to the file, vacated by the first rook. For instance, if rook a1 is moved to \\"b\\" file, rook b2 must be moved to \\"a\\" file, and now they will become rook b1 and rook a2. The new sequence will become (b,a,c,d,e,f,g,h). In combinatorics, this operation is termed permutation, and the sequences, obtained as a result of the permutation, are permutations of the given sequence. The total number of permutations, containing 8 elements from a sequence of 8 elements is 8! (factorial of 8). To assess the effect of the imposed limitation \\"rooks must not attack each other\\", consider the problem without such limitation. In how many ways can eight rooks be placed on an 8 × 8 chessboard? This will be the total number of combinations of 8 rooks on 64 squares: : {64 \\\\choose 8} = \\\\frac{64!}{8!(64-8)!} = 4,426,165,368. Thus, the limitation \\"rooks must not attack each other\\" reduces the total number of allowable positions from combinations to permutations which is a factor of about 109,776. A number of problems from different spheres of human activity can be reduced to the rook problem by giving them a \\"rook formulation\\". As an example: A company must employ n workers on n different jobs and each job must be carried out only by one worker. In how many ways can this appointment be done? Let us put the workers on the ranks of the n × n chessboard, and the jobs − on the files. If worker i is appointed to job j, a rook is placed on the square where rank i crosses file j. Since each job is carried out only by one worker and each worker is appointed to only one job, all files and ranks will contain only one rook as a result of the arrangement of n rooks on the board, that is, the rooks do not attack each other. = The rook polynomial as a generalization of the rooks problem = The classical rooks problem immediately gives the value of r8, the coefficient in front of the highest order term of the rook polynomial. Indeed, its result is that 8 non-attacking rooks can be arranged on an 8 × 8 chessboard in r8 = 8! = 40320 ways. Let us generalize this problem by considering an m × n board, that is, a board with m ranks (rows) and n files (columns). The problem becomes: In how many ways can one arrange k rooks on an m × n board in such a way that they do not attack each other? It is clear that for the problem to be solvable, k must be less or equal to the smaller of the numbers m and n; otherwise one cannot avoid placing a pair of rooks on a rank or on a file. Let this condition be fulfilled. Then the arrangement of rooks can be carried out in two steps. First, choose the set of k ranks on which to place the rooks. Since the number of ranks is m, of which k must be chosen, this choice can be done in \\\\binom{m}{k} ways. Similarly, the set of k files on which to place the rooks can be chosen in \\\\binom{n}{k} ways. Because the choice of files does not depend on the choice of ranks, according to the products rule there are \\\\binom{m}{k}\\\\binom{n}{k} ways to choose the square on which to place the rook. However, the task is not yet finished because k ranks and k files intersect in k2 squares. By deleting unused ranks and files and compacting the remaining ranks and files together, one obtains a new board of k ranks and k files. It was already shown that on such board k rooks can be arranged in k! ways (so that they do not attack each other). Therefore, the total number of possible non-attacking rooks arrangements is:Vilenkin, Naum Ya. Combinatorics (Kombinatorika). 1969. Nauka Publishers, Moscow (In Russian). :r_k = \\\\binom{m}{k}\\\\binom{n}{k} k! = \\\\frac{n! m!}{k! (n-k)! (m-k)!}. For instance, 3 rooks can be placed on a conventional chessboard (8 × 8) in \\\\textstyle{\\\\frac{8! 8!}{3!5!5!}} = 18,816 ways. For k = m = n, the above formula gives rk = n! that corresponds to the result obtained for the classical rooks problem. The rook polynomial with explicit coefficients is now: :R_{m,n}(x) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\min(m,n)} \\\\binom{m}{k} \\\\binom{n}{k} k! x^k = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\min(m,n)}\\\\frac{n! m!}{k! (n-k)! (m-k)!} x^k. If the limitation \\"rooks must not attack each other\\" is removed, one must choose any k squares from m × n squares. This can be done in: :\\\\binom{mn}{k} = \\\\frac{(mn)!}{k! (mn-k)!} ways. If the k rooks differ in some way from each other, e.g., they are labelled or numbered, all the results obtained so far must be multiplied by k!, the number of permutations of k rooks. = Symmetric arrangements = As a further complication to the rooks problem, let us require that rooks not only be non-attacking but also symmetrically arranged on the board. Depending on the type of symmetry, this is equivalent to rotating or reflecting the board. Symmetric arrangements lead to many problems, depending on the symmetry condition.Vilenkin, Naum Ya. Popular Combinatorics (Populyarnaya kombinatorika). 1975. Nauka Publishers, Moscow (In Russian).Gik, Evgeny Ya. Mathematics on the Chessboard (Matematika na shakhmatnoy doske). 1976. Nauka Publishers, Moscow (In Russian).Gik, Evgeny Ya. Chess and Mathematics (Shakhmaty i matematika). 1983. Nauka Publishers, Moscow (In Russian). (GVK- Gemeinsamer Verbundkatalog)Kokhas', Konstantin P. Rook Numbers and Polynomials (Ladeynye chisla i mnogochleny). MCNMO, Moscow, 2003 (in Russian). (GVK- Gemeinsamer Verbundkatalog) The simplest of those arrangements is when rooks are symmetric about the centre of the board. Let us designate with Gn the number of arrangements in which n rooks are placed on a board with n ranks and n files. Now let us make the board to contain 2n ranks and 2n files. A rook on the first file can be placed on any of the 2n squares of that file. According to the symmetry condition, placement of this rook defines the placement of the rook that stands on the last file − it must be arranged symmetrically to the first rook about the board centre. Let us remove the first and the last files and the ranks that are occupied by rooks (since the number of ranks is even, the removed rooks cannot stand on the same rank). This will give a board of 2n − 2 files and 2n − 2 ranks. It is clear that to each symmetric arrangement of rooks on the new board corresponds a symmetric arrangement of rooks on the original board. Therefore, G2n = 2nG2n − 2 (the factor 2n in this expression comes from the possibility for the first rook to occupy any of the 2n squares on the first file). By iterating the above formula one reaches to the case of a 2 × 2 board, on which there are 2 symmetric arrangements (on the diagonals). As a result of this iteration, the final expression is G2n = 2nn! For the usual chessboard (8 × 8), G8 = 24 × 4! = 16 × 24 = 384 centrally symmetric arrangements of 8 rooks. One such arrangement is shown in Fig. 2. For odd- sized boards (containing 2n + 1 ranks and 2n + 1 files) there is always a square that does not have its symmetric double − this is the central square of the board. There must always be a rook placed on this square. Removing the central file and rank, one obtains a symmetric arrangement of 2n rooks on a 2n × 2n board. Therefore, for such board, once again G2n + 1 = G2n = 2nn! A little more complicated problem is to find the number of non-attacking arrangements that do not change upon 90° rotation of the board. Let the board have 4n files and 4n ranks, and the number of rooks is also 4n. In this case, the rook that is on the first file can occupy any square on this file, except the corner squares (a rook cannot be on a corner square because after a 90° rotation there would 2 rooks that attack each other). There are another 3 rooks that correspond to that rook and they stand, respectively, on the last rank, the last file, and the first rank (they are obtained from the first rook by 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations). Removing the files and ranks of those rooks, one obtains the rook arrangements for a (4n − 4) × (4n − 4) board with the required symmetry. Thus, the following recurrence relation is obtained: R4n = (4n − 2)R4n − 4, where Rn is the number of arrangements for a n × n board. Iterating, it follows that R4n = 2n(2n − 1)(2n − 3)...1. The number of arrangements for a (4n + 1) × (4n + 1) board is the same as that for a 4n × 4n board; this is because on a (4n + 1) × (4n + 1) board, one rook must necessarily stand in the centre and thus the central rank and file can be removed. Therefore R4n + 1 = R4n. For the traditional chessboard (n = 2), R8 = 4 × 3 × 1 = 12 possible arrangements with rotational symmetry. For (4n + 2) × (4n + 2) and (4n + 3) × (4n + 3) boards, the number of solutions is zero. Two cases are possible for each rook: either it stands in the centre or it doesn't stand in the centre. In the second case, this rook is included in the rook quartet that exchanges squares on turning the board at 90°. Therefore, the total number of rooks must be either 4n (when there is no central square on the board) or 4n + 1\\\\. This proves that R4n + 2 = R4n + 3 = 0. The number of arrangements of n non-attacking rooks symmetric to one of the diagonals (for determinacy, the diagonal corresponding to a1–h8 on the chessboard) on a n × n board is given by the telephone numbers defined by the recurrence Qn = Qn − 1 \\\\+ (n − 1)Qn − 2. This recurrence is derived in the following way. Note that the rook on the first file either stands on the bottom corner square or it stands on another square. In the first case, removal of the first file and the first rank leads to the symmetric arrangement n − 1 rooks on a (n − 1) × (n − 1) board. The number of such arrangements is Qn − 1. In the second case, for the original rook there is another rook, symmetric to the first one about the chosen diagonal. Removing the files and ranks of those rooks leads to a symmetric arrangement n − 2 rooks on a (n − 2) × (n − 2) board. Since the number of such arrangements is Qn − 2 and the rook can be put on the n − 1 square of the first file, there are (n − 1)Qn − 2 ways for doing this, which immediately gives the above recurrence. The number of diagonal-symmetric arrangements is then given by the expression: :Q_n = 1 + \\\\binom{n}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{1 \\\\times 2}\\\\binom{n}{2}\\\\binom{n-2}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{1 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 3}\\\\binom{n}{2}\\\\binom{n-2}{2}\\\\binom{n-4}{2} + \\\\cdots. This expression is derived by partitioning all rook arrangements in classes; in class s are those arrangements in which s pairs of rooks do not stand on the diagonal. In exactly the same way, it can be shown that the number of n-rook arrangements on a n × n board, such that they do not attack each other and are symmetric to both diagonals is given by the recurrence equations B2n = 2B2n − 2 \\\\+ (2n − 2)B2n − 4 and B2n + 1 = B2n. = Arrangements counted by symmetry classes = A different type of generalization is that in which rook arrangements that are obtained from each other by symmetries of the board are counted as one. For instance, if rotating the board by 90 degrees is allowed as a symmetry, then any arrangement obtained by a rotation of 90, 180, or 270 degrees is considered to be \\"the same\\" as the original pattern, even though these arrangements are counted separately in the original problem where the board is fixed. For such problems, DudeneyDudeney, Answer to Problem 295 observes: \\"How many ways there are if mere reversals and reflections are not counted as different has not yet been determined; it is a difficult problem.\\" The problem reduces to that of counting symmetric arrangements via Burnside's lemma.

Hailing from the outskirts of Peshawar area known as Khalisa, named after the Sikh invaders, he was well known for joining Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the Pakistan movement, and was known by many as \\"the king maker of the frontier\\". He was popularly known for his resolve and aura and referred to informally by the name Jhagra Khan. Jhagra Khan was a former Congressite and was largely responsible for gaining support for the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province for Abdul Qayyum Khan, the first Chief Minister of the province after independence. He was the General Secretary of the PML until he died of throat cancer. He died in England where he was supposed to be treated; his family receiving condolences from many heads of nations including Queen Elizabeth II. He was well known throughout British India, especially in his native province, and was one of the few leaders Jinnah had personally tried, successfully, to recruit in All India Muslim League. During his long political career he was requested to take part in provincial elections to become chief minister but declined on a number of occasions. He became governor upon the request of then Governor General Khwaja Nazimuddin; taking charge to make sure the Objective Resolution be implemented successfully in the province and to settle the Pashtunistan revolts instigated by Bāchā Khān and his Khudai Khidmathgar movement. He was relieved of his posting by then Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, who had felt threatened by Khan's strength and popularity, especially amongst the various Princely States which existed during British rule, including the Nizam of Hyderabad and Khan of Kalat, both of whom were said to be amongst his closest friends. Khan's death came as a huge blow to the country and province in particular as he was the only figure keeping up support for the PML party. After his death Qayyum separated and formed his own branch of PML. After him the next general secretary of the PML was later to be former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He is buried at his hometown of Jhagra in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, close to Peshawar. He is the father of Muhammad Saleem Khan Jhagra, Former Federal Secretary of Local Government and of the Board of Investment, and of Iftikhar Ahmad Khan Jhagra, former PPP leader, thrice member of the KPK assembly and twice provincial minister. His grandson Taimoor Khan Jhagra, son of Saleem Khan Jhagra, is Provincial Minister for Finance and Health in KP Cabinet of PTI Government.

It is the group's third studio album and their fourth release in total.Mono Music, official homepage. http://www.monomusic.se/cd-benny-anderssons-orkester-bao-3.aspx Album information Being a typical Benny Anderssons Orkester album, BAO 3 (the title indicates that it's the third BAO album) includes many different musical styles, ranging from Swedish folk music to pop, jazz, classical tunes and Viennese influences. The album is officially credited to \\"Benny Anderssons Orkester, Helen Sjöholm & Tommy Körberg\\", indicating that it also includes several tracks with vocals. In fact, compared to its studio predecessor, BAO! in 2004, the number of vocals tracks has increased. Seven out of the 12 tracks on the album are sung by either Helen Sjöholm or Tommy Körberg or as a duet. Körberg can be heard on a BAO studio album for the first time, after already appearing together with the group during their tours and also lending vocals to two tracks on Benny Andersson's two solo albums from the 1980s, Klinga mina klockor and November 1989. As usual, most of the lyrics were written by Andersson's former ABBA partner Björn Ulvaeus, while all the music was composed by Andersson himself. BAO 3 was recorded in Sveriges Radios Studio 5 and Atlantis Studio, both in Stockholm, during 2007. Like all Benny Anderssons Orkester albums, it was engineered by Bernard Löhr und subsequently mixed by him and Andersson at Mono Music Studio. =Success and promotion= BAO 3 did not achieve the same success as the group's other two studio albums, which both topped the Swedish Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for 55 weeks. Nevertheless, BAO 3 entered the charts on November 1, reached the top 3 and also managed to collect a Gold disc during its 34-week chart run.Hitlistan, official Swedish charts. . Retrieved on 7 June 2011. BAO 3 is the first and to date also last album by the group to be released in autumn, namely October. All their other albums were released in late spring and early summer, in May, June or July. And because Benny Anderssons Orkester is also famous for its summer tours, the band and its music is strongly connected with that time of the year. So the album's inability to sell as well as Benny Anderssons Orkester and BAO! could be linked to this rather unusual release date. Due to Helen Sjöholm giving birth to her first child, Benny Anderssons Orkester did not tour in 2007. Instead, they performed two concerts in Stockholm and Gothenburg to promote the album. Contrary to their summer tours, the venues were not the usual small open-air stages, but rather big concert halls, like the Ericsson Globe in Stockholm, where they played in front of 6,000 people. =Songs and trivia= Two big Svensktoppen hits were released from BAO 3. \\"Fait Accomplit\\", with lyrics by Björn Ulvaeus and vocals by Tommy Körberg, entered the radio chart on December 1 and eventually topped the list for 11 weeks in early 2008. In the summer of the same year, the Helen Sjöholm and Tommy Körberg duet \\"Nu mår jag mycket bättre\\" became a top 5 hit on Svensktoppen. The lyrics for this song were written by Swedish poet and dramatist Kristina Lugn. By this time, Benny Anderssons Orkester's hit \\"Du är min man\\" was still going strong on Svensktoppen, albeit already being four years old, and eventually outliving both tracks by far.Svensktoppen, Archiv. http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2023&artikel;=454888. Retrieved on 7 June 2011. *The album also includes a song with English lyrics, \\"Crush On You\\". This up-tempo pop number, performed in BAO style, is another Sjöholm and Körberg duet. It is said that the song, or at least parts of it, was written back in 1979 during recording sessions for ABBA's Voulez-Vous album. However, a demo version from those sessions with vocals by Agnetha Fältskog or Anni-Frid Lyngstad does not exist.The Official International ABBA Fan Club, Magazine #93, December 2007. *\\"För dig\\" originally appeared on Benny Anderssons Orkester's live album BAO på turné in 2006. In 2009, an English- language version, titled \\"The Stars\\", was recorded for the group's compilation album Story Of A Heart. *\\"Upp till dig\\", performed by Helen Sjöholm, borrows some elements from a song called \\"(I Am) The Seeker\\", another old composition which dates back to the ABBA days. It was ultimately performed as part of the Abbacadabra musical in 1983 and subsequently released on single by B. A. Robertson. *The track \\"Bonde söker fru\\", with lyrics by Björn Ulvaeus and vocals by Tommy Körberg, is a funny depiction of and parody about the famous Swedish reality TV program Bonde söker fru (farmer seeks wife). It is performed as a Charleston. *\\"Helens brudvals\\" was written for Helen Sjöholm's wedding in 2006.

Giacomo Bresadola (Mezzana, Trento; often given as Giacopo) 14 February 1847 - Trento 9 June 1929) was an eminent Italian mycologist. Fungi he named include the deadly Lepiota helveola and Inocybe patouillardii, though the latter is now known as Inocybe erubescens as this latter description predated Bresadola's by a year. He was a founding member of the Société mycologique de France (Mycology Society of France).  Life  Bresadola was born in 1847 into a farming family in Trent, then an Austrian possession. From a very early age, he showed an interest in botany. After attending elementary school at Mezzana, he was sent by his father to Cloz in the Val di Non at the age of nine to continue his studies with his uncle who was a priest. His uncle, however, considered him too rambunctious and quickly sent him home again. In 1857, his father moved to Montichiari in Brescia to become a bronze merchant. At twelve years of age, he left to study at the technical institute in Rovereto. Having placed at the head of his class four years in a row, he was so disappointed at being classed second that he abandoned his studies to enter the seminary at Trent. Upon becoming a priest, he was appointed to the parishes of Baselga di Pinè, Roncegno, and Malè. In 1878, he became the vicar at Magràs, a position he held for five years. During this period, he again started to become keenly interested in botany and spent time with Francesco Ambrosi, whoever he was, who introduced him to the bryologist Gustavo Venturi and the work of Carlo Vittadini. Both the large number of mushrooms that he found during his excursions and his contact with various mycologists led to a specific interest in mycology. Thus he met with Pier Andrea Saccardo, a professor of botany at the University of Padua and celebrated mycologist. Saccardo directed Bresadola to Lucien Quélet and later Émile Boudier, with whom he would have a warm relationship. From this point on, he maintained a voluminous and broad correspondence with upwards of 400 Italian and foreign specialists, a collection that is now housed at the University of Washington. Starting in 1881, he published the first installment of Fungi tridentini novi vel novum vel nondum delineati, a work which, when finished in 1892, ran to 232 pages of text and 217 plates. In 1884, he left to become vicar in Trent, where he would remain for the rest of his life. In 1887, he was named administrator of the Trent episcopacy's estates, a position he held until 1910. He became a leading specialist in various areas, in which he enjoyed close collaborations: Agaricomycetes, with Quélet and Adalbert Ricken; Aphyllophoromycetideae, with Narcisse Théophile Patouillard and the Canon Hubert Bourdot; and finally Discomycetes with Boudier. He also developed a keen interest in exotic specimens and published various observations on examples he received from all parts of the world, including Cameroon, Congo, Hungary, Saxony, Poland, San Tomé, and Samoa. Under the auspices of the Italian Botanical Society and the Natural History Museum in Trent, he undertook the monumental Iconographia mycologica, a partially posthumous work which comprised some 25 volumes and 1,250 colour plates. In 1910, he retired and relied on his friends and family for a reasonable pension. Unfortunately, the First World War diminished its value considerably and to survive he was forced to sell off piecemeal his extensive library, his plant collection and his original drawings. In 1927, the University of Padua conferred upon him a doctorate honoris causa and the Italian government named him to the Order of the Crown of Italy. He died in Trent in June, 1929 and was buried at municipal expense. Bresadola is the author of 1017 species of mushrooms and some fifteen genres in roughly sixty publications, almost all of which are written in Latin. His collections are today conserved in various institutions. The Natural History Museum of Stockholm has the largest collection (some thirty thousand species), although additional parts of Bresadola's collection are to be found in the Universities of Washington, Trent, Uppsala, Leiden and Paris.

It flows through the East Lyn Valley in Devon. History The Lynmouth Disaster occurred on the East Lyn river due to rocks and fallen trees having been washed into the West Lyn river. These formed a log jam near Watersmeet, forming a landslide dam. When the pressure behind the dam increased to uncontrollable levels, the water broke out of the dam, and rushed down the East Lyn (via the convergence of the rivers) into Lynmouth, obliterating houses and ultimately resulting in 34 deaths. Boulders from the incident can still be seen today, lining the banks of the East Lyn as it travels into Lynmouth today. Watercourse The river is formed as the Upper East Lyn at Malmsmead from two minor tributaries, the Oare Water and Badgworthy Water. It flows for several miles, past Brendon and makes confluence with Hoar Oak Water at Watersmeet, where Watersmeet House is situated.

Rose Theatre depicted in Norden's Map of London, 1593 The Beargarden or Bear Pit was the facility for bear-baiting, bull-baiting, and other \\"animal sports\\" in the London area during the 16th and 17th centuries, from the Elizabethan era to the English Restoration period. Samuel Pepys visited the venue in 1666 and described it as \\"a rude and nasty pleasure\\". The last recorded event at the Beargarden was the baiting of \\"a fine but vicious horse\\" in 1682. History The Beargarden was a round or polygonal open structure, comparable to the public theatres built in and around London starting in 1576. Contemporaneous illustrated maps of the city show a substantial three-storey building that resembles the theatres nearby.Shapiro, pp. 25-7. It was located in the Bankside, across from the City of London on the south bank of the River Thames in Southwark; but its exact location is unclear, and apparently changed over time. Documentary sources from the middle 16th century refer to the bear-baiting rink as being in Paris Garden, the liberty at the western end of the Bankside. The names of the facility and its location were merged in popular usage: John Stow, writing in 1583, calls it \\"The Beare-garden, commonly called the Paris garden.\\"Similarly, the prison located in the liberty of the Clink was called The Clink Prison, from which derived the colloquialism \\"in the clink.\\" The origins of the names of both liberties, Paris Garden and the Clink, are obscure and debated. Late-16th-century sources, however -- the Speculum Britanniae map of 1593, and the Civitas Londini map of 1600 -- show the Beargarden farther to the east, in the liberty of the Clink, where it sits on the northwestern side of the Rose Theatre.Halliday, p. 55. The building could have been moved from its original location, much as The Theatre was moved and rebuilt into the Globe Theatre in 1598-99.Halliday, pp. 188-9, 490. The date of the Beargarden's construction is unknown; it was in existence by the 1560s, when it is shown on the \\"woodcut\\" map of the city. Questions of the Beargarden's location and date are complicated by the fact that animal sports were conducted at more than one place in Southwark in this era; the Agas map shows both a bull-baiting and a bear-baiting ring, situated near each other (bulls to the west, bears to the east).Ordish, p. 127. John Taylor the Water Poet, testifying in the Court of Exchequer in 1620 or 1621, said that \\"the game of bear-baiting hath been kept in four several [i.e. separate] places, at Mason Stairs on the Bankside, near Maid Lane by the corner of Pike Garden, at the beargarden which was parcel of the possession of William Payne, and at the place where they now are kept.\\"Ordish, p. 140. Yet one main bear-baiting facility, the \\"Paris Garden,\\" stood out in the public mind. In 1578, William Fleetwood, \\"Sergeant-in-law\\" and Recorder of London, described it as a place where foreign ambassadors met their spies and agents; at night it was so dark and obscured by trees that a man needed \\"cat's eyes\\" to see.Calendar of States Papers Domestic, 1547-80; p. 595. Ambassadors and travellers were often shown the Beargarden; The prominent French nobleman the Duke of BironGeorge Chapman wrote plays about him: The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron. was escorted there by Sir Walter Raleigh on September 7, 1601. On Sunday, January 13, 1583, eight people were killed and others injured when the scaffold seating in the Beargarden collapsed under their weight. Puritan commentators, hostile to animal baiting as they were to other sports and pastimes (like play-going), attributed the accident to God's displeasure. The Beargarden closed for a time, but reopened a few months later. The English monarchy had had an official \\"bearward,\\" an officer in charge of its \\"bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs,\\" at least from the reign of Richard III. In 1573 a Ralph Bowes was appointed Queen Elizabeth's \\"Master of Her Majesty's Game at Paris Garden.\\" ( Elizabeth herself, like other royals and aristocrats of her era, was a passionate fan of animal baiting.) In 1604, Philip Henslowe (who had a financial interest in bear- baiting at least from 1594) and his son-in-law Edward Alleyn purchased the royal office of the Mastership for £450, and maintained the practice of animal baiting along with their other business of theatre production. Henslowe bought out Alleyn's share in 1611, for £580 (though Alleyn re-acquired his share upon Henslowe's 1616 death). In 1613, Henslowe and new partner Jacob Meade tore down the Beargarden, and in 1614 replaced it with the Hope Theatre. The Hope was equipped as a dual-purpose venue, hosting both stage plays and animal sports. Gradually, though, fewer plays were staged there, and the Hope was generally called the Beargarden after its primary use. Samuel Pepys, in an entry in his famous Diary, describes a visit he and his wife paid to the Hope/Beargarden on August 14, 1666. (He called the spectacle \\"a rude and nasty pleasure.\\")Halliday, p. 56. Spectacle Surviving descriptions of the entertainment offered at the Beargarden have an extraordinary ring to a modern ear and sensibility. The crowds were amused at the whipping of the old blind bear \\"Harry Hunks\\" until the blood ran down his shoulders. (At least some bears -- perhaps the fiercest, longest-enduring ones -- were given names: \\"George Stone,\\" \\"Ned Whiting,\\" and the most famous, \\"Sackerson.\\")Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 457. There are extant descriptions of horses with apes tied to their backs set upon by dogs. An early account, from the visiting Duke of Najera in 1544, mentions :\\"...a pony with an ape fastened on its back, and to see the animal kicking among the dogs, with the screams of the ape, beholding the curs hanging from the ears and neck of the pony, is very laughable.\\"Translated from the original Spanish; Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 454. Pepys describes a bull tossing a dog into a spectators' box. Others mention the bulls tossing dogs into the air and then catching the falling dogs on their horns again. On a few rare occasions (in 1604 and 1605, and in 1609 and 1610), lions were baited. The shows at the Beargarden had surprising aspects; according to contemporary accounts, music and fireworks were used, and special effects were employed. German tourist Lupold von Wedel was at the Beargarden on August 23, 1584; he left a description that cites the usual and expected baiting of bulls and bears, and a horse chased by the dogs, plus people dancing, and a man who threw white bread to the crowd (they \\"scrambled for it\\"). And then, :\\"Right over the middle of the place a rose was fixed, this rose being set on fire by a rocket: suddenly lots of apples and pears fell out of it down upon the people standing below. Whilst the people were scrambling for the apples, some rockets were made to fall down upon them out of the rose, which caused a great fright but amused the spectators. After this, rockets and other fireworks came flying out of all corners, and that was the end....\\"Translated from the original German; Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 455. The last recorded instance of animal baiting at the Hope/Beargarden occurred on April 12, 1682, when \\"a fine but vicious horse was advertised to be baited to death for the amusement of the Moroccan ambassador...and for as many as would pay to see it.\\"Wheatley, Vol. 2, p. 230. The horse reportedly had killed several men and other horses. It survived and beat off the dogs; to please the clamoring crowd, the horse was stabbed to death with a sword.Jesse, p. 273. Nowadays, by contrast, the term \\"Bear Garden\\" is employed by a retailer of teddy bears and stuffed animals. However, the Bear Pit is not entirely forgotten: Alleyn bought the manor of Dulwich in 1605 and in the course of establishing his tenure, implemented a requirement of Sir Francis Bacon's Star Chamber to establish a charitable school \\"for 12 poor children of the parish of Camberwell\\" - who appear in practice to have often been the players of the female parts at the Globe. Their own sub-company, named the Bear Pit, continued in the original School, which passed through the Dulwich College Lower School in the 1850s to Alleyn's School in 1887, and remains active to this day, run without any parental or scholastic support, regularly producing household names in the theatre. The intention of theatre as a medium for the young was further promoted by the secondment of the School's Head of English, Michael Croft, in the late 1950s to establish the National Youth Theatre. Although many members were from the School, their outreach achieved the target of opening the theatre to many of less advantaged backgrounds, and a worldwide movement resulted.

L. Hogan, was a noted American radio pioneer. Hogan was born in Philadelphia, constructed his first amateur wireless station in 1902, began his career in 1906 as a laboratory assistant to Lee de Forest, and in 1907 participated in the first public demonstration of the audion tube (triode). From 1908-10 he attended Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University, leaving without a degree to join Reginald Fessenden's National Electric Signaling Co. (NESCO) at Brant Rock, Massachusetts, where he served as a telegraph operator. While working at NESCO and its successors, Hogan helped develop Fessenden's first crystal detector patent (1910), a patent on single- control tuning (1912), and in 1913 discovered the \\"rectifier heterodyne\\" which increased radio receiver sensitivity by a factor of one hundred. In 1913 led acceptance tests of the U.S. Navy's first high powered station at Arlington, and from 1914-1917 was chief research engineer, working primarily on high- speed recorders for long-distance wireless. In 1921 Hogan became a consultant performing experiments in mechanical television, FM broadcasting, and facsimile transmission. By the late 1920s, he was broadcasting sound and pictures over his own experimental station, W2XR in New York City which officially went on the air March 26, 1929, having started his experimental transmissions of radio, facsimile, and television in 1928. During the 1930s his experiments with radio facsimile resulted in a machine capable of producing a 4-column newspaper, complete with illustrations, at the rate of 500 words per minute. He sold the station and its FM sister station (by then, WQXR and WQXQ) to The New York Times in 1944. During World War II, Hogan served as special assistant to Vannevar Bush at the Office of Scientific Research and Development, working on radar, missiles, and the proximity fuze.

It combines the mechanisms of naloxone and paracetamol (the two more commonly used abuse-deterring agents) by increasing the likelihood of the overdose resulting in harmful and/or fatal sequelae (as does paracetamol), in addition to reliably producing unpleasant side-effects which \\"spoil\\" the opioid euphoria and discourage abusers from overdosing again following their initial experience (as does naloxone). This does not deter the use of single doses of difenoxin to potentiate another opiate, the anticholingeric activity of a single tablet is actually likely to increase the pleasurable effects of opioid use in a manner similar to combining one or more opioids with orphenadrine.  Side effects  At high doses there are strong CNS effects and the atropine at such high doses causes typical anticholinergic side effects, such as anxiety, dysphoria, and delirium. Excessive use or overdose causes constipation and can promote development of megacolon as well as classic symptoms of overdose including potentially lethal respiratory depression. In the 1990s its use in children was restricted in many countries due to the CNS side effects, which included anorexia, nausea and vomiting, headache, drowsiness, confusion, insomnia, dizziness, restlessness, euphoria and depression.  Mechanism of action  Difenoxin has a high peripheral/central actions ratio, working primarily on various opioid receptors in the intestines. Although it is capable of producing significant central effects at high doses, doses within the normal therapeutic range generally do not notably impair cognition or proprioception, resulting in therapeutic activity roughly equatable to that of loperamide (Imodium). Increased dosages result in more prominent central opioid effects (and anticholingeric effects when the formulation also contains a tropane alkaloid). It therefore offers limited advantages over more potent anti-diarrheal opioid options (ex. morphine) when treating intractable cases of diarrhea which fail to respond to normal or moderately increased difenoxin doses, and may in fact be harmful in such circumstances if the formulation used also contains atropine or hyoscyamine.  Legal status  Difenoxin is a Schedule I drug by itself in the US; the combination with atropine is in the less-restrictive category Schedule IV on account of the adulterant (the practice of making opioids more easily available by including an abuse- deterring adulterating agent is standard practice in the United States). Pure difenoxin, in Schedule I, has a quota of 50 grammes, and an ACSCN of 9168. The combination of difenoxin and atropine, in Schedule IV, has the DEA ACSCN of 9167 and being in Schedule IV is not assigned an aggregate annual manufacturing quota.

It is located roughly 50 km from Graz and 200 km from Vienna. It has a population of 2.287 as of April 2010.  Emblem  The emblem of Stubenberg shows ideas of the emblem of the noble family of Stubenberg, which was named after the castle located within the area of Stubenberg. The toppled anchor resembles the silvery Wolfsangel of the emblem of the nobles; the background was replaced though, showing the green- white colors of Styria now.  Geography  Stubenberg is located in the valley of Feistritz, on the south-east of the Alps. The municipality extends between 386 to 1282 meters above sea level. =Climate= Due to its position southeast of the Alps, Stubenberg is shielded from the prevailing westerly winds that bring weather fronts in from the North Atlantic to northwestern and central Europe. =Districts= Stubenberg is divided into 5 districts. They are: * Buchberg, 452 ha (231 inhabitants) * Freienberg, 544 ha (293 inhabitants) * Stubenberg, 789 ha (622 inhabitants) * Vockenberg, 630 ha (440 inhabitants) * Zeil-Stubenberg, 841 ha (670 inhabitants) =Neighbouring municipalities= The following villages border Stubenberg (starting from north): * Rabenwald * Schönegg bei Pöllau * Tiefenbach bei Kaindorf * Sankt Johann bei Herberstein * Siegersdorf bei Herberstein * Puch bei Weiz * Floing Population =Population development= Since the first census 1869, resulting in 1,772 inhabitants, the number of inhabitants did rise almost year-to-year (with a sharp decline of 4.9% from 1934 to 1939) up to 2,325. Reaching a peak in 1991 the most recent number (2010) is slightly down, at 2,287. = Religions = The vast majority (95.4%) of the inhabitants are members of the Catholic Church; 0.8% belong to the Protestantism and about 0.4% are attributed to Islam. 2.1% of the inhabitants do not belong to any religious group.

The village can account for more than 150 thousand overnight stays. In addition, many visitors take day trips to Stubenberg, especially to its lake providing water sports facilities or to Schloss Herberstein. There is no industrial production located in the vicinity, small companies mainly provide for local demand. 14 percent of persons employed are within the agricultural sector. The service sector dominates with 52%. Stubenberg hosted the 1986 European Hot Air Balloon Championships, at the grounds of Schloss Schielleiten. The balloon event was held there again in 1996.

During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, then Major Fazle Haq was part of the Guides Cavalry in the 6th Armoured Division, when the regiment launched a two- squadron attack at Phillaurah on 11 September. The attack was targeted against the Indian 1st Armoured Division, and as a result both sides faced heavy casualties.

Military exemptions allow to evaluate the legal position of mercenary soldiers, functioning of legal norms of a temporary character and the interrelations between the statutory law and customary law in Poland. In 16th and 17th centuries both the general exemptions, granted by Sejm (parliament), and hetman’s exemptions, deprived of the Sejm’s sanction, existed. The constitutions on the exemptions always had a temporary nature. As a consequence of the advancing paralysis of the parliament’s works, the exemptions issued by hetman became more and more common. Exemptions were the releases to be applied before all types of courts, apart from military courts. They withheld the proceedings (even enforcement proceedings when the verdict did not benefit from the res iudicata character) with regard to all persons taking part in the military expeditions and their families. This enhanced the attractiveness of military service and prevented soldiers from leaving the army. Exemptions were known to the customary law, however, they were formulated by Sejm by means of constitutions. The parliament, depending on the circumstances, enlarged or limited the group of the beneficiaries, applied more or less strict criteria, changed the time limits of the exemptions’ validity, prevented their abuse, and most importantly, it firmly opposed a rejection of the releases by courts.

During this time, Fida Khan joined All-India Muslim League and actively participated in Pakistan Movement, serving as the leading activist of Pakistan Movement in Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa.Fida Mohammad Khan's interview remembered by a veteran print journalist, The Express Tribune (newspaper), Published 22 November 2014, Retrieved 8 August 2017 Fida Muhammad Khan was a veteran Muslim Leaguer and former Governor of NWFP. He had also served as an ex-senator, federal minister, provincial minister and a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan (MNA). He had represented Pakistan in the United Nations also at an early age of 27. As a young man, Fida Mohammad Khan took part in the independence movement. As All-India Muslim League - Peshawar chapter president, he played an active role in the 1947 referendum in the NWFP in which majority of voters opted for their province to become part of Pakistan. The referendum was rejected and boycotted by the Pashtun nationalists led by Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan. He also remained active in the All-India Muslim League's National Guards and Muslim Students Federation. He subsequently served as central and provincial president of the Muslim League. Twice during his political career, Fida Mohammad Khan was elected member of the Senate. However, he never contested an assembly election. During General Ziaul Haq's martial law regime, he served as federal housing minister. He remained governor of the NWFP from 1986 to 1988. Fida Mohammad was fond of narrating the story of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah's visit to Khyber Agency. Due to opposition by the Congress party of India and its ally, Khudai Khidmatgar movement, Jinnah's trip to Khyber Agency was considered risky. But Fida Mohammad Khan volunteered to drive Jinnah to Landikotal, where his father Tehmas Khan was serving as political Tehsildar. This was a historic trip as tribesmen gave a warm welcome to the Quaid-i-Azam and announced their allegiance to the All-India Muslim League. Quaid-i-Azam was driven to Torkham on the border with Afghanistan and brought back by Fida Mohammad Khan to Peshawar. For the young Fida, this was a memorable event and he never missed an opportunity to narrate the story. The PML under Mohammad Khan Junejo formed the government in the so-called 'non-party' elections of March 1985, but the President, General Zia ul Haq dismissed it on the 29th of May 1988 on account of challenges to Zia's power. Following this, Fida Khan lead a break-away faction of the PML, the so-called PML-F, which remained loyal to Zia. After Gen. Zia's death in a mysterious Pakistan Air Force crash in August 1988 the Supreme Court of Pakistan mandated free and fair multi-party general elections to be held in November 1988. The PML-F, under pressure from Inter-Services Intelligence Director-General Hamid Gul merged with the Jamaati Islami and a few smaller parties to form the 'Islami Jamhoori Ittihad.' The IJI under Fida Khan failed to achieve a majority in the National Assembly, but found victory in the Punjab Provincial Assembly under Nawaz Sharif.

A Sioux City, Iowa cemetery refused to bury his body because he was Native American, touching off a national episode culminating in President Harry Truman ordering his body to be interred in Arlington National Cemetery. Biography A tribal member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, also known as the Winnebago Indian Tribe, Rice was born in Winnebago, Nebraska, and had previously served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II.Way of the Warrior (2007) PBS documentary. Rice was awarded the Bronze Star for heroism during the New Guinea campaign, and he was killed leading a squad of Company A, 8th Cavalry Regiment, during the Battle of Tabu-dong \\"one of the most critical and heroic stands made by the hard-pressed United Nations forces.\\" During his funeral on August 28, 1951—at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Sioux City, Iowa—a cemetery employee noticed there were a lot of Native Americans among the mourners. After the military burial service, including the ceremonial three-volley salute, cemetery officials discovered that Rice himself was Native American. They stopped the actual burial, and made his non- Indian wife Evelyn take his body away. According to cemetery officials, \\"Private cemeteries have always had a right to be operated for a particular group such as Jewish, Catholic, Lutheran, Negro, Chinese, etc., not because of any prejudice against any race, but because people, like animals, prefer to be with their own kind.\\" The following day, August 29, then-President Harry Truman publicly reprimanded the cemetery and the Sioux City town leaders. Rice's wife was given a plot in Arlington National Cemetery. The press and local groups in Sioux City also lambasted the Sioux City cemetery. What is not widely reported is that prior to making burial arrangements at Memorial Park Cemetery, the widow had already been denied the burial of Sergeant Rice at the city-owned cemeteries because of his race. During this time in history, many businesses, including Memorial Park, still practiced segregation. Memorial Park's by-laws of the time restricted burial to white people only; burial of other races would have resulted in legal proceedings against the cemetery. The cemetery today offers burial to all persons, regardless of race, nationality, religion, etc. Sergeant Rice was buried with full military honors on September 5, 1951, nearly a year to the day after he died, in Arlington National Cemetery between two generals.

RNA-folding predictions suggest that this region of the NSP1 mRNA can interact with itself, producing a stem-loop structure similar to that found near the 5'-terminus of the NSP1 mRNA. The carboxyl-half of the rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP1 is not required for virus replication. NSP1 could play a role in host range restriction. The cysteine-rich region of NSP1 is not considered essential for genome segment reassortment with heterologous virus. NSP1 interacts with IRF3 in the infected cell. NSP1 is an antagonist of the IFN-signaling pathway. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a key transcription factor involved in the induction of interferon (IFN) in response to viral infection. NSP1 binds to and targets IRF3 for proteasome degradation early post-infection. IRF3 degradation is dependent on the presence of NSP1 and the integrity of the N-terminal zinc-binding domain, coupled with the regulated stability of IRF3 and NSP1 by the proteasome, collectively support the hypothesis that NSP1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. NSP1 could mediates the degradation of IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7 by recognizing a common element of IRF proteins, thereby allowing NSP1 to act as a broad-spectrum antagonist of IRF function.

The Belgian & Scottish Islands sections are not shown. EuroVelo 12 (EV12), the North Sea Cycle Route, is a long-distance cycling route circuit around the coastlines of the countries that border the North Sea: these countries are (going clockwise from an arbitrary starting point of Harwich in Essex) England, Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium. The North Sea Cycle Route was officially opened in 2001, and is an international project between the countries participating, with 68 partners in 8 countries. In 2003, the route was awarded a Guinness world record certificate confirming that the North Sea Cycle Route was the world's longest cycle route. Route The route starting from the Shetland islands towards Norway would go through the countries in the following order: =Scotland= The Scottish section of the North Sea Cycle Route follows the British National Cycle Route 1 (NCR 1) from the English border to Thurso on the north-east tip of the Scottish mainland. From the nearby port of Scrabster the route continues via ferry services to Stromness in Orkney and from there to Shetland. From there the route starts up again in Norway. (The ferry service linking Lerwick in Shetland with Bergen in Norway has been discontinued. The alternative is the summer-only twice-weekly flights from Sumburgh Airport south of Lerwick to Bergen in Norway, operated by flybe.) =England= Heading clockwise, starting at the English portside town of Harwich takes you through the following route. Travellers from the Continent would typically begin the English section of the North Sea Cycle Route at Harwich International Port in Parkeston. From there, there is a signposted route that meets the National Cycle Network's NCR51 in a park to the south of Dovercourt station. The route is then signposted as NCR51 south- east to Colchester where it then follows National Cycle Route 1. Once on NCR 1, this route takes you all the way to the Scottish border. An alternative route from Harwich is to take the National Cycle Route 51 in the other direction, then take a (seasonal) foot ferry north using NCR 51 to Felixstowe and then either head directly for the NCR1 using Regional Cycle Route 41 to Woodbridge or take a more scenic route using RCR41 up the Suffolk coast and join NCR1 near Saxmundham. =Belgium= The Belgian section of the North Sea Cycle Route has been added in at a later date. It basically continues to follow the LF1 from the Netherlands and goes from Knokke in the Zwin region through to Oostende, to Nieuwpoort and to De Panne close to the border with France. (The LF1 ultimately terminates at Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.) =The Netherlands= The Dutch section of the North Sea Cycle Route is approximately long and follows two national LF-routes, the LF10 (Waddenzeeroute) and the LF1 (Noordzeeroute), starting at the German border at Nieuweschans to Sluis near the Belgian border. The LF10 starts from Nieuweschans near the German border and continues to Callantsoog. This route shows you the Groningen and Frisian coast at its best. The salty, fresh wind on your back and gaze at the endless green pastures cycling along vanished villages, congested inland seas, hidden, stinzen, mounds and basalt dikes. Highlights include the former island of Wieringen in North Holland, part of the route, Lauwersmeer National Park. The route also passes over all ports with ferry connections to the Dutch Wadden Sea. A little \\"island hopping\\" to Vlieland and Schiermonnikoog is easily possible. From Callantsoog, the route follows the LF1 from nearby Den Helder and continues to Sluis near the Belgian border. Before the Belgian sections were included, the North Sea Cycle Route originally terminated at the Hook of Holland where passenger ferries sail to the English port of Harwich, thus completing the circuit of the North Sea Cycle Route. =Germany= The German section of the North Sea Cycle Route follows the German Cycling Network's D1 route. This route follows for the most part the North Sea coast through rural areas, but also passes several towns and cities. You will become acquainted with various parts of the Wadden Sea landscape, which is absolutely unique. Sometimes the route diverts inland to a more varied landscape. =Denmark= The Danish section of the North Sea Cycle Route follows two routes of the Danish National Cycle Routes network, routes 5 and 1. It starts just across the channel from Sweden at the Danish port of Grenå on the Djursland peninsula. Following national route 5 it travels north to Skagen. From Skagen it continues south along the west coast following route 1 all the way to the town of Rudbøl on the German border. =Sweden= The Swedish section of the North Sea Cycle Route is and follows the west coast of Sweden through the counties of Halland and Västra Götaland. From Norway, the route starts at Svinesund and follows the Cykelspåret cycling route through the province of Bohuslän towards Gothenburg. The navigation signs of the Cykelspåret cycling route are badly maintained, which makes additional GPS-navigation necessary. From Gothenburg, it follows the Ginstleden and Cykelspåret Väst cycling routes southwards to the port of Varberg. From there the route departs Sweden with the ferry to Grenå in Denmark. =Norway= The Norwegian section of the North Sea Cycle Route starts in Bergen, and exits to Sweden at Svinesund. The route follows the southern coastline, and is approx 1000 kilometres long. Along the route several towns are visited, among them Haugesund, Stavanger, Kristiansand, Arendal, Larvik, Sandefjord, Tønsberg, Fredrikstad and Sarpsborg. The whole route is marked with a sign that reads 1, as it shares it route with the Norwegian National Cycle Route 1. Because former ferry routes have been replaced with tunnels forbidden for bicycles, the route is now moving far into the inland east of Stavanger in order to still reach Bergen. Even this route might be changed, because it uses the ferry from Stavanger to Tau, which has been replaced by the 14 km Ryfylke Tunnel, which is forbidden for bicycles.

They are known as more for the science-fiction laced sexuality they portray as for their music. They are more often compared to late 60s to early 70s glam and psychedelic bands like David Bowie and Pink Floyd than to any contemporary bands. Their initial following was mainly in the LGBT community. History The band began as a recording project in Rochester, New York with frontwoman April Laragy on vocals and guitar, Gary Trainer on bass, and Roy Stein on drums. As they began to play together they realized that they would need to play live gigs to attract a following and added guitarists Chris Yockel and Scott Ostrowski for a fuller sound. Adding Yockel and Ostrowski contributed to the emergence of the band's eclectic nature. Ostrowski, a blues-based traditional rock guitarist contrasted with Yockel's jagged ambient style to create an edgy tension to their sound. Keyboardist Johnny Cummings rounded out the sextet and they began playing and recording the tracks for what would become their self-released debut album, Coming Out Electric. Ostrowski has since been replaced by Mike Gladstone. Attention from the LGBT community Laragy's on-stage persona is of a space-aged biker lesbian and the band's homoerotic stage show and lyrics have not gone unnoticed by the LGBT community. They have been mentioned in Out magazine and the Advocate. Their first music video, \\"Float (My Electric Stargirl)\\", premiered at the ImageOut film festival. Coming Out Electric The band's debut, self-released, concept album, Coming Out Electric, was released in 2004 and produced by Christopher Hooker, originally it was to be called Intergalactic Lesbian Love Songs. It has been compared to David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust and Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon. George Smith of the Village Voice has called it \\"a rock opera about spacebiker lesbian stargirls in love\\". Laragy, Trainer, and Stein shared all of the song-writing duties and maintain a science fiction theme throughout. =\\"Float (My Electric Stargirl)\\"= The first single from Coming Out Electric was \\"Float (My Electric Stargirl)\\". An animated video, described as \\"Barbarella-meets-Samurai Jack\\", was shot by director Joel Trussell and tells the story of a lesbian starship captain searching for her abducted lover. In addition to its premiere at the 2004 ImageOut festival, it has been featured at the 2005 Hypefest film and video film festival, New York's 4th annual Indie Music Video Festival, Vancouver's International Digital Festival 2005, and Brooklyn, New York's Animation Block Valentine Film Festival 2005. Live show The shows are a multimedia experience that have been known to \\"inspire a mixture of wonder and confusion in the audience\\". Laragy has said of their shows, \\"We want to give the audience a surreal way to experience the band's music. By collaborating with these artists we are able to celebrate, explore, and connect the space between visual and musical performance... without the use of heavy pharmaceuticals\\".

His most prominent club was Dundee United, where he returned to work as a community coach after ending his playing career. Career Having been developed as a player through Dundee United's youth scheme, he turned professional with the club in July 1997. McDonald made his United debut in a League Cup tie at home to Airdrie in September 2000 and appeared as a substitute in the Dundee derby two weeks later. During the derby match, McDonald – who himself suffered concussion and sickness – admitted responsibility for a challenge that saw teammate Jason de Vos wrongly sent off for challenging Fabián Caballero, injuring the Argentine for several months. The fallout from the challenge saw Dundee manager Ivano Bonetti call de Vos \\"an animal\\", prompting the Canadian to consider legal action. McDonald failed to make another appearance for United and went on loan to Greenock Morton in January 2001, playing three times for them. In October, McDonald was released from United along with youngsters Blair Sturrock and Gary Middleton. McDonald captained Scotland's under-15 and under-16 teams.

The halls in the basement served for years as the only Catholic school in the city.\\"St Andrew's Cathedral, Dundee\\", Leisure and Culture Dundee The church was dedicated as a cathedral on 4 February 1923. The sanctuary (presbyterium) area, which contains the high altar and stalls for the canons of the cathedral, was added later by knocking out the back wall and building on top of the clergy house. As a result, the altar area is significantly higher than the body of the cathedral. The cathedral is also unusual in that the floor slopes from the entrance to the entrance to the sanctuary. Interior There are two side altars in the cathedral; one is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the other to Mary, the Mother of Jesus under her title of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. As in all Catholic churches, the cathedral has a set of the Stations of the Cross on the walls. In the vestibule there is a statue of the cathedral's patron saint, Saint Andrew.

Howitt is chiefly remembered for designing prominent public buildings, such as the Council House and Processional Way in Nottingham, Baskerville House in Birmingham (first phase of the unrealised Civic Centre scheme), Newport Civic Centre, and several Odeon cinemas (such as Weston-super-Mare and Bristol). Howitt’s chief architectural legacies are in his home city of Nottingham. He was Housing Architect for the City Council, designing municipal housing estates which are often considered to be among the finest in terms of planning in the country. Early years Howitt was born at Hucknall, near Nottingham and educated at Nottingham High School, leaving in 1904 to be apprenticed to the prominent Nottingham architect, Albert Nelson Bromley. Bromley was architect to the Nottingham School Board and did extensive work for the Boots Company. In 1907, Howitt studied briefly at the Architectural Association School in London. He later opened a London branch office for Bromley, before returning to the Nottingham office until 1913. Following a study tour of Europe in early 1914, Howitt was invited to become the company architect for Boots, however, the war soon intervened. Howitt was commissioned in November 1914, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Leicestershire Regiment. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and French Croix de Guerre, as well as a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur (for action at the Battle of the Marne). Howitt was demobilised with the rank of Major in October 1919, and joined the City Engineer's Department at Nottingham City Council. Architectural career In 1926, Howitt’s rising status in the profession was marked by election as a member of the RIBA Council. The following year, he made a study tours of the USA and Canada and in 1928 to Denmark and Sweden (where he saw Stockholm Town Hall-writing an article about it for the local Nottingham Guardian). In 1928 he was appointed City Architect in Nottingham in succession to Arthur Dale, but he relinquished this position in 1930 in favour of Edward Phillips. As work on the Council House came towards completion, Howitt wished to set up his own practice, and after being asked to stay in post until a suitable successor could be appointed, he established an office in Exchange Buildings in December 1930.

Development of CADPAT started in the 1990s, but it was not until the turn of the 21st century that widespread adoption began.

The resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. Since the initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments, under the GNU General Public License v2. Events leading to creation Ken Thompson (left) and Dennis Ritchie (right) After AT&T; had dropped out of the Multics project, the Unix operating system was conceived and implemented by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (both of AT&T; Bell Laboratories) in 1969 and first released in 1970. Later they rewrote it in a new programming language, C, to make it portable. The availability and portability of Unix caused it to be widely adopted, copied and modified by academic institutions and businesses. In 1977, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) from UC Berkeley, based on the 6th edition of Unix from AT&T.; Since BSD contained Unix code that AT&T; owned, AT&T; filed a lawsuit (USL v. BSDi) in the early 1990s against the University of California. This strongly limited the development and adoption of BSD. In 1983, Richard Stallman started the GNU project with the goal of creating a free UNIX-like operating system.Initial Announcement of the GNU Project, 1983 As part of this work, he wrote the GNU General Public License (GPL). By the early 1990s, there was almost enough available software to create a full operating system. However, the GNU kernel, called Hurd, failed to attract enough development effort, leaving GNU incomplete. In 1985, Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor with a 32-bit instruction set and a memory management unit with paging. In 1986, Maurice J. Bach, of AT&T; Bell Labs, published The Design of the UNIX Operating System. This definitive description principally covered the System V Release 2 kernel, with some new features from Release 3 and BSD. In 1987, MINIX, a Unix-like system intended for academic use, was released by Andrew S. Tanenbaum to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. While source code for the system was available, modification and redistribution were restricted. In addition, MINIX's 16-bit design was not well adapted to the 32-bit features of the increasingly cheap and popular Intel 386 architecture for personal computers. In the early nineties a commercial UNIX operating system for Intel 386 PCs was too expensive for private users.:Video 0:50 min. These factors and the lack of a widely adopted, free kernel provided the impetus for Torvalds' starting his project. He has stated that if either the GNU Hurd or 386BSD kernels had been available at the time, he likely would not have written his own. The creation of Linux Linus Torvalds in 2002 In 1991, while studying computer science at University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds began a project that later became the Linux kernel. He wrote the program specifically for the hardware he was using and independent of an operating system because he wanted to use the functions of his new PC with an 80386 processor. Development was done on MINIX using the GNU C Compiler. As Torvalds wrote in his book Just for Fun, he eventually ended up writing an operating system kernel. On 25 August 1991, he (at age ) announced this system in a Usenet posting to the newsgroup \\"comp.os.minix.\\": According to Torvalds, Linux began to gain importance in 1992 after the X Window System was ported to Linux by Orest Zborowski, which allowed Linux to support a GUI for the first time. Naming Floppy disks holding a very early version of Linux Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention Freax, a portmanteau of \\"free\\", \\"freak\\", and \\"x\\" (as an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, he stored the files under the name \\"Freax\\" for about half of a year. Torvalds had already considered the name \\"Linux\\", but initially dismissed it as too egotistical. In order to facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the FTP server (ftp.funet.fi) of FUNET in September 1991. Ari Lemmke at Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did not think that \\"Freax\\" was a good name. So, he named the project \\"Linux\\" on the server without consulting Torvalds. Later, however, Torvalds consented to \\"Linux\\". To demonstrate how the word \\"Linux\\" should be pronounced (), Torvalds included an audio guide () with the kernel source code. Linux under the GNU GPL Torvalds first published the Linux kernel under its own licence, which had a restriction on commercial activity. The software to use with the kernel was software developed as part of the GNU project licensed under the GNU General Public License, a free software license. The first release of the Linux kernel, Linux 0.01, included a binary of GNU's Bash shell.Torvalds, Linus: Notes for linux release 0.01 kernel.org, 1991. In the \\"Notes for linux release 0.01\\", Torvalds lists the GNU software that is required to run Linux: In 1992, he suggested releasing the kernel under the GNU General Public License. He first announced this decision in the release notes of version 0.12. In the middle of December 1992 he published version 0.99 using the GNU GPL.z-archive of Linux version 0.99, kernel.org, December 1992 Linux and GNU developers worked to integrate GNU components with Linux to make a fully functional and free operating system. Torvalds has stated, \\"making Linux GPLed was definitely the best thing I ever did.\\"Hiroo Yamagata: The Pragmatist of Free Software, Linus Torvalds Interview , 30 September 1997 Around 2000, Torvalds clarified that the Linux kernel uses the GPLv2 license, without the common \\"or later clause\\". After years of draft discussions, the GPLv3 was released in 2007; however, Torvalds and the majority of kernel developers decided against adopting the new license.Linus Torvalds says GPL v3 violates everything that GPLv2 stood for Debconf 2014, Portland, Oregon (accessed 11 March 2015) GNU/Linux naming controversy The designation \\"Linux\\" was initially used by Torvalds only for the Linux kernel. The kernel was, however, frequently used together with other software, especially that of the GNU project. This quickly became the most popular adoption of GNU software. In June 1994 in GNU's bulletin, Linux was referred to as a \\"free UNIX clone\\", and the Debian project began calling its product Debian GNU/Linux. In May 1996, Richard Stallman published the editor Emacs 19.31, in which the type of system was renamed from Linux to Lignux. This spelling was intended to refer specifically to the combination of GNU and Linux, but this was soon abandoned in favor of \\"GNU/Linux\\". This name garnered varying reactions. The GNU and Debian projects use the name, although most people simply use the term \\"Linux\\" to refer to the combination. Official mascot Tux Torvalds announced in 1996 that there would be a mascot for Linux, a penguin. This was because when they were about to select the mascot, Torvalds mentioned he was bitten by a little penguin (Eudyptula minor) on a visit to the National Zoo & Aquarium in Canberra, Australia. Larry Ewing provided the original draft of today's well known mascot based on this description. The name Tux was suggested by James Hughes as derivative of Torvalds' UniX, along with being short for tuxedo, a type of suit with color similar to that of a penguin. New development =Linux Community= The largest part of the work on Linux is performed by the community: the thousands of programmers around the world that use Linux and send their suggested improvements to the maintainers. Various companies have also helped not only with the development of the kernels, but also with the writing of the body of auxiliary software, which is distributed with Linux. As of February 2015, over 80% of Linux kernel developers are paid. It is released both by organized projects such as Debian, and by projects connected directly with companies such as Fedora and openSUSE. The members of the respective projects meet at various conferences and fairs, in order to exchange ideas. One of the largest of these fairs is the LinuxTag in Germany, where about 10,000 people assemble annually to discuss Linux and the projects associated with it. =Open Source Development Lab and Linux Foundation= The Open Source Development Lab (OSDL) was created in the year 2000, and is an independent nonprofit organization which pursues the goal of optimizing Linux for employment in data centers and in the carrier range. It served as sponsored working premises for Linus Torvalds and also for Andrew Morton (until the middle of 2006 when Morton transferred to Google). Torvalds worked full-time on behalf of OSDL, developing the Linux kernels. On 22 January 2007, OSDL and the Free Standards Group merged to form The Linux Foundation, narrowing their respective focuses to that of promoting Linux in competition with Microsoft Windows. As of 2015, Torvalds remains with the Linux Foundation as a Fellow. =Companies= Despite being freely available, companies profit from Linux. These companies, many of which are also members of the Linux Foundation, invest substantial resources into the advancement and development of Linux, in order to make it suited for various application areas. This includes hardware donations for driver developers, cash donations for people who develop Linux software, and the employment of Linux programmers at the company. Some examples are Dell, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, which validate, use and sell Linux on their own servers, and Red Hat and SUSE, which maintain their own enterprise distributions. Likewise, Digia supports Linux by the development and LGPL licensing of Qt, which makes the development of KDE possible, and by employing some of the X and KDE developers. =Desktop environments= KDE was the first advanced desktop environment (version 1.0 released in July 1998), but it was controversial due to the then-proprietary Qt toolkit used.Byfield B. (2007). KDE vs. GNOME: Is One Better?. Datamation. GNOME was developed as an alternative due to licensing questions. The two use a different underlying toolkit and thus involve different programming, and are sponsored by two different groups, German nonprofit KDE e.V. and the United States nonprofit GNOME Foundation. As of April 2007, one journalist estimated that KDE had 65% of market share versus 26% for GNOME. In January 2008, KDE 4 was released prematurely with bugs, driving some users to GNOME.Byfield B. (2011). Will GNOME 3.0 Repeat the User Revolt of KDE 4.0?. Datamation. GNOME 3, released in April 2011, was called an \\"unholy mess\\" by Linus Torvalds due to its controversial design changes.Linus Torvalds dubs GNOME 3 'unholy mess'. The Register. Dissatisfaction with GNOME 3 led to a fork, Cinnamon, which is developed primarily by Linux Mint developer Clement LeFebvre. This restores the more traditional desktop environment with marginal improvements. The relatively well-funded distribution, Ubuntu, designed (and released in June 2011) another user interface called Unity which is radically different from the conventional desktop environment and has been criticized as having various flawsWhat’s wrong with Unity & how we can fix it. OMG Ubuntu. and lacking configurability.Ubuntu Desktop Designers: ‘Unity Should Be Configurable’. OMG Ubuntu. The motivation was a single desktop environment for desktops and tablets, although as of November 2012 Unity has yet to be used widely in tablets. However, the smartphone and tablet version of Ubuntu and its Unity interface was unveiled by Canonical Ltd in January 2013. In April 2017, Canonical canceled the phone-based Ubuntu Touch project entirely in order to focus on IoT projects such as Ubuntu Core. In April 2018, Canonical dropped Unity and began to use GNOME for the Ubuntu releases from 18.04 onward. \\"Linux is obsolete\\" In 1992, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, recognized computer scientist and author of the Minix microkernel system, wrote a Usenet article on the newsgroup comp.os.minix with the title \\"Linux is obsolete\\", which marked the beginning of a famous debate about the structure of the then-recent Linux kernel. Among the most significant criticisms were that: * The kernel was monolithic and thus old-fashioned. * The lack of portability, due to the use of exclusive features of the Intel 386 processor. \\"Writing a new operating system that is closely tied to any particular piece of hardware, especially a weird one like the Intel line, is basically wrong.\\" * There was no strict control of the source code by any individual person. * Linux employed a set of features which were useless (Tanenbaum believed that multithreaded file systems were simply a \\"performance hack\\").Andrew Tanenbaum, Linus Torvalds and others: Linux is obsolete Usenet post, 29 January 1992 Tanenbaum's prediction that Linux would become outdated within a few years and replaced by GNU Hurd (which he considered to be more modern) proved incorrect. Linux has been ported to all major platforms and its open development model has led to an exemplary pace of development. In contrast, GNU Hurd has not yet reached the level of stability that would allow it to be used on a production server.The GNU Hurd Project His dismissal of the Intel line of 386 processors as 'weird' has also proven short-sighted, as the x86 series of processors and the Intel Corporation would later become near ubiquitous in personal computers and servers. In his unpublished book Samizdat, Kenneth Brown claims that Torvalds illegally copied code from MINIX. In May 2004, these claims were refuted by Tanenbaum, the author of MINIX: The book's claims, methodology and references were seriously questioned and in the end it was never released and was delisted from the distributor's site. Microsoft competition and collaboration Although Torvalds has said that Microsoft's feeling threatened by Linux in the past was of no consequence to him, the Microsoft and Linux camps had a number of antagonistic interactions between 1997 and 2001. This became quite clear for the first time in 1998, when the first Halloween document was brought to light by Eric S. Raymond. This was a short essay by a Microsoft developer that sought to lay out the threats posed to Microsoft by free software and identified strategies to counter these perceived threats. Competition entered a new phase in the beginning of 2004, when Microsoft published results from customer case studies evaluating the use of Windows vs. Linux under the name “Get the Facts” on its own web page. Based on inquiries, research analysts, and some Microsoft sponsored investigations, the case studies claimed that enterprise use of Linux on servers compared unfavorably to the use of Windows in terms of reliability, security, and total cost of ownership. In response, commercial Linux distributors produced their own studies, surveys and testimonials to counter Microsoft's campaign. Novell's web-based campaign at the end of 2004 was entitled “Unbending the truth” and sought to outline the advantages as well as dispelling the widely publicized legal liabilities of Linux deployment (particularly in light of the SCO v IBM case). Novell particularly referenced the Microsoft studies in many points. IBM also published a series of studies under the title “The Linux at IBM competitive advantage” to again parry Microsoft's campaign. Red Hat had a campaign called “Truth Happens” aimed at letting the performance of the product speak for itself, rather than advertising the product by studies. In the autumn of 2006, Novell and Microsoft announced an agreement to co-operate on software interoperability and patent protection. This included an agreement that customers of either Novell or Microsoft may not be sued by the other company for patent infringement. This patent protection was also expanded to non-commercial free software developers. The last part was criticized because it only included non-commercial free software developers. In July 2009, Microsoft submitted 22,000 lines of source code to the Linux kernel under the GPLV2 license, which were subsequently accepted. Although this has been referred to as \\"a historic move\\" and as a possible bellwether of an improvement in Microsoft's corporate attitudes toward Linux and open-source software, the decision was not altogether altruistic, as it promised to lead to significant competitive advantages for Microsoft and avoided legal action against Microsoft. Microsoft was actually compelled to make the code contribution when Vyatta principal engineer and Linux contributor Stephen Hemminger discovered that Microsoft had incorporated a Hyper-V network driver, with GPL-licensed open source components, statically linked to closed-source binaries in contravention of the GPL licence. Microsoft contributed the drivers to rectify the licence violation, although the company attempted to portray it as a charitable act, rather than one to avoid legal action against it. In the past Microsoft had termed Linux a \\"cancer\\" and \\"communist\\". By 2011, Microsoft had become the 17th largest contributor to the Linux kernel. As of February 2015, Microsoft was no longer among the top 30 contributing sponsor companies. The Windows Azure project was announced in 2008 and renamed to Microsoft Azure. It incorporates Linux as part of its suite of server-based software applications. In August 2018, SUSE created a Linux kernel specifically tailored to the cloud computing applications under the Microsoft Azure project umbrella. Speaking about the kernel port, a Microsoft representative said \\"The new Azure-tuned kernel allows those customers to quickly take advantage of new Azure services such as Accelerated Networking with SR-IOV.\\" In recent years, Torvalds has expressed a neutral to friendly attitude towards Microsoft following the company's new embrace of open source software and collaboration with the Linux community. \\"The whole anti-Microsoft thing was sometimes funny as a joke, but not really.\\" said Torvalds in an interview with ZDNet. \\"Today, they're actually much friendlier. I talk to Microsoft engineers at various conferences, and I feel like, yes, they have changed, and the engineers are happy. And they're like really happy working on Linux. So I completely dismissed all the anti-Microsoft stuff.\\" SCO In March 2003, the SCO Group accused IBM of violating their copyright on UNIX by transferring code from UNIX to Linux. SCO claims ownership of the copyrights on UNIX and a lawsuit was filed against IBM. Red Hat has counter-sued and SCO has since filed other related lawsuits. At the same time as their lawsuit, SCO began selling Linux licenses to users who did not want to risk a possible complaint on the part of SCO. Since Novell also claims the copyrights to UNIX, it filed suit against SCO. In early 2007, SCO filed the specific details of a purported copyright infringement. Despite previous claims that SCO was the rightful copyright holder of 1 million lines of code, they specified only 326 lines of code, most of which were uncopyrightable. In August 2007, the court in the Novell case ruled that SCO did not actually hold the Unix copyrights, to begin with, though the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in August 2009 that the question of who held the copyright properly remained for a jury to answer. The jury case was decided on 30 March 2010 in Novell's favour. SCO has since filed for bankruptcy. Trademark rights In 1994 and 1995, several people from different countries attempted to register the name \\"Linux\\" as a trademark. Thereupon requests for royalty payments were issued to several Linux companies, a step with which many developers and users of Linux did not agree. Linus Torvalds clamped down on these companies with help from Linux International and was granted the trademark to the name, which he transferred to Linux International. Protection of the trademark was later administered by a dedicated foundation, the non-profit Linux Mark Institute. In 2000, Linus Torvalds specified the basic rules for the assignment of the licenses. This means that anyone who offers a product or a service with the name Linux must possess a license for it, which can be obtained through a unique purchase. In June 2005, a new controversy developed over the use of royalties generated from the use of the Linux trademark. The Linux Mark Institute, which represents Linus Torvalds' rights, announced a price increase from 500 to 5,000 dollars for the use of the name. This step was justified as being needed to cover the rising costs of trademark protection. In response to this increase, the community became displeased, which is why Linus Torvalds made an announcement on 21 August 2005, in order to dissolve the misunderstandings. In an e-mail he described the current situation as well as the background in detail and also dealt with the question of who had to pay license costs: The Linux Mark Institute has since begun to offer a free, perpetual worldwide sublicense. Chronology * 1991: The Linux kernel is publicly announced on 25 August by the 21-year-old Finnish student Linus Benedict Torvalds. * 1992: The Linux kernel is relicensed under the GNU GPL. The first Linux distributions are created. * 1993: Over 100 developers work on the Linux kernel. With their assistance the kernel is adapted to the GNU environment, which creates a large spectrum of application types for Linux. The oldest currently (as of 2018) existing Linux distribution, Slackware, is released for the first time. Later in the same year, the Debian project is established. Today it is the largest community distribution. * 1994: Torvalds judges all components of the kernel to be fully matured: he releases version 1.0 of Linux. The XFree86 project contributes a graphical user interface (GUI). Commercial Linux distribution makers Red Hat and SUSE publish version 1.0 of their Linux distributions. * 1995: Linux is ported to the DEC Alpha and to the Sun SPARC. Over the following years it is ported to an ever-greater number of platforms. * 1996: Version 2.0 of the Linux kernel is released. The kernel can now serve several processors at the same time using symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and thereby becomes a serious alternative for many companies. * 1998: Many major companies such as IBM, Compaq and Oracle announce their support for Linux. The Cathedral and the Bazaar is first published as an essay (later as a book), resulting in Netscape publicly releasing the source code to its Netscape Communicator web browser suite. Netscape's actions and crediting of the essay brings Linux's open source development model to the attention of the popular technical press. In addition a group of programmers begins developing the graphical user interface KDE. * 1999: A group of developers begin work on the graphical environment GNOME, destined to become a free replacement for KDE, which at the time, depended on the then proprietary Qt toolkit. During the year IBM announces an extensive project for the support of Linux. Version 2.2 of the Linux kernel is released. * 2000: Dell announces that it is now the No. 2 provider of Linux-based systems worldwide and the first major manufacturer to offer Linux across its full product line.Dell, Michael (15 August 2000), Remarks Putting Linux on the Fast Track - Keynote at the LinuxWorld Expo, San Jose, California, retrieved 2 February 2014 * 2001: Version 2.4 of the Linux kernel is released. * 2002: The media reports that \\"Microsoft killed Dell Linux\\"Orlowski, Andrew (19 March 2002), Microsoft ‘killed Dell Linux’ – States, The Register, retrieved 3 February 2014 * 2003: Version 2.6 of the Linux kernel is released. * 2004: The XFree86 team splits up and joins with the existing X standards body to form the X.Org Foundation, which results in a substantially faster development of the X server for Linux. * 2005: The project openSUSE begins a free distribution from Novell's community. Also the project OpenOffice.org introduces version 2.0 that then started supporting OASIS OpenDocument standards. * 2006: Oracle releases its own distribution of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Novell and Microsoft announce cooperation for a better interoperability and mutual patent protection. * 2007: Dell starts distributing laptops with Ubuntu pre-installed on them. * 2009: Red Hat's market capitalization equals Sun's, interpreted as a symbolic moment for the \\"Linux-based economy\\". * 2011: Version 3.0 of the Linux kernel is released. * 2012: The aggregate Linux server market revenue exceeds that of the rest of the Unix market. * 2013: Google's Linux-based Android claims 75% of the smartphone market share, in terms of the number of phones shipped. * 2014: Ubuntu claims 22,000,000 users. * 2015: Version 4.0 of the Linux kernel is released. *2019: Version 5.0 of the Linux kernel is released.

The law prohibits political events at the site. Law 52/2007 That recognises and broadens the rights and establishes measures in favour of those who suffered persecution or violence during the Civil War and the Dictatorship (in Spanish: Ley 57/2007 por la que se reconocen y amplían derechos y se establecen medidas en favor de quienes padecieron persecución o violencia durante la Guerra Civil y la Dictadura), commonly known as Historical Memory Law (Sp: Ley de Memoria Histórica), is a Spanish law passed by the Congress of Deputies on 31 October 2007.El País, 1/11/2007, La ley de memoria se aprueba entre aplausos de invitados antifranquistas It was based on a bill proposed by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party government of Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. The Historical Memory Law principally recognizes the victims on both sides of the Spanish Civil War, gives rights to the victims and the descendants of victims of the Civil War and the subsequent dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, and formally condemns the Franco Regime. The conservative Popular Party and the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) both voted against passage of the law but for different reasons. For its no vote the Popular Party accused the Socialist Party government of weakening the political consensus of the transition to democracy and \\"using the Civil War as an argument for political propaganda\\", while the Republican Left of Catalonia rejected the law on the basis it did not go far enough.  Provisions  The main provisions of the law are:http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/31/europe/EU-GEN-Spain-Civil-War- Legislation.php International Herald Tribune: Main points of Spain's Historical Memory Law * Recognition of the victims of political, religious and ideological violence on both sides of the Spanish Civil War and of Franco's State. * Condemnation of the Francoist State * Prohibition of political events at the Valley of the Fallen – Franco's burial place. * The removal of Francoist symbols from public buildings and spaces. Exceptions may be given for artistic or architectural reasons, or in the case of religious spaces. * State help in the tracing, identification and eventual exhumation of victims of Francoist repression whose corpses are still missing, often buried in mass graves. * The granting of Spanish nationality to surviving members of the International Brigades, without requiring them to renounce their own nationalities. * Rejection of the legitimacy of laws passed and trials conducted by the Francoist State. * Temporary change to Spanish nationality law, granting the right of return and de origen citizenship to those who left Spain under Franco for political or economic reasons, and their descendants. * Provision of aid to the victims and descendants of victims of the Civil War and the Francoist State.  Criticism  Criticism of the law has come from two sides, those who think that the law is not effective enough and those who support the Pact of forgetting. Doubt has been expressed about how effective the law is as a means of obtaining retroactive justice. Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), the left wing and Catalan nationalist party, opposed the law for not overturning verdicts reached by judges in political trials conducted during the Francoist State, although the new legislation did declare these trials illegitimate. Another example of the limits placed on judicial activity is what happened in 2008 when Judge Baltasar Garzón opened a national investigation into Franco and his allies. He dropped the investigation the same year after state prosecutors questioned his jurisdiction over Francoist crimes. In a 152-page statement, he passed responsibility to regional courts for opening 19 mass graves believed to hold the remains of hundreds of victims. Subsequently, a Spanish court upheld the 1977 Amnesty Law, declaring that Garzón had opened the investigation without proper authority. Members of the conservative Popular Party have tended to support the Amnesty Law, arguing that the Historical Memory Law goes against the spirit of Spain's transition to democracy. For example, while in opposition the leader of the Popular Party Mariano Rajoy claimed that Garzón's attempt to compile a list of victims would needlessly open up old wounds. However, the Popular Party did offer support for some elements of the Historical Memory Law, including seven amendments to the original text of the law, facilitating the \\"depoliticisation\\" of the Valle de los Caídos (Valley of the Fallen) and monetary aid to victims of the Civil War and Franco regime. Implementation of the Law The conservative Popular Party government of Mariano Rajoy, which was in power from 2011 until 2018, neither repealed nor amended the Historical Memory Law. The Centro Documental de la Memoria Histórica provided information on victims of Francoist repression, but the government curtailed State help in the exhumation of victims. In 2020 the Sánchez government resumed financial support to victim associations for exhumations. New law In 2020 El Pais reported that the Pedro Sánchez administration was working on the draft of a new historical memory law that would include a DNA database and an official list of Civil War victims.

It was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. Toponym Seacourt's toponym is derived from the Old English apparently meaning the homestead of an Anglo Saxon man called Seofeca.Ekwall, 1960 It evolved from Seofecanwyrthe and Seovecurt in the 10th century, through Sevacoorde and Sevecurt in the 11th century, Sewkeworth and Seuekwrth in the 12th century, Sevecheworda and Sevecowrthe in the 13th century and Sekworth and Sewecourte in the 16th century.Page & Ditchfield, 1924, pages 421–423 Manor The earliest known record of Seacourt is from 955, when King Eadwig granted 20 hides of land at Hinksey, Seacourt and Wytham to the Benedictine Abingdon Abbey. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the abbey had let the lordship of the manor of Seacourt to a lay tenant. In 1313 one Walter le Poer of Tackley, Oxfordshire granted the manor to Sir William Bereford and his son for the rest of their lives. Subsequently the reversion of the manor was granted to Isabel de Vesci and her brother Henry de Beaumont. After the deaths of the younger Bereford and Isabel de Vesci, Henry de Beaumont granted Seacourt to his son John Beaumont and daughter-in-law Eleanor Plantaganet. In 1409 their son Henry Beaumont, 3rd Baron Beaumont sold Seacourt to one William Wilcotes of North Leigh, Oxfordshire. The manor then passed through various hands and was broken up into shares until 1469, when Sir Richard Harcourt started buying them up. By the time he died in 1486, Sir Richard owned the whole of the manors of Seacourt and Wytham. Thereafter the two manors stayed together and by 1546 Seacourt was considered part of the manor of Wytham. Parish church Seacourt had a parish church by 1200, when Robert de Seacourt (or Seckworth), lord of the manor, granted it to the prioress of the Benedictine Studley Priory, Oxfordshire. According to a 13th-century charter Seacourt parish church was dedicated to Saint Mary. In 1439 it was reported that the church building had collapsed. In the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 Studley Priory surrendered its lands to the Crown, which sold them in 1540.Page, 1907, pages 77–79 Studley Priory and its possessions at Seacourt were sold to one John Croke, an ancestor of the John Croke who was a lawyer, judge, member of Parliament and Speaker of the House of Commons towards the end of the reign of Elizabeth I. Economic and other history Seacourt had two watermills. They were described as corn mills in the 12th century, when William de Seacourt, lord of the manor, granted their tithes to the Benedictine Godstow Abbey. Early in the 13th century his son Robert de Seacourt also granted their tithes to Godstow Abbey, but this time they are described as fulling mills. All of Seacourt's original houses were timber- framed.Rowley, 1978, page 48 Then in the 13th century a new north-south street was laid out and lined with stone-built houses on both sides.Rowley, 1978, pages 48, 126 The old road between Eynsham and Oxford passed through Seacourt rather than Botley. In the Middle Ages the treacle (i.e. healing) well at Binsey was a place of pilgrimage. Binsey is just on the other side of Seacourt Stream, so some pilgrims used to stay at Seacourt to visit the well. According to tradition, Seacourt had 24 inns to accommodate them. However in 1439 the report that Seacourt parish church had collapsed stated also that all but two of the houses in the village were ruined and uninhabited.

Four nucleotides are the minimal requirement for RNA recognition by rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP3: using short oligoribonucleotides, it was established that the minimal RNA sequence required for binding of NSP3A is GACC. Rotavirus RNA-binding protein NSP3 interacts with eIF4GI and evicts the poly(A)-binding protein from eIF4F. And NSP3A, by taking the place of PABP on eIF4GI, is responsible for the shut-off of cellular protein synthesis. Expression of NSP3 in mammalian cells allows the efficient translation of virus-like mRNA: NSP3 forms a link between viral mRNA and the cellular translation machinery and hence is a functional analogue of cellular poly(A)-binding protein. Site-directed mutagenesis and isothermal titration calorimetry documented that NSP3 and PABP use analogous eIF4G recognition strategies, despite marked differences in tertiary structure. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, RoXan a novel cellular protein was found to bind NSP3. The interaction between NSP3 and RoXaN does not impair the interaction between NSP3 and eIF4GI, and a ternary complex made of NSP3, RoXaN, and eIF4G I can be detected in rotavirus-infected cells, implicating RoXaN in translation regulation.

He is remembered principally as the designer of the Anderton Boat Lift (1875) near Northwich in Cheshire, which links the navigable stretch of the River Weaver with the Trent and Mersey Canal. Early life and work Clark was at one time a mathematical master at Brook Green, then became a Surveyor in the west of England. In 1846 Clark went to London where he met Robert Stephenson, who appointed him Superintending engineer of the Menai Bridge. Clark, in turn, appointed his brother Josiah Latimer Clark as his Assistant Engineer. When the Menai Bridge opened on 5 March 1850, Clark published a book The Britannia and Conway Tubular Bridges (3 vols), and by August of that year he had moved on to become an Engineer with the Electric and International Telegraph Company, where he took out the first of several patents for telegraph apparatus; the London and North Western Railway used Clark's telegraph between London and Rugby from 1855. Stephenson bequeathed him £2000 which he used to build a telescope on top of his house in Honor Oak. He was also known for his astronomy.https://sydenham.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2299 Thames Hydraulic Lift Graving Dock In 1857 Clark became Engineer to the Thames Graving Dock Limited, for which he designed a graving dock in which the ships to be repaired were lifted from the water by hydraulic presses, based on his experience of lifting the tubular sections of Stephenson's Britannia and Conwy tubular bridges over the Menai Strait. In 1866 he delivered a lecture on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers, after the lift had been successfully used for about seven years and had raised 1055 ships at a cost of £3 per ship. He was awarded a Telford Medal for the lecture. Clark's boat lifts Edwin Clark's best known achievement in the UK, the Anderton Boat Lift Lift at Strépy-Bracquegnies (Belgium), one of a series of four World Heritage Clark lifts Clark was an experienced Hydraulic Engineer with the firm of Clark, Stansfield & Clark, consulting engineers of Westminster, when he was called upon in 1870 by Edward Leader Williams to design a boat lift to raise boats 50 feet from the River Weaver to the Trent and Mersey Canal. Clark designed the original hydraulic structure opened in 1875, which was later replaced by a wire rope and pulley system from 1908 to 1983 before being returned to hydraulic operation in 2002. He went on to design other boat lifts in other European countries. In 1879, he presented a project to the Belgian government that included four of his lifts. This project received governmental approval in 1882, but it was 1917 before it was totally operational. When the canal was modernised in the 1960s, the original plan was to demolish the old installations and to redevelop the land. Local objections, and wishes to maintain the installations, were upheld after a long period and in 1988, the whole site of the Canal du Centre became a World Heritage Site. In 2007, the restoration work at all but one of the four Belgian Clark lifts was almost finished. Legacy Clark appears in the painting Conference of Engineers at the Menai Straits Preparatory to Floating one of the Tubes of the Britannia Bridge by John Lucas, and is also remembered in the name of the public trip boat that operates on the Anderton Boat Lift.

The species is endemic to northern Australia, inhabiting primarily inshore waters. It is similar to other scads in the genus Alepes, and is distinguished by a well-developed posterior adipose eyelid, as well as fin membrane spotting and gill raker counts. It is not a large species, with the maximum length reported to be 29.5 cm. It feeds primarily on a variety of small invertebrates, and is of very minor economic importance. Taxonomy and naming The smallmouth scad is one of five members in the scad genus Alepes, which is one of 33 genera of the jack family, Carangidae. The Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. The smallmouth scad has a slightly confusing taxonomic history, with confusion over the classification, the author, and confusion with other species clouding the species past. The first specimen known to science was taken in 1984, and deposited in the Queensland Museum along with photographs of a juvenile as paratypes with no holotype designated. Grant described the species for the first time in 1987 in \\"Fishes of Australia\\", crediting the species to Smith-Vaniz, who presumably collected the specimen and wrote a brief description. However, Grant's description of the species is the first publication of the species, making him the correct author under the ICZN rules. Confusion over this species and Alepes kleinii led Sainsbury to refer to the species as Alepes sp., with the placement in the genus considered somewhat dubious. The type locality is listed only as Australia. The common name of the species is related to the small mouth size of the species, with the names banded scad and roundfin trevally used incorrectly, and this is partially due to confusion with A. kleinii, the true banded scad. Description The smallmouth scad has an elongate oval to oblong shaped body which is strongly compressed. The snout is blunt, and both the ventral and dorsal profiles are equally convex. The dorsal and anal fins both have a low profile, and are not falcate, while the pectorals are falcate and extend beyond the junction of the curved and straight lateral line. The curved section of the lateral line is strongly arched, rising from the origin at the operculum and terminating at the junction with the straight section. A posterior adipose eyelid is well developed and reaches almost to the center of the eye, and the jaws are filled with fine teeth. The first dorsal fin has 8 spines, and the second dorsal has one spine and 24-26 soft rays. The anal fin has two separate spines posterior to the main anal fin which consists of one spine and 20 to 22 soft rays. There are 51-70 moderately protrusive scutes. It is similar to Atule mate, but lacks the adipose eyelid on both posterior and anterior sides of the orbit. It is also very similar to Alepes melanoptera and is distinguished from it by having dusky to hyaline dorsal intermembranes, compared to A. melanoptera's spotted membranes. Alepes vari is more similar still, and can be clearly distinguished by gill raker counts, having 27-30 compared to A. vari's 37. The largest specimen known was taken by the CSIRO and measured 29.5 cm. The colour of the body is a blue to green blue above and silver below, with young specimens having dark vertical cross bars. The operculum has a diffuse dark blotch .The spinous and soft dorsal fins, anal fins and caudal fin are a dusky yellow green. The anterior of the soft dorsal and anal fins have white tips and the pelvic fin is a white to grey colour, while the pectoral is hyaline. Distribution and habitat The smallmouth scad is known only from Australian waters, inhabiting the tropical north from Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia, north to the Northern Territory and east to Wide Bay in Queensland. There has been a single report of an individual as far down as Botany Bay in New South Wales. The species may also occur in the Gulf of Papua but has not yet reported. It is an abundant fish on the continental shelf in waters from 10 to 150 m in depth, rarely leading a pelagic lifestyle. Biology and fishery Smallmouth scad are omnivorous, but take a high proportion of small invertebrates, primarily benthic crustaceans and molluscs. It also frequently ingests algae, a feature which is rare in the Carangidae. Nothing of the reproductive cycle is known. It is of little importance to fisheries, usually caught on hook and line tackle by commercial and recreational fishermen.

For RMCE, this is achieved by the clean exchange of a preexisting gene cassette for an analogous cassette carrying the \\"gene of interest\\" (GOI). The genetic modification of mammalian cells is a standard procedure for the production of correctly modified proteins with pharmaceutical relevance. To be successful, the transfer and expression of the transgene has to be highly efficient and should have a largely predictable outcome. Current developments in the field of gene therapy are based on the same principles. Traditional procedures used for transfer of GOIs are not sufficiently reliable, mostly because the relevant epigenetic influences have not been sufficiently explored: transgenes integrate into chromosomes with low efficiency and at loci that provide only sub-optimal conditions for their expression. As a consequence the newly introduced information may not be realized (expressed), the gene(s) may be lost and/or re-insert and they may render the target cells in unstable state. It is exactly this point where RMCE enters the field. The procedure was introduced in 1994 and it uses the tools yeasts and bacteriophages have evolved for the efficient replication of important genetic information:  General principles  Figure 1: Principle of RMCE: exchange of genetic cassettes (´flip´ step) is enabled by a recombinase (´Flp´) from yeast. Part B shows mutants (Fn) of the naturally occurring 48 bp FRT-site (F). If a gene cassette is flanked by a set of these sites (F and Fn, for example) it can change places, by double-reciprocal recombination, with a second cassette that is part of an exchange plasmid (Figure 1, part A). A model experiment is shown in part C, in which an ´empty´ cell is modified by either a standard transfection approach or by RMCE. Please note that in the first case multiple genomic sites are hit, each giving raise to a different expression level (cf. the broad distribution of green dots). If a pre-defined genomic address is used to introduce the same gene reporter, each clone derived from such an event shows comparable expression characteristics Most yeast strains contain circular, plasmid-like DNAs called \\"two-micron circles\\". The persistence of these entities is granted by a recombinase called \\"flippase\\" or \\"Flp\\". Four monomers of this enzyme associate with two identical short (48 bp) target sites, called FRT (\\"flip-recombinase targets\\"), resulting in their crossover. The outcome of such a process depends on the relative orientation of the participating FRTs leading to * the inversion of a sequence that is flanked by two identical but inversely oriented FRT sites * the deletion/resolution of a sequence that is flanked by two equally oriented identical FRTs * the inefficient reversion of the letter process, commonly called integration or \\"addition\\" of an extra piece of DNA carrying a single FRT site identical to the target site This spectrum of options could be extended significantly by the generation of spacer mutants for extended 48 bp FRT sites (cross-hatched half-arrows in Figure 1). Each mutant Fn recombines with an identical mutant Fn with an efficiency equal to the wildtype sites (F x F). A cross-interaction (F x Fn) is strictly prevented by the particular design of these components. This sets the stage for the situation depicted in Figure 1A: * a target cassette (here a composite +/- selection marker) is flanked by an F- and an Fn site. After its introduction into the genome of a host cell the properties of many integration sites (genomic ´addresses´) are characterized and appropriate clones are isolated * the GOI (gene-of-interest) is part of a circular ´exchange plasmid´ and is flanked by a set of matching sites. This exchange plasmid can be introduced into the cell at large molecular excess and will thereby undergo the depicted exchange (RMCE-) reaction with the pre-selected genomic address (i.e. the F <+/-> Fn target) * this RMCE-principle is a process that can be repeated with the same or a different exchange plasmid (\\"serial RMCE\\"). Please note that RMCE of the GOI at the pre-determined locus and that it does (dotted lines) that would otherwise trigger immunologic or epigenetic defense mechanisms. First applied for the Tyr-recombinase Flp, this novel procedure is not only relevant to the rational construction of biotechnologically significant cell lines, but it also finds increasing use for the systematic generation of stem cells. Stem cells can be used to replace damaged tissue or to generate transgenic animals with largely pre-determined properties.  Dual RMCE  It has been previously established that coexpression of both Cre and Flp recombinases catalyzes the exchange of sequences flanked by single loxP and FRT sites integrated into the genome at a random location. However, these studies did not explore whether such an approach could be used to modify conditional mouse alleles carrying single or multiple loxP and FRT sites. dual RMCE (dRMCE; Osterwalder et al., 2010) was recently developed as a re-engineering tool applicable to the vast numbers of mouse conditional alleles that harbor wild-type loxP and FRT sites and therefore are not compatible with conventional RMCE. The general dRMCE strategy takes advantage of the fact that most conditional alleles encode a selection cassette flanked by FRT sites, in addition to loxP sites that flank functionally relevant exons ('floxed' exons). The FRT-flanked selection cassette is in general placed outside the loxP-flanked region, which renders these alleles directly compatible with dRMCE. Simultaneous expression of Cre and Flp recombinases induces cis recombination and formation of the deleted allele, which then serves as a 'docking site' at which to insert the replacement vector by trans recombination. The correctly replaced locus would encode the custom modification and a different drug-selection cassette flanked by single loxP and FRT sites. dRMCE therefore appears as a very efficient tool for targeted re-engineering of thousands of mouse alleles produced by the IKMC consortium.  Multiplexing RMCE  Figure 2: Multiplexing RMCE. In the given example a reporter gene cassette (gfp/tk/neo), flanked by four heterospecific FRT-sites (F5/F3-F/Fn) is introduced into the genome. The unique F5/F3 address can then be used to introduce an upstream-regulatory element and the F/Fn address to apply a similar modification at the downstream end. after the expression of the gfp-reporter has been optimized by systematic changes of this type, the central reporter cassette can be exchanged for any ´gene-of- interest´(GOI): the GOI will be flanked by the F3 and F-sites, respectively and introduced accordingly while the flanking elements will remain in place Multiplexing setups rely on the fact that each F-Fn pair (consisting of a wildtype FRT site and a mutant called \\"n\\") or each Fn-Fm pair (consisting of two mutants, \\"m\\" and \\"n\\") constitutes a unique \\"address\\" in the genome. A prerequisite are differences in four out of the eight spacer positions (see Figure 1B). If the difference is below this threshold, some cross-interaction between the mutants may occur leading to a faulty deletion of the sequence between the heterospecific (Fm/Fn or F/Fn) sites. 13 FRT-mutants have meanwhile become available, which permit the establishment of several unique genomic addresses (for instance F-Fn and Fm-Fo). These addresses will be recognized by donor plasmids that have been designed according to the same principles, permitting successive (but also synchronous) modifications at the predetermined loci. These modifications can be driven to completion in case the compatible donor plasmid(s) are provided at an excess (mass-action principles). Figure 2 illustrates one use of the multiplexing principle: the stepwise extension of a coding region in which a basic expression unit is provided with genomic insulators, enhancers, or other cis-acting elements. A recent variation of the general concept is based on PhiC31 (an integrase of the Ser-class), which permits introduction of another RMCE target at a secondary site the first RMCE-based modification has occurred. This is due to the fact that each phiC31-catalyzed exchange destroys the attP and attB sites it has addressed converting them to attR and attL product sites, respectively. While these changes permit the subsequent mounting of new (and most likely remote) targets, they do not enable addressing several RMCE targets , nor do they permit \\"serial RMCE\\", i.e. successive, stepwise modifications at a given genomic locus. This is different for Flp-RMCE, for which the post-RMCE status of FRTs corresponds to their initial state. This property enables the intentional, repeated mobilization of a target cassette by the addition of a new donor plasmid with compatible architecture. These \\"multiplexing-RMCE\\" options open unlimited possibilities for serial- and parallel specific modifications of pre-determined RMCE-targets  Applications  = Generation of transgenic animals = Generation of transgenic knock-out/-in mice and their genetic modification by RMCE. = Tagging and cassette exchange in DG44 cells in suspension culture = Insertion of a target cassette in a mammalian host cell line (CHO DG44 in suspension culture) and exchang with an ER stress reporter construct via targeted integration (RMCE).

An extension of this model with more than one server is the M/M/c queue. Model definition An M/M/1 queue is a stochastic process whose state space is the set {0,1,2,3,...} where the value corresponds to the number of customers in the system, including any currently in service. * Arrivals occur at rate λ according to a Poisson process and move the process from state i to i + 1\\\\. * Service times have an exponential distribution with rate parameter μ in the M/M/1 queue, where 1/μ is the mean service time. * A single server serves customers one at a time from the front of the queue, according to a first-come, first-served discipline.

We assume that the queue is initially in state i and write pk(t) for the probability of being in state k at time t. Then ::p_k(t)=e^{-(\\\\lambda+\\\\mu)t} \\\\left[ \\\\rho^{\\\\frac{k-i}{2}} I_{k-i}(at) + \\\\rho^{\\\\frac{k-i-1}{2}} I_{k+i+1}(at) + (1-\\\\rho) \\\\rho^{k} \\\\sum_{j=k+i+2}^{\\\\infty} \\\\rho^{-j/2}I_j(at) \\\\right] where \\\\rho=\\\\lambda/\\\\mu, a=2\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda\\\\mu} and I_k is the modified Bessel function of the first kind. Moments for the transient solution can be expressed as the sum of two monotone functions. Stationary analysis The model is considered stable only if λ < μ. If, on average, arrivals happen faster than service completions the queue will grow indefinitely long and the system will not have a stationary distribution. The stationary distribution is the limiting distribution for large values of t. Various performance measures can be computed explicitly for the M/M/1 queue. We write ρ = λ/μ for the utilization of the buffer and require ρ < 1 for the queue to be stable. ρ represents the average proportion of time which the server is occupied. =Average number of customers in the system= The probability that the stationary process is in state i (contains i customers, including those in service) is : \\\\pi_i=(1-\\\\rho)\\\\rho^i.\\\\, We see that the number of customers in the system is geometrically distributed with parameter 1 − ρ. Thus the average number of customers in the system is ρ/(1 − ρ) and the variance of number of customers in the system is ρ/(1 − ρ)2. This result holds for any work conserving service regime, such as processor sharing. =Busy period of server= The busy period is the time period measured between the instant a customer arrives to an empty system until the instant a customer departs leaving behind an empty system. The busy period has probability density function ::f(t)=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{t\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho}}e^{-(\\\\lambda+\\\\mu)t}I_1(2t\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda\\\\mu}) & t>0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise}\\\\end{cases} where I1 is a modified Bessel function of the first kind, obtained by using Laplace transforms and inverting the solution. The Laplace transform of the M/M/1 busy period is given by ::\\\\mathbb E( e^{-\\\\theta F} )= \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\lambda}(\\\\lambda + \\\\mu + \\\\theta - \\\\sqrt{(\\\\lambda + \\\\mu + \\\\theta)^2 - 4 \\\\lambda \\\\mu}) which gives the moments of the busy period, in particular the mean is 1/(μ − λ) and variance is given by ::\\\\frac{1+\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu}}{\\\\mu^2(1-\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu})^3}. =Response time= The average response time or sojourn time (total time a customer spends in the system) does not depend on scheduling discipline and can be computed using Little's law as 1/(μ − λ). The average time spent waiting is 1/(μ − λ) − 1/μ = ρ/(μ − λ). The distribution of response times experienced does depend on scheduling discipline. First-come, first-served discipline For customers who arrive and find the queue as a stationary process, the response time they experience (the sum of both waiting time and service time) has transform (μ − λ)/(s + μ − λ) and therefore probability density function ::f(t)= \\\\begin{cases} (\\\\mu-\\\\lambda)e^{-(\\\\mu-\\\\lambda)t} & t>0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} Processor sharing discipline In an M/M/1-PS queue there is no waiting line and all jobs receive an equal proportion of the service capacity. Suppose the single server serves at rate 16 and there are 4 jobs in the system, each job will experience service at rate 4. The rate at which jobs receive service changes each time a job arrives at or departs from the system. For customers who arrive to find the queue as a stationary process, the Laplace transform of the distribution of response times experienced by customers was published in 1970, for which an integral representation is known. The waiting time distribution (response time less service time) for a customer requiring x amount of service has transform :W^\\\\ast(sx) = \\\\frac{(1-\\\\rho)(1-\\\\rho r^2)e^{-[\\\\lambda(1-r)+s]x}}{(1-\\\\rho r^2)-\\\\rho(1-r)^2e^{-(\\\\mu/r-\\\\lambda r)x}} where r is the smaller root of the equation :\\\\lambda r^2 - (\\\\lambda + \\\\mu + s)r + \\\\mu = 0. The mean response time for a job arriving and requiring amount x of service can therefore be computed as x μ/(μ − λ). An alternative approach computes the same results using a spectral expansion method. Diffusion approximation When the utilization ρ is close to 1 the process can be approximated by a reflected Brownian motion with drift parameter λ – μ and variance parameter λ + μ. This heavy traffic limit was first introduced by John Kingman.

He was a papal notary and a member of the influential Fieschi family, who later became bishop of Vercelli. The letter is best known for its claim that Edward II was not murdered in 1327 but escaped and spent the remainder of his life in exile in Europe. It has been a source of controversy ever since a copy was discovered in 1878 in Montpellier. Contents of the letter The Fieschi letter begins by following the historically accepted story that Edward II fled to South Wales after the invasion of England by Isabella of France and Roger Mortimer before being arrested and imprisoned at Kenilworth Castle and Berkeley Castle in 1326. But according to Fieschi, when the king heard that he was to be killed at Berkeley Castle he changed clothes with a servant. Using this disguise he reached the gate and escaped by killing the gate-keeper. He then went to Corfe Castle where he remained for 18 months. Edward is then said to have stayed in Ireland for nine months. He then crossed to the Low Countries and travelled to Italy, visiting the pope in Avignon on his way through France. Edward reported to have lived the rest of his life in monastic hermitages near Cecima in the Diocese of Pavia, most likely in Sant'Alberto di Butrio abbey, Ponte Nizza. Provenance The letter was discovered by a French archivist in an official register dated before 1368 which had been the property of Gaucelm de Deaux, bishop of Maguelonne, and was preserved in the Archives Departmentales d'Herault at Montpelier. It is still there today. The letter has been tested and is not a later forgery. Fieschi is a well known historical figure. He had several livings in England and knew the country though the letter shows a confusion between the rank of a knight and that of a lord. Theories in support No one doubts the authenticity of Fieschi's letter, only its veracity, and it contains details that few people knew at the time and was written long before the accepted accounts of the flight, imprisonment and murder. Ian Mortimer has argued that it is 'almost certain' that Edward II did not die in 1327.Ian Mortimer, 'The Death of Edward II in Berkeley castle', English Historical Review cxx (2005), pp. 1175-1224 It is possible that Edward II knew he had no support at home and never tried to regain the throne, especially after his son, Edward III, had removed Roger Mortimer. In the Italian town of Cecima (75 km from Milan), there is a tradition that a king of England was buried there and there is an empty mediaeval tomb said to be the place of his burial before his body was repatriated to England by his son. The elaborate funeral in Gloucester of the person supposed to be Edward II may have been that of the gate-keeper. Many local dignitaries were invited to view the body from a distance, but it had been embalmed and may have been unrecognisable. For the first time a carved wooden effigy of the dead king was carried through the streets rather than the body on a bier. Diplomatic documents also show in 1338 that Edward III travelled to Koblenz to be installed as vicar of the Holy Roman Empire and there he met someone called William le Galeys, or William the Welshman, who claimed to be the king's father. (Edward II was born in Caernarvon and was the first son of an English king to be given the title Prince of Wales.) Claiming to be the king's father would have been dangerous, and it is not known what happened to William. Some historians claim that the person was William Ockle. Arguments against Opponents who challenge the veracity of the contents of the letter argue that the letter should be seen rather as an attempt by the bishop of Maguelone (who had been sent to Germany to disrupt an Anglo-German alliance) to blackmail Edward III by undermining his position at the German court. Fieschi held various church appointments in England from 1319 and may also have been attempting to gain royal patronage. Popular culture The main plot of Ken Follett's novel, World Without End, is built around a similar letter. However, the fictional letter in the book was written by the King himself, and would have constituted an unquestionable proof.

Automated airport weather stations have become part of the backbone of weather observing in the United States and Canada and are becoming increasingly more prevalent worldwide due to their efficiency and cost-savings. System types within the United States In the United States, there are several varieties of automated weather stations that have somewhat subtle but important differences. These include the automated weather observing system (AWOS) and the automated surface observing system (ASOS). =Automated weather observing system (AWOS)= A commercial AWOS The automated weather observing system (AWOS) units are mostly operated, maintained and controlled by state or local governments and other non-federal entities and are certified under the FAA non-federal AWOS Program. The FAA completed an upgrade of the 230 FAA owned AWOS and former automated weather sensor systems (AWSS) systems to the AWOS-C configuration in 2017. The AWOS-C is the most up-to-date FAA owned AWOS facility and can generate METAR/SPECI formatted aviation weather reports. The AWOS-C is functionally equivalent to the ASOS. FAA owned AWOS-C units in Alaska are typically classified as AWOS-C IIIP units while all other AWOS-C units are typically classified as AWOS III P/T units. AWOS systems disseminate weather data in a variety of ways: * A computer-generated voice message which is broadcast via radio frequency to pilots in the vicinity of an airport. The message is updated at least once per minute, and this is the only mandatory form of weather reporting for an AWOS. * Optionally, a computer-generated voice message, available over a telephone dial-up modem service. The message is updated at least once per minute. * Optionally (but frequently done), AWOS messages may be transmitted to the FAA for national dissemination via computer. These messages are currently in METAR format, and typical reporting frequencies are once every 20 minutes. This option is only available for AWOS III or IV systems (see below). The following AWOS configurations are defined below in terms of what parameters they measure: * AWOS A: barometric pressure and altimeter setting (in inches of Mercury). * AWOS I: wind speed and wind gusts (in knots), wind direction (from which the wind is blowing) and variable wind direction (in degrees of the compass), temperature and dew point (in degrees Celsius), altimeter setting and density altitude. * AWOS II: all AWOS I parameters, plus visibility and variable visibility (in miles). * AWOS III: all AWOS II parameters, plus sky condition (in oktas), cloud ceiling height (in feet), and liquid precipitation accumulation (in inches). * AWOS III P: all AWOS III parameters, plus precipitation type (rain, snow and sometimes drizzle) identification. * AWOS III T: all AWOS III parameters, plus thunderstorm detection (via a cloud-to- ground lightning detector). * AWOS III P/T: all AWOS III parameters, plus precipitation type identification and thunderstorm detection. * AWOS IV Z: all AWOS III P/T parameters, plus freezing rain detection via a freezing rain sensor (Note: this configuration used to be called AWOS III PTZ). * AWOS IV R: all AWOS III P/T parameters, plus runway surface condition. * AWOS IV Z/R: all AWOS III P/T parameters, plus freezing rain detection and runway surface condition. Also, custom configurations such as AWOS AV (AWOS A parameters plus visibility) are possible. Non-certified sensors may be attached to AWOS systems, but weather data derived from those sensors must be clearly identified as \\"advisory\\" in any voice messages and may not be included in any METAR observations. As of November 9, 2019, the following manufacturers provide FAA-certified, non-federal AWOS systems: * All Weather Inc. *DBT Transportation Services LLC (formerly Vaisala Inc.) * Mesotech International, Inc. *Optical Scientific Inc. (formerly Belfort Instrument Co.) =Automated surface observing system (ASOS)= The automated surface observing system (ASOS) units are operated and controlled cooperatively in the United States by the NWS, FAA, and DOD. After many years of research and development, the deployment of ASOS units began in 1991 and was completed in 2004. These systems generally report at hourly intervals, but also report special observations if weather conditions change rapidly and cross aviation operation thresholds. They generally report all the parameters of the AWOS-III, while also having the additional capabilities of reporting temperature and dew point in degrees Fahrenheit, present weather, icing, lightning, sea level pressure and precipitation accumulation. Besides serving aviation needs, ASOS serves as a primary climatological observing network in the United States, making up the first-order network of climate stations. Because of this, not every ASOS is located at an airport; for example, one of these units is located at Belvedere Castle in Central Park, New York City; another is located at the Blue Hill Observatory near Boston, Massachusetts. =Automated weather sensor system (AWSS)= The FAA has converted all automated weather sensor system (AWSS) units to AWOS IIIP/T units. There are no AWSS systems remaining in the US National Airspace System (NAS). Observing equipment Automated airport weather stations use a variety of sophisticated equipment to observe the weather. ASOS ice-free wind sensor =Wind speed and direction= A majority of older automated airport weather stations are equipped with a mechanical wind vane and cup system to measure wind speed and direction. This system is simple in design: the wind spins three horizontally turned cups around the base of the wind vane, providing an estimation of the wind's speed, while the vane on top turns so that the face of the vane offers the least resistance to the wind, causing it to point in the direction the wind is coming from and thus providing the wind direction. The new generation of sensors use sound waves to measure wind speed and direction. The measurement is based on the time it takes for an ultrasonic pulse to travel from one transducer to another, which varies depending on - among other factors - the wind speed. The transit time is measured in both directions for several (usually two or three) pairs of the transducer heads. Based on those results, the sensor computes wind speed and direction. Compared to mechanical sensors, the ultrasonic sensors offer several advantages such as no moving parts, advanced self- diagnostic capabilities and reduced maintenance requirements. NWS and FAA ASOS stations and most of new AWOS installations are currently equipped with ultrasonic wind sensors. Unlike all other measurements, which are made between 3 and 9 feet (1 and 3 meters) above the ground, wind speed and direction are measured at 30 feet (10 meters). ASOS visibility sensor =Visibility= To determine visibility, automated airport weather stations use one of two sensor types: * forward scatter sensors * transmissometers The forward scatter sensor uses a beam of infrared light which is sent from one end of the sensor toward the receiver, but offset from a direct line to the receiver by a certain angle. The amount of light scattered by particles in the air and received by the receiver determines the extinction coefficient. This is then converted to visibility using either Allard's or Koschmieder's law. In a transmissometer, a beam of visible light is transmitted from its transmitter to receiver head. The extinction coefficient is derived from the amount of light lost in the air. There also are sensors that, to a certain degree combine a transmissometer with a forward scatter sensor. Forward scatter sensors are more popular due to their lower price, smaller size and lower maintenance requirements. However, transmissometers are still used at some airports as they are more accurate at low visibilities and are fail-safe, i.e. in case of failure report visibility lower than actual. Current sensors are capable of reporting visibility in a wide range. For aviation purposes, the reported values are rounded down to the nearest step in one of the following scales: * M1/4 (less than 1/4 mile), 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1, 1-1/4, 1-1/2, 2, 2-1/2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 10+ (greater than 10 miles) * In steps of 50 m when the visibility is less than 800 m; in steps of 100 m when it is 800 m or more, but less than 5 km; in kilometer steps when the visibility is 5 km or more but less than 10 km; and 10 km when visibility is 10 km or more. ASOS present weather sensor =Present weather (falling precipitation)= Automated airport weather stations use a light emitting diode weather identifier (LEDWI) to determine if and what type of precipitation is falling. The LEDWI sensor measures the scintillation pattern of the precipitation falling through the sensor's infrared beam (approximately 50 millimeters in diameter) and determines from a pattern analysis of the particle size and fall velocity whether the precipitation is rain or snow. If precipitation is determined to be falling, but the pattern is not conclusively identified as either rain or snow, unknown precipitation is reported. Automated airport weather stations are not yet able to report hail, ice pellets, and various other intermediate forms of precipitation. =Obscurations to vision= Automated airport weather stations do not have a separate sensor for detecting specific obscurations to vision. Instead, when visibility is reduced below 7 statute miles, the system uses the reported temperature and dew point to determine an obscuration to vision. If relative humidity is low (i.e., there is a large difference between the temperature and dew point), haze is reported. If relative humidity is high (i.e., there is a small difference between the temperature and the dew point), mist or fog is reported, depending on the exact visibility. Fog is reported when visibility is 1/2 mile or less; mist is reported for visibilities greater than but less than . If the temperature is below freezing, humidity is high and visibility is 1/2 mile or less, freezing fog is reported. ASOS CT12K ceilometer =Cloud coverage and ceiling= Automated airport weather stations use an upward-pointing laser beam ceilometer to detect the amount and height of clouds. The laser is pointed upward, and the time required for reflected light to return to the station allows for the calculation of the height of the cloud base. Because of the limited coverage area (the laser can only detect clouds directly overhead), the system computer calculates a time-averaged cloud cover and ceiling, which is reported to external users. To compensate for the danger of rapidly changing sky cover, the averaging is weighted toward the first 10 minutes of the 30-minute averaging period. The range of the ceilometer is up to depending on the model. Clouds above that height are not detectable by automated stations at present. ASOS HO-1088 thermometer =Temperature and dew point= Automated airport weather stations use a temperature/dew point sensor (hygrothermometer) designed for continuous operation which normally remains on at all times, except during maintenance. The measurement of temperature is simple compared to the dew point. Operating under the principle that electrical resistance varies with temperature, a platinum wire resistive temperature device measures the ambient air temperature. The current ASOS thermometer is designated the HO-1088, though some older systems still utilize the HO-83. ASOS DTS-1 dew point sensor In contrast, the dew point measurement is considerably more complex. The original dew point sensor deployed on ASOS systems utilized a chilled mirror that is cooled to the point where a fine film of condensation forms on the mirror's surface. The temperature of the mirror at this condition is equal to the dew point temperature. The hygrometer measures the dew point by directing a light beam from a small infrared diode to the surface of the mirror at an angle of 45 degrees. Two photo transistors are mounted so they measure a high degree of reflected light when the mirror is clear (direct) and scattered light when the mirror is clouded with visible condensation (indirect). With the formation of condensation on the mirror, the degree of cloudiness of the mirror surface increases with the direct transistor receiving less light and the indirect transistor more light. The output from these photo transistors controls the mirror cooling module which is an electronic heat pump that operates much like a thermocouple in reverse, producing a heating or cooling effect. When the sensor is first activated, the mirror is clear. As the mirror surface temperature is cooled to the dew point temperature, condensations forms on the mirror. The electronics continuously tries to stabilize the signal levels to the power amplifier to maintain the mirror temperature at the dew point. If the dew point of the air changes or if the circuit is disturbed by noise, the loop makes the necessary corrections to restabilize at the dew point and maintaining continuous operation. Due to problems with the chilled mirror sensor, NWS ASOS sites now use Vaisala's DTS1 sensor, which measures humidity only via capacitance. The sensor is based on a solid state capacitive relative humidity element that incorporates a small heater so that the sensing element is always above the ambient temperature, eliminating the formation of dew or frost. The sensor reports directly in dew point through a calculation based on measured relative humidity and the measured temperature of the heated capacitive element. Older AWOS systems used a lithium chloride dew point sensor. Current AWOS systems use capacitive relative humidity sensors, from which dew point is calculated. ASOS acquisition control unit, including the three pressure transducers towards the bottom =Barometric pressure and altimeter setting= Data from a barometric pressure sensor are used to calculate QNH altimeter setting. Pilots rely on this value to determine their altitude. To ensure safe separation from terrain and other obstructions, high degree of accuracy and reliability is required from a pressure sensor. Most aviation weather stations use two (required for an AWOS) or three independent pressure transducers. The transducers may or may not share their associated tubing and external ports (designed to minimize effect of wind/wind gusts). Should the reported pressures differ by more than a preset maximum, the pressure values are discarded and altimeter setting is not reported or is reported as \\"missing.\\" Altimeter setting is calculated based on barometric pressure, site elevation, sensor elevation and - optionally - air temperature. Altimeter setting is reported in inches of mercury (in steps of 0.01 inHg) or whole hectopascals, rounded down. ASOS heated tipping bucket precipitation gauge =Precipitation accumulation= The original precipitation accumulation measuring device used for automated airport weather stations was the heated tipping bucket rain gauge. The upper portion of this device consists of a diameter collector with an open top. The collector, which is heated to melt any frozen precipitation such as snow or hail, funnels water into a two- chamber, pivoting container called a bucket. Precipitation flows through the funnel into one compartment of the bucket until of water (18.5 grams) is accumulated. That amount of weight causes the bucket to tip on its pivots, dumping the collected water and moving the other chamber under the funnel. The tipping motion activates a switch (either a reed switch or a mercury switch), which sends one electrical pulse for each of precipitation collected. ASOS all-weather precipitation accumulation gauge (AWPAG) Because of problems the heated tipping bucket has with properly measuring frozen precipitation (particularly snow), the all-weather precipitation accumulation gauge (AWPAG) was developed. This sensor is essentially a weighing gauge where precipitation continuously accumulates within the collector, and as the weight increases, precipitation is recorded. Only select NWS ASOS units have been equipped with the AWPAG. ASOS freezing rain sensor =Icing (freezing rain)= Automated airport weather stations report freezing rain via the resonant frequency of a vibrating rod. The resonant frequency decreases with increasing accretion (additional mass) of ice, hoarfrost, freezing fog, freezing drizzle, rime, or wet snow. To report freezing rain, the system combines the sensor output from the freezing rain sensor with data from the LEDWI. The LEDWI must provide a positive indication of unknown precipitation or rain before the system can transmit a report of freezing rain. If the LEDWI reports either no precipitation or snow, the system will ignore the input from the freezing rain sensor. The sensor is designed to detect and report icing from all weather conditions. ASOS thunderstorm sensor =Lightning (thunderstorms)= Many automated airport weather stations within the United States use the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) to detect lightning via the automatic lightning detection and reporting system (ALDARS). The NLDN uses 106 sensors nationwide to triangulate lightning strikes. Data from the detection grid is fed into ALDARS, which in turn sends messages to each automated airport station informing it of the proximity of any lightning strikes. Lightning strikes within of the station result in a report of a thunderstorm at the station (TS). Lightning strikes more than but less than from the station result in a report of a thunderstorm in the vicinity of the station (VCTS). Lightning more than but less than from the station results only in a remark of distant lightning (LTG DSNT). However, some stations now have their own lightning sensor to actually measure lightning strikes at the site rather than requiring an external service. This thunderstorm sensor works by detecting both the flash of light and momentary change in the electric field produced by lightning. When both of these are detected within a few milliseconds of each other, the station registers a possible lightning strike. When a second possible lightning strike is detected within 15 minutes of the first, the station records a thunderstorm.ASOS LIGHTNING ASSESSMENT - National Weather Service, Archived at: Data dissemination Data dissemination is usually via an automated VHF airband radio frequency (108-137 MHz) at each airport, broadcasting the automated weather observation. This is often via the automatic terminal information service (ATIS). Most automated weather stations also have discrete phone numbers to retrieve real-time observations over the phone or through a modem. In the United States, the AWOS/ASOS data acquisition system (ADAS), a computer system run by the FAA, polls the systems remotely, accessing the observations and disseminating them worldwide electronically in METAR format. Limitations requiring human augmentation At present, automated airport weather stations are unable to report a variety of meteorological conditions. These include: * shallow or patchy fog * blowing dust * smoke * falling ash * volcanic eruptions * tornadoes * precipitation that is not in the form of rain or snow, such as hail, ice pellets and snow grains * multiple forms of precipitation falling at the same time * depth of new snowfall * total snow depth * in-cloud and cloud-to-cloud lightning * clouds that are not directly above the station * clouds that are more than twelve thousand feet above ground level * cloud type Because many of these can pose dangers to aircraft and all of these are of interest to the meteorological community, most of the busier airports also have part-time or full-time human observers who augment, or provide additional information to, the automated airport weather station's observations. Research is on-going to allow the automated stations to detect many of these phenomena. Automated stations can also suffer from mechanical breakdown, requiring repair or replacement. This can be either due to physical damage (either natural or human caused), mechanical wear, or severe icing during winter weather. During system outages, human observers are often required to supplement missing or non-representative observations from the automated station. Research is also ongoing to produce more robust systems which are less vulnerable to natural damage, mechanical wear and icing.

It enables participants to exchange views and experiences, form partnerships and shape joint solutions to global water challenges. During the week, the Stockholm Water Prize, the Stockholm Junior Water Prize, and the Stockholm Industry Water Award are given out at their respective award ceremonies.  History  The World Water Week in Stockholm originally began as the Stockholm Water Symposium in 1991 and has been convened annually ever since. In 2001, the official name became World Water Week in Stockholm. SIWI identifies a conference theme to place a specific focus on one aspect of the world's escalating water crisis. Initially, one theme was promoted for 4–5 years. Since 2008, a different theme has been selected for each year.

It is taught at over two hundred universities and colleges in 38 countries. Swedish is the Scandinavian language which is most studied abroad. Svenska Institutet (The Swedish Institute) plays a key role in organising the learning of Swedish abroad. In addition to collaborating with universities where Swedish is taught, the Institute organises summer courses for students and conferences for teachers, as well as publishing a textbook called Svenska utifrån. In 2013 the SI announced that a web-based Swedish beginners' course would be made available free of charge on its website in Autumn 2013. Language classification Swedish belongs to the North Germanic branch of the Germanic sub-family of the Indo-European languages. As such, it is mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish. Because most of the loanwords present in Swedish come from English and German (originally Middle Low German, closely related to Dutch), and also because of similarities in grammar, native speakers of Germanic languages usually have an advantage over speakers of other, less related languages. The similarity between Swedish and English is further emphasized by many Old Norse words brought to England by the Vikings during the early Middle Ages. Difficulties for students = Phonology = One of the main difficulties encountered by students of Swedish is its phonology. Swedish words have either an acute or a grave accent, usually described as \\"tonal word accents\\" by Scandinavian linguists. These accents may vary between dialects and can be difficult for non-native speakers to distinguish. However, few words are only distinguished by their word accents, and these are usually easy to tell apart by context. In most Finland Swedish varieties, the distinction is absent. Several phonemes of Swedish often present difficulties for students. Among the most difficult are the fricatives , and , which are all phonetically close to one another. Swedish has also a large inventory of vowels, which might be difficult to distinguish. The orthography might cause confusion, e.g. the diacritics in the letters Å, Ä and Ö. The difference between /l/ and /r/ can also present difficulties for speakers of languages that do not distinguish the two, such as Vietnamese.Garlén (1988), pp. 72, 75 = Grammar = In Swedish, there is a grammatical gender distinction between common (en) and neuter (ett). Like other languages with noun classes, Swedish has few consistent rules to determine each word's gender; so the genders have to be learned word by word, although the words of common gender far outnumber the neuter words, and given morphological derivations consistently yield results of a certain gender, e.g. adding -ning to a verb always yields a common gender noun (röka → rökning, \\"to smoke → smoking\\") whereas adding -ande always yields a neuter gender noun (famla → famlande, \\"to fumble → fumbling\\"). Swedish has five different ways to form regular plurals of nouns, also determined on a word-by-word basis, in addition to irregular plurals. These are -ar, -or, -er, -en and identical to singular. As in English, there are many irregular verbs and plurals, such as (fot; fötter \\"foot; feet\\") and (flyga; flög; flugit \\"fly; flew; flown\\"), cf. Germanic umlaut and Germanic strong verb. = Syntax = Swedish utilizes V2 word order in subclauses, a phenomenon rarely encountered cross- linguistically. = Orthography = Certain common words retain their historical written form, e.g. mig /mεj/ and och /ɔk/ or /ɔ/. The pronoun de is pronounced /dɔm/ by most speakers, even though it has traditionally distinct written forms in the nominative (as well as used as a plural article) and accusative case.  Geographic distribution  In addition to the minorities in Sweden, Swedish is a compulsory subject in school for Finnish-speakers in Finland, where Swedish is a co-official language with Finnish; a 5% minority of Finns use Swedish as a native language. In official documents and in education, Swedish is considered \\"the second domestic language\\" (fi. toinen kotimainen kieli, sv. det andra inhemska språket) for Finnish-speakers, while the same holds true for Finnish for Swedish-speakers. Finland was a part of Sweden from the 13th century to 1809, and the use of Swedish in government prevailed for much of 19th century. Language reforms did not replace Swedish, but gave Finnish (which is a completely unrelated Uralic language) an \\"equal status\\" as an official language of the state. This situation remains to this day, despite the near-complete switchover to Finnish in practical usage in governmental affairs. There is compulsory teaching and language testing at all levels of education, and a basic working knowledge of Swedish is required for state government officials. Proficiency tests *Swedex consists of three different levels corresponding to the A2, B1 and B2 levels in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. It can be taken in examination centers in twenty-five different countries. Swedex tests the skills of the student in five different areas: vocabulary, grammar, listening, writing and reading. *TISUS is another certificate, often used as a proof of competence in Swedish to gain access to Swedish universities. It tests the reading, oral and written skills of the student. *In Finland, there is an official examination in the universities, called \\"public servant's Swedish\\", as a part of the policy of bilinguality of the state of Finland. The abitur examination includes a Swedish exam, which, while itself optional, is based on compulsory courses in high school.

It was incorporated with its parent hospital, the Manila Sanitarium Hospital, upon its establishment, thus adding the hospital name with a “school of medical arts” (SMA). In its opening year, the college offered five vocational and allied health courses: three-year Associate in Radiologic Technology, two-year Midwifery, two-year Physical Therapy technician, one-year courses in Nursing Assistant and Emergency Medicine Technician. After a year, the college wished to upgrade its Physical Therapy Technician and the Associate in Radiologic Technician into a five-year and four-year Bachelor's degree. The college wrote to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) asking for the authority to implement the upgrade, which was agreed on, and the upgraded courses were offered in school year 1995-6. In 1995, the college expanded its grounds by constructing a three-storey building with a capacity of six classrooms, five laboratory rooms and two offices. The building was finished in 1996. In 2000 the college introduced two new programs: the six-month Caregiver Program and the four-year B.S. in Nursing degree. The hospital and school were renamed from Manila Sanitarium Hospital to Manila Adventist Medical Center in 2002 and from School of Medical arts to Colleges in 2007. In 2019, the School of Law and Jurisprudence commenced operations. This is the first Adventist law school in the Philippines.

After education at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford he was ordained and travelled to New Zealand as chaplain to George Augustus Selwyn, its first bishop. He introduced the skills of beekeeping to North Island and wrote books on the subject. Later as vicar of Frodsham, Cheshire, England, he restored its church and vicarage but was limited in his activities by mental illness. Early life William Charles Cotton was born in Leytonstone, Essex, England, the eldest child of William Cotton and his wife Sarah. His father was a businessman who became Governor of the Bank of England. His younger brother was the jurist Henry Cotton. He was initially educated at home by tutors, until at the age of 14 he was sent to Eton College. There he became an accomplished rower and had a fine scholastic record, winning the Newcastle Prize for excellence in divinity and the classics in his final year. In 1832 he matriculated to Christ Church, Oxford, and graduated BA in 1836, with first class honours in Classics and second class honours in Mathematics. He decided on a career in the church and was appointed as a curate at Baston, Lincolnshire. He was ordained as a deacon in 1837, in 1838 was promoted to MA by seniority, and in 1839 was ordained a priest and was appointed as curate at St Edward's Church, Romford, Essex. Even at this stage of his life, there were concerns about his mental health. He then moved to a curacy at the parish church of St John, Windsor. Here he became a good friend of George Augustus Selwyn, a fellow curate five years his senior. Missionary In summer 1841 Selwyn was appointed to be the first Anglican Bishop of New Zealand and Cotton offered to go with him as his chaplain. This decision met with disapproval from Cotton's father who said \\"You are not missionary material\\". Cotton did have some of the practical skills which would be valuable; he could use various tools, including a lathe, ride a horse, and row and sail boats. The Tomatin sailed from London for Plymouth Sound without its clerical cargo who went overland to Plymouth before eventually boarding the ship there. Cotton had loaded some hives of bees aboard but had not packed them securely within a hogshead as planned in My Bee Book. Delayed in the English Channel by contrary winds the bee hives were so thrown about aboard the Tomatin that they were jettisoned overboard in Plymouth Sound in Cotton's absence. The missionary party of 23 members set sail from Plymouth late on 26 December 1841 on board the barque Tomatin. On the ship, in addition to their luggage, were various animals and possibly, an unknown number of hives of bees. Cotton's letter dated 30 December 1841, passed to a homeward bound brig on 21 January, stated the bees were safe. However, given the short time available from the Tomatin's arrival in Plymouth Sound on 19 December, the daily hope that contrary winds would abate so they could sail \\"on the morrow,\\" and the party boarding on 23 December, there's little likelihood he had the time to organize a replacement lot of bees.Barrett, Peter (2013) The Immigrant Bees, Volume V (pp.423-429) Either way, the fate of the bees is unknown, they did not survive the trip to Sydney. Also on board was a Māori boy who taught many of the passengers, including Cotton, to speak the Māori language. In April 1842 the Tomatin arrived in Sydney. The boat was damaged by a rock on entering their landing place and, rather than wait for its repair, some of the party, including Selwyn and Cotton, set sail for New Zealand on the brig Bristolian on 19 May. They arrived in Auckland on 30 May. After spending some time as guests of Captain William Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand, Selwyn and Cotton set sail for the Bay of Islands on the schooner Wave on 12 June, arriving on 20 June. Amongst the party was a clerk, William Bambridge, who was an accomplished artist and was later to become photographer to Queen Victoria. Selwyn had decided to set up residence at the Waimate Mission Station, some inland from Paihia where the Church Missionary Society had established a settlement 11 years earlier. On 5 July 1842 Selwyn set out on a six-month tour of his diocese leaving the Mission Station in the care of Sarah, his wife, and Cotton. While he was away Cotton was effectively the head of the mission, director of the college and minister at the church. By October 1843 more missionaries had arrived at Waimate and Cotton was able to accompany Bishop Selwyn on his second tour, this time to mission stations and native settlements in the southern part of North Island. Their journey was made partly by canoe but mainly by walking, often for large distances over difficult and dangerous terrain. Part way through the tour Selwyn decided to split the party into two sections with one section led by himself and the other by Cotton. After being away for nearly three months, Cotton arrived back at Waimate early in 1844 and Selwyn returned a few weeks later. Later in 1844 Selwyn decided to move some south to Tamaki near Auckland where he bought of land, giving it the name of Bishop's Auckland. The party left on 23 October and arrived in Auckland on 17 November. During the first six months of 1845 Selwyn was away for much of the time and management of the settlement, and particularly the schools, fell to Cotton. Cotton continued to work in Bishop's Auckland particularly as headmaster of St John's College, and also with ecclesiastical duties and practical tasks. He finally left New Zealand in December 1847, together with Bambridge, arriving in England in May 1848. Apiarist From his childhood Cotton had a passionate interest in bees and beekeeping. () At Oxford University he was a founder and the first secretary of the Oxford Apiarian Society. In 1837 he published his first work about bees, A Short and Simple Letter to Cottagers from a Bee Preserver, which sold 24,000 copies. A second Letter followed three years later. In 1842 he published My Bee Book which amongst other advice suggested ways to render bees semiconscious to obtain the honey rather than by killing them. New Zealand had two native species of bees but neither was suitable for producing honey. The first honey bees in New Zealand had been introduced by Mary Bumby, the sister of a Wesleyan minister, in March 1839. While Cotton was in Sydney in April 1842 he arranged for hives of bees to be sent to him after his arrival in New Zealand. This took longer than Cotton had expected and it was not until March 1844 that he received his first colony of honey bees at Waimate. When he moved to Bishop's Auckland he successfully transferred them. He spent much time in training settlers and Māori in the practices of keeping bees and gathering their honey. Towards the end of 1844 he published A Few Simple Rules for New Zealand Beekeepers. He later wrote a series of articles on beekeeping in The New Zealander and these were published together in 1848 as A Manual for New Zealand Beekeepers. Another book, written in Māori, Ko nga pi (The Bees) was published the following year. There is a tradition that Cotton introduced bees to New Zealand, but this is incorrect, although he was largely responsible for teaching the skills of beekeeping to the immigrants and the natives. When Cotton was later appointed vicar of Frodsham he continued his interest in beekeeping and carried out experiments on bees. On one of his trips to the Continent Cotton purchased a copy of a book called Schnurrdiburr by Wilhelm Busch which contained comical illustrated stories about a beekeeper and his bees. Cotton produced his own version of the book with his own verses attached to the illustrations entitled Buzz a Buzz or The Bees – Done freely into English. He took an active part in the discussions which led to the formation of the British Beekeepers' Association and became one of its vice presidents. He collected a library of over 200 books on bees and beekeeping which was bequeathed to the parish of Frodsham on his death. In 1932 it was deposited with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and in 1987 transferred to Reading University Library. Oxford There is little information about the nine years following Cotton's return from New Zealand. He remained a Fellow of Christ Church, Oxford, but was in residence in the college only intermittently. He spent some of this time travelling on the Continent. In 1855 he was in Constantinople and in the summer of 1857 he visited Avignon and Paris. In December 1855 he was appointed as curate to St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, a position from which he resigned in May 1857. While in Oxford he met Lewis Carroll, with whom he shared an interest in photography. Vicar of Frodsham William Cotton in later life In the summer of 1857 Cotton was appointed vicar of Frodsham, a market town in north Cheshire. At the time there were problems in the parish, in particular there was little financial provision for the outlying townships and the fabric of the parish church of St Laurence was in a bad condition. To make matters worse, the church stood in an elevated position above the town, making access difficult. Cotton sank into a state of apathy and despondence, and in the autumn of 1865 he was admitted for several weeks to Manor House Asylum, Chiswick, an asylum, under the care of Dr Seymour Tuke. There was some improvement in his mental condition and by 1870 Cotton was making arrangements for the restoration of the parish church. At this time there was competition from other denominations, particularly the Wesleyan Methodists. Financed by Thomas Hazlehurst, a member of the family business of Hazlehurst & Sons, soap and alkali manufacturers of nearby Runcorn, one small chapel had already been built near the parish church and another chapel, larger and more splendid, was planned for the centre of town. Cotton organised the building of a temporary chapel of ease in the middle of the town. This was constructed of iron (and known as the Iron Church) and was erected in a very short time on land donated by the Marquess of Cholmondeley. In addition to restoring the parish church, Cotton began to organise the restoration of the vicarage, in autumn 1872 hiring John Douglas to draw up plans. He also employed Douglas to design a house for him to live in while the vicarage was being renovated. Cotton successfully improved the provision of church schools in his parish. During his ministry he took boys from his parish to various events, both locally and to Manchester and Liverpool. In the late 1870s Cotton's mental health began to deteriorate to such a degree that he became unable to carry out his duties. In 1879 a sequestration order was obtained to allow John Ashton to take charge of the affairs of the parish; Cotton was readmitted to Manor House in the early summer and died there in June. His funeral took place at St John the Baptist's Church in Leytonstone and he was buried in the family grave in the churchyard. On the same day a memorial service was held for him in his Frodsham church. A memorial to his memory is in Frodsham Parish Church. The symbol of the honey bee appears on the chain of office of Frodsham's mayor and in various other places in the town, a Frodsham street is named Maori Drive and a Māori inscription is still present on the doorstep of Cotton's Old Vicarage. Mental health There is no doubt that William Cotton was a talented man whose achievements were limited by his mental ill-health. Numerous references have been made to Cotton's erratic behaviour, in particular his over-spending, and his periods of depression. There can be little doubt that he suffered from bipolar disorder; Cotton's biographer Smith refers to his \\"manic depression\\". He did achieve much, particularly during his years as a missionary, and in the field of apiculture. As he became older his condition deteriorated, especially during the time he was vicar of Frodsham. However, in view of his achievements in Frodsham, including the building of the Iron Church, the restoration of the parish church and vicarage, and the development of the church schools in his parish, the comment that while he was there \\"he had occasional periods of effectiveness\\" seems unfair.

Pro Donaldson, a full-time police officer, turned pro 1992 with first round knock out of Ben Green. His next fight he went the distance decisioning a tough Warren Williams whom sported a decent record of 6-1. He then suffered his first defeat to fringe contender James Gains. Donaldson then had a string of first-round knockouts, before facing Kirk Johnson. Donaldson was KO'd in the 5th. Following the loss, Donaldson put together his best win streak. The streak climaxed with a brutal second round blow out of undefeated prospect Quinn Navarre. Quinn was entering the ring undefeated in 11 pro outings, while Ed was a deceiving 7-2. Donaldson then took on Alex Garcia, who sported an impressive 35-4-1 record. He kept the pressure on and took Garcia the distance, but lost a ten-round decision. Impressed with Donaldson's durability and showing, ESPN offered a fight with Jimmy Thunder on national TV. Thunder took Donaldson out in the second round. =Fight Against Holmes= After the loss, Larry Holmes lined up a fight with Donaldson on ESPN. The fight started out with Larry winning solely on his jab, then rocking a tense looking Donaldson with right hands. Donaldson got bolder and started firing his jabs and righthands finding mild success. The fight was a rough and tumble affair with Ed pushing Larry back with bull charges and Larry losing his footing with his back foot slipping off the ring apron and causing him to fall to the canvas twice. It looked as if Holmes was en route to a decision when Holmes crashed home a devastating right hand that was reminiscent of the one that crushed Mike Weaver. Donaldson struggled to his feet just as the ref counted ten. For a brief moment it appeared the ref might stop it, but he didn't and the bell saved Donaldson from Holmes' follow up. The beginning of the ninth round had Larry trying to finish with Donaldson on shaky legs. By the middle of the round Donaldson had his legs back. Donaldson was able to hang on for the remainder of the fight, but lost a decision. After the loss, he returned to the ring at 37 years old to fight the undefeated Michael Grant (boxer). Donaldson was never in the fight and Grant took him out in the third. A year later Donaldson was to fight again. It was only his second fight in three years and by now he was 38. He fought Keith McKnight. McKnight took the decision. Donaldson's then retired with a record of 11-7 with 9 of his wins coming by knockout, and 5 of those knockouts were in the first round.

Saint-Géry Island is highlighted in red, the Brussels Stock Exchange is superimposed in green. North is roughly to the right. Saint- Géry Island () or Sint-Goriks Island (Dutch: ) was the largest island in the Senne (Zenne) river in Brussels, Belgium. It was named after Saint Gaugericus of Cambrai, who built a chapel there around 580; hence the name \\"Brussels\\", which comes from Bruocsella or Broekzele, meaning \\"settlement in the marsh\\".

The island was roughly round, and centred on the current /, a former covered market, and one of the trendiest districts of the capital. Many streets and buildings in the area still bear the name \\"/\\". History The church of St Gaugericus Saint Gaugericus of Cambrai built a chapel on the island around the year 580. Starting in the 10th century, the church began to house relics of Saint Gudula, who had died two centuries earlier, transferred there by Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine. Later the relics were transferred to the nearby Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula. When King Lothair II of Lotharingia appointed his brother Charles to be Duke of Lower Lotharingia in the 10th century, Charles constructed a fort on the island. Past the island navigation on the Senne was much more difficult, so it was a good strategic position. It had to defend not only the area, but also the western frontier of the Holy Roman Empire (to which the Duchy of Brabant and thus also Brussels belonged) against attacks by the French kings and their powerful vassals, the Counts of Flanders. This fort marked the birth of the city of Brussels, though the ruins have not been found. The island was said to be once completely carpeted in yellow irises. Due to the importance of the island, the iris has been a symbol of Brussels since the 19th century, and a stylised version is featured on the flag of the Brussels-Capital Region. Flag of the Brussels-Capital Region, featuring the iris By the 12th century, the island was home to a high density of watermills, playing an important role in Brussels' growth as a commercial centre.Deligne 15 During the Middle Ages, the island was home to a large amount of fishmongers, who would use the river surrounding the island to exchange the water in their fish reservoirs.Deligne 29 Fish were extremely important in the Roman Catholic city, as fasts prescribed by the church were rigorously obeyed. This ceased to be common practice even before the Industrial Revolution, as a growing number of tanners, dyers and other trades dumped their waste into the river, causing it to be unsuitable for storing fish.Deligne 9 At the end of the 18th century, under the French revolutionary regime, the Gothic church which had replaced the chapel was razed, replaced by a fountain centred on an obelisk dating from 1767 which had been taken from Grimbergen abbey. The square was an open-air market for the following century. Around 1870, when the Senne was covered, the island ceased to exist as an island and some of the eastern sections were demolished to make way for the modern bourgeois housing on Anspach boulevard (then called Central Boulevard). Plans were made to create a covered market to replace the open-air one, and in 1882, work was finished. The building, known as the ', () is in the Flemish neo-Renaissance style. The fountain still stands inside it. Today, the Saint-Géry area is well known for the many bars, cafés and restaurants in the area, making it a popular Brussels nightspot.

Walker founded the Minneapolis Public Library. He was among the ten wealthiest men in the world in 1923. He built two company towns, one of which his son sold to become part of what is today known as Sunkist. He is the founder and namesake of the Walker Art Center.  Early life and family  T.B. Walker, c. 1860. T. B. Walker was the son of Platt Walker and Anstis Keziah (Barlow) Walker (1814–1883), a sister of New York State Senator Thomas Barlow (1805–1896). He was born in Xenia, Ohio, in 1840, where in 1849 he got his first job in a bakery cutting biscuits. He had accompanied his parents and siblings west from New York when his father died of cholera in 1849 at Westport, Missouri, on their way to the California gold fields to seek their fortune. Harriet G. Walker, wife, mother of eight children and president of Northwestern Hospital In 1854, his mother married Oliver Barnes and in 1855 his family moved to Berea, Ohio, where while traveling for Fletcher Hulet, he was able to study mathematics intermittently and Newton's Principia at Baldwin University. When he finished college at age 19, he filled a contract in Paris, Illinois for railroad ties. He then taught school and then became a traveling salesman of grindstones. He is remembered as a man of \\"strong opinions\\" who would not eat grapefruit and who slept with a pistol under his pillow. His brother Platt Bayless Walker II founded Mississippi Valley Lumberman, a magazine. He had another brother and two sisters: Oliver W. Barnes, Adelaide B. Walker, and Helen M. Walker. Walker married his college classmate and boss's daughter Harriet Granger Hulet in 1863. They had eight children and lived in Minneapolis at first in a home on the east side rented for $9 per month. Their children were Gilbert M. (1864–1928), Julia A. (1865?–1952?), Leon B. (1868–1887), Harriet (1870–1904), Fletcher L. (1872–1962), Willis J. (1873–1943), Clinton L. (1875–1944), and Archie D. (1882–1971). The Walkers celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 1913. One of Walker's grandson's was Olympic hurdler Walker Smith.  Forestry  From a man in Iowa, Walker heard good things about Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved there in 1862. He arrived at Saint Paul where he met and sold grindstones, once to James Jerome Hill, then employed as a clerk who carefully sorted them for the buyer. Within one hour of his arrival in Minneapolis, he was hired as a chainman to George B. Wright, who was surveying federal pine lands in the north of the state. He became a deputy surveyor within a few days. His application to become assistant professor in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin had been accepted but he loved his new career and turned it down. Walker worked for twelve years on government surveys and on surveys for the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad. His work took him away from home for long periods, and it gave him intricate knowledge of what property to buy in northern Minnesota. He began to acquire pine land in 1867, but without capital of his own, he partnered at first with Dr. Levi Butler and Howard W. Mills and later with others. With George A. Camp, in 1877 Walker bought the Pacific Mill, a sawmill constructed in 1866 at the foot of 1st Avenue North on the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, which they owned for ten years before dissolving their partnership amicably. Red River Lumber Company (RRLC) was founded in 1883 and incorporated the following year. His oldest sons Gilbert and Leon became partners with Walker and the company built more mills in Crookston, Minnesota and at Grand Forks, Dakota Territory. He developed the town and built a mill at Akeley, Minnesota, which was named for his business partner, Healy C. Akeley. By 1902, four of his sons were involved in his businesses, and one was still in school. He was concerned about forest conservation and wrote an article for the National Magazine about what had become the \\"forestry question\\". During his lifetime, he gave papers to the Conservation Commission, the U.S. Forestry Department, the U.S. Interior Department and to the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee for their consideration for a tariff on lumber. He gave a presentation on conservation to the Minnesota Academy of Science.  Minneapolis  Minneapolis Public Library in the early 1900s He had to spend months up north, but finally returned to Minneapolis in 1881 intending to build up the city. Walker said, \\"St. Paul had the wholesale trade, the retail trade, the railroads and the banks. We tried five years to arrange an amicable interest in building up the industries of both cities.\\" He and others tried to lure a factory from the east but was double-crossed when Saint Paul, at the time a rival, ended up with both the eastern and the Minneapolis factories. He and his friends also invested in the Midway area but the city of Saint Paul annexed it. Minneapolis Central Library in 2006 One of 41 libraries in the Hennepin County system, Walker Community Library was built on land Walker donated. Walker built the commercial market in Minneapolis, renowned at the time, into the best produce market in the U.S. He is also \\"primarily responsible\\" for building the Minneapolis Public Library system, first with donations and as a stockholder in the Athenaeum Library Association and later with public property tax. He eventually overcame opposition to the idea of a free public library. Walker was a director and president of the library board from its founding in 1885 until he died in 1928. Four-fifths of the art displayed at the library came from his own collection which he had started to collect in 1874 when he purchased a copy of a portrait of George Washington by Rembrandt Peale for the library of his new home. He was particularly interested in creating a public art gallery, a museum, and the Minneapolis Art School. He became president of the Business or Businessman's Union, which formed in 1883 for fifteen years. They chose to build up land west of Minneapolis for their industrial site, to avoid any possibility of Saint Paul annexing the land. According to Walker, \\"some of the men in the union who liked changes made a social club of it, in the Guaranty Loan Building [known as the Metropolitan Building, since demolished]. This practically closed out the Business Union.\\"  Walker Galleries  Walker home at 803 Hennepin Avenue, Minneapolis Walker built his first house in Minneapolis in 1870, at Ninth Street and Marquette Avenue. In 1874 he built a mansion at 803 Hennepin Avenue. A gallery was open to the public six days a week beginning in 1879 to display his paintings, porcelain, bronzes, jades, ancient and modern high- grade glass, carved crystals, ancient Chinese carved snuff-boxes and ivory carvings. Visitors had to ring at the front door until the home was expanded. The house and its eight additions covered nearly a city block but were later demolished to build a complex that includes the State Theatre. His paintings included 15 American landscapes, 103 portraits of Native American chiefs, medicine men and warriors, and 24 portraits of renowned cowboys, scouts and guides, alongside traditional works by Raphael, Rembrandt, Holbein, Ingres, Titian, Bonheur, Turner and Michelangelo and dozens of other artists. Some of these paintings proved to be fakes and some were genuine—certainly, a landscape by Frederic Edwin Church sold for $8.5 million in a 1989 Sotheby's New York auction. Walker Art Center in 1941, opened in 1927 In 1915 Walker purchased the Thomas Lowry property on Groveland Terrace including the present Walker Art Center. In 1917 Walker moved into the Lowry Mansion but it was demolished in about 1932. By 1915 the Walker Galleries on 803 Hennepin had 14 rooms, and had about 100,000 visitors each year. In 1926, Walker completed building a new gallery next door to the Lowry Mansion on the site of the present Walker Art Center which opened in 1927. Built by local architects, Long and Thorsov, the original Walker Art Center building stayed open until it was demolished in 1969 to make way for a new building by Edward Larrabee Barnes. The T. B. Walker Collection (1907) Speaking of the 25 to 30 people who founded the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, Donald Torbert wrote: > \\"Today it is impossible to assess, with anything approaching justice, the > worth of the individual contributions, because each person was > indispensable. But two, by reason of their energy and position in the > community, played leading roles and through their accomplishments left a > permanent imprint on the art life of the community. They were William Watts > Folwell and Thomas Barlow Walker.\\" During the early 20th century, Walker published catalogs of his art collection which he wanted to give to the city of Minneapolis. He presented the deeds to his collection and of land to the library board in 1918. According to the Minnesota Historical Society, the city refused the gift. Today, the Art Gallery at Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church has several paintings from Walker's collection. Walker wanted to build a large public library and an arts and sciences institution but the city failed to provide financial support—the Minnesota legislature authorized bonds for $500,000 but only half of them sold. For five years, the city negotiated with Walker but never reached mutual satisfaction, and in 1923 he rescinded the offer. Folwell wrote in his A History of Minnesota, \\"Walker wisely followed his independent course\\". Walker Galleries, Inc., was incorporated in 1924, and the T. B. Walker Foundation of today was founded in 1925 to \\"own and manage the collection and gallery\\". Most of his collection was given away or sold to buy modern works. A gallery across the street at Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church holds several of the works in his collection by 16th- and 19th-century European masters, which Walker donated to decorate the Sunday school.  St. Louis Park, Minnesota  In 1886, with Calvin Goodrich, Jr. and Henry Francis Brown, Walker founded the Minneapolis Land and Investment Company and became its president. By 1888, the company advertised 12,000 lots on their , just west of the city limits near Bde Maka Ska, with the industry \\"in the marsh\\". Residential lots were wide, so that developers could build a garden in every other lot. The Industrial Circle exists today at Dakota and Walker Streets in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, near the intersection of Highway 7 and Louisiana. Daniel J. Falvey, the village roadmaster, graded the roads. Walker built about 100 Walker Houses between 1888 and 1900 for his workers to rent at $9 to $14 per month. Around this time, Walker was the richest man in Minnesota. About 50 of the houses remained in 1999 in the Edgebrook neighborhood. The Panic of 1893 left Walker owning and paying taxes on many unsold lots and his partners departed, assigning their land to Walker. In 1913 he owned about 600 or 700 of but the land was worth less than he had paid for it. Walker then turned his attention to the Pacific coast. He used money made there to pay off his unsold lots in Minnesota. His dream of a large downtown St. Louis Park disappeared in twelve years, but to that end he had built a Methodist church (which later burned), the Walker/Syndicate building (still standing), the St. Louis Park Hotel (which the village later demolished), The Great Northern Hotel (which later burned down) and a streetcar line to Minneapolis. According to the St. Louis Park Historical Society, Walker could be seen \\"giving out food during the Depression, but people shied away from him and even despised him\\". The E.H. Shursen Agency sold the last lot during the 1930s. Death T. B. Walker died at his home in Minneapolis in 1928. He was buried at Lakewood Cemetery, Minneapolis.http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00093.xml His wife died in 1917 while accompanying Walker on a business trip to New York. They were both buried in Lakewood. Walker was among the 15 or so wealthiest persons in the world when he died. A portrait of T. B. Walker in 1915 by Carl Boeckman, acquired at some time since 1940, was on display at the Walker Art Center from November 21, 2009 until August 15, 2010. In the Walker's recent collection, Walker appears in Lost Forty (2011), a huge tapestry by Goshka Macuga picturing a tract of unlogged land in the Chippewa National Forest.  Westwood, California  Left to right: Fletcher, Willis, Archie, T.B., Gilbert and Clinton Walker in 1907. He also had daughters, Julia, and Harriet who died in 1904. Leon, another son, died in 1887. Walker started to acquire northerneastern California land in 1894. In 1909 he bought property near Mountain Meadows, California. In 1912 RRLC signed an agreement with the Southern Pacific Railroad giving them the right to build a line (the Fernley and Lassen Railway) and exclusive right to haul lumber. RRLC may have owned of timberland in California, or about 1% of the area of the state, by the time Walker retired c. 1912. About 1912 RRLC built a mill and the company town of Westwood, California. Westwood included houses, apartments, dormitories, hotels, a community center, a department store, churches, and a theater. All utilities were company-owned. The men had the “Westwood Club” to themselves but for the first 20 years no liquor was sold. About this time, Walker retired from RRLC which his sons Gilbert, Fletcher, Willis, and Archie then ran. Walker grew \\"increasingly frustrated\\" that he couldn't control the business by himself. The Minnesota Historical Society notes that his sons didn't always see \\"eye to eye\\" with each other or with Walker. Walker’s youngest son Archie Dean Walker was first secretary (1908–1933) and then president (1933–c. 1956) of RRLC. Archie was Minneapolis-based and during his tenure on November 30, 1944, the Westwood mill and town were sold to the Fruit Growers Supply Company, the buying arm of today’s Sunkist.  List of associations and affiliated businesses  Walker's many business ventures and associations included the Crookston Boom and Water Power Company, the International Lumber Company in Minneapolis, the Metropolitan Trust Company in Minneapolis, the Minneapolis Central City Market Company, the Minneapolis Esterly Harvester Company, the Minnesota and Dakota Elevator Company in Minneapolis, the National Lumber Convention in Washington, D.C., the Northern Minnesota Log Driving & Boom Company, the Northwestern Elevator Company in Minneapolis, Pacific Investment Company, and the Waland Lumber Company. Walker was president of the Flour City National Bank in Minneapolis from 1887 to 1894. He was one of the incorporators of Edison Light & Power Co. He was one of the managers of the State Reform School in Saint Paul. He was involved in the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. Walker was a trustee of the Hennepin Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church (now known as the Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church in Minneapolis), a member of the Executive Committee of the Methodist Episcopal General Conference in Minneapolis, and a president of the Minneapolis Methodist Church Extension Society. He was a member of the executive committee of the See America League, a president of Walker Galleries, Inc., a president and a trustee of the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, president of the Minnesota Academy of Natural Sciences and its successor, the Minnesota Academy of Science where he donated boxes of specimens, and a trustee of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) of the City of Minneapolis. * Butler, Mills & Walker, later L.

Australia has several bands and sound systems that play reggae music in a style faithful to its expression in Jamaica. Australia has a relatively small Jamaican community, but reggae penetrated local consciousness via the popularity of reggae among the non-Jamaican population of England in the 1960s and 1970s. Many indigenous musicians have embraced reggae, both for its musical qualities and its ethos of resistance. Examples include Mantaka No Fixed Address Zennith and Coloured Stone History The first Reggae sound system in Australia was Soulmaker, established in 1972 by J.J. Roberts, a Jamaican from Saint Catherine Parish. Bob Marley & The Wailers toured Australia in 1979, playing Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney. Reggae had success on the radio charts in Australia in the early 1980s when Toots and the Maytals, the first artist to use the term \\"reggae\\" in song, went to number one with their song \\"Beautiful Woman\\".Hardwicke, Al. Toots and the Maytals to Ignite UK Festival Circuit. African & Caribbean Music Circuit Ltd. Web. 2007-06-21 Retrieved 13 March 2017.\\"reggae\\". Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 14 March 2017. . One of the first Australian reggae bands was Untabu. They had releases on Larrikin Records and were resident in a number of clubs in the Darlinghurst and Manly area of Sydney. They also toured the East coast regularly. They performed original music and reggae covers. The Aboriginal band No Fixed Address from Adelaide also had reggae songs in their repertoire. In 1984, Australian label Corroboree Records had its first release with Dangerous Times. This 7\\" single was recorded at Channel One Studios with the Roots Radics, voiced and mixed at King Tubby's with Bugs as engineer, and voiced by Dudley Green and General Justice. It Contains the song \\"Dangerous Dub\\" on the B side, which was mixed by King Tubby. It was released in Jamaica, the UK and Australia. In 1985 Larry Maluma arrived in Australia from Zambia with master tapes recorded in Zambia. He remixed a couple of tracks, Black or White and Chimutima Chako at AAV studios in Melbourne for a 45 single vinyl which was released in 1986 under his own newly formed independent (Safari Music) label. In 1987, two years after his arrival from Zambia Larry Maluma released his first album Confusion on his own Safari Music label. The video clip Black and White from the same album was aired on Countdown Revolution and Rock Arena on ABC. Larry Maluma went on to release his 14th album, Ndakondwa (I'm Happy) in 2014. The first notable dub release in Australia was Ten Dubs That Shook The World by Sheriff Lindo and the Hammer, issued on the artist's own label, Endless Recordings, in 1988. The LP was reissued on the Creative Vibes label with five extra tracks in 1998, and again by EM Records of Japan in 2006, on CD (catalogue number EM1049CD) and LP (EM1049LP), limited to 500 copies. The CD version contains five extra tracks. Melbourne-based band The Red Eyes released their first live CD in 2003 Live at the Evelyn, following it with two CD EPs, two full-length albums (Rudeworld in 2006 and Red Army in 2010) and the 2011 single Circles before disbanding. Their catalog contains reggae, dub and occasional drum 'n' bass tracks. The band's lead singer El Witeri is Maori, and their work has been remixed by New Zealand dub producer, Deep Fried Dub. In September 2006, Astronomy Class released Exit Strategy on the record label Elefant Traks. The record fused reggae and hip hop music. In February 2007, Melbourne-based producer Mista Savona released Melbourne Meets Kingston on Elefant Traks. It is a 21-track collaboration with Jamaican singers and deejays such as Anthony B, Determine and Big Youth. In September 2008, the Sydney-based band King Tide released their debut album To our Dearly Deported on the UK label Urban Sedated. The single \\"No Dog War\\" was used worldwide by the Sony corporation for their Wag the Dog campaign. The commercial shot in Brazil featured members from the cast of the feature film City of God. In December 2009, Australian artist Matty Woods released The Ras Gong Guerrilla EP, a 10-track recording that tackles Australian and international political issues such as Indigenous sovereignty, climate change and human rights. As of 2015, many indigenous Australian artists from the Northern Territory represented by the Aboriginal owned and operated music label CAAMA Music identify as reggae or ska artists (often in combination with rock). Artists include Tjintu Desert Band (previously known as Sunshine Reggae) and Tjupi Band. Some also identify as \\"desert reggae\\" artists, with examples including Lajamanu Teenage Band and Rising Wind. Reggaeton, a music genre that blends reggae, hip hop, and traditional Latin American music, is also popular in Australia. The genre first came to prominence when Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee released his most notable single, \\"Gasolina,\\" to Australian radio in 2006. Already a hit worldwide, it reached a peak of No. 12 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified Platinum, making it one of the few Spanish-language songs to reach that position on the Australian charts.

It was a British company based in Deptford, South London, specialising in custom handmade steel bicycle frames. The company was founded in 1949, by Ernie Witcomb and his wife Lily. The London shop closed in May 2009. History Left to right: Barrie Witcomb, Phil Liggett and Ernie Witcomb on the Witcomb Cycles stand at the London Cycle Show – 11 October 2007 Ernie Witcomb's father, Tom, a steel worker in local dockyards, started to build frames in 1928 in his east London cellar. In 1951, Ernie bought E.A. Boult, where he had been working since before World War II and, by 1952, started trading as Witcomb Lightweight Cycles with Wally Green as frame builder. Barrie Witcomb, Ernie Witcomb's son, started his apprenticeship as a frame builder in 1958 at the age of 15, under Malcolm Barker, a former builder at J.R.J. Cycles in Leeds. In 1959, Witcomb Cycles bought Rotrax Cycles building.Hilary Stone, \\"Rotrax\\" Classiclightweights.co.uk, n.d.; accessed 5 August 2012. In 1961, Witcomb co- founded the Lightweight Cycle Association, one of cycling's first trade- focused organisations. In the 1960s, Witcomb Trading also made frames for Sid Mottram, Rotrax, Velosport and others. More recently they have made frames for the fashion brand Carhartt and Reynolds steel. Richard Sachs, Peter Weigle, Chris Chance and Ben Serotta, four American frame builders, trained at Witcomb Cycles in the early 1970s, along with the British wheel builder, Harry Rowland. By the 1980s, the fashion for mountain bikes put a strain on the business, which went into decline. In 1998, Ernie Witcomb retired. The company seems to have been dormant since 2009. Location Witcomb's shop in Tanners Hill From its beginning, until 2009, the company's headquarters was located in London, starting in Woolwich, then later moving to Tanners Hill in Deptford. After moves from one building to another, the workshop stayed at 25 Tanners Hill, a late 17th-century Grade II listed building for many years. During the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the company also operated a factory in Llanelli, Carmarthernshire, Wales. The London site was closed in May 2009, and the business announced an intention to move production to Wales. This does not appear to have materialised.Jonathan Donald, \\"Witcomb Cycles\\", Londoncyclesport.com, 22 May 2009; as archived by the Wayback Machine on 25 June 2009. Witcomb USA In 1971, the company represented the UK at a British Fair in New York City. The next year, Witcomb, while exhibiting in San Francisco, received Princess Alexandra and her husband, Sir Angus Ogilvy. This marked a short-lived foray on the US market. Witcomb USA was founded in 1972 in East Haddam, Connecticut by Richard Sachs and Peter Weigle. However, problems with suppliers meant the company could not fulfill demand, and the venture was dismantled after 8 years. Racing Team In the 1960s, Witcomb Cycles sponsored the London Coureurs and the Hadrian CC Riders, then the Witcomb Metro CRC, and the Witcomb Vulcan CRC. Witcomb organised races including Dover-London. At this time Barrie Witcomb started racing as an independent (semi-professional).

Casals was a Catalan and one of the world's most respected cellists. He was a legend in his own lifetime, one so powerful that when, in protest at Franco's regime, he began a self-imposed exile in the tiny Catalan French Pyrenean village of Prades just north of the Spanish border, the world's leading musicians refused to allow Casals' genius to remain unheard and flocked there, creating a famous festival in the heart of the mountains. Casals' sayings and witticisms were as legendary as his musical interpretations, and he was revered by the world's great statesmen and musicians alike.

It is native to many areas of both Asia and North America. The common name water parsnip is due to its similarity to parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) and its wetland habitat. The alternate common name hemlock waterparsnip is due to its similarity to spotted water hemlock (Cicuta maculata). Introduction Sium suave, also widely known as water parsnip, is a wildflower native to parts of the northern hemisphere and thriving in primarily wetland habitats. Sium suave belongs to the carrot family, Apiaceae. Water parsnip blooms from July to August and creates many small white flowers with umbel inflorescences. Sium suave resembles a few quite poisonous plants, and consumption should be avoided. There is a vast number of insect species of bees, beetles, wasps, butterflies, and flies that visit this plant for its nectar and pollen. Sium come from the Latin sion meaning water parsley, and suave comes from the Latin suâvis meaning sweet. Description The shape and size of the leaves depends on the environment in which S. suave grows. Basil rosette leaves form on moist ground at around 3.8 cm long, and in shallow water they grow in clusters of aquatic leaves. Once leaves are formed this flowering plant stands up to 3 meters tall with stems that are 5 cm in diameter. Water parsnip has light green and glabrous stems with longitudinal veins and few branches. Leaves along the stems are alternate and odd-pinnate. Water parsnip flowers are perfect (both male and female) and are self-fertile. The pedicles are 3–5 mm long and the fruit is ovoid. The fruit is dry but does not split open when ripe. The flowers have umbellule inflorescence with 10-20 white flowers. These white flowers are small (~3.2 mm across) with 5 petals. The petals can sometimes be of unequal size and are somewhat heart shaped. Taxonomy Sium suave is a member of the order Apiales and the family Apiaceae, the celery, carrot and parsley family (also known as Umbelliferae). This family contains about 445 genera and about 3540 species. Some distinctive characteristics of this family include compound leaf, simple or compound umbel inflorescence containing many small flowers, 2 styles, 2-carpellate ovary, and a schizocarp fruit that splits into 2 mericarps. This species belongs to the genus Sium which is made up of about 9 species. Species in Sium are all perennial herbs of the northern hemisphere. Some common characteristics of this genus include serrate leaves with teeth turned inward and slightly overlapping, flowers in bracteate umbels with conspicuous involucels, five small teeth on calyx, white petals that are obcordate with inflexed apex, styles with depressed conical base which spread or recurve above, fruit that are laterally flattened with mericarp exhibiting 5 ridges, and subterete seeds. The diploid number of chromosomes for Suim suave is 22. The Kutenai call water parsnip nakhankam (Ktunaxa: naq̓an̓kam). Sium suave (from the Latin sium, the Latinization of Greek sion, meaning \\"water parsley,\\" and suâvis, meaning \\"sweet.\\"), the hemlock waterparsnip or water parsnip, is a herb native to parts of Canada, Asia, and North America. Synonyms for S. suave include Sium cicutifolium Schrank, Sium floridanum Small, Sium suave Walter var. floridanum (Small) C.F. Reed, Apium cicutifolia (J.F.Gmel.) Benth. & Hook.f. ex F.B.Forbes & Hemsl., Cicuta dahurica Fisch. ex Schultz, Sium cicutifolium Schrenk, Sium formosanum Hayata, and Sium nipponicum Maxim. According to a molecular phylogeny created with maximum parsimony heuristic searches using a 59-sequence data set of Sium s.l., Helosciadium, Cryptotaenia, and outgroups, the sister groups of S. suave are Sium medium found in Central Asia and Sium latifolium found in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Western Asia. Distribution and habitat Sium suave grows in wetland habitats (sandy and non-sandy). These wetland habits include wet prairies, bottoms of seeps, low areas along springs, soggy thickets, swamps, borders and shallow water of ponds, marshes, and ditches. It is native to both North America and Asia in Canada, the United States, Japan, Russia Federation, South Korea, and China. Uses Extreme caution should be practiced when using this plant for food because it resembles the very poisonous Cicuta maculata (Spotted Water Hemlock). Edible parts of Sium suave include the root in the spring and fall, either raw or cooked; it has a nutty flavor. The leaves are also sometimes used for condiments such as relish. Crushed water parsnip roots have also been used as an analgesic (pain reliever) in cases of broken limbs. Cultivation Water parsnip should be grown in wet mucky soil / sand or in standing water up to an inch and a half deep. It also prefers partial to full sun. The seeds should be sown in late winter to early spring during a cold frame. Sium suave is in flower from July to August while the seeds ripen from September to October. It has been shown to accumulate arsenic and heavy metals near abandoned mine tailings in South Korea. In the presence of added N03-N to the ground, water parsnip shows increased production. Faunal associations These flowers attract a wide variety of insects. While most insects are attracted to the nectar of the flower, bees seek both their nectar and pollen. These include 21 species of bees, 73 species of flies, 91 species of wasps,4 species of plant bugs, 5 species of butterflies, and 19 species of beetles. Two types of physodermas have been found to parasitize S. suave. Type I physoderm causes conspicuous black pustules on several parts of the plant including the stem, petiole, leaflet lemina, and flowers. Type II physoderma formed abundant resting spores and epibiotic sporangia on seedlings of S. suave. The stems and leaves of this plant are toxic to livestock.

The project is financed by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) and carried out by the Center for Development Research, ZEF Bonn in Germany and with the Institute of Biodiversity Conservation and the Ethiopian Coffee Forest Forum in Ethiopia. Background The montane rain forests in southeast Ethiopia, the birthplace of wild Coffea arabica, were the origin of a large part of modern commercially used Coffea breeds. Due to the dwindling size of the montane rain forests as a result of clearing, the precious resource of wild Arabica coffee, and the genetic diversity it contains, is increasingly threatened. Approximately 40% of Ethiopia's land area was covered by dense forests at the end of the 1960s. This has now fallen to 2.7 percent. The former Kingdom of Kaffa in the southwest of the country is now a part of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region, one of the nine ethnic divisions of Ethiopia. The rapidly developing town of Bonga is the economic center of the Kaffa region. In the Kaffa region there are only 200,000 acres of undisturbed African montane rain forest remaining. However, these are extremely threatened in their existence, because of pressure on this forest region—due to the growing population, infrastructure projects such as road construction and investors plans—which has been increasing steadily.

SHC has been found to be important in the regulation of apoptosis and drug resistance in mammalian cells. SCOP classifies the 3D structure as belonging to the SH2 domain family.  Gene and expression  The gene SHC1 is located on chromosome 1 and encodes 3 main protein isoforms: p66SHC, p52SHC and p46SHC. These proteins differ in activity and subcellular locations, p66 is the longest and while the p52 and p46 link activated receptor tyrosine kinase to the RAS pathway. The protein SHC1 also acts as a scaffold protein which is used in cell surface receptors. The three proteins that SHC1 codes for have distinctly different molecular weights. All three SHC1 proteins share the same domain arrangement consisting of an N-terminal phosphotyrosine- binding(PTB) domain and a C-terminal Src-homology2(SH2) domain. Both of the domains for the three proteins can bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins but they are different in their phosphopeptide-binding specificities. P66SHC is characterized by having an additional N-terminal CH2 domain.  Function  Overexpression of SHC proteins are associated with cancer mitogenesis, carcinogenesis and metastasis. The SHC and its adaptor proteins transmit signaling of the cell surface receptors such as EGFR, erbV-2 and insulin receptors. p52SHC and p46SHC activate the Ras-ERK pathway. p66SHC inhibits ERK1/2 activity and antagonize mitogenic and survival abilities of T-lymphoma Jurkat cell lines. A rise in p66SHC promotes stress induced apoptosis. p66SHC functionally is also involved in regulating oxidative and stress- induced apoptosis – mediating steroid action through the redox signaling pathway. P52SHC and p66SHC have been found in steroid hormone-regulated cancer and metastasizes. = EGFR pathway = SHC1 has been found to act in signaling information after epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Activated tyrosine kinase receptors, on the cell surface, use proteins such as SHC1 that contain phosphotyrosine binding domains. After the EGF stimulation SHC1 binds to groups of proteins that activate survival pathways. This activation is followed by a sub-network of proteins that bind to SHC1 and are involved cytoskeleton reorganization, trafficking and signal termination. PTPN122 then acts as a switch to convert SHC1 to SgK269-mediated pathways that regulate cell invasion and morphogenesis. SHC1 is not a static scaffold protein, a protein that does not move or change over time, it is dynamic as the conformation changes and modifies the EGFR signaling output over time. = MCT-1 regulation = SHC proteins are differentially regulated by the Multiple Copies in T-cell malignancy(MCT-1). This regulation affects the SHC-Ras-ERK pathway. With MCT-1 reduction the phosphor activation of Ras, MEK and ERk ½ were also reduced, this reduction in ERK also affects cyclin D1. The expression of the SHC proteins (all three) were also dramatically reduced with the reduction of MCT-1 because of this it is thought that MCT-1 acts as an inducer of SHC gene transcription. p66SHC is found to be the protein that is most affected by MCT-1. SHC expression downregulated in tumorigenic processes are identified after MCT-1 depletion. By blocking the MCT-1 activity this could inhibit the SHC signaling cascase and the oncogenicty and tumorigenicity that is regulated by SHC expression. = Oxidative stress = Oxidative stress occurs when the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is greater than their catabolism. ROS production by the mitochondria is regulated by many diverse factors including SHC1. The SHC proteins are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation and are part of the growth factor and stress-induced ERK activation. There have been findings that suggest a correlation between life span and the oxidative stress response. Selective resistance to oxidative stress and extended life span have been related to p66SHC. = Life span = There is a link between oxidative stress, life span and p66SHC in mice because of this relationship the SHC gene has been related to longevity and increasing the life span of the mouse. It has been proposed that SHC1 modulates the life span and stress response through the DAF-2 insulin- like receptor of the IIS pathway. The SHC-1 can directly interact with the DAF-2 in vitro. = p66SHC metabolism = p66SHC operates as a redox enzyme linked to apoptotic cell death. p66SHC has been related to the sirtuin-1 system and has been associated with endothelial damage and repair. This relationships is also related to vascular homeostasis and oxidative stress. p66SHC can be altered by changes in the glucose metabolism and vascular senescence. When protein kinase C is induced by hyperglycemia, p66SCH is induced which then leads to oxidative stress. When the coagulated protease-activated protein C inhibits p66SHC a cytoprotective effect on diabetic nephropathy is placed on the kidneys . When a mutations such as a p66SHC deletion occurs the cardiomyocyte death is reduced and a pool of cardiac stem cells are preserved from oxidative damage – preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy. The deletion of p66SHC also protects from ischemia/reperfusion brain injuries through blunted production of free radicals.  Clinical significance  The signaling activation of SHC is implicated in tumorigenic in cancer cells there is a potential to use SHC as a prognostic marker when targeting cancer treatment. SHC1 interacts with SgK269 which is a member of the Src kinase signaling network that characterized basal breast cancer cells. When SgK269 is overexpressed in mammary epithelial cells it promotes the cell growth and might contribute to the progression of aggressive breast cancers. In prostate and ovarian cancer, increased expression of p66Shc appears to promote cell proliferation. and tumorigenicity, particularly in prostate cancer xenografts This tumorigenic effect is related to its ability to increase redox stress in these cancer cells.

The main causes of deforestation in Ethiopia are shifting agriculture, livestock production and fuel in drier areas. Deforestation is the process of removing the forest ecosystem by cutting the trees and changing the shape of the land to suit different uses.Sucoff, E. (2003). \\"Deforestation\\", Environmental Encyclopedia, at pp.358–359. Detroit: Gale. Background Among developing countries, especially in Africa, Ethiopia is exceptionally rich in history, as well as cultural and biological diversity. It is home to one of the earliest ancestors of the human species, around 80 languages are spoken by various ethnic groups, and it is home to two globally important biodiversity hotspots. However, this rich cultural and natural heritage is threatened, especially in the form of deforestation. Ethiopia has the second largest population in Africa and has been hit by famine many times due to rain shortages and a depletion of natural resources. Deforestation may have further lowered the already meagre rainfall. Bercele Bayisa, a 30 year old Ethiopian farmer said \\"his district was very forested and full of wildlife but, overpopulation caused people to come to this fertile land and clear it to plant crops, cutting all trees to sell as fire wood\\".Haileselassie, A. (2004) \\"Ethiopia’s struggle over land reform,\\" World press Review 51.4, 32(2). Expanded Academic ASAP Growing populations are increasing deforestation which is leading the country to famine. As the population continues to grow, the needs of the people increase.

Retrieved November 22, 2006, from ABI/INFORM Global database. (Document ID: 538367341) Forests in Ethiopia Forests in Ethiopia play a big role in protecting erosion, as tree roots protect against washouts. Trees also help to keep water in the soil and reduce global warming by uptake of carbon dioxide. Because there are not enough trees, the Blue Nile is carrying all the soil and nutrients in the water to the neighboring countries of Sudan and Egypt. Historically, forests have been very important for the livelihoods of the people of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian people used trees for lumber for construction, and to fuel their cooking fires. They also made traditional medicines from trees and other forest plants. Forests were also important in Ethiopian religious beliefs; the people believed in holy spirits in the forest that they treat in the same way as human beings. Mitchell Page states that over 6603 plant species live in Ethiopia, of which approximately one fifth are not native to other countries. At the beginning of the twentieth century around 420,000 square kilometres (35% of Ethiopia's land) was covered by trees but recent research indicates that forest cover is now less than 14.2% due to population growth. Despite the growing need for forested lands, lack of education among locals has led to a continuing decline of forested areas.  Accelerated destruction  Earth trends estimated that in 2000 Ethiopia had 43,440,000 km² of natural forest area, which is 4% of its total land area.Earth Trends 2003 Compared to other East African countries Ethiopia's deforestation rate is about average.FAO. State of the World’s Forests Report 2007 However, the deforestation rates in East Africa are second highest of the continent. Moreover, it has the smallest fraction of its forest area designated primarily for conservation. Apart from Northern Africa, East African countries show the second highest decline rates of conservation forests in the continent. In a forest resource assessment of Ethiopia, Reusing found that within 17 years (1973–1990) high-forest cover decreased from 54,410 to 45,055 km² or from 4.72 to 3.96% of the land area.Reusing, M. 1998. Monitoring of Natural High Forests in Ethiopia. Government of Ethiopia in cooperation with GTZ, Addis Ababa. High forest cover was divided into closed, slightly disturbed and heavily disturbed forests, based on the assumption that closed high forests have an 80% area coverage. He calculated a deforestation rate of 1,630 km² per year, which means that deforestation at the same rate would leave about 18,975 of the 45,055 km² in 2006. The FAO (2007) estimated a deforestation rate of 1,410 km² per year. Dereje carried out a study in the coffee forest areas of southwest Ethiopia in order to estimate forest cover change between 1973 and 2005.Dereje Tadesse 2007. Forest cover change and socio-economic drivers in SW Ethiopia. MSc Thesis. Technical University Munich, Center of Land Management and Land Tenure, Germany The study area covered an area of 3,940 km² with 2,808 km² of high-forests (71% of the area) extended over five woredas (Bench, Sheko, Yeki, Guraferda, and Godere) in the two regional states of the Gambela and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Regions. His analysis shows that the forested land declined to 1,907 km², which equals 67% of the forest cover in 1973. Between 2001 and 2005 another 55.4 km² of forest land were allocated for private coffee production and 20 km² for rubber plantations. Gessesse studied an upland rain forest area of 3,060 km² in the Awasa watershed of the south- central Great Rift Valley, 280 km south of Addis Ababa.Gessesse Dessie 2007. Forest Decline in South Central Ethiopia. Extent, History and Process. Dpt. Of physical geography and quaternary geology, Stockholm University, Sweden He estimated the rate of deforestation between 1972 and 2000 using remote sensing techniques. Furthermore, he could show that within the 28-year period 80% (400 km²) of the 1972 forest cover (489.24 km²) was lost. He describes that within the formerly closed forest, clearings created a speckled pattern of non- connected small forest patches. Despite the slightly different estimates for deforestation in different regions of Ethiopia, given deforestation rates remain the same, the country will have lost its last tree of high forests within about 27 years. And with it will go the world's only original wild populations of Coffea arabica. The economic loss of that genetic resource ranges between 0.4 and US$1.5 billion/year.  Causes of deforestation  Dereje explains deforestation in the coffee forest area he studied by linking it to historical events in certain time periods. From 1973 – 87 forest cover reduced by 11%. That period was characterized by resettlement and villagization programs and the expansion of state farm programs. Twenty-four percent of forest loss was a result of converting 101.28 square kilometers of high forests into coffee plantations. In later periods forests continued to be converted to agro-forestry systems, agricultural land and settlement areas. The speed and pattern varies depending on the distance to state monitoring and coincides with changes in government. From the 1950s to 1974 private land ownership was promoted through land grants to civil servants and war veterans. During this period mechanized farming became increasingly attractive.Ethiopian Economic Association/Ethiopian Economic Policy Research Institute 2002. Land tenure and agricultural development in Ethiopia. A research report, Addis Ababa, pp. 157 As a result, large numbers of rural people were dislocated – also to forest areas. Recently pressure comes from intensive management of forest coffee and semi-forest coffee which drastically changes the structure and functions of the original forests. Improved transport and communication infrastructure and thereby better access to markets is facilitating deforestation. More forest cover change was detected close to areas with good road networks and around settlements. Gessesse Dessie and Carl Christiansson identify an entire combination of biophysical and socio-political conditions for forest decline in the Awassa watershed area.Gessesse Dessie and Carl Christiansson 2007. Forest Decline and its Causes in the South Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Ambio (accepted) Geographic properties, socio-political change, population growth, insecurity of land tenure, agricultural development and the improvement of transport capacities are among the most important. As a result of a political power vacuum during periods of political transition, large forest areas were cut down. Those proximate reasons are accompanied by underlying causes for deforestation. Faced by food insecurity agricultural land is just more valuable to farmers.Rojahn, A. 2006. Incentive Mechanisms for a Sustainable Use System of the Montane Rain Forest in Ethiopia. PhD Thesis.

Why Financial Incentives can Destroy Economically Valuable Biodiversity in Ethiopia. ZEF Discussion Paper No.114, Center for Development Research, ZEF Bonn, Germany Individual farmers do not have many other options than converting forests into agricultural land if they are exposed to severe food insecurity. Their time preference rates are low which means they prefer food today over tomorrow and they definitely can not carry the costs of forest conservation for the larger national or global society.

Ponte 2005. The coffee paradox: Global markets, commodity trade and the elusive promise of development. London and New York: Zed Books Economically valuable forests in Ethiopia, which contain the world's only wild Coffea arabica populations are diminishing and, at current deforestation rates, will be completely lost in 27 years. Deforestation in Ethiopia is caused by past governmental and institutional changes, insecurity of land tenure, resettlement programs, population pressure, agricultural and infrastructure developments. Farmers suffer from poverty as well as food insecurity and cannot bear the costs of forest conservation. Ethiopian and international stakeholders are involved in a competitive game for resources, rights and mandates. That hinders collective action and cooperation to prevent deforestation. Apart from appropriate economic incentives, environmental education, public awareness and civil society engagement need to be strengthened and trust needs to be rebuilt between stakeholders. Capacities for conservation must be built by devolving authority. Despite being the birthplace of Coffea arabica and the source for one of the world's finest coffees, current commitment of the worldwide coffee industry to conserve the forests is negligible. = Locales of special concern= When the Derg military regime seized power in 1975, socialism was declared the guiding ideology for Ethiopia and all rural and forest land was nationalized. Central and Eastern European experience has taught us that state ownership of land is a disincentive to manage it productively and sustainably. However, also the current government adopted a constitution in 1995 in which forests (land and other natural resources) are declared exclusively state property.Constitution of Ethiopia 1995, Art 40, No.3 It also says that anybody who is willing to work the land has a right to obtain land without payment. Although this goal can be enforced through land allocation, it almost certainly will conflict with land users’ tenure security.Deininger, K. and S. Jin. 2006. \\"Tenure Security and Land-Related Investment: Evidence from Ethiopia,\\" European Economic Review 50 (5): 1245-77. This is because the administrative redistribution of land and use rights (in all Regions except Amhara) is contingent on physical residence, the amount of land to be rented out and the prohibition of mortgaging and sale of land. \\"This leads to confusion and provides scope for bureaucratic discretion.\\"Ege, S. 1997. \\"The Promised Land: The Amhara Land Redistribution of 1997.\\" SMU-rapport 5/97. Dragvoll, Norway: Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Centre for Environment and Development. In 1994 a proclamation made the distinction between public and private ownership of forests, declaring natural forests as state owned and allowing planted forests to be owned privately. The proclamation No. 94/1994 prohibits any person to use or harvest trees, settle, graze, hunt or keep bee hives in the state forest. With the intention to improve tenure security, the first land certification scheme was initiated 1998 in Tigray and only 80% completed (because of the war with Eritrea). Shortly before the 2005 elections land certification continued also in other regions of Ethiopia.World Bank Policy Research Paper 4218, April 2007 The results showed that certification has indeed improved tenure security and investments into land. However, certification of land rights cannot eliminate systemic uncertainty of the type of problem mentioned earlier in the context of administrative retribution of land. Also, the head of the Ethiopian Forum for Social Studies expressed doubt that \\"…a piece of paper will bring about (tenure) security because it leaves all other aspects of the (current) land tenure system intact, like interference by the authorities.\\"http://www.addistribune.com/Archives/2003/07/25-07-03/New.htm In 2000 a new approach to forest ownership and management was initiated with the help of international donor agencies. The so-called co-management approach builds on a contract between the government and communities which rely on forest management for their livelihood.Tsgaye Tadesse 2007. An overview of the forest ecosystems of Ethiopia: Functions, trends and future directions. In: Seyoum and De Stoop (eds) Environment for survival. Taking Stock of Ethiopia’s Environment. Green Forum, Addis Ababa Forest user groups are established and exclusive rights for forest use are granted to the members of the group. The contract confirms the boundaries of the forest, defines ownership and use and other specific conditions. The principal idea behind the co-management approach is that secured rights are a crucial incentive for sustainable management. After initial promising results, the sustainability of that approach still needs to be evaluated. Deforestation and drought Horrific famines occurred in Ethiopia during the 1970s and 1980s, especially in the northern part of the country where there was a bad drought. Thousands of people died. Deforestation can exacerbate the problems caused by drought because rain is less likely to soak into the soil and replenish ground water.  Attitudes to deforestation in Ethiopia  It is costly to halt deforestation. Coffee companies have discovered the niche market for forest coffee from Ethiopia and are willing to pay higher prices to the farmer cooperatives in coffee forest areas. Consumers are promised that buying the coffee will improve incomes of farmers and therefore farmers are motivated to manage their coffee forests sustainably. Traditionally farmers have abandoned wild coffee collection when coffee prices were too low. Whether or not higher prices for forest coffee are an incentive either to over-harvest or harvest more sustainably, remains an open question. Currently there is no scientific evidence that higher prices for forest coffee are an incentive for sustainable harvest practices. In fact, even the knowledge about the amount of wild coffee that can be collected in a sustainable way is scarce. Because of the complex nature of the problem of deforestation, the Ethiopian government alone is not able to prevent deforestation. By now we also know that markets alone are unable to prevent this either.James. A, K.J. Gaston and A. Balmford 2000. Why private institutions alone will not do enough to protect biodiversity, Nature, 9 Mar 404: 120. Eventually local stakeholder participation will be required. Much of Ethiopia's national budget is covered by international development aid.With 1.6 billion USD per year, Ethiopia is one of the world’s most successful aid attractors. http://www.zef.de/hpnews.0.html Not surprisingly international aid agencies should also play a prominent role in sustainable forest management. The government of Ethiopia has asked several international agencies, like the Japanese ICA, the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and FARM-Africa to get involved in Participatory Forest Management. Such projects aim at developing forest management plans and signing contracts between local communities and the government. Different areas of the remaining forests are divided among the foreign aid agencies, where they carry out “their” projects on behalf of the government. What is needed, however, are direct, competent, trustworthy relations between local resource users and the federal authorities: a functioning and effective forestry extension service. Another problem is that the environmental issues in Ethiopia have no (or a very weak) lobby and the current restrictive socio-political context for public engagement has detrimental effects on environmental education, awareness, advocacy and the building of an engaged and empowered civil society – assets which are necessary to conserve and use Ethiopia's forests in a sustainable way. The recent \\"School Children Talent Competition Award on Biodiversity Conservation\\", organized by the Ethiopian Coffee Forest Forum is an excellent example of what is needed.Mekdes Girmaw 2004. Institutions Influencing the Conservation of Coffea arabica in the Montane Rainforests of SW Ethiopia. The Case of the Institute of Biodiversity Conservation, Environmental Protection Authority and Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative. Addis Ababa University =Government and deforestation= In rural areas, the government realized that if the deforestation continues the overall condition of the country will worsen. Because of that, the government has begun teaching the people about the benefits of forests and encouraging the people to plant more trees and to protect what they have by providing them alternative home and agricultural materials. If any person cuts a tree, he or she needs to plant one to replace it. The current government and people are working hard together to make their country a better place. Prohibiting the Ethiopian population to cut trees, especially rural populations, will actually hurt daily life since meeting daily needs becomes more difficult. The government is trying to provide the Ethiopian people with fuel and electrical machinery so the demand for forest resources is not as high. Additionally, the government is providing flat land with no pre-existing forests to promote agriculture so that deforestation is not necessary for modern agriculture.Maddox, G.H. (2006). Sub-Saharan Africa: An environmental history. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO. There are governmental and nonprofit groups working with the government to protect the land. Organizations such as SOS and Farm Africa are working with the federal government and local governments to create a good system of forest management. The government is also working to relocate people who live in dry regions to places where they can find fertile land for farming, so that they would be able to support themselves without any assistance from the government. With the fund provided by E.C grant (around 2.3 million Euros) people were trained to protect the land from erosion and taught to use water for irrigation, which improved quality of life and the environment. Locals have now come to the realization that trees need legal recognition, and must be protected for future generations. One of the methods used to protect trees is to designate certain areas where trees may be chopped down and used, and other areas where trees are protected by law.

Written and directed by Irish filmmaker Dermott Petty and produced by Mee Vaj and Lon Casler Bixby, the movie stars Pat Towne, Jonathan Mangum and Jaclyn Fjeslad. Manband recently played at the Unfringed Festival in Limerick, Ireland and was nominated for Best Production. Plot ManBand! is the tale of two music promoters looking to find the next big thing in pop music for television. They inadvertently create a \\"manband\\", a boy band with middle-aged men. The television company follows and sabotages their progress. The band, cruelly named ‘Parazone’ (a European brand of bleach), consists of five members: *Barrelman (Michael Wallot), an opera singer; *RS Smoothskin (Tim Murphy), who has boy band looks but no talent; *Mild Bob (Kurt Scholler), a Tupperware salesman who mistakenly auditions thinking it to be a Tupperware convention; *Bosco Barret (Kevin Kearns), an “Irish lunatic/Troubadour; and *Bartender (Ed Bell), a bartender/crazed heavy metal singer. Their choreographer, TT Bags, is a less than successful dancer and songwriter Lun E. Tune is a recently released mental patient who writes songs about maiming his old girlfriends. Background/Production Petty stated in an interview “One day at the day job I had to watch a commercial for fast food featuring a Boys Band. Just as I was about to give up on Western Civilization a thought occurred to me What if some Joker of Promoter had the zany idea of creating a Boysband with Middle Age Men, hence a 'ManBand!'\\" ManBand! is a SAG experimental movie shot on DV.

Clinical significance  Defects in this gene lead to the most common form of congenital deafness in developed countries, called DFNB1 (also known as connexin 26 deafness or GJB2-related deafness). One fairly common mutation is the deletion of one guanine from a string of six, resulting in a frameshift and termination of the protein at amino acid number 13. Having two copies of this mutation results in deafness. Connexin 26 also plays a role in tumor suppression through mediation of the cell cycle. The abnormal expression of Cx26, correlated with several types of human cancers, may serve as a prognostic factor for cancers such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer. Furthermore, Cx26 over- expression is suggested to promote cancer development by facilitating cell migration and invasion and by stimulating the self-perpetuation ability of cancer stem cells.  Function  Gap junctions were first characterized by electron microscopy as regionally specialized structures on plasma membranes of contacting adherent cells. These structures were shown to consist of cell- to-cell channels. Proteins, called connexins, purified from fractions of enriched gap junctions from different tissues differ. The connexins are designated by their molecular mass. Another system of nomenclature divides gap junction proteins into two categories, alpha and beta, according to sequence similarities at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. For example, CX43 (GJA1) is designated alpha-1 gap junction protein, whereas GJB1 (CX32), and GJB2 (CX26; this protein) are called beta-1 and beta-2 gap junction proteins, respectively. This nomenclature emphasizes that GJB1 and GJB2 are more homologous to each other than either of them is to gap junction protein, alpha GJA1.

In 2013, Gallo re-created the band's original tour truck and customized a flatbed-turned-stage where Phish performed \\"in the round\\" in the world's most famous arena. In 2016, Gallo returned to Madison Square Garden with the band as creative director of a 25-minute gag featuring a cast of 17, floating umbrellas on nano winches, an astonishing rain effect, and a maelstrom of \\"raining\\" inflatable cats and dogs and customized foam raindrops. In 2017, he filled the Garden with \\"an ocean of light and love\\" with performing riggers operating a rotating mast of sails amid an audience twinkling with LED wristbands. The following year, he directed ten aerialists in nets with ten specialty \\"Phish droid\\" moving colored fog and light machines, that appeared to blast the performers with spray paint and fire. Afterwards, two of the band members \\"flew\\" in the air while playing, and a large cast danced in inflatable alien costumes and flung air freshener-covered inflatables into the audience. Since 2014, Gallo has been production designer of the children's television show, Sesame Street. His redesign of the classic set garnered him significant press attention and the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Art Direction/Set Decoration/Scenic Design in 2017 and 2018 as well as the 2019 Art Director's Guild Award for best production design of a multi-camera series. Often credited with a whimsical style, many of Gallo's projects have been centered on children and family entertainment. Gallo designed the 135th Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and served as the production designer for many youth-oriented live productions including Yo Gabba Gabba!; Madagascar; Super Why; Blue's Clues; Dora the Explorer; Go, Diego, Go!; Clifford the Big Red Dog; SpongeBob SquarePants; and various projects for Nickelodeon. He designed the popular Christmas television special Elmo's Christmas Countdown for Sesame Street and was honored by the Jim Henson Company with a true Muppet crafted in his likeness. Gallo designed the 2010 Broadway Cares Collection Official Snow Globe to benefit Broadway Cares/Equity Fights Aids Fund. He has served as creative consultant for Live Design's Scenic Design Master Class and as performing arts/design contributing editor at Stated Magazine. In 2000, Gallo's body of work was chosen to represent innovative contemporary American set design in the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum inaugural National Design Triennial. His paintings for the 1997 Broadway revival of A View from the Bridge are in the Smithsonian Institution archives and the payphone he designed and painted for Jitney is on display in the August Wilson section of the National Museum of African American History & Culture. The hot dog he flew around Madison Square Garden with Phish in it is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Gallo's designs were featured in the 2003 Prague Quadrennial, and many can be found in the permanent collection of the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas as well as in assorted public and private collections.

It was established by the Selangor state government in 1987 and has been managed by the Malaysian Nature Society who have proposed that it be declared a wetland of international importance.Grace Chen. 2018. 'Kuala Selangor out to get Ramsar listing for wetlands'. The Star (Malaysia), 26 October.Man-made lake With a total area of , the park is a combination of secondary forest and wetland with a man-made coastal bund separating the wetland from the forest. Inside the park itself is a large pond surrounded by another bund. A water lock connecting the pond with the river controls the water level of the pond. The park, as part of the Selangor River estuary, is home to a number of large bird species such as milky storks and herons as well as primates, namely silver leaf monkeys and long-tailed macaques. The area was a breeding ground of an endangered milky stork species before the program was suspended. An abandoned aviary still stands in the middle of the park. History There were mangrove virgin forest in Kuala Selangor until the 1940s. However, the land was cleared to make salt plans from 1965 to the 1970s. Furthermore, in 1986, the land clearing started to create a marina, prawn farm and golf course. Sand dredging for the project killed wide range of mangrove forest, and the existing secondary forest was created since then. For these reasons, Malayan Nature Society (now the Malaysian Nature Society) and the Asian Wetlands Bureau (now Wetlands International) made a petition to the government of Selangor state, and the land was established as a park by the government on 27 September 1987. Endangered silvered-leaf monkey was adopted as a logo mark of the park. After that, the park have been managed by Malaysian Nature Society under a cooperative arrangement with the Selangor state government. It became the first park to be managed by a NGO in Malaysia. In 1997, Kuala Selangor Nature Park was recognised as a nature reserve for conservation and ecotourism, and recognised as Important Bird Area (IBA) by Birdlife International.Malaysian Nature Society (2010).

It is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  History  =Early history= Montague Electric Bi-Frame from the early 1990s. Montague Corporation was formed in 1987 by David and Harry Montague. Prior to the foundation of Montague Bikes, Washington-based architect Harry Montague began making plans to build a full-size folding bicycle that could accommodate his 6'2\\" frame. He started sketching designs for the bike in the early 1980s and had a prototype (the \\"BiFrame\\") by 1984. The BiFrame used the \\"Concentrus\\" system, which unites the two parts of the frame with concentric seat tubes, one nested inside the other. Montague BMW Olympic Bike from 1996. Montague obtained a patent for the bike design and the Concentrus system by 1987. That year, his son David Montague, used his father's folding bike as a potential business model for an entrepreneurship project while attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). With $300,000 in capital, the two launched and incorporated their folding bicycle company as Montague Corporation in Massachusetts later in 1987. =1988-1996 BiFrame design and BMW partnership= The company began selling in the U.S. market in 1988. It also sold bikes in Canada, Europe, Japan, and in Great Britain through a joint marketing deal with the Raleigh Bicycle Company. In 1989, Montague sold around 2,200 BiFrames worldwide. While producing the BiFrame design, Montague worked closely with the Schwinn Bicycle Company, and in 1991 the Schwinn Montague M1000 was first marketed and sold through Schwinn dealers. Beginning in 1992, Montague began producing a line of folding mountain bikes in a partnership with the car company BMW. The bikes were initially sold in Germany and came to American BMW dealerships in 1994. The Montague BMW BiFrame was chosen as the official mountain bike of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia and was also featured in the closing ceremonies. Popular Mechanics honored the company with a Design & Engineering Award for its design of the special BMW Olympics Games mountain bike. Other folding bike models Montague developed in the 1990s included the TriFrame tandem bicycle and the Montague Backcountry mountain bike. =1997-2009 DARPA, Paratrooper and X-Series= Picture of a Montague Paratrooper bike in Afghanistan. In 1997, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) gave Montague a two-year grant to develop an all- terrain, heavy-duty, folding electric mountain bike that could be utilized by paratroopers. With this grant, the company created the Tactical Electric No Signature (TENS) mountain bike which was equipped with a battery-powered motor that was largely undetectable by ear, radar, or infrared devices. The bikes, which had a new \\"X-Frame\\" design, were used by U.S. military members in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Montague Hummer Bike next to Hummer H2. The first civilian bikes using the new X-Frame design (dubbed the \\"X-Series\\") were introduced in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The first two bikes in the X-Series were the Montague CX 21-speed Comfort Bike and the Montague MX 24-speed Mountain Bike. In 2001, the company released the Paratrooper military mountain bike, which was a commercial, non-electric version of the TENS bike it had developed for DARPA. In the early 2000s, Montague developed a promotional bicycle, dubbed the \\"Hummer Tactical Mountain Bike,\\" for General Motors' Hummer line of vehicles. Promotional distribution of Montague-designed Hummer bicycles took place through GM dealerships. In 2008, Montague introduced the SwissBike line which featured the company's first mountain bikes designed for road use, including the SwissBike LX and SwissBike TX Commuter. By 2009, Montague bikes were being sold in 18 countries with 400 dealers in the United States. =2010 to present= Montague FIT open and folded composite. The company continued developing pavement-specific bikes into 2010 and beyond. The pavement versions were the first Montague bikes to feature 700c road wheels and a new double top tube design. In 2011, Montague added to its Pavement bike line with the Boston 8, the first folding bike to incorporate the Shimano Nexus 8 speed internal-gear hub. Montague also continued releasing new iterations of their Paratrooper line with the Paratrooper Pro in 2012. The following year, the company started selling framesets as standalone products, allowing manufacturers and hobbyists to incorporate Montague folding frames into their models. In 2015, Montague helped institute the \\"Park & Pedal\\" program in the Boston area. The program encourages commuters to drive part of the way to work, park in one of several designated lots outside the city center, and ride their bikes for the remainder of the commute. It was originally devised by founder David Montague and was implemented in conjunction with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation and the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. The program was expanded to more locales in the Greater Boston area in 2016. Montague introduced a new folding system called \\"DirectConnect\\" in 2016. It allows a bike to be folded using one release on the wheel and one lever on the bike's frame. The company also partnered with Shapeways to 3D print aluminum prototype components for its bicycles for the first time. It also launched several new models in 2016 including the Urban, Paratrooper Elite, FIT, and Allston, the first to employ a belt drive in place of a traditional bicycle chain.  Products  Closeup of DirectConnect Latch System. Current Montague bike models use the patented DirectConnect folding system, and are equipped with full-size 26\\", 27.5\\", or 700c wheels. When folded, the bikes measure approximately 36\\" x 28\\" x 12\\". Montague has pavement-specific models that utilize 700c wheels, including: Boston, Allston, Crosstown, Urban, Navigator, and FIT. Some models (including the Navigator, Allston, and FIT) are equipped with Montague's \\"RackStand\\" which serves as both a rear rack and a potential kick stand when released from the seat tube. Montague also produces the Paratrooper line of folding mountain bikes that utilize either 26\\" or 27.5\\" wheels. Included in the Paratrooper line are the Paratrooper, Paratrooper Highline, Paratrooper Express, and Paratrooper Elite. Some Paratrooper models, including the Highline and Elite, utilize RockShox suspension systems. The company also offers electric pedal assist models, including the E-Crosstown. Several bike models use an Octagon adjustable steering assembly that allows the handlebar to be adjusted in height without the use of tools. Most Montague bikes also utilize a Shimano drivetrain. The Allston model is equipped with a Gates carbon belt drive and a Shimano Alfine internally geared hub rather than a traditional bike chain and hub gear setup.

Main characters =Ned= Ned (Lee Pace) is a 29-year-old pie maker with a unique magical ability to be able to bring back to life anyone or anything that is dead. He owns his own pie restaurant, called The Pie Hole, and also uses his gift to aid Emerson Cod, a private investigator, by bringing dead people back to life to find out how they died, though they can only stay alive for one minute before something else must die in their place. Ned had a childhood crush on his neighbour, Charlotte \\"Chuck\\" Charles. The two shared a first kiss at the neighboring funerals of Chuck's father and Ned's mother, but the two lost touch immediately afterwards when Ned was sent away to boarding school by his father. Twenty years later, Ned learns of an unaccompanied female tourist, dubbed the \\"lonely tourist\\", murdered on a cruise ship, and soon discovers that the woman is his long-lost love. He revives Chuck at the funeral home to ask her who killed her, but cannot bring himself to re-dead her when her minute of life is up, allowing her to live instead (and inadvertently causing the larcenous funeral director to die in her place.) Chuck and Ned soon develop strong feelings for each other and begin a relationship; however, they cannot touch at all, as doing so would kill Chuck. However, Ned and Chuck find other ways to express affection: they kiss each other while encased in body bags and while holding a sheet of plastic wrap between their lips. The character of Ned as a nine-year-old is played by Field Cate. =Charlotte \\"Chuck\\" Charles= Charlotte Charles (Anna Friel), usually called Chuck, is Ned's childhood neighbor and boyhood crush. Raised by her two agoraphobic aunts, Chuck is murdered on a cruise ship under mysterious circumstances. Ned brings her back to life, but his feelings for her prevent him from rescinding the usually-temporary resurrection; the two enter a renewed relationship with each other, although Ned has to be very careful not to touch her again. She has a wealth of information on odd and uncommon topics due to reading a large variety of books while growing up in a relatively repressed environment. She can also speak various languages such as French, German, Swedish, Chinese and Japanese. She is an avid beekeeping enthusiast. She has a kind, free-spirited nature which contrasts Ned's more aloof demeanor. When Olive Snook went to the convent, Chuck moved into Olive's apartment, which neighbors Ned's, to work on developing her own life after her resurrection. She later becomes Olive's roommate after Olive returned from the convent, also revealing that Chuck's aunt Lily was actually her mother. Eight- year-old Charlotte is played by actress Sammi Hanratty. =Emerson Cod= Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) is the private detective who enlists the help of the pie-maker in solving murder cases. He is also an avid knitter and knits in stressful circumstances. In the final episode of the first season, it is revealed that Emerson has a daughter whom he has not seen in 7 years. To this end, he authors a pop-up book entitled Lil' Gumshoe designed to help her find her way home. After several publisher rejections and sharp criticism from his mother, Emerson rewrites it and is finally accepted for publication. He is reunited with his former lover, Lila Robinson who makes a deal with him: to help her get the police off her back or he'll never see his daughter, Penny again. Emerson agrees and keeps this deal, but only seeing her briefly as a car drives away. In the second season, Emerson is in a relationship with Simone Hundin. In the series finale, Emerson is reunited with his daughter after she reads Lil' Gumshoe. Young Emerson is played by Steven Wash Jr. =Narrator= The narrator (voiced by Jim Dale) is an omniscient voice who narrates the series, commonly beginning the expositions about case information with the phrase \\"The facts were these\\". The voice also lists any measurement of time (people's ages, intervals since a particular event, or how long ago something happened) to the minute. =Lily and Vivian Charles= Lily (Swoosie Kurtz) and Vivian Charles (Ellen Greene) are Charlotte's aunts and only living family. In their teen years the two sisters were an internationally famous synchronized swimming duo called the \\"Darling Mermaid Darlings.\\" They adopted their surname in adulthood when their mother married Charles's father.\\"Bad Habits\\" Both sisters were also romantically linked to Charles. Vivian was engaged to him, while Lily had an affair with him and accidentally got pregnant with Charlotte. To keep the secret of the affair and her pregnancy from Vivian, Lily secretly lived at a convent, telling Vivian she was in France. Charlotte was raised to believe that Lily was only her step-aunt, and that her mother was a woman named Susan who died in childbirth. Vivian did know that Charles had cheated on her, but not with Lily. They gave up their swimming career after Lily lost sight in her right eye while cleaning a litter box. They gradually became shut-ins. After Charles Charles's death, they became Charlotte's guardians. As their social phobias progressed, Charlotte stayed at home in order to take care of them, while making feeble attempts to get them to go outside. After Charlotte's murder, Lily and Vivian struggle to live on their own. After Charlotte is revived, she is unable to see Lily and Vivian, because Ned doesn't want his secret gift known. Charlotte, however, still continues to care for them by sending pies from The Pie Hole with mood enhancers baked into the crust. Her ultimate goal is to inspire Lily and Vivian to overcome their social phobias and restart their synchronized swimming careers. Lily and Vivian become close friends with Olive Snook, who delivers the pies to their Coeur d'Coeur address, which is outside the regular delivery zone. The sisters are also acquainted with Ned and Emerson, who pay them occasional visits. Both sisters are agoraphobic, bird lovers, and connoisseurs of fine cheese. They also suffer from separation anxiety, as demonstrated in their unusual practice of stuffing their pet birds after they die. Vivian also confesses to Ned that she sometimes puts pillows in Charlotte's bed and pretends she is sleeping. Their personalities also significantly contrast, with Vivian being the hopeful, albeit naive sister, while Lily is the perpetual pessimist and is more confrontational. Lily suffers from severe coulrophobia (fear of clowns) and is a heavy drinker. Their names also reference their personalities as well as the life and death theme of the series: \\"Vivian\\" meaning \\"alive\\", while \\"Lily\\" references the flower often associated with funerals. =Olive Snook= Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth) is the waitress at Ned's restaurant and his next-door neighbor. She is romantically interested in Ned but is often thwarted from pursuing her interest, due at first to the piemaker's social aversion and later to Chuck \\"faking her own death\\" and coming out of nowhere. She developed a relationship with Chuck's aunts when she began delivering pies to them, but has not told them of Chuck's continued presence to avoid hurting them. But when she was fed another secret, that of Lily being Chuck's mother, she felt too much pressure to keep all of the secrets, so she quit her job at the Pie Hole and Lily transferred her to a nunnery. However, soon after the murder of one of the nuns, she returned to the Pie Hole, bringing the nunnery's truffle-hunting sow, Pigby. Before working at the Pie Hole she used to be a jockey, where one case saw her as the target for a serial killer. Olive becomes particularly close to Emerson over the course of several adventures, who is fond of her energetic personality and shares her feelings of being an outsider when around Ned and Chuck. Because of Olive's diminutive stature, Emerson takes to affectionately calling her, \\"Itty Bitty.\\" In the series finale, Olive Snook opens a restaurant dedicated to making Macaroni and Cheese. When she is faced with a \\"relationship\\" problem with Ned, she breaks into song. The first time she sings in the series is in the episode \\"Dummy,\\" she sings \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You,\\" from Grease. The narrator introduced her singing as follows: \\"Olive often imagined there was an orchestra in her heart. Music heard only by her except when her heart broke open and it spilled out into the world.\\" In the end, Olive begins a relationship with a taxidermist named Randy Mann. Nine-year-old Olive is played by Samantha Bailey in \\"Bad Habits\\" and Ellery Sprayberry in \\"Window Dressed to Kill.\\" Kristin Chenoweth won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Olive Snook. =Digby= Digby is Ned's Golden Retriever, who was hit by an 18-wheeler truck and subsequently becomes the first creature that the young Ned brings back to life. The fact that Digby is still alive and well twenty years later would seem to suggest that the resurrection suspends the aging process, but this has yet to be confirmed (however, there may be a slight possibility that any corpse revived by Ned will continue to live so long as he does not touch them again). The pie maker pets Digby with a fake arm, because if he were to touch Digby again, Digby would be dead forever. The dog is intelligent enough to understand this, and avoids touching Ned himself. Digby also spends a significant amount of his time with Olive. Digby is played by two dogs, Orbit and Orion. Recurring characters =The Coroner= The Coroner (Sy Richardson) works at the City Morgue where Ned, Emerson, and Chuck inspect (and secretly interrogate) dead bodies. He is often suspicious of all three of them and voices it by simply saying, \\"Mmmmmm-hmmmm.\\" He has started hitting up Emerson for bribe money to keep quiet about his inspections. Emerson reluctantly pays him, but only because he believes it's simply for business. Series creator Bryan Fuller planned a slow reveal of the coroner's homosexuality and his crush on Emerson Cod (Chi McBride). =Alfredo Aldarisio= Alfredo Aldarisio (Raúl Esparza) is a homeopathic salesman who has a fear that Earth's atmosphere could be sucked away from space and treats himself with his own herbal wares. He secretly admires Olive Snook and gave Chuck a sample pack of antidepressants. Olive also secretly admires him, even though she still longs for the Pie Maker, but she has not yet had a chance to tell him this due to his going away on a trip. =Oscar Vibenius= Oscar Vibenius (Paul Reubens) is an olfactory expert who works for the Department of Water and Power. He was almost framed by his former partner, Napoleon LeNez, for attempting to kill him, when in fact LeNez was staging his own attempts to try to publicize his latest book. He becomes intrigued with Chuck after noticing something slightly different in her scent, and he stole her mother's sweater to further investigate his suspicions. In \\"Corpsicle\\", Chuck gave him a sample of her hair so that he could continue his investigation into her scent, but he returned it to her without testing it in an effort to gain her trust. Beforehand, he had also shaved Digby's behind, as he was also interested in his peculiar scent. =Simone Hundin= Simone Hundin (Christine Adams) is a dog breeder whose husband was murdered in \\"Bitches\\". During the investigation- which was complicated as the victim mentioned he was killed by his wife in his last minute 'alive' before revealing that he was a polygamist- she and Emerson became romantically interested in one another, but nothing became of it. Later on, during an investigation in \\"Dim Sum, Lose Some\\", the two of them run into each other and become involved. However, Emerson is frightened by the degree of control she has over him, and tries to avoid her. Simone gets angry, and tells him off (and indirectly solves the case). Impressed on how she had opened up, Emerson apologized to Simone, and the two of them got back together. She appeared again in \\"Water and Power\\" where she and Emerson Cod are in a relationship. =Dwight Dixon= Dwight Dixon (Stephen Root) was a friend of Charles Charles's and Ned's father's from the army. He shows up at the Pie Hole after being released from prison, searching for Ned's father. Ned is reluctant to help him, but gives him his father's last known address. It is later revealed that Dwight's intentions are much more sinister than simply a visit, as he is seen brandishing a gun outside of Maurice and Ralston's house. He appears at Lily and Vivian's house soon after, where he reveals to Lily that he knows her secret. He uses Vivian's infatuation with him to find out where a pocket watch that belonged to Charles is, only to find out that they buried the watch with his daughter. He digs up Chuck's grave, finding the casket empty. While dating Vivian in order to obtain more information about the watch, he discovers Chuck is still alive. He breaks into her apartment and steals the watch. Lily, however, finds the watch while in his hotel room and takes it, and Dwight is led to believe that Chuck took back the watch herself. Ultimately he is found dead in the cemetery when attempting to kill Chuck for the watch, a victim of proximity after Ned revived Charles Charles and Chuck kept him alive for more than a minute. =Maurice and Ralston= Maurice and Ralston (Alex and Graham Miller (adults), Conner and Keenan Merkovich (Age 12), Jason and Kristopher Simmons (Age 5)) are the half-brothers of Ned. When Ned runs away from boarding school and returns home, he finds that his father has remarried and had two sons. Ned goes back to school, never to see his father again. Ralston, Maurice and Ned's father leaves the twins as well and never returns. Maurice and Ralston's mother went into another relationship, leaving the twins with the house. As an adult, Olive and Chuck learn that Ned has family he never attempted to connect with, and he is \\"reunited\\" with them. He later helps them solve the murder of the Great Herrmann, the magician who took on the role of a father figure to the boys after their real father abandoned them at one of his magic shows. They both are magicians. =Ned's mother= Ned's mother (Tina Gloss Finnell) appears only in flashbacks. She died from a brain aneurysm while baking a pie for Ned in the kitchen of their home. Ned brought her back to life for more than one minute and as a consequence, accidentally killed Chuck's father, Charles Charles. That night, Ned's Mother tucked him into his bed and gave him a goodnight kiss, one that ended up being her very last. This is how Ned learned the rules of his powers: First touch, life, second touch, dead again-- forever. =Ned's father= After his mother died, Ned's father (Jon Eric Price in all other episodes, a stand-in in \\"Bzzzzzzz!\\") sent him away to the Longborough School for Boys in the town of North Thrush. His parting words to him were \\"I'll be back\\". This would turn out to be a lie as one Halloween, Ned got a postcard that said he moved away from his house. So that night, Ned went to the new house to find his father with a new wife and two new twin boys, Maurice and Ralston. Since Ned was dressed up as a ghost, his father did not recognize him, so he gave him a Honeycomb Chew and wished him a happy Halloween. He later abandoned Maurice and Ralston as well after participating in a disappearing act at a magic show and simply not reappearing. According to Lily, Ned's Father was a \\"jackass...who did us all a favor [by leaving].\\"In The Norwegians\\", he was spotted at the Pie Hole, portrayed by George Hamilton, though Ned failed to see him. He is also implied to be the masked man who saves Ned and Olive's lives in the same episode, as well as having set up a faked chain of evidence so that a group of Norwegian detectives would believe that Dwight Dixon had died of natural causes rather than draw attention to his demise as a result of Ned's gift, suggesting that he is aware of his son's ability. =Calista Cod= Calista Cod (Debra Mooney and Amelia Borella, Amelia plays young Calista). She has only appeared in one episode called \\"Frescorts.\\" She is Emerson's Mom/Best Friend (As explained by Emerson). =Charles Charles= Charles Charles is the father of Lonely Tourist Charlotte Charles who is found dead while watering his lawn. His death is due to Ned keeping his mother alive for over a minute, and he is the life who died in her place. Ned decided to revive him to press for more information on Dwight Dixon. When he did, Chuck kept him alive by tricking Ned to touch his gloved hand and he is hidden in Ned's old house. Charles decided to leave town when he did not get along with Ned. Charles was played by a stand-in in the \\"Pie-lette\\", and was played by Josh Randall in \\"Comfort Food\\" and \\"The Legend of Merle McQuoddy\\". =Pigby= Pigby (played by \\"Fiona\\") is a pot-bellied sow whom Olive befriends at the nunnery. She often hunts for truffles with Olive and once unintentionally killed Olive's best friend there. When Olive returns home, she got to take Pigby with her. Pigby's name rhymes with the name of Ned's golden retriever, Digby. =Other characters= Other recurring roles include Eugene Mulchandani and Ingmar, who are classmates of Ned in the boarding school, are seen in flashbacks at the beginning of every episode. Other minor recurring roles are the unnamed delivery boy and the news anchor, played by Leyna Nguyen.

Holmes (disambiguation). Holmes v. United States, 391 U.S. 936 (1968), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States denied a petition for writ of certiorari to a Jehovah's Witnesses minister who asked the Court to decide whether a draft of men into the Armed Forces in times of peace is constitutionally permissible.. The minister argued that, in the absence of a declaration of war, a draft was not authorized and was equivalent to involuntary servitude. Facts of the case Albert H. Holmes was classified in August 1965 as a conscientious objector by his Selective Service Appeal Board. Section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1948 stated that a conscientious objector who, like petitioner, is also opposed to noncombatant military service, may in lieu of induction 'be ordered by his local board ... to perform ... such civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest as the local board may deem appropriate. ...' Beginning in October 1965 Holmes exchanged a series of letters with his local board in which the Board explained to Holmes the types of civilian work available and Holmes asserted his religious scruples against serving the United States Government in any capacity, including civilian work programs. Holmes reiterated this position in a personal meeting with his local board. On February 7, 1966, the Board sent Holmes an order to report on February 21 to an Illinois state hospital for civilian work assignment. However, on the day he was due to report, Holmes notified the Board that he refused to do so for religious reasons. Prior history Holmes was charged with willful failure to report as ordered, in violation of 12(a) of the Selective Service Act. At his nonjury trial Holmes moved for judgment of acquittal. That motion was denied, Holmes was convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting.United States v.

Munyeshyaka was pursued in the French courts but in October 2015 the case was not continued because of the quality of the evidence. Despite the controversy and his Rwandan conviction he has been employed as a priest in France since 2001. History Munyeshyaka was born on 30 July 1958 in Butare Province, Rwanda. His mother, Félicité Mukarukaka, was a Tutsi and his father, Gabriel Ngiruwonsanga, was a Hutu. He was born in the Rwandan commune of Ngoma in Butare prefecture.Wenceslas Munyeshyaka, Trial-CH, Retrieved 2 March 2016 Munyeshyaka was responsible for the Sainte-Famille church and parish in Kigali. A military tribunal in Rwanda found him guilty of rape and involvement in the 1994 genocide and sentenced him in absentia to life in prison. He was found to have delivered hundreds of adults and children to the genocidal militias, which brutally slaughtered them. The military tribunal found Munyeshyaka guilty of rape and of aiding militias in the killing of hundreds of Tutsi refugees at the Holy Family Cathedral in downtown Kigali, where he was head priest. In October 2015 the French government expressed disappointment that the French courts had decided to not progress the case further against Munyeshyaka. The Catholic church has employed him as a priest in Gisors, France and the Epte Valley since 2001.

Background A Portsmouth, New Hampshire municipal ordinance provided that \\"No theatrical or dramatic representation shall be performed or exhibited and no parade or procession upon any public street or way, and no open air public meeting upon any ground abutting thereon shall be permitted unless a license therefor shall first be obtained from the City Council.\\" The New Hampshire Supreme Court had construed the discretion vested in the city council as \\"limited in its exercise by the bounds of reason, in uniformity of method of treatment upon the facts of each application, free from improper or inappropriate considerations and from unfair discrimination.\\" Thus, the discretion of the official was ministerial. The City could \\"take one of its small parks and devote it to public and nonreligious purposes under a system which is administered fairly and without bias or discrimination.\\" In fact, the City of Portsmouth denied all religious groups the privilege of using the park for religious services. The Jehovah's Witnesses, who applied for a permit and were arbitrarily denied, nevertheless chose to hold a religious meeting in the public park. The preacher was arrested. They argued, as they had done on dozens of cases previously, that the arbitrary action of the city council was a defense to their \\"illegal\\" holding of the religious meeting. Decision of the Court The Court ruled in favor of the City, deciding that because no appeal to the denial was made, despite ample opportunity, punishment under the law was constitutional. Justice Reed delivered the opinion of the Court. =Dissenting opinions= Justice Douglas' approach to Free Exercise/Speech in this case was first articulated nearly a decade earlier in Murdock v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.. He speaks of the \\"preferred position\\" granted freedom of speech, religion, press and assembly by the First Amendment. \\"The case is therefore quite different from a legislative program in the field of business, labor, housing and the like where regulation is permissible.\\" He quoted with approval Justice Roberts' opinion in Cantwell v. Connecticut. to the effect that even if there was an available remedy (such as mandamus) for abuses in the system of licensing, it still leaves in its place a system of prior restraint that was arbitrarily exercised. Douglas was quite adamant: \\"There is no free speech in the sense of the Constitution when permission must be obtained from an official before a speech can be made.\\" Thus, for him, the case was an example of prior restraint of a privileged freedom, a freedom that could be exercised with impunity if it was improperly curtailed by civic officials.

Brown was a partner in the so-called 'Bank of the Four Johns' that was established in Ann Street in the town in 1787. Other families associated with the original Merville estate would include Blair, Rowan, Coey, McKee, Robinson and Todd. From 1952-58 Merville House was the meeting place of the Belfast Rural District Council, forerunner of Newtownabbey Urban District Council, Newtownabbey Urban Council and latterly Newtownabbey Borough Council. Between 1947-49, the grounds of Merville were re-developed by Belfast builder Thomas Arlow McGrath of Ulster Garden Villages to create Merville Garden Village, a French style housing development consisting of 156 detached and semi-detached houses, 28 cottage flats, 256 apartments, in addition to a row of shops at its entrance and a number of lock-up garages. Merville House was retained as the centre piece of its layout and which takes its name. It was E. Prentice Mawson (1885-1954), a leading English architect and graduate of the School of Fine Arts in Paris, who was the consultant architect of the new Garden Village project, the first to be constructed in Northern Ireland. Other Garden Villages were constructed that became Abbots Cross and Fernagh, both located near Merville, Whitehead, north of Carrickfergus, and in the grounds of Ballycraigy House in the townland of Muckamore on the edge of Antrim town. In June 1995 Merville Garden Village was awarded Conservation Area status by the Department of the Environment of Northern Ireland because of its unique architectural and landscape design. Today Merville Garden Village is still the sole holder of the title within the borough of Newtownabbey and is second in a North Belfast context after the leafy Somerton Road which boasts many Victorian houses. Merville House has undergone a £1.2m renovation and is now an important part of local Newtownabbey community life. Officially re-opened on 27 April 2006 by the prominent Belfast community activist Baroness Blood, the restoration project was undertaken via Merville House Limited, a company set up in 2001 by the Merville Residents' Association, one of the oldest residents groups in Northern Ireland, to formally garner funding from North Belfast Local Strategy Partnership, Newtownabbey Local Strategy Partnership, Newtownabbey Borough Council, International Fund for Ireland and Ulster Garden Villages Limited, as well as from other sources.  History of Merville House  To reflect the history of the original Merville estate, the principal rooms in the house are named after some of the families that have an affiliation with the estate. These families are: Donegall Suite Sir Arthur Chichester (1739–99), the 5th Earl of Donegall and 1st Marquis of Donegall. He was created Baron Fisherwick in the peerage of Great Britain in 1790 and Baron of Belfast and marquis of Donegall in the peerage of Ireland the following year. Previous inference has suggested that he probably built Merville as a bolthole for contemplation and leisurely pursuits. But the actual reason why a room at Merville House is named after a member of the Donegall dynasty is because Chichester was the lawful possessor of the townland of Drumnadrough where Merville stands, as well as all of the neighbouring townlands that established the former civil parish of Coole or Carnmoney. His ancestor, Sir Arthur Chichester (1536-1625), was given the lands by King James I in May 1604 during the period of Irish History that became known as the Plantation of Ulster. The current incumbent of the title, (Arthur) Patrick Chichester (b. 1952), the 8th Marquis of Donegall, the son of Dermot Chichester LVO (1916-2007). Rowan Room Soldier-turned-Resident Magistrate, Lt. Col. John Rowan (1778-1855), High Sheriff of County Antrim in 1814, come to live at Merville in 1823 after he married Dorothea Blair, the widow of the residence's previous owner, James Blair (1756-1820) of Newry, who died at Merville in November 1820. Throughout the 1830s and 1840s Major Rowan presided over proceedings at the weekly Petty Sessions Court within the village of Whitehouse and at Carrickfergus. Merville was in the permanent status of Dorothea since 1800 until the estate was sold to the future Sir Edward Coey in October 1849. John Rowan was the eldest brother of Sir Charles Rowan KCB (1783-1852), the joint founding Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police. The Rowans originated from Ballymoney, County Antrim. Coey Room Wealthy provision merchant Sir Edward Coey (1805–87) is almost certainly the most illustrious of all owners of the Merville estate in regard to his wealth and standing in Victorian Ulster. Responsible for introducing cured ham to Ireland from the United States in the mid-1830s, Coey went on to be elected the first and only Liberal Party Mayor of Belfast in December 1860. He was also conferred High Sheriff of Belfast and Deputy Lieutenant of County Antrim. He died at Merville in June 1887 aged 82. After his death, his nephew, also called Edward Coey (1847-1923), inherited Merville and its demesne. Taken as a whole, Merville was in the possession of the Coey lineage from 1849 to 1924. In November 2006, however, the Ulster History Circle, the heritage organisation officially recognised as the manager of Blue Plaques in Northern Ireland, erected a plaque on the front elevation of the House in recognition of Sir Edward Coey's notable charity work. Robinson Room The distinguished Frederick Charles Gunning Robinson (1872-1934) worked for many years in the family pork processing business of A.T. Robinson of Shankill Road, west Belfast, before establishing his own provision merchants in 1905 under the trade name Fred C. Robinson Ltd after dropping Gunning from his full name. Operating from their premises at York Street, Belfast the business specialised in 'Ham and Rolled Bacon.' Fred C. Robinson died in England in 1934 aged 62. After his death his eldest descendant, Arthur Robsinson (1900–93), took over the running of the family business and managing the Merville estate on behalf of his widow, Isabella. The last surviving member of the Robinson family to have lived at Merville is Fred C. Robinson's youngest daughter Joan, who resides at Newtownards, Co. Down, Northern Ireland. During the Second World War the house and grounds were used as part of the British 'war effort' as Northern Ireland was strategically important to Great Britain, as well as acting as a lookout in support of the Atlantic convoys into Great Britain from the United States of America.  The neighborhood of Whitehouse  The neighbourhood of Whitehouse, where Merville Garden Village is located, has changed dramatically since the 1970s. Part of Whitehouse today is one of Northern Ireland's retail developments that includes the Abbeycentre, TESCO, Marks & Spencer, amongst other high street stores, as well as a sports centre, Valley Leisure Centre built by Newtownabbey Borough Council in 1977.

Originally designed as a module for the Apache HTTP Server, it has evolved to provide an array of Hypertext Transfer Protocol request and response filtering capabilities along with other security features across a number of different platforms including Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS and Nginx. It is a free software released under the Apache license 2.0. The platform provides a rule configuration language known as 'SecRules' for real- time monitoring, logging, and filtering of Hypertext Transfer Protocol communications based on user-defined rules. Although not its only configuration, ModSecurity is most commonly deployed to provide protections against generic classes of vulnerabilities using the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS). This is an open-source set of rules written in ModSecurity's SecRules language. The project is part of OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project. Several other rule sets are also available. To detect threats, the ModSecurity engine is deployed embedded within the webserver or as a proxy server in front of a web application. This allows the engine to scan incoming and outgoing HTTP communications to the endpoint. Dependent on the rule configuration the engine will decide how communications should be handled which includes the capability to pass, drop, redirect, return a given status code, execute a user script, and more.  History  ModSecurity was first developed by Ivan Ristić, who wrote the module with the end goal of monitoring application traffic on the Apache HTTP Server. The first version was released in November 2002 which supported Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x. Starting in 2004 Ivan created Thinking Stone to continue work on the project full-time. While working on the version 2.0 rewrite Thinking Stone was bought by Breach Security, an American-Israeli security company, in September 2006. Ivan stayed on continuing development of version 2.0 which was subsequently released in summer 2006. Ristić and Breach Security released another major rewrite, version 2.5, with major syntactic changes in February 2008. In 2009 Ivan left Breach to found SSL Labs. Shortly after Ivan's departure from Breach Security, Trustwave Holdings acquired Breach in June 2010 and relicensed ModSecurity under the Apache license. Development continued and the new license allowed easier integration of ModSecurity into other products. As a result of this there was steady adoption of ModSecurity by various commercial products. The license change also precipitated easier porting of the software. Hence, Microsoft contributed an IIS port in August 2012 and the port for Nginx was released at Black Hat Briefings in 2012. 2017 saw the second edition of the handbook released, written by Christian Folini and Ivan Ristić. It covers ModSecurity up to version 2.9.2. Being originally an Apache module, porting ModSecurity to other platforms was time consuming and had high maintenance costs. As a result of this a complete rewrite was started in December 2015. This new iteration, libmodsecurity, changes the underlying architecture, separating ModSecurity into a standalone engine that communicates with the web server via an API. This modular architecture based WAF, which was announced for public use in January 2018, became libmodsecurity (ModSecurity version 3.0) and has supported connectors for Nginx and Apache.  Former Lynx browser blocking  The default rules shipped with most ModSecurity distributions are the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS). These rules used to block the Lynx browser as an \\"automated tool\\", returning a \\"406 Not Acceptable\\" to it unless its user-agent string was changed. This blog must be incorrect to say the motivation for the Lynx block was to stop the web server running a \\"Linux command\\", since the command to invoke Lynx does not start with a capital L as does the default user-agent string (and the block is case-sensitive). This inconvenienced users with blindness who work in Lynx. However, with the release of Core Rule Set 3.0 (CRS3), a Lynx user agent does not trigger any rules anymore.

Life Filipe de Magalhães was born in Azeitão, Portugal, in 1571. He studied music at the Cathedral of Évora with Manuel Mendes where he was a colleague of the equally renowned polyphonists Duarte Lobo and Manuel Cardoso. He was apparently considered by his master Manuel Mendes as his favourite student; the latter left his own manuscripts to Magalhães, in the hope that these would be eventually published. In 1589 Magalhães replaced Manuel Mendes as mestre do Claustro da Sé. Later, he went to Lisbon to become a member of the Capela Real (Royal Chapel's) choir and then mestre de Capela da Misericórdia. On the 27th of March 1623 he was appointed Mestre da Capela Real, a position he held until 1641. While at Évora, he was the teacher of Estêvão Lopes Morago, Estêvão de Brito and Manuel Correia, who carried on with the music school of the Cathedral of Évora in the 16th and 17th centuries. He died in Lisbon. Musical work Magalhães dedicated himself to the composition of sacred polyphonic works for the liturgy. Most of them were published in collections such as the Missarum Liber, which was dedicated to Philip II of Portugal, and the Cantica Beatissima Virgines, published in Lisbon in 1639. He also wrote a book of plainsong, Cantus Ecclesiasticus, which was published in five different editions (the first ones in Lisbon in 1614 and in Antwerp in 1642, and the last one in 1724). The catalogue of the Music Library of King John IV of Portugal also mentions one 8-voice Mass, 6-voice Lamentations for Maundy Thursday, one 7-voice Christmas villancico and five 5- and 6-voice motets. All these works are believed to have been lost during the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

His work has been categorized as being part of the Surrealist movement, while Stanley G. Payne has described him as the Spanish Gabriele d'Annunzio. Education He took the baccalaureate education at the Instituto San Isidro. Between 1916 and 1920 he took studies in Letras at the Central University (where he wrote for the Conservative journal Filosofía y Letras and helped to launch a \\"Group of Socialist Students\\", some of whose members would soon after establish the Spanish Communist Party), and then collaborated for a time at the Centro de Estudios Históricos before moving to the University of Strasbourg to work as lecturer in Spanish. Influenced by José Ortega y Gasset's critique of democracy, however, he became a nationalist in the vein of Miguel de Unamuno.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, p. 148 Military service He performed his military service in Spanish Morocco, although his 1923 book on the experience, Notas Marruecas de un Soldado, which was influenced by Charles Maurras, caused such outrage amongst the generals that he was imprisoned for a time before being pardoned by General and Dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera. As literary critic for El Sol newspaper he went to Italy in 1928 and struck up friendships with such fascist thinkers as Giuseppe Bottai, Giovanni Gentile, Curzio Malaparte and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, eventually becoming an adherent of fascist beliefs himself. Having had already made a name for himself as an aesthetic writer, he announced his conversion to fascism in 1929 in an article in La Gaceta Literaria, a journal he had founded in 1927. Dubbed the \\"Spanish d'Annunzio\\", his conversion saw him cut off from Spain's high culture which was dominated by Liberals, becoming what he described as \\"a literary Robinson Crusoe\\".Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism: 1914-1945, London: Routledge, 2001, pp. 256-58 Ideology Being married to an Italian, sister of the Italian Consul at Strasburg, Giménez Caballero's fascism was largely derived from the Italian model of fascism whilst also including an international dimension in which he saw fascism as the future of the Latin Roman Catholic world.Payne, A History of Fascism, p. 258 He had little sympathy for National Socialism, which he saw as too Protestant and northern, even going so far as foreseeing war between fascism and national socialism. Writing extensively about the decadence of modern society and fascism in his book 1932 Genio de España, Giménez Caballero called for a re-establishment of the Spanish Empire to its former glory under a Mussolini-led Latin union. His follow-up, La Nueva Catolicidad, underlined his commitment to Roman Catholicism within a fascist framework. Giménez Caballero was a promoter of cultural Philosephardism, publishing several philosephardist pieces himself in La Gaceta Literaria. His Philosephardism—not exempt from contradictions—was no impediment to the outburst of antisemitic ideas in Gecé, particularly once his Fascist romanism affirmed, although there is no clear boundary in the chronology. Gimenez Caballero declared his support for the plans of Ramiro Ledesma Ramos and became involved in his Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista. However the writer was no political organizer and generally left control of the movement to Ledesma. He went on to join the Falange Española y de las JONS and served on the council of the movement. However he was at odds with many of the ideas of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, son of his former redeemer from jail, General Miguel Primo de Rivera. He was expelled from the Falange in 1936 after he began to work with the Mallorca banker Juan March Ordinas in the Partido Español de Patrones y Empresarios. Later readmitted to the Falange, he fled to Italy during the Spanish Civil War, but from abroad encouraged Francisco Franco to merge the Falangists with the Carlists. He was rewarded for his encouragement with the post of Vice-Secretary for National Education in Franco's inaugural cabinet. Later years One of the most bizarre of Giménez Caballero's actions was perhaps his unsuccessful attempt to marry Primo de Rivera's sister, Pilar, to Adolf Hitler, as a way to \\"soften\\" and \\"catholicize\\" the latter.Francisco Umbral: \\"Ramón y las vanguardias\\", El País, 5 August 1985 After the Spanish Civil War he spent most of his time abroad, holding positions in the Spanish embassies in Paraguay and Brazil before being appointed ambassador to Paraguay in 1958, a position he held for 14 years. In later life he continued as a writer, winning his final writing prize, Premio Espejo de España, for his work Retratos españoles (bastante parecidos) in 1985 whilst also directing a series of documentary films. Giménez Caballero, who spent his last months following a surgical procedure to treat cataract in his house in the El Viso colony under an ill condition and dealing with auditive disorders, finally died on 14 May 1988.

Policies and philosophy  Online Direct Democracy does not have any policies. Instead it has pledged to conduct an online poll for every bill that passes before Parliament. Anyone on the Australian electoral roll would be allowed to register to vote in these polls and will be allowed one vote per bill. The MPs would then be required to vote in accordance with the clear majority (55%-70% and more than 100,000 votes). If there is no clear majority they will abstain from voting. A beta version of the system is operating and available for public use. This system has been designed to highlight the possibilities on online democracy. History The party contested the 2007 and 2013 federal elections as Senator Online. In the five states the party contested in 2007, it received on average 0.06% of the vote (or roughly 6 votes for every 10,000 cast) with the greatest success in Victoria where it received 0.18% of the vote (or roughly 18 votes for every 10,000 cast).

Swing, the arena was constructed at the grounds of the National Orange Show in 1949. Many musicians and other artists performed at the venue, including Jack Benny, George Burns, Louis Armstrong, Grateful Dead, Ike & Tina Turner, Elvis Presley and (for 13 consecutive years) Bob Hope. Sammy Davis Jr. hosted a benefit concert at the venue in 1958, featuring performances by Judy Garland, Jerry Lewis, Tony Curtis, Danny Thomas and Shirley MacLaine. Davis hosted the event to demonstrate his appreciation to the San Bernardino Community Hospital for treating him following an automobile accident in 1954. Davis lost his left eye as a result. The venue altered in the 1960s, becoming a prominent rock arena for the West Coast. In 1964, it was the launching point of the first American tour of The Rolling Stones. The Grateful Dead's February 26, 1977 performance there was released in 2019 as the album Dave's Picks Volume 29. On September 11, 1981, the auditorium was irreparably damaged when it was struck by a twin-engine Cessna T310P, registered N5705M, in an accident that killed the pilot and passenger, following which the building had to be demolished.

In 1592 he became vicar of Honingham, Norfolk, and in 1603 he succeeded Lawrence Fairclough, father of Samuel Fairclough, as vicar of Haverhill, Suffolk. In 1605 he became lecturer, not vicar as some scholars believe, of Dedham, Essex, where for over thirty years he had the repute of being \\"one of the most awakening preachers of the age.\\" The vicars and lecturers are listed inside the church by the north door. On his lecture days his church overflowed. On one occasion, according to John Howe based on a report by Thomas Goodwin, Rogers rebuked the congregation for their woeful neglect of the Bible. His eloquence, some would say anointed preaching, moved many to tears and loud weeping. On market days he preached to hundreds of people from the tower by the muniment room above the north porch. This muniment room holds some early editions of his works. Cotton Mather reports a saying of Ralph Brownrig that Rogers would \\"do more good with his wild notes than we with our set music.\\" His lecture was suppressed from 1629 till 1631, on the ground of his nonconformity. His subsequent compliance was not strict. Giles Firmin, one of his converts, never saw him wear a surplice, and he only occasionally used the prayer-book, and then repeated portions of it from memory. He died on 18 October 1636, and was buried in the churchyard at Dedham. There is a tombstone to his memory, and also a mural monument in the church on the north wall of the sanctuary. His funeral sermon was preached by John Knowles. His engraved portrait exhibits a worn face, and depicts him in nightcap, ruff, and full beard. Matthew Newcomen succeeded him at Dedham. Nathaniel Rogers was his second son. Works He published: *The Doctrine of Faith, 1627; 6th edit. 1634, 12mo. *A Treatise of Love, 1629; 3rd edit. 1637.

The RFC identifies four requirements for tags: * Identifiers are likely to be unique across space and time, and come from a practically inexhaustible supply. * Identifiers are relatively convenient for humans to mint (create), read, type, remember etc. * No central registration is necessary, at least for holders of domain names or email addresses; and there is negligible cost to mint each new identifier. * The identifiers are independent of any particular resolution scheme. Tags are used extensively in YAML.  Format  The general syntax of a tag URI is: \\"tag:\\" authorityName \\",\\" YYYY-MM-DD-date \\":\\" specific [ \\"#\\" fragment ] In this syntax, the \`authorityName\` is either a domain name or an email address, and the date is in the YYYY-MM-DD format, such as \`2017-01-01\`. Thus, a specific tag is tied to a specific domain name or email address at a specific point of time. It is required that the \\"tagging entity\\" creating the tag be in control of the specified domain or email address as of 00:00 UTC on the specified date. This requirement makes each tag globally and persistently unique. The authority name alone would not suffice for global uniqueness, since the ownership of domains and email addresses is subject to change. The date used in a tag may be a past date, provided the tagging entity controlled the authority name on that past date. An entity which acquires control of an authority name immediately after a period when it was unassigned is allowed to mint tags as if it controlled the authority name during the unassigned period, provided the entity has evidence that the name was unassigned. The date used in a newly-minted tag may not be a date in the future. The date may be abbreviated; the month and day default to \`01\`, but tags which have defaulted month and day values are reckoned as different from tags where the \`01\` value is specified. Thus, * \`tag:example.com,2004:1234\` * \`tag:example.com,2004-01:1234\` * \`tag:example.com,2004-01-01:1234\` are all different tags and might have different referents. They all should have been minted by the same tagging entity (specifically, whoever controlled example.com on January 1, 2004 00:00 UTC). If a different entity gained control of example.com at 00:05 UTC on that date, it would not be allowed to mint tags until the following date, and it would not ever be able to use the abbreviated forms, \`2004\` or \`2004-01\`.

Hinduism mostly shares common terms with the Dhārmic religions that it birthed, including Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. The scriptures of Hinduism are the Shrutis (the four Vedas, which comprise the original Vedic Hymns, or Samhitas, and three tiers of commentaries upon the Samhitas, namely the Brāhmaṇas, Āraṇyakas, and Upanishads); these are considered authentic, authoritative divine revelation. Furthermore, Hinduism is also based on the Smriti literature, including the Rāmāyana, the Bhagavad Gītā, and the Purānas, which are also considered to be sacred Hindu texts.For Hinduism: see Yajurveda, Chapter 32, Verse 3; Yajurveda, Chapter 40, Verse 8; Yajurveda, Chapter 40, Verse 9. Islam is a monotheistic religion that originated in the Arabian peninsula, in which the deity is Allah (, : see God in Islam), the Islamic prophet being Muhammad, whom Muslims believe delivered the Islamic scripture, the Quran. Islam shares common terms with the Abrahamic religions which pre- date it─those religions claiming descent from Abraham─being, from oldest to youngest, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and the Baháʼí Faith. The Quran and the Hadith literature are the primary Islamic scriptures, while the sunnah consists of the Islamic traditional customs and practices which all Muslims are expected to follow. Hinduism and Islam share some ritual practices such as fasting and pilgrimage, but differ in their views on animal slaughter, apostasy, blasphemy, circumcision, consanguineous marriages, cult images, henotheism, social stratification, vegetarianism, and Ahiṃsā (non-violence) as a virtue. Their historical interaction since the 7th century has witnessed periods of cooperation and syncretism, as well as periods of religious discrimination, intolerance, and violence. As a religious minority in India, Islam assimilated to local Hindu traditions and the Hindu roots of converts over a period of 13 centuries. The boundaries between Islam and Hinduism remained flexible until British colonial rule in India.M. Hakan Yavuz Is there a Turkish Islam? The emergence of convergence and consensus Published online: 07 Aug 2006 Pages 213-232 Comparison between Islam and Hinduism =Theology and concept of God= Islam is a system of thought that believes in varied traditions, hence the various Islamic Sects. Tawḥīd. Muslims are required to affirm daily, as one of the five pillars of Islam, in Shahada, that is \\"There is no other god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.\\"N Mohammad sahab (1985), The doctrine of jihad: An introduction, Journal of Law and Religion, 3(2): 381–397 Hinduism is a system of thought that believes in varied traditions. In the Upanishads, one popular interpretation is the Advaita Vedanta tradition. It is absolute monism. A person finds the truth when realizing his/her true nature or the pure soul or self (atman). When the person is devoid of ignorance the person realizes that their inner self (atman) is the Brahman (the ultimate reality). Till the person realizes this truth, the person is usually of ignorance and therefore thinks everything around them is real and indulges in it, when it's actually not and is an illusion (maya). The Brahman which is absolute and pure and the atman which is absolute and pure also are the same in this school of thought. When the person singularly focus on 'I' and indulges in self-enquiry, study of texts, ethical perfection and jnana and the self, they realize the Brahman and don't depend on the material. =Scriptures and messengers= The scriptures of Islam are the Qurān and the Hadiths, which are varied and has many versions, The last and final Islamic prophet Muhammad is mentioned in world's major religions. According to Islamic doctrine, Jesus Christ was also the messenger from the God.Neal Robinson (2013), Islam: A Concise Introduction, Routledge, , Chapter 7 Muslims believe that Muhammad was the last messenger, and Quran was the last revelation from God to the last prophet. who predicted Muhammad as the last messenger. The hadiths contain the Sunnah, or the reports of Muhammad's life, sayings, actions and examples he set. The Quran and the Hadiths are considered in Islam as the source of Islamic law, or Sharia. Hinduism has no traditional ecclesiastical order, no centralized religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any particular holy book., Quote: \\"one need not be religious in the minimal sense described to be accepted as a Hindu by Hindus, or describe oneself perfectly validly as Hindu. One may be polytheistic or monotheistic, monistic or pantheistic, even an agnostic, humanist or atheist, and still be considered a Hindu.\\" Spiritual knowledge of Hinduism is contained in texts called Shruti (\\"what is heard\\") and Smriti (\\"what is remembered\\"). These texts discuss diverse theology, rituals, rites of passage, philosophy, and other topics. Major scriptures in Hinduism include the Vedas, Upanishads (both Śruti), the Epics, Puranas, Dharmasutras and Agamas (all smriti). =Similarities= According to Islam, one after death either enters Paradise (Jannah) or Hell (Jahannam), depending on their deeds. However unlike Muslims, Hindus believe in cycle of reincarnation. However, the concept of higher and lower realms of existence can be found in Hinduism, though the realms are temporary places Both are obliged to fight the Demons (Shaitan/Asura), who are in constantly war against human and the Divine.Firoz-Ul Haque Islam Under the Microscope: A Condensed Digest for Muslims and Non-Muslims Atlantic Publishers & Dist 2006 page 35 Asuras are part of Hindu mythology along with Devas, Yakshas and Rakshasas.

They battle constantly with the devas.Wash Edward Hale (1999), Ásura in Early Vedic Religion, Motilal Barnarsidass, , pages 2-6 Similarities can still be found at the concept of the Divine and the world. Both belief in the existence of an entirety supreme power, either called Brahman or Allah. Brahman is a metaphysical concept which is the single binding unity behind diversity in all that exists in the universe, while Allah is the Arabic word for God in Abrahamic religions. Assimilated in local lore, the Islamic concept of God became comparable to the notion of the ultimate reality expressing itself through different names as the creator, the maintainer and the destroyer.Mohammed Yamin Impact of Islam on Orissan Culture Readworthy page 56-57 The Sufi concept of Waḥdat al-Wujūd is close to the world view asserted in the Advaita Vedanta.Malika Mohammada The Foundations of the Composite Culture in India Aakar Books 2007 page 141 Some Islamic scholars belief that the worlds created by God will perish and created anew resembling the Hindu notion of an endless procress of generation and decay.Jean Holm, John Bowker Sacred Place Bloomsbury Publishing 2001 page 112Clinton Bennett, Charles M. Ramsey South Asian Sufis: Devotion, Deviation, and Destiny A&C; Black page 23 Pilgrimage is found in both religions, Hajj to Mecca in Islam, while Kumbh Mela and Tirtha Yatra in Hinduism. Muslims performs 7 rounds around Kaaba during Hajj which is called Tawaf.World Faiths, teach yourself - Islam by Ruqaiyyah Maqsood. page 76 Hindus also perform one or more rounds around the center (Garbhagriya) of a temple (one to twenty-one), which is called as Parikrama (known in Sanskrit as pradakśiṇā). Both of them are commonly called circumambulation. By some members of the Ahmadiya Muslim Community, Islamic Prophet Muhammad is believed to be the Hindu Avatar Kalki; some of the Muslim scholars and a few of the Hindu scholars also argued that kalki is mentioned indicating Muhammad in some Hindu scriptures. However, most of the Hindu scholars widely discarded it as a false theory, claiming that Kalki is supposed to arrive at the end of Kali Yuga, not in the beginning. The idea of Fana has been compared to Samadhi. =Differences= Apostasy Apostasy, that is a condition of Islam for a Muslim to leave his religion or to blaspheme against it, is according to some Islamic schools of law, a religious crime . Hinduism allows freedom of conscience. A Hindu can become an atheist, or change beliefs when he or she wants.MK Gandhi, The Essence of Hinduism, Editor: VB Kher, Quote: \\"According to Gandhi, a man may not believe in God and still call himself a Hindu.\\" Both religions state that there should be no compulsion in religion even though Islamic scholars may call for punishment for leaving Islam. Blasphemy Blasphemy against God and against Muhammad is a religious crime in Islam. The Quran in verse and many Hadiths of Islam discuss blasphemy and its punishment. A variety of actions, speeches or behavior can constitute blasphemy in Islam. Some examples include insulting or cursing Allah or Muhammad, mockery or disagreeable behavior towards beliefs and customs common in Islam, finding faults or expressing doubts about Allah, improper dress, drawing offensive cartoons, tearing or burning holy literature of Islam, creating or using music or painting or video or novels to mock or criticize Muhammad are some examples of blasphemous acts. Punishment can range from imprisonment, flogging to execution. Open discussion and criticism of spiritual thoughts, ideas and deities is allowed in Hinduism. The concept of \\"divine blasphemy\\" or \\"heresy\\" does not exist in Hinduism, and ancient Hindu texts make no provisions for blasphemy. Caste and creed Hindu texts such as the Manusmriti segregate people through social stratification and class . Islamic texts do not segregate Muslims. According to the Quran, all human beings in this world are equal, whether it is a king or a sweeper. In Islamic texts such as the Hadīth, however mention the prophecy of the Muslim Ummah being separated into 73 sects. This stratification is from the book of the Prophet - the Hadīth. Thus, in prophetic tradition it is believed that despite the inherent division there is always a majority which retains the correct belief and practice of Islam, a group singled out from the others and on the path to attain salvation. There are deferences in their traditional practices as the tradition differ according to geography but spiritually all Muslims are equal. - Ahl al-Sunnah wa٬ُl-Jamāٝah While Hinduism texts do not list thousands of castes, in practice, the Hindu caste system has been described variously as four Varnas or as thousands of endogamous hereditary groups called jātis. Similar to the Hindu caste structure of four Varnas, in practice, Muslims in South Asia developed a caste system that divided the South Asian Muslim society into three: the foreign-descended Ashraf Muslims, the local Ajlaf converts, and the converted Arzal untouchables at the lowest rung. The term \\"Arzal\\" stands for \\"degraded\\" and the Arzal castes are further subdivided, like Hindu jatis, into Bhanar, Halalkhor, Hijra, Kasbi, Lalbegi, Maugta, Mehtar etc.Dereserve these myths by Tanweer Fazal,Indian express ScholarsGabriele Vombruck (June 1996), \\"Being worthy of protection. The dialectics of gender attributes in Yemen\\", Social Anthropology, 4 (2): 145–162 state that caste-like social stratification is also found in Islam outside South Asia. Circumcision Khitan (circumcision) of males is required in Islam. The Qur'an itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse, but it is mentioned in the Hadiths of Islam. Muslim commentators consistently interpret Islamic scriptures as making male circumcision obligatory. Circumcision is not a religious requirement in Hinduism. Consanguineous marriage Consanguineous marriage are those where the bride and groom share a grandparent or near ancestor.Joseph, S. E. (2007), Kissing Cousins, Current Anthropology, 48(5), pages 756–764 Islam prohibit marriage due to consanguinity with ancestors, descendants, siblings, siblings of ancestors and descendants of siblings. However marriage with cousins and farther consanguineous relatives is allowed. Hinduism forbids consanguineous marriage, and strongly recommends seven degrees of biological separation between bride and groom. Arranged endogamous consanguineous marriage are very common in Islam, particularly first cousin marriages, followed by second cousin marriages.Shaw, A. (2001), Kinship, cultural preference and immigration: consanguineous marriage among British Pakistanis, Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 7(2): 315–334 About 25 to 40% of all marriages in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and UAE are first cousin marriages; while overall consanguineous arranged marriages exceed 65 to 80% in various regions of the Islamic Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia.R. Hussain (1999), Community perceptions of reasons for preference for consanguineous marriages in Pakistan, Journal of Biosocial Science, 31, pages 449–461Consanguineous marriages Brecia Young (2006), University of New Mexico, Santa Fe Jizya Islamic scriptures, in its history and unlike Hinduism, compelled the payment of a special tax called Jizya from dhimmi, the non- Muslims who live in a Muslim state.John Louis Esposito, Islam the Straight Path, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 33–34Anver M. Emon, Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law, Oxford University Press, , pp. 99–109 Jizya was a tool of social stratification and treasury's revenue from non-Muslims. Jizya was a reminder of subordination of a non-Muslim under Muslims, and created a financial and political incentive to convert to Islam.Majid Khadduri (2010), War and Peace in the Law of Islam, Johns Hopkins University Press; pp. 162–224; There is no such concept of \\"Jizya\\" in Hindu texts. Slavery The Quran and the Hadiths permit the institution of slavery of non-Muslims in Islam, using the words abd (slave) and the phrase ma malakat aymanukum (\\"that which your right hand owns\\"). Brunschvig, 'Abd, in Encyclopedia of Islam, Brill, 2nd Edition, Vol 1, pp. 13–40; , Under Islamic law, Muslim men can have sexual relations with female captives or concubines and slaves with her consent.Abbott, N. (1942). \\"Women and the state in early Islam\\". Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 1(3), pp. 341–368Ahmad Sikainga (1996), Slaves Into Workers: Emancipation and Labor in Colonial Sudan, University of Texas Press, Islam, in some cases, encouraged a slave's manumission, but only after a non-Muslim slave were forcefully converted to Islam. Non-Muslim slave women who were raped and had children for their Muslim masters became legally free upon her master's death, and her children were presumed to be Muslims as their father. Aurangzeb, the Mughal Emperor, hired Muslim scholars to study the Quran and the Hadiths and write down the Islamic law for India in late 17th century. The resulting document was called Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, and it dedicated many chapters on the rights of Muslim men to own and buy non-Muslim slaves for work and sex.A digest of the Moohummudan law - Slavery Neil Ballie, Smith Elder, Oxford & London, pp. 363–389 The practice of slavery in early and late Vedic era of Hinduism is undocumented. Arrian, the Greek historian who chronicled India about the time of Alexander the Great, wrote in his Indika, However, some Hindu texts use the term dasa. Some scholars translate this as slave, while other scholars have translated it as servant and religious devotee.A Sharma (September 2005), Journal American Acad Religion, 73(3): 843–870Kangle R.P. (1960), The Kautiliya Arthasastra - a critical edition, Part 3, University of Bombay Studies, , p. 186 Arthashastra text of Hinduism dedicates a chapter to dasa where a financially bankrupt individual may apply and become a servant of another. Arthashastra grants a dasa legal rights, and declares abusing, hurting and raping a dasa as a crime.Shamasastry, Arthashastra of Chanakya, pp. 260–264B. Breloer (1934), Kautiliya Studien, Bd. III, Leipzig, pages 10–16, 30–71 Food-related issues Islam has restrictions on food, such as how the meat is prepared.Qurʾan 2:173 Halal meat is prepared by ritual slaughter that involves cutting the jugular veins of the animal with a sharp knife. This leads to death via bleeding. Meat from animals that die of natural causes or accident is not allowed. Beef is a sought after meat among Muslims, but they strictly avoid pork and alcohol. Hinduism, with its emphasis on non- violence against all creatures, tends to be vegetarian, and lacto-vegetarian meals are common. However, food habits are left as a choice for Hindus and alcohol consumption is accepted. There are varied opinions regarding the permissibility of eating meat in Hinduism, depending upon the interpretation of the Hindu scriptures. Vegetarianism is a choice for most Hindus, although some sects emphasize vegetarianism. Some Hindus consider violence against animals, that is used to produce any meat, so unacceptable that they avoid eating with non-vegetarians. Most observant Hindus strictly avoid cow-based beef, but some may eat water buffalo-based beef or pork as an alternative. The manner in which an animal is slaughtered in Islamic rituals is considered cruel and barbaric by Hindus, as Hindus consume Jhatka meat. Jhatka is meat from an animal that has been killed instantly, such as by a single strike of a sword or axe to sever the head, as opposed to ritualistically slow slaughter (kutha) in the halal method (dhabihah). Jhatka is the method of meat production demanded by most Hindus who eat meat, as this provides a quick and painless death to the animal. Both methods use sharp knives. In the Jhatka method, a swift uninterrupted cut severs the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins, vagus nerves and the spine. In the Halal method, the slaughter is done with a swift deep incision with a sharp knife on the throat, cutting the jugular veins and carotid arteries of both sides but leaving the spinal cord and nervous tissue intact, followed by a period where the blood of the animal is drained out. A prayer to God is not required in the Jhatka method with each animal commercially slaughtered, but a prayer to God (Allah) is required at the start or if there is any interruption during Halal meat production. Slaughter of a cow is considered heinous in Hinduism and has been a cause of Hindu-Muslim riots in India. Politics and historical interaction H.G. Rawlinson, in his book: Ancient and Medieval History of India claims the first Arab Muslims settled on the Indian coast in the last part of the 7th century. It was however the subsequent expansion of the Turkish and Persian led Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent over the next millennium that significantly expanded the interaction of Islam with Hinduism. =Peaceful cooperation= Translation of scriptures The Mughal Emperor Akbar commissioned many Hindu texts to be translated into Persian.India: A Laboratory of Inter-religious Experiment. Siraj Maqbool Ahmed, 2008, Religion and the Arts, Volume 12, No. 1 Pages 319–328 Girish Chandra Sen, a Brahmo Samaj missionary, was the first person to produce the complete translation of the Qur'an into Bengali in 1886. Music There have been instances of syncretic cooperation on music on Islamic and Hindu theme. The national poet of Bangladesh Kazi Nazrul Islam, for example, wrote a lot of Islamic devotional songs for the mainstream of Bengali folk music.Kamrunnessa Azad. 2001. Dharmiya Chetonay Nazrul. Nazrul Institute, Dhaka. 1999. pp. 173–174 He also explored Hindu devotional music by composing Shama Sangeet, bhajans and kirtans, often merging Islamic and Hindu values. Nazrul's poetry and songs explored the philosophy of Islam and Hinduism.Kamrunnessa Azad. 2001. Dharmiya Chetonay Nazrul. Nazrul Institute, Dhaka. 1999. pp. 19–20 =Religious violence= Historical records of religious violence are extensive for medieval India, in the form of corpus written by numerous Muslim historians. Will Durant states that Hindus were historically persecuted during Islamic rule of the Indian subcontinent. Recurrent clashes between Hindus and Muslims appear in the historical record during the Delhi Sultanate. They continued through the Mughal Empire, and then in the British colonial period. There have been periodic instances of violence against Muslims in India from before its partition from Pakistan in 1947, frequently in the form of mob attacks on Muslims by Hindus that form a pattern of sporadic sectarian violence between the Hindu and Muslim communities. Over 10,000 people have been killed in Hindu-Muslim communal violence since 1950 in 6,933 instances of communal violence between 1954 and 1982. The roots of violence against Muslims lie in India's history, stemming from lingering resentment toward the Islamic domination of India during the Middle Ages, policies established by the country's British colonizers, the violent partition of India into a Muslim Pakistan, and a Hindu Majority, but secular India with a large but minority Muslim population. Some scholars have described incidents of anti-Muslim violence as politically motivated and organized anti-Muslim violence are politically motivated and a part of the electoral strategy of mainstream political parties they called them pogroms or acts of genocide, or a form of state terrorism with \\"organized political massacres\\" rather than mere \\"riots\\". Others argue that, although their community faces discrimination and violence, some Muslims have been highly successful, that the violence is not as widespread as it appears, but is restricted to certain urban areas because of local socio-political conditions, and there are many cities where Muslims and Hindus live peacefully together with almost no incidences of sectarian violence.  Hindu-Islamic relations in India  Though it is widely believed that violence between Hindus and Muslims began with British interference, this is not true. Problems between Hindus and Muslims in India can be traced back to the 14th century. This hate between Hindus and Muslims was further fueled by the British, using their strategy of \\"divide and rule\\". In 1947, Pakistan was created as a separate entity for Muslims, making the Muslim population in India a minority compared to Hindus and further deepening the divide between them. Since then, there have been many riots between Hindus and Muslims. One of the most destructive riots was the 2002 Gujarat Riots which was spread over three days and led to the death of more than 1000 people. This occurred as a result of the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims, which was followed by Hindu retaliation against Muslims. Another prominent controversy between Hindus and Muslims is the Ayodhya Ram Mandir - Babri Masjid case. The premise for this was that a Mosque was built by Mir Baqi, a commander of Babur in the birthplace of Lord Ram, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. However, Hindus believed that this Mosque was built after tearing down a Temple that used to be in its place and the Hindus thus raised legal objections to the presence of the Mosque. Fortunately, both Hindus and Muslims have agreed to maintain peace and preserve communal harmony in Ayodhya, in light of the Supreme Court delivering its verdict regarding this case on 9 November, 2019. Thus, though Hindu-Muslim relations are complicated and are fueled by hate, there are also many places where they peacefully coexist in India.  Contemporary interaction  India separated Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971 AD. Various news agencies, such as BBC, Associated Press and Reuters have reported periodic violence against Hindus by some Muslims in Bangladesh, and attempts by the Bangladeshi government to punish such violence. For example, in early 2013, Hindu families were attacked and killed, as well as dozens of temples burnt/destroyed after the International Crimes Tribunal sentenced Delwar Hossain Sayeedi of the Jamaat-e-Islami to death for the war crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.

Outside a bloodbath is going on. Suddenly an orphan begins to weep as it gets too hot in the garage. At once, the killers approach the garage.\\" As the refugees refuse to come out, the militia leader, Emmanuel Rekeraho, decides to burn them alive in the garage. \\"'The nuns are coming to help us. They are bringing gasoline,' I heard [Rekeraho] say. Looking through a hole that the militiamen meanwhile had made in the wall, I indeed saw Sister Gertrude and Sister Kisito. The latter was carrying a petrol can. Shortly upon that, the garage is set on fire.\\" \\"Vatican Puzzled by Verdict Against Rwandan Nuns,\\" retrieved May 26, 2008  References   See also  * Butare Four Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Benedictine nuns Category:Members of the clergy convicted of crimes Category:People of the Rwandan genocide Category:Prisoners and detainees of Belgium Category:Rwandan Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Rwandan criminals Category:Rwandan people imprisoned abroad Category:Belgium–Rwanda relations Category:Rwandan people convicted of war crimes ","title":"Maria Kisito"},{"id":"14034609","text":"is a train station in the city of Nagano, Nagano Prefecture, Japan, operated jointly by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), with the third-sector railway operating company Shinano Railway.

It belonged to PIN Group S.A., a Luxembourg-based corporate affiliation made up of several German postal companies. History and shareholding The PIN Group originally traded under the name Briefdienstleistungsunternehmen PIN intelligente Dienstleistungen AG, a postal services company founded in 1999 in Berlin. In 2004, Axel Springer AG and the Holtzbrinck Publishing Group each bought a majority shareholding of 30% from the company founders and venture capital company DKB Wagniskapital GmbH. In October 2005 the remaining shares of the PIN founders were acquired by WAZ-Mediengruppe and the Luxembourg investment company Rosalia Investment S.A. before founding the PIN Group. In the summer of 2006 the newspaper publishers Madsack, M. DuMont Schauberg, Rheinisch- Bergische Verlagsgesellschaft and W. Girardet merged their postal services divisions into the company, receiving in return a 10 per cent holding of PIN Group AG. Following the takeover of Briefnetz Süd GmbH & Co. KG (BNS), a consortium of postal services providers owned by 12 newspaper publishers in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, since April 2007 the PIN Group has operated a mail delivery network throughout the whole of Germany. To offer delivery services to German authorities and government departments, the PIN Group acquired Ulm-based postal services provider DirektExpress. Since June 2007, the majority shareholder in the PIN Group has been the Axel Springer publishing company, after raising its holding from 23.5% to 71.6%. Axel Springer bought these shares from WAZ, Holtzbrinck and Rosalia for €510 million. The holding company, PIN Group S.A. is responsible for laying down the strategy of the entire corporate affiliation and planning day-to-day operations, which are managed and organised by the German subsidiaries and shareholding companies.

Due to the cost squeeze on owner Axel Springer, the company was quoted by the German Financial Times as examining \\"a variety of options\\" ranging from selling the company to closing down operations entirely. On 5 Dec 2007, PIN Group subsequently announced it was to lay off 1000 employees, more than 1/10 of the workforce, simultaneously criticising the German government for \\"consciously taking into account that investments worth billions to Germany ... would go to waste\\".ARD reports PIN Group to lay off 1000 workers (German) In his 2007 Christmas address to the nation, German President Horst Köhler described the introduction of the minimum wage in the postal sector as \\"risky\\", stating that \\"a minimum wage that can not be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs\\".Stuttgarter Zeitung, 29 December 2007 (German) The PIN Group CEO, Günter Thiel, resigned his position on 17 Dec 2007 after Axel Springer Publishing turned down his offer to buy its remaining 63.7% share in the company.

Despite Germany's proving victorious on the eastern front following the Russian Revolution, the military high command had failed to prevent the continuing erosion of morale, both domestically and in the army. Despite transferring veteran troops from the eastern front to fight on the western front, the Spring Offensive was a failure and following the outbreak of the German Revolution, Germany's provisional government was obliged to agree to the terms of the 1918 armistice. This included accepting that the troops of the victorious powers occupied the left bank of the Rhine and four right bank \\"bridgeheads\\" with a radius around Cologne, Koblenz, Mainz and a radius around Kehl. Furthermore, the left bank of the Rhine and a -wide strip east of the Rhine was declared a demilitarized zone. The Treaty of Versailles repeated these provisions, but limited the presence of the foreign troops to fifteen years after the signing of the treaty (until 1934). The purpose of the occupation was on the one hand to give France security against a renewed German attack, and on the other to serve as a guarantee for reparations obligations. After this was apparently achieved with the Young Plan, the occupation of the Rhineland was prematurely ended on 30 June 1930. The administration of occupied Rhineland was under the jurisdiction of the Inter- Allied Rhineland High Commission with its seat at the Upper Presidium of the Rhine Province in Koblenz. thumbOccupations of the Rhineland and Saar regions: — blue: France, including the former American zone around Koblenz — yellow: Belgium — brown: United Kingdom — stripes : Ruhr, occupied by France and Belgium — green: Saar, occupied by France under the auspices of the League of NationsEdmonds, (1943), p. 1 French forces continued to occupy German territory in the Rhineland until the end of 1930, while France continued to control the smaller Saarland region until 1935., Revue historique des armées, Service historique de la défense.

John Rogers in an engraving by Wenceslas Hollar. Background He was born at Messing in Essex, the second son of the clergyman Nehemiah Rogers, by his wife Margaret. Because of his religious views, he was turned out by his father in 1642. He returned to studies of medicine, as a servitor at King's College, Cambridge. The First English Civil War had broken out, and the servitors were dismissed. Rogers almost starved, but in 1643 he obtained a post in a school in Lord Brudenel's house in Huntingdonshire, and afterwards at the free school at St. Neots.:s:Rogers, John (1627-1665?) (DNB00) Preacher In a short time he became known in Huntingdonshire as a preacher, and, returning to Essex, he received presbyterian ordination in 1647. About the same time he married a daughter of Sir Robert Payne of Midloe in Huntingdonshire, and became 'settled minister' of Purleigh in Essex, a valuable living. Rogers engaged a curate, and proceeded to London. There he renounced his presbyterian ordination, and joined the Independents. Becoming lecturer at St. Thomas Apostle, he preached violent political sermons in support of the Long parliament. In 1650 he was sent to Dublin by parliament as a preacher. Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin was assigned him by the commissioners as a place of worship. A schism arose in his congregation owing to the adoption by a party among them of Anabaptist principles; he wearied of the controversy, and returned to England in 1652. In the following year his parishioners at Purleigh cited him for non-residence, and he lost the living. Rogers was now no longer the champion of parliament. In 1653 Rogers published two controversial works, Bethshemesh, or Tabernacle for the Sun, in which he assailed the presbyterians, and Sagrir, or Doomes-day drawing nigh, in which he attacked the 'ungodly laws and lawyers of the Fourth Monarchy,' and also the collection of tithes. The two books indicate the date of his change of views: Bethshemesh is written from the standard Independent standpoint, while in Sagrir he has developed the characteristics of a fifth-monarchy man. The forcible dissolution of the Long parliament met with Rogers's approval. Besides doctrinal differences, he had personal quarrels with prominent members: Sir John Maynard had appeared against him as advocate for the congregation at Purleigh, while Zachary Crofton had anonymously attacked his preaching in a pamphlet.A Taste of the Doctrine of Thomas Apostle; at a later date Crofton renewed the controversy by publishing a reply to Bethshemesh styled Bethshemesh Clouded. Imprisonment After Cromwell's coup d'état Rogers occupied himself with two long addresses to him, in which he recommended a system of government very similar to that which was actually inaugurated. This accord did not survive the dissolution of Cromwell's first parliament and his assumption of the title of Lord Protector. Rogers addressed a cautionary epistle to Cromwell, and assailed him openly from the pulpit. Being denounced as a conspirator in 1654, his house was searched and his papers seized. This drew from him another denunciation.Mene, Tekel, Perez: a Letter lamenting over Oliver, Lord Cromwell. On 28 March he proclaimed a solemn day of humiliation for the sins of the rulers. His sermon, in which he likened Whitehall to Sodom and demonstrated that Cromwell had broken the first eight commandments (time preventing his proceeding to the last two), procured his arrest and imprisonment in Lambeth. On 5 February 1655 he was brought from prison to appear before Cromwell. He held by his previous utterances, and desired Cromwell to remember that he must be judged. On 30 March he was moved to Windsor, and on 9 October to the Isle of Wight. He was released in January 1657, and immediately returned to London. The fifth-monarchy men were then deep in conspiracy. Informations were repeatedly laid against Rogers, and on 3 February 1658 he was sent to the Tower of London on the Protector's warrant. This imprisonment lasted only till 16 April. Four and a half months later Cromwell died. The fifth-monarchy men followed Sir Henry Vane in opposing Richard Cromwell's succession, and Rogers denounced him vehemently from the pulpit. The remnant of the Long parliament was recalled to power, and Rogers involved himself in controversy with William Prynne. Both supported \\"the good old cause,\\" but differed in defining it. Prynne remained true to the older ideal of limited monarchy, while Rogers advocated a republic with Christ himself as its invisible sovereign. Later life His faction now wanted him to proceed safely to Ireland to preach the gospel. The insurrection of Sir George Booth intervened, and brought him the post of chaplain in Charles Fairfax's regiment. He served through the campaign against Booth, and at its conclusion was relieved of his duties in Ireland. In October he was nominated to a lectureship at Shrewsbury, but he was again in Dublin by the end of the year, and was imprisoned there for a time by the orders of the army leaders, after they had dissolved the remnant of the Long parliament. Parliament ordered his release immediately on regaining its ascendancy. At the time of the Restoration he moved to the Netherlands. He resumed the study of medicine, at Leyden and Utrecht, and received a Utrecht M.D. In 1662 he returned to England and resided at Bermondsey. In 1664 he was admitted to an ad eundem degree of M.D. at Oxford. His date of death is not known. His oldest son and only surviving child was Sir John Rogers, 1st Baronet.

The station is owned by Signal Media and the broadcast license is held by Signal Media of Arkansas, Inc. KABZ airs a sports radio format, known as \\"103.7 The Buzz.\\" The station's studios are located on Cottondale Lane, just west of downtown along the south shore of the Arkansas River (David D. Terry Lake). The transmitter is located on Shinall Mountain, near the Chenal Valley neighborhood of Little Rock.Radio-Locator.com/KABZ On weekdays, KABZ airs local sports shows from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Nights and weekends, the station carries the ESPN Radio Network. Channel 7 KATV, Little Rock's ABC-TV Network affiliate, supplies news and weather updates. Some KABZ local sports shows are also heard on other Arkansas sports radio stations. History =Early Years= On June 22, 1961, the station signed on as KARK-FM, the FM simulcast of AM 920 KARK, one of Little Rock's earliest radio stations. KARK-FM was powered at 22,500 watts on a 790 foot tower. KARK-AM-FM were co-owned with Channel 4, KARK-TV, the NBC affiliate in Little Rock. In 1967, FM stations in most cities could not simulcast their AM stations full time any longer. KARK- FM switched to an automated Top 40 sound, using syndicator TM Century's \\"Stereo Rock\\" format. In 1972, a Denver-based company bought Channel 4. In those days, broadcast stations owned by different companies could not have the same call sign. The TV station has kept the KARK-TV call letters to this day, while the radio stations switched to KARN and KARN-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1973 page B-15 By then, KARN-FM had boosted its power to 95,000 watts and nearly doubled its antenna height to 1510 feet, boasting a signal that could be heard on a good car radio from Fort Smith to Memphis, along the entire I-40 run through Arkansas. =Top 40 KKYK= In 1973, to carve out its own identity, it switched call letters to KKYK, continuing to run the \\"Stereo Rock\\" format for several years as \\"K-Kick 104.\\" As a top-40 station, KKYK 103.7 usually finished well behind KLAZ 98.5 and its successor KZOU \\"Zoo 98.\\" Ted Snider, owner of KARN 920, sold the FM station to Shepard Communications in late 1988 after members of his family bought an interest in an urban contemporary station, KIPR \\"Power 92.\\" After Shepard bought it, KKYK dropped the automation, hired a disc jockey staff and adopted a more major-market sound, overtaking Zoo 98. It usually finished in the top three behind country music outlet KSSN 95.7 and either just behind or just in front of beautiful music KEZQ 100.3 (now KDJE). When CHR/Top-40 began to falter in the early-1990s, KKYK saw its ratings decline. KZOU was forced out of the format in June 1991, becoming hot AC KURB \\"B-98.5.\\" While that would normally have been a moment of celebration, KKYK was unable to capitalize on the demise of its competitor. B-98.5 hired KKYK's popular morning man Craig O'Neill away, and KKYK began a steep drop despite its biggest competitor leaving the format. =Switch to K-Rock= KKYK attempted several reboots of its Top 40 format, including an attempt at bringing back the old K-Kick 104 branding and moving to a so-called \\"Rock 40\\" format as Kick 103.7. None of these steps were successful, and in the summer of 1993, the Top 40 format was jettisoned for album rock as \\"K-Rock 103.7.\\" K-Rock 103.7 was more successful ratings-wise than the last few years of KKYK's top-40 format, but it struggled to compete against the established rock station, KMJX, then known as \\"Magic 105.\\" It was also had to deal with a glut of rock stations launching around the same time in the market, including KLPQ/KOUN, which ran a classic rock format. In 1994, Shepard sold KKYK to Philip Jonsson, owner of Signal Media, which owned KBIS 1010 and KHLT 94.1. Shortly after buying KKYK, Signal Media flipped KHLT from \\"K-Lite 94.1\\" to KKPT \\"94.1 The Point,\\" running a classic rock format. Signal attempted to tag team its classic rock station, KKPT, with a younger-skewing active rock station, KKYK, to run the other local rock stations out of the format. Although the rock combo had some success in the ratings, it failed to force any major competitors to switch to other formats. =The Signal and The Buzz= KKYK's fate as a rock station was sealed after Group W bought AM 1010, by then known as KSYG, to silence it, which would decrease nighttime interference to its 1010 WINS in New York City. In 1996, Jonsson moved the AM station's talk format to FM 103.7, which assumed the KSYG call letters and became known as \\"The Signal.\\" After six years as \\"The Signal,\\" in 2000, it took on the call sign KABZ and became \\"103.7 The Buzz.\\" During its time as \\"The Buzz,\\" it aired mostly hot talk and guy talk programming with modern rock in late nights and on the weekends. Eventually all music programming was discontinued while the talk format remained. In 2004, 103.7 took on a sports talk format, at first carrying the Fox Sports Radio Network and in 2009 switching to ESPN, apart from its local shows.

The movie was the second Tarzan movie ever made, and is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' original 1912 novel Tarzan of the Apes. It adapts only the second part of the novel, the earlier portion having been the basis for the preceding film Tarzan of the Apes (1918). Less popular than its predecessor due to much of the action taking place in the wild west rather than Africa, the film has not been preserved, and no prints of it are known to survive today. Plot The film opens with flashbacks from Tarzan of the Apes to establish the back story. The African expedition led by Professor Porter (Thomas Jefferson) to find Tarzan (Elmo Lincoln), the ape-raised heir of Lord Greystoke, has been crowned with success, and Tarzan and Porter's daughter Jane (Enid Markey) are in love. The party now prepares to return to civilization when it is attacked by natives and separated from the ape-man. Tarzan's paternal cousin William Cecil Clayton (Colin Kenny), the current Lord Greystoke, desiring to keep his wealth and title, reports having seen the savages kill Tarzan. Believing him dead, they leave without their charge. But Tarzan has in fact survived, and is eager to be reunited with Jane. Finding his new friends gone he swims out to another boat to follow. Eventually he reaches the United States, and is landed near the Porters' ranch in San Francisco, California. Tarzan in civilization is like a bull in a china shop, as is demonstrated early in a destructive incident in a dance hall, where his prowess impresses La Belle Odine (Cleo Madison). Things get back on track when Jane is kidnapped by outlaws, presenting him with the opportunity to rescue her. Jane, however, is cold to him, as Clayton has falsely convinced her he is in love with the other woman. Heartbroken, Tarzan swears off civilization and returns to Africa. Belatedly learning the truth from Odine, Jane follows, and is happily reunited with her lover in the jungle.

French as Binns *Gordon Griffith as Tarzan as a Boy *Colin Kenny as Clayton *Kathleen Kirkham as Lady Greystoke *Bessie Toner (Undetermined Role) Reception Like many American films of the time, The Romance of Tarzan was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors required a cut, in Reel 2, of Tarzan choking a native with his arm, Reel 4, Tarzan kissing a young woman on her breast, Reel 6, the intertitle \\"If you will only spare him I will go back and be your slave\\", a scene showing Tarzan lifting a man off his feet and choking him, and two scenes of Tarzan choking a man.

The station was owned by the Winston Riddle family of Benton for a number of years before being sold in the early 1990s. The station's call letters were changed to KEWI by new owner Bernie Bottenberg. After falling on hard times, the station was sold to a partnership consisting of longtime Arkansas television broadcaster Jim Landers, and his nephews Steve and Lance Landers who were prominent local car dealers. Jim Landers would later purchase full ownership stock in the station. In the 1990s and 2000s, the station enjoyed a number of formats, including classic country and, later on, adult standards. It has been known for its tradition of broadcasting local sports, most notably Benton High School football, basketball, and baseball. In fall 2011, the station was sold to an ownership group headed by broadcaster Grant Merrill. The station switched to a news, talk, and sports format and developed an online newspaper known as Saline 24/7. The station serves as a home base for the syndicated \\"Sports Night\\" program broadcast across the Arkansas Radio Network. The show is owned and hosted by Merrill and longtime print journalist Andy Hodges. The station applied for an FM translator (K277BT), which signed on the air in the fall of 2013 at 103.3 FM. The translator moved to 93.7 FM in Benton, Arkansas on February 29, 2016, as K229CX, and again to 99.3 as K257GP on November 26, 2018. On February 7, 2014, KEWI went silent and then returned to the air on June 20, 2014 with a sports format with programming from ESPN Radio. The call sign was changed to the current KAFN on August 1, 2015. Effective October 6, 2017, Saline River Media sold KAFN to High Plans Radio Network, LLC for $50,000. KAFN currently broadcasts a classic rock format.

He was the brother of the famous explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Leftist activism He was born in Saint-André-de-Cubzac, Gironde, and educated in the United States as well as the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. Cousteau served in the military before working as a translator and a meteorologist and for New York's Credit Alliance Corporation. He then became a journalist for left-wing papers such as Regards or Monde and was associated with pacifism and the Anti-Stalinist left. Move to Fascism Cousteau abandoned his communism in the early 1930s, and was drawn to anti-Semitism and anti-democracy, writing for Coup de Patte and then Je suis partout, a journal of which he became editor in 1932. In this role he was close to Pierre Gaxotte, who converted him to fascism. He went to Nazi Germany in 1936 with Robert Brasillach and Georges Blond and then Spain in 1938 with Brasillach and Maurice Bardèche. While the trips helped to develop his fascism, his attendance at the Nuremberg Rally of 1937 left him of the opinion that Nazism was impressive but not without its flaws. Collaboration Cousteau was recalled up to the army in 1939 and captured in 1940, although Brasillach secured his release and he returned to Je suis partout, eventually succeeding Brasillach as political director in 1943. A strong believer in collaboration, he sought internment for the Jews and justified his stance by stating in 1943 that \\"We are not opportunists. We remain just plain fascists\\". His other wartime roles included a spell as editor of Paris-Soir in 1941, service on the general secretariat of Milice from 1942 and a series of written works for a variety of journals, including Combats, the militant journal of Henry Charbonneau. He was particularly noted for both his anti-Semitism and his anti-Americanism and in 1942 he produced his most notorious work L'Amérique juive, in which he sought to demonstrate that the United States was controlled by Jews and that these Jews were bent on controlling the world.Seth D. Armus, French Anti-Americanism (1930-1948): Critical Moments in a Complex History, Lexington Books, 2007, p. 10 In August 1944 he moved to Bad Mergentheim, where he helped run a French newspaper and radio station, before ultimately fleeing to Switzerland. Arrested at Innsbruck, he was condemned to death in November 1946, before the sentence was commuted to life with hard labour. Cousteau would later justify his collaboration by stating that \\"I wanted a German victory because it represented the last chance of the white man, while the democracies represented the end of the white man\\".Hugo Frey, Louis Malle, Manchester University Press, 2004, p. 76 Post-war activity Released under an amnesty in 1953, he went on to edit the extreme nationalist journal Rivarol, as well as contributing to Henry Coston's Lectures Françaises, Jeune Nation, Charivari, Dimanche-Matin and others. He was also associated with the minor Union des Intellectuels Indépendants movement. His brother Jacques, whose fame was growing at the time, had begged Pierre-Antoine to retire from public life following his release from prison, but he refused, insisting that it was a matter of honor that he continue to agitate.Sophie Coignard, Marie- Thérèse Guichard, French Connections: Networks of Influence, Algora Publishing, 2000, p. 244 His most well-known post-war work was Les lois de l'hospitalité in which he justified collaboration, arguing \\"we [the collaborators] did not commit an error of judgement.

The electron source and dump are installed in the upper metallic cylinders. Electron cooling is a method to shrink the emittance (size, divergence, and energy spread) of a charged particle beam without removing particles from the beam. Since the number of particles remains unchanged and the space coordinates and their derivatives (angles) are reduced, this means that the phase space occupied by the stored particles is compressed. It is equivalent to reducing the temperature of the beam. See also stochastic cooling. The method was invented by Gersh Budker at INP, Novosibirsk, in 1966 for the purpose of increasing luminosity of hadron colliders. It was first tested in 1974 with 68 MeV protons at NAP-M storage ring at INP. It is used at both operating ion colliders: the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and in the Low Energy Ion Ring at CERN. Basically, electron cooling works as follows: * A beam of dense quasi-monoenergetic electrons is produced and merged with the ion beam to be cooled. * The velocity of the electrons is made equal to the average velocity of the ions. * The ions undergo Coulomb scattering in the electron “gas” and exchange momentum with the electrons. Thermodynamic equilibrium is reached when the particles have the same momentum, which requires that the much lighter electrons have much higher velocities. Thus, thermal energy is transferred from the ions to the electrons. * The electron beam is finally bent away from the ion beam.

The yearbook underwent several name changes, including The Sledge, Sunrise, The Bell Clapper and The Banner, until it became the Royal Purple in 1909. The Royal Purple has consistently been a trend-setting yearbook. It was the first yearbook with an opening section that told the highlights of the year in chronological order, \\"tilted\\" pictures, numerous \\"bleed\\" pages, new headlines, and a \\"tip-on\\"—an applied color picture to the cover first used on the 1938 Royal Purple. An embossed design on the division page, a trend of the 1980s, first was used on the 1939 Royal Purple. The 1941 Royal Purple staff produced the first full-color lithograph cover in the nation. The 1994 Royal Purple used the very first UV lamination, a technique that has since become very popular. In 1997 the Royal Purple added a CD-Rom to its coverage and changed with the technology and in 2003 changed from CD-Roms to a DVD supplement.

The game is designed for three to five players and puts each of them in the shoes of child soldiers during the Warsaw Uprising, serving as members of the Grey Ranks ().  Setting  Grey Ranks is set in the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, with each player playing a child aged between 15 and 17. The game itself takes place over the course of ten chapters, each relating to an event that shaped the course of the Warsaw Uprising. To set the scene, each chapter begins with someone reading out a passage attributed to Radio Lightning. This is a narrative conceit as the game starts with preparing for the uprising in July 1944, and Radio Lightning didn't start until a week into August. Warsaw Uprising Radio Lightning page The ten chapters are: * Chapter One: Monkey-wrenching the Occupation - July 2, 1944 * Chapter Two: The Nazis Begin To Get Nervous - July 27, 1944 * Chapter Three: The Uprising Begins! - August 1, 1944 * Chapter Four: Desperate Street Fighting - August 2, 1944 * Chapter Five: The High Water Mark Of The Uprising - August 4, 1944 * Chapter Six: German Tanks against Home-Made Rifles - August 7, 1944 * Chapter Seven: Old Town Must Hold - August 14, 1944 * Chapter Eight: Old Town Falls and the Sewers Become A Highway - September 2, 1944 * Chapter Nine: The Soviets Reach the Vistula and Stop Cold - September 10, 1944 * Chapter Ten: Capitulation - October 3, 1944 The players have no ability within the game to change the overall course of the uprising.  Game play  Grey Ranks is a collaborative role-playing game with no GM, and where each player has one scene for their character per chapter. Each scene in all chapters save the first and last needs resolving, and each chapter is harder to resolve than the previous ones. In order to play you need: * 3-5 players * A set of standard polyhedral dice ranging four sided to twelve sided. Ideally each player should have one of these. * A copy of the grid, used to indicate the characters' mental and emotional health and well-being * A copy of the Radio Lightning broadcasts * A list of the districts in Warsaw in 1944 and brief descriptions of them * Approximately one hour per chapter (commonly broken into three sessions)RPG.net review Although not strictly necessary to play, the game book itself contains notes on Warsaw in the 1940s, guidance towards play, and other useful references. = Character Creation = Before the game each player gives their character a name, a code name, an age, a sex, and a position on the grid. After the first chapter each player chooses something their character holds dear from their faith, their country, their city, their family, their friends, and their first love - and represents whichever they pick with a tangible symbol that may get destroyed in play. The other players then pick two negative reputations for the character that they may turn into positive reputations in play if they survive long enough. The reputations, and the things that characters hold dear may not overlap between player characters. = Play = At the start of each chapter the players pick a mission leader who decided what the mission will be. In the first chapter (the prologue) and the final chapter (the epilogue) the players collaboratively narrate scenes for the surviving characters. In subsequent chapters, the players each have one scene related to the mission for their character, and one personal scene for their character. Each player contributes one die to their personal scene, and one die each to the mission; in order to succeed the players must roll above the chapter number (2-9) multiplied by the number of players rolling. This means that it gets progressively harder to succeed as the game goes on, modelling the rise and fall of the Warsaw resistance. If a player fails but wishes to succeed (or even succeeds and wishes to fail) they may risk the thing they hold dear to re-roll any single die as a twelve sided dice (or as its previous value if they want to fail). At the end of the chapter each character moves on the two-axis grid (love-hate and enthusiasm- exhaustion) based on whether they won or lost their personal mission and whether they won or lost. In each corner is a danger (martyrdom, nervous breakdown, derangement, suicidal depression) and any character that ends up in the same corner square twice is out of the game.

He is a member of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Early life Born on June 1, 1973, Law grew up in Smithtown, New York on Long Island. He graduated with honors from Harvard University, where he majored in sociology and economics. He received his Master of Business Administration from Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business. Career He began writing for Baseball Prospectus in 1997. Unlike many other Baseball Prospectus authors, Law's primary influence was not Bill James, but Eddie Epstein, the writer of the first STATS, Inc. Minor League Scouting Notebook. In 2002, Law was hired by the Toronto Blue Jays as a \\"Consultant to Baseball Operations\\" after impressing Blue Jays' general manager J. P. Ricciardi during the offseason winter meetings. Paul DePodesta had recommended Law to him and Ricciardi asked Law's opinions regarding the approaching Rule 5 draft of that year, and, impressed with Law's answers and explanations, offered him a position with the team. During his time with the Blue Jays, he acted as a major league and minor league scout, contract negotiator, and provided assistance to the team's marketing and sales staffs. Law reached the position of \\"Special Assistant to the GM\\" before resigning in 2006 to work at ESPN. At ESPN, Law works as baseball scouting writer. He writes baseball columns, maintains a blog, provides analysis on radio and television, and holds weekly chats on his blog. He also previously hosted a weekly ESPN podcast, Behind the Dish. On December 29, 2011, Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports reported that Law interviewed for a number of front office positions with the Houston Astros, including the title of Scouting Director. Despite all of this, Keith Law decided to remain with ESPN in order to spend more time with his family. In November 2014, Law got into a day-long Twitter argument with pitcher Curt Schilling over the creation–evolution controversy, defending evolution against Schilling's creationist arguments, after which ESPN decided to suspend Law's Twitter account. ESPN commented that \\"Keith’s Twitter suspension had absolutely nothing to do with his opinions on the subject,\\" but it remains unclear what other motivation is behind the act, since the conversation between Schilling and Law reportedly \\"never really turned hostile\\", with many reading the details feeling that his suspension was \\"ridiculous\\". When a bystander ordered him to 'Stick to baseball', Law replied \\"No, I won't. Science is infinitely more important\\", later emphasizing that \\"I haven't criticized or questioned anyone's faith. I oppose anti-science, that's all\\". Law concluded by tweeting \\"Eppur si muove.\\", meaning \\"And yet it moves\\", apocryphally said to have been uttered by Galileo when the Catholic Church forced him to recant his statements about heliocentricity.http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/11/28/after- a-brief-suspension-for-defending-evolution-espns-keith-law-returns-to-twitter- with-this-gem/ In 2017 Law released his book on baseball statistics titled Smart Baseball: The Story behind the Old Stats That Are Ruining the Game, the New Ones That Are Running It, and the Right Way to Think about Baseball. His second book The Inside Game: Bad Calls, Strange Moves, and What Baseball Behavior Teaches Us About Ourselves was released in April 2020. =Baseball Writers' Association of America= In December 2007, Law was denied admission to the Baseball Writers' Association of America, members of whom vote for Baseball Hall of Fame candidates and several annual awards including the Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Award. While 16 other internet baseball columnists were admitted in their first year of eligibility, ESPN's Law and Rob Neyer were refused due to the BBWAA's perception that Law and Neyer did not attend enough games in person. In 2008, however, Law was admitted to the BBWAA along with Neyer and Baseball Prospectus writers Christina Kahrl and Will Carroll. On his 2009 NL Cy Young ballot, Law listed Javier Vázquez in front of Adam Wainwright and did not include Chris Carpenter on the three name ballot, which elicited strong reactions from St. Louis Cardinals fans. Law stated, \\"Carpenter's innings total was the main reason he ended up off my ballot. He pitched extremely well when on the mound, but not well enough to close the value gap between him and the three pitchers I listed, each of whom threw at least 27 innings more than Carpenter\\".http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=4671356&name;=law_keith =The Athletic= On January 6, 2020, Law joined The Athletic as a Senior Baseball Writer. Other interests Law's main interests outside of baseball are cuisine, German-style board games, and literature. For these other interests, he maintains the personal website meadowparty.com, which includes a food and literature blog, and reviews of board games. On the Season Four disc of Home Movies, he recorded two commentary tracks. Law currently lives in Delaware with his family. Law has been outspoken about his struggle and treatment of his anxiety disorder.http://stigmafighters.com/stigma-fighters- keith-law/ References External links *Law's ESPN columns *Law's ESPN.com blog Category:American sportswriters Category:ESPN.com Category:Living people Category:Toronto Blue Jays executives Category:American people of Italian descent Category:Writers from New York (state) Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Tepper School of Business alumni Category:1973 births Category:People from Smithtown, New York ","title":"Keith Law"},{"id":"14035117","text":"This is a list of fictional countries supposedly located in North, Central, or South America.

He was Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1870 and 1892. Early life He was born on September 20, 1824, in the Town of Herkimer, in Herkimer County, New York. He was educated at the Herkimer Academy, and graduated from Union College in Schenectady in 1845. After graduation, he became Principal of Herkimer Academy, and at the same time studied law with Charles Gray in Herkimer. He was admitted to the bar in 1848, and practiced in partnership with his brother Samuel in their law firm in the Village of Herkimer, S. & R. Earl. As a young lawyer, Earl was active in local politics and civic affairs. In 1849, he acquired a weekly newspaper, the \\"Herkimer Democrat\\", and served as its editor and publisher. In the same year, he was elected a supervisor of Herkimer, then trustee of the village, and again supervisor in 1860. He was also elected First Judge and Surrogate of the Herkimer County Court in 1855, and served from 1856 to 1859. In 1868, he served as President of the New York Democratic State Convention. New York Court of Appeals In 1869, he was elected on the Democratic ticket to the seat on the New York Court of Appeals to which Henry R. Selden had been elected in 1863. After Selden's resignation in January 1865, the seat had been occupied by John K. Porter (appointed 1865, elected for the remainder of the term in Nov. 1865, resigned Dec. 1867) and Lewis B. Woodruff (appointed 1868). Earl would have served for the remaining two years of the term, but was legislated out of office on July 4, 1870, when the Court of Appeals was completely re-organized. As the elected judge with the shortest remaining term, as was the rule established by the New York State Constitution of 1846, he was Chief Judge during his half year in office in 1870. From 1870 to 1875, he was one of the Commissioners of Appeals. On November 5, 1875, he was appointed by Governor Samuel J. Tilden to the Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Martin Grover. At the New York state election, 1876, he was re-elected on the Democratic ticket for a full fourteen-year term, and was re-elected with Republican endorsement at the New York state election, 1890. On January 19, 1892, he was appointed Chief Judge again, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of William C. Ruger, and remained on the post until the end of the year. He left the bench at the end of 1894 when he reached the constitutional age limit of 70 years. While serving on the Court of Appeals, Earl received honorary LL.D. degrees from Union College in 1874, and from Columbia College in 1887. Life after retirement from bench After retiring from the bench in 1894, Judge Earl returned to his home community of Herkimer, where he joined with several others to form the Herkimer Bank, which became the Herkimer National Bank in 1898. In 1896, Earl founded the Herkimer Historical Society, and as the Society's president contributed numerous research papers and historical essays. He encouraged the youth of Herkimer County by offering prizes for the best essays submitted to the Historical Society. And, 1896 he donated his residence and grounds for the establishment of the Herkimer Free Public Library. While Earl's residence and grounds still existed in 2014, the library was moved in the 1970s to another location in the Village of Herkimer, and renamed the \\"Frank J. Basloe Library\\". He suffered a stroke on November 22, 1902, and died ten days later at his home in the Village of Herkimer. He was buried at the Oak Hill Cemetery there. See also *Riggs v.

Miriello is the director ofhttp://miriellografico.com/mg/ Miriello Grafico and a founding member of the San Diego Chapter of the American Institute of Graphic Arts. In 2008, he was recognized as an AIGA national fellow.  Biography  Miriello studied at Colorado State University and completed his design degree in Italy at La Poggerina, operated by the University of Texas. In 1989, Miriello was instrumental in acquiring an important collection of 300 historical graphic posters from the government of the Soviet Union that depicted contemporary Soviet life in the periods during Perestroika and Glasnost. Working with members of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) San Diego chapter, this exhibition was supported by a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts. The rare collection of posters held at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, showcased political themes, social issues and the arts. The collection then traveled to a variety of U.S. locations, after the fall of the Soviet Union. The posters were designed between 1986 and 1989 by the Union of Soviet Artists members. The original posters were collected and curated by Oleg Savostiuk, Secretary to the Union of Soviet Artists and he attended the original opening in La Jolla. In March 2013, the Soviet Poster Show collection was uncrated at the City Gallery in a new exhibition called Dialogues in downtown San Diego. The Soviet historical posters were featured alongside new works created by contemporary artists, designers and illustrators including Sean Adams, Rafael López, Joel Nakamura and Michael Osborne, among others. To complement their historical counterparts the new posters featured political, social and arts themes as well as a visual or conceptual reference to Soviet culture. Ron Miriello served on the Design Innovation Institute advisory board, the San Diego Center City Advisory Council, Business Roundtable for Education,http://www.sandiego.gov/arts-culture/ Commission for Arts and Culture/San Diego Advisory board member for thehttp://www.sandiegoitalianfilmfestival.com/index.php San Diego Italian Film Festival. In 2008, Ron Miriello, Margo Chase, Rian Hughes and Alex White co- authored the book Really Good Logos Explained critiquing the logo work of top designers. In the text, Miriello discusses how working designers must keep their thinking elastic and pliable and how this requires both right and left brain thinking at the same time. As a child, Miriello was fascinated with globes. A sculptor, he produced 100 sculptures inspired by the metaphor of the world globe which culminated in the 100 Worlds Project exhibit. The exhibit incorporated craftspeople and makers as collaborators, reconnecting the arts with the guild tradition of craft. For this exhibition Miriello produced fifty interpreted globes, using a variety of materials that included antique pipe wrenches, bowling balls, the propellers of boats and corrugated cardboard. The globes were then given to forty San Diego based photographers who spent a week with each sculpture and documented it through personal photography. Their original photographic prints were displayed at the Jett Gallery and included in an exhibition book. In 2016 the globes were exhibited at San Diego's Lindbergh field in Terminal 2. In 2016 he started a bicycle event, 100Miglia, making it possible for cyclists to explore one hundred miles of farm routes and old castles.

It was a mostly marginal phenomenon in the Cold War period, excepting a surge of radical right-wing populism during the early 1970s, and has again attracted some media attention since 2000. World Wars (1914–1945) Switzerland was one of the least likely countries in Europe to succumb to fascism as its democracy had deep roots, it lacked a frustrated nationalism, had a high standard of living, wide distribution of property ownership and a secure economy.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-1945, London, Routledge, 2001, p. 291 Despite this, before World War II a number of far right and fascist groups existed in Switzerland. The earliest of these was Eugen Bircher's Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband, established in 1918. Gaining some influential members, it lasted until 1947. It was linked to the Heimatwehr, an anti- Semitic group established in 1925.Alan Morris Schom, 'A Survey of Nazi and Pro-Nazi Groups in Switzerland: 1930-1945' Dr. Jakob Lorenz's Aufgebot Bewegung, formed in 1933, enjoyed some lower middle class support by advocating collaboration with Nazi Germany. Franz Burri advocated a similar closeness and led a variety of movements including Bund der Schweizer in Grossdeutschland (1941), Nationalsozialistische Schweizerbund and the Nationalsozialistische Bewegung in der Schweiz (both 1942).Schom By 1937 there were effectively three main language-specific groups i.e. the National Front (formed 1933) for German speakers, the Union Nationale for French speakers and the Lega Nazionale Ticinese for Italian speakers, with the latter two active in Romansh areas. Of these, only the National Front managed to gain any real support.R. Griffin, The Nature of Fascism, London: Routledge, 1993, p. 129 Other minor, pro-Nazi, fascist or far right groups that were active included: * The Swiss branch of the NSDAP under Wilhelm Gustloff. * Bund für Volk und Heimat – a Christian ultra-right group under Rudolf Grob, Samuel Haas and Professor Walter Wili. * Bund Treuer Eidgenossen Nationalsozialistischer Weltanschauung – a more avowedly pro-Nazi breakaway from the National Front under former leader Rolf Henne. This group was superseded by the Nationale Bewegung der Schweiz in 1940. * Eidgenössische Front – an anti-Semitic group ran by Heinrich Eugen Wechlin between 1933 and 1938. * Eidgenössische Soziale Arbeiter-Partei – a Zurich-based group active from 1936 to 1940 under Ernst Hofmann. * Faschistischer Bewegung der Schweiz – the movement of Benito Mussolini follower Arthur Fonjallaz. It grew from his previous groups Helvetic Action Against Secret Societies and the Federation Fasciste Suisse. * Katholische Front and Front der Militanten Katholiken – two pro-Nazi Roman Catholic movements led by brothers Karl and Fridolin Weder. * Nationalsozialistische Schweizerische Arbeitspartei – a mimetic Nazi group, also known as the Volksbund, led by Major Ernst Leonhardt.Schom, A number of pro-Nazi parties and organizations persisted well into World War II. In the course of the war, however, these pro-Nazi became very unpopular and were effectively driven underground, the National Front and its successor group the Eidgenössische Sammlung were banned in 1943. Cold War period (1946–1989) After World War II, far-right politics re-emerged in the guise of radical right-wing populism against Überfremdung in the early 1970s, notably orchestrated by James Schwarzenbach. The first surge of right-wing populism subsided in the late 1970s, but it survived in the form of a few far-right fringe parties, the Nationale Aktion (1961–1990), a right-wing group that attracted a few neo-fascists to its ranksGriffin, p. 167 and the Republicans (1971–1990), in 1990 merged into the Schweizer Demokraten and the Freedom Party (founded 1984 as Autopartei \\"automobile party\\" in a backlash against the emerging Green movement). A Liberal Ecologist Party also existed for a time, espousing a far right take on environmentalism that recalled ecofascism.Griffin, p. 171 The end of the war saw the emergence of neo-Nazism in Switzerland, with the Volkspartei der Schweiz of Gaston-Armand Amaudruz the most important group. A Swiss Nazi Party, also existed at a minor level and during a 1970 trial evidence was heard that it maintained links to Al Fatah.G. Harris, The Dark Side of Europe – The Extreme Right Today, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1994 François Genoud was also a member and he helped to maintain links between the group and both Hjalmar Schacht and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.M.A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens, London: Warner Books, 1998, p. 181 From a more neo-fascist bent, Switzerland also played host to a revived Cercle Proudhon, with the group working closely with France's Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne.Griffin, p. 169 New Right (1990–present) From the mid-1990s, these remaining fringe parties were mostly absorbed by the expanding Swiss People's Party (SVP), which had initiated a revival of right-wing populism from the late 1980s. The party is mainly considered to be national conservative, but it has also been variously identified as \\"extreme right\\"P. Ignazi, Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 234 and \\"radical right-wing populist\\",H-G Betz, 'Xenophobia, Identity Politics and Exclusionary Populism in Western Europe', L. Panitch & C. Leys (eds.), Socialist Register 2003 - Fighting Identities: Race, Religion and Ethno-nationalism, London: Merlin Press, 2002, p. 198 reflecting a spectrum of ideologies present among its members. In its far right wing, it includes members such as Ulrich Schlüer, Pascal Junod, who heads a 'New Right' study group and has been linked to Holocaust denial and neo- Nazism.Antisemitism and Racism in Switzerland 2000-1 Antisemitism and Racism in Switzerland 1999-2000 The neo-Nazi and white power skinhead scene in Switzerland has seen significant growth in the 1990s and 2000s, growing from an estimated number of 200 active individuals in 1990 to 1,200 in 2005 (or from 0.003% to 0.016% of the total population).2006 report on domestic security This development occurred in parallel with the increasing presence of right-wing populism due to SVP campaigns, and is reflected in the foundation of the Partei National Orientierter Schweizer in 2000, which resulted in an improved organisational structure of the neo-Nazi and white supremacist scene. The PNOS has succeeded in having a member elected to municipal governments in Langenthal in 2004 and Günsberg the following year.Searchlight, June 2005, p. 30 The Swiss Federal Police in 2005 counted 111 right extremist incidents in 2005, estimating that the number of individuals involved in the \\"right extremist scene\\" grew by 20% to from ca. 1,000 to 1,200. At the same time, the number of loosely involved sympathisers fell from 700 to 600, so that the overall number of people involved with right extremist activism grew by some 6% from 1,700 to 1,800 people (or 0.024% of the total population).2005 report on domestic security , p. 20. Far-right activists briefly won the attention of mainstream media for disrupting the 2005 celebration of the Swiss national holiday on the Rütli Meadow. The 2006 report2006 report on domestic security, p. 20. reports 109 right extremist incidents, of which 60 involved physical violence (65%). The size of the right extremist scene remains stable at 1,200 active individuals. As opposed to the preceding year, the police reports a significant increase in left extremist incidents, their number rising by 87 to 227, incidents involving physical violence likewise accounting for 65%. Bund Oberland, a group associated with the white power skinhead Blood and Honour network has also been active in the country, especially in the distribution of CDs.Searchlight, December 2005, p. 22 A minor Swiss National Party was briefly active under the leadership of David Mulas, dissolved in 2003. This group was closely linked to the National Democratic Party of Germany. The far-right groups further declined in the 2011 federal elections, the Swiss Democrats remaining the largest with 4,838 votes or 0.20% of the total vote, less than half than in 2007. Smaller groups participating in the elections were the Swiss Nationalist Party in Berne and Vaud (1,198 votes, 0.05%) and Eric Weber's Volksaktion in Basel-Stadt (810 votes, 0.03%). International activism Switzerland's status as the world centre of neutrality has meant that it has sometimes been important in international links for fascists and neo-Nazis. Before the Second World War, Switzerland was pivotal in the concept of fascism as an international phenomenon as it hosted the International Centre for Fascist Studies (CINEF) and the 1934 congress of the Action Committee for the Universality of Rome (CAUR).Griffin, p. 129 Amaudruz's New European Order represented a similar post-war phenomenon from a Swiss base, albeit on a neo-Nazism rather than Italian fascism basis.

It was the first Nektar album to be released in their home country of the United Kingdom. An attempt to recreate the band's live sound, ...Sounds Like This was largely improvised and dominated by extensive instrumental jamming, in contrast to their usual concept and composition-driven albums. The different approach to recording, combined with a number of difficulties with the mixing, resulted in it being the band's heaviest work. Background and recording The idea behind ...Sounds Like This, conceived by the band themselves, was to create an album that recreated Nektar's live sound while avoiding the various recording and sound quality difficulties inherent to live recordings. To this end, on 12 October 1972 the band set up their gear in Dierks Studios and performed for a little over an hour to an audience of just a small group of friends. None of the songs played had been written and rehearsed ahead of the time; some were loosely built on riffs and lyrical concepts that the band had been working on, while others were completely improvised. Dissatisfied with the original master, Nektar and producer Peter Hauke opted to do a series of dubs and re-recordings, which took place in February. Of the tracks recorded during the original October session, only \\"Wings\\" appeared on the album in its original form, without dubbing or additional takes. Two songs from the original session (\\"Sunshine Down on the City\\" and \\"It's All in Ya Mind\\") were cut from the album entirely, and new songs that had been written in the intervening four months were added.

Loyal only to himself and his own ambitions, he switched sides several times, and ended up conquering much of Macedonia for the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan () before being assassinated by the Byzantines. Biography =Family origins and early career= Syrgiannes was born about 1290. He was named after his father or possibly grandfather, a Cuman leader who became megas domestikos (commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army) under Emperor Andronikos II. At the time there were many Cumans in the Empire, who settled during the reign of John III Doukas Vatatzes (). The elder Syrgiannes's original name was Sytzigan (from Cuman-Turkic Sïčğan, \\"mouse\\"); it was Hellenized to Syrgiannes (\\"master John\\") when he was baptized. The younger Syrgiannes's mother was Eugenia Palaiologina, a member of the ruling Palaiologos family and niece of Emperor Michael VIII (). Conscious of the prestige of his mother's family name, young Syrgiannes chose to use that in order to advance himself in the imperial hierarchy. Syrgiannes also had a sister, Theodora, who married Guy de Lusignan, later King of Armenian Cilicia as Constantine II.. Syrgiannes makes his appearance in history in 1315, when he was placed as military governor of a Macedonian province near the Serbian border. Despite the existing treaties, and against his instructions, he resolved to attack both Serbia and Epirus. Relieved of his post, he rebelled, was captured and imprisoned. Sometime before 1320, however, he was eventually pardoned and appointed to a command in Thrace. =Support of Andronikos III= Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos (). In his turbulent career, Syrgiannes went from being one of his principal supporters to his foe. In 1320, following the death of Michael IX Palaiologos (eldest son of Andronikos II and co-emperor from 1295 on), his son Andronikos III was crowned as co-emperor by Andronikos II. Although initially popular with his grandfather, the younger Andronikos and his entourage of young nobles, to which Syrgiannes belonged, had by that time caused the elder emperor's displeasure by their extravagance. Their excesses culminated in the mistaken-identity murder of the young emperor's younger brother, Manuel; enraged, the elder Andronikos annulled his grandson's titles, and a deep personal rift was opened between the two. At that time, Syrgiannes and John Kantakouzenos bought for themselves governorships in Thrace, where discontent with the old emperor was rife, and they quickly mobilized support for the younger Andronikos. Together with Alexios Apokaukos and Theodore Synadenos, they prepared to overthrow the aged Andronikos II in favour of his grandson. In Easter 1321, the younger Andronikos came to Adrianople, and the uprising broke out. Syrgiannes led a large army towards the capital, forcing the old emperor to negotiate. Consequently, on 6 June 1321, an agreement was reached which partitioned the empire. Young Andronikos III was recognized as co- emperor and given Thrace to govern as a quasi-appanage, setting up his court at Adrianople, while Andronikos II continued to rule from the capital, Constantinople, as senior emperor. Syrgiannes was dissatisfied with the new arrangements, feeling that he had not been sufficiently rewarded for his support of Andronikos III. He also resented the greater favour shown by the young emperor to Kantakouzenos, and developed a fierce rivalry with the latter. Furthermore, chroniclers also report a story whereby Andronikos III attempted to seduce Syrgiannes's wife. In December 1321, Syrgiannes switched sides, fleeing to Constantinople. Rewarded with the lofty title of megas doux, he convinced Andronikos II to resume the war against his grandson.. In July 1322, however, another agreement was reached between the two Andronikoi, which left Syrgiannes in an awkward position. His own schemes having failed, he began plotting to murder the aged Andronikos II and seize the throne for himself. The plot was foiled, however, and Syrgiannes was sentenced to life imprisonment. =Governorship in Macedonia, defection to the Serbs and death= In 1328, Andronikos III finally overthrew his grandfather and established himself as sole emperor. Syrgiannes was freed, and was able to restore himself to Andronikos's favour, to the extent that in late 1329 he was entrusted with the important governorship of Thessalonica, the Empire's second-largest city, and of western Macedonia and Albania. There, he was again suspected of plotting against Kantakouzenos, this time with the emperor's mother, Empress Maria. She lived in Thessalonica, and was supposed to keep an eye on Syrgiannes; instead, she became so infatuated with him that she had him adopted. Following the death of the Empress in late 1333, the plot was uncovered and Syrgiannes was arrested and brought to Constantinople to face charges of treason. Syrgiannes, however, managed to escape and flee to the court of the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan. Dušan put Syrgiannes at the head of a large Serbian force, with which he invaded Byzantine Macedonia in 1334. Syrgiannes's abilities as a general, his knowledge of the Byzantine army's dispositions and the friendships he had maintained with several local Byzantine officers resulted in the swift capture of many important Byzantine cities, including Ohrid, Prilep, Strumica, and Kastoria. The road was open for an advance towards Thessalonica, and Syrgiannes's army encamped before the walls of the city, facing a Byzantine relief force. Both sides remained encamped confronting each other for several days, but on 23 August 1334, Syrgiannes was lured away from his camp with only a few retainers and murdered by Sphrantzes Palaiologos, a Byzantine general who had defected on purpose to the Serbian camp a few days earlier. With the loss of their principal military leader, the Serbs settled for a negotiated peace with the Byzantines, which was very advantageous for them as they were left in possession of most of the cities won by Syrgiannes in northern Macedonia. Appraisal Syrgiannes's ambition, inveterate plotting, and multiple betrayals made him one of the darkest figures of the era in the eyes of both contemporary and later historians: the 14th-century historian Nikephoros Gregoras compared his flight to Serbia with Themistocles's flight to the Persians, while Donald Nicol likened him to Alcibiades and Angeliki Laiou called him \\"the most evil presence\\" of the civil war.

Licensed to Texarkana, Arkansas, United States, it serves the Texarkana area. The station is owned by Townsquare Media. The radio station was originally built in 1951 by W. Decker Smith, MD, as an investment. It was affiliated with the CBS Radio Network. His son, James K. Smith, ran the station for many years as the general manager. The studios were established in the same building at 119 E. 6th as the Smith Clinic medical practice. Well into the 1980s, until the building was destroyed by a fire, remnants of the old medical practice remained on the upper floors including X-ray equipment and examination tables (the broadcasting studios were on the lower floors). In 1989, the younger Smith, who had suffered a heart attack and was approaching retirement, sold the station to corporate interests along with its sister station, KOSY-FM (Y102), which was broadcasting a contemporary hit format at the time of sale. The new owners changed the call signs to KKYR and implemented a country music format, which exists to this day. The transmitter site of KOSY remains on the city's southern border off Line Ferry Road but KKYR began transmitting from a taller shared tower near Robinson Road in Texarkana shortly after the sale. This new broadcast tower could properly accommodate the 100,000 watt Class C license held by Smith since the station's sign-on in 1965 (the station operated at only 35,000 watts for many years). The KOSY transmitter site on Line Ferry Road has two towers, constructed for a nighttime directional signal of 500 watts.

Orai channels play an important role in the activation of T-lymphocytes. The loss of function mutation of Orai1 causes severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in humans The mammalian orai family has two additional homologs, Orai2 and Orai3. Orai proteins share no homology with any other ion channel family of any other known proteins. They have 4 transmembrane domains and form hexamers.  Structure and function  Orai channels are activated upon the depletion of internal calcium stores, which is called the \\"store-operated\\" or the \\"capacitative\\" mechanism. They are molecular constituents of the \\"calcium release activated calcium currents\\" (ICRAC). Upon activation of phospholipase C by various cell surface receptors, inositol trisphosphate is formed that releases calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. The decreased calcium concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum is sensed by the STIM1 protein. STIM1 clusters upon the depletion of the calcium stores and forms \\"puncta\\", and relocates near the plasma membrane, where it activates Orai1 via protein- protein interaction. In 2012, a 3.35-angstrom (Å) crystal structure of the Drosophila Orai channel, which shares 73% sequence identity with human Orai1 within its transmembrane region, was published. The structure, thought to show the closed state of the channel, revealed that a single channel is composed of six Orai subunits, with the transmembrane domains arranged in concentric rings around a central aqueous pore formed exclusively by the first transmembrane helix of each subunit. Transmembrane helices 2 and 3 surround TM1 and are hypothesized to shield it from the surrounding lipid bilayer and provide structural support. The fourth transmembrane helix forms the outermost layer.

Ilgaz started writing poetry during his junior school years and evolved into one of the prolific social-realist writers of the 20th-century Turkish literature. His poems are considered prime examples of socialist-realistic writing. While he has never really been a partisan of political ideologies, the fact that he has written about the sufferings of the people placed him at a left wing perspective. Like other writers of his time, Ilgaz was imprisoned as a result of one of his publications. In addition to his writing, he led an accomplished career as a lecturer in Turkish literature.

It plays the classic rock format. The station is currently owned by Townsquare Media. Its studios are shared with its other five sister stations in West Shreveport (one mile west of Shreveport Regional Airport), and the transmitter is in Greenwood, Louisiana. History KTUX began life on April 1, 1985, debuting as a contemporary hit radio station, \\"Fun Radio Tux 99.\\" The month before Tux 99 officially debuted, the 98.9 frequency continuously played the 1966 novelty song by Napoleon XIV \\"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!\\" The first official song played on Tux 99 was \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" by Prince. The KTUX studios were originally located at the transmitter site near Greenwood, LA. The original on-air lineup included Bobby Cook on the AM Drive, Cornstock at Middays, John Steel on the PM Drive, Machine Gun Dave 7pm to midnight, and The Moondog on overnights. Within the bounds of Top 40 hits, TUX99 occasionally altered the ratios of its playlist through the early 1990s; each of these \\"format changes\\" was preceded by a stunting event, with the station playing the Napoleon XIV novelty song on constant repeat for several days. The song was occasionally played on normal rotation as well, acting as a sort of theme song for the station. In its earliest incarnation, with Top 40 jingles, \\"Tux 99\\" often took its musical cues from MTV rather than the Billboard charts. For example, \\"Home Sweet Home\\" by Mötley Crüe could be heard on \\"Tux 99.\\" While never released to Top 40 radio, nor available as a 45 RPM single, \\"Home Sweet Home\\" spent months in summer 1985 on the top of the MTV charts in the U.S. In 1986 KTUX moved its studios and most of its operations to Shreveport even though the city of license remained Carthage. Around 1993 the station underwent a drastic format and branding change. This format switch was to a wide-ranging rock format, with modern rock, alternative rock and grunge influences. This format soon yielded to a more traditional album-oriented hard rock format, accompanied by a stunting event which featured Billy Idol's \\"Rebel Yell\\" on repeat, in anticipation of the station's new \\"The Rebel Rocker, 99X\\" slogan. During the 1990s, KTUX mixed several different rock formats, ranging from AOR to active rock, alternative rock, and even classic rock. By 1998 KTUX had a strong alternative rock lean. This changed in November 1998, when the station switched to an \\"All-Led Zeppelin\\" format as a stunt. The stunt lasted for a week. After which, KTUX was tweaked to a more uniform Active Rock format with the slogan changed to \\"Real Rock Radio 99X.\\" This change lasted for about a year until Clear Channel acquired the station. In November 1999, the station featured yet another change focusing less on contemporary rock and more on classic rock. The name of the station was changed to \\"Rock 99.\\" As Clear Channel took over operations, The Bob & Tom Show was added to mornings on KTUX. By fall 2000, KTUX \\"Rock 99\\" evolved back to Active Rock. This name lasted only for a few years, in which it was switched back to \\"99X\\" in late Summer 2002. Upon returning to the \\"99X\\" name, KTUX began to incorporate a more broadly focused Rock format. KTUX evolved back to an aggressive more current-based Active Rock format once again in 2012. About this time, KTUX switched syndicated morning shows from Bob & Tom to Free Beer & Hotwings. In its final couple years, KTUX toned down its focus on newer music a bit and played many 90s tracks along with some classic rock. The \\"99X\\" monicker was dropped on New Years Day 2018. KTUX continued with the same format for a week identifying as \\"98.9\\" and teasing the start of the Walton & Johnson Show and a \\"brand new radio station.\\" On January 8, 2018, KTUX rebranded as \\"Highway 98.9\\". A new Classic Rock format accompanied the addition of perennial market-leading morning show, Walton & Johnson—The Radio Gawds.

The Yatasi provided bear fat and buffalo and deer hides for cloth, blankets, metal tools and weapons, combs, glass beads, flints, ammunition, vermillion dye, mirrors, and copper.Carter, 182-3 On 21 April 1770, French-born Indian agent of Spanish Louisiana, Athanase De Mézières y Clugny (c. 1715–1779) presented the Yatasi chief with a medal and presents from the King of Spain.Carter, 183 That day the Kadohadacho and Yatasi both agreed to allow Spain proprietorship of their lands and promised not to supply the Comanche, Wichita, Tawakoni, and Kichai tribes with weapons or ammunition.Swanton, 70 After the United States took over control of Louisiana, Dr. John Sibley became the Indian agent who oversaw relations with the Yatasi and neighboring tribes.Perttula, 39 They continued participating in the fur trade, providing bear, deer, beaver, otter, and other furs. Language The Yatasi spoke a Caddoan language and were culturally similar to surrounding groups such as the Adai. The Yatasi language is attested only in a nine-page vocabulary collected by Albert Gatschet in the 1880s and now archived at the National Anthropological Archives.

Rumely, publisher of the New York Evening Mail, has been arrested and placed under heavy bail, charged with operating the paper with funds supplied by the Imperial German Government. The facts of the care are intricate and numerable. The primary charge lodged against Rumely was that of perjury, as he filed an affidavit with the Alien Property Custodian stating that the \\"Mail\\" was an American owned paper. Professor Rumely is shown on the left, in the custody of a Federal agent. Edward Aloysius Rumely (1882-1964) was a physician, educator, and newspaper man from Indiana.  Education  Rumely was born in La Porte, Indiana, in 1882. He attended University of Notre Dame, Oxford University and the University of Heidelberg. He graduated from the University of Freiburg, where he received his M.D. in 1906.  Interlaken School  It is said that while he studied in Germany he lived on nuts, herbs and other uncooked foods and wore sandals and scanty clothes, under the influence of views espoused by Leo Tolstoy. But he came back with every appearance of normality and founded the Interlaken School at La Porte, the school where boys did all their own work, from carpentry up. Rumely married one of the teachers at Interlaken in 1910, Fanny Scott. The Interlaken School closed in 1918 due to anti-German sentiments associated with World War I. Isamu Noguchi was one of the last students to enroll at Interlaken before it closed.  Family business  While running the school, Rumely was also active in the family tractor business. He used his technological interest to develop the Rumely Oil Pull Farm Tractor,History which burned kerosene. The Rumely family lost control of their own company due to Edward's mishandling of the company’s assets. The Rumely Hotel was built in 1913 in La Porte when Edward was still in charge of the family business.→Advance-Rumely  Publishing  When the First World War broke out in Europe, Rumely was pro-German and outraged by the pro-British slant of most American newspapers. Thus, in 1915, Rumely bought and became editor-in-chief and publisher of the New York Evening Mail. Since he was a good friend of Theodore Roosevelt, he permitted him to use the newspaper as his mouthpiece. Roosevelt contributed one, and possibly many more, editorials on the subject of the development of the American merchant marine.Theodore Roosevelt, \\"American Preparedness; Germany's Lessons for the United States.\\" New York Evening Mail, Dec. 16, 1915. Reprinted: The Gravest 366 Days; Editorials Reprinted from the Evening Mail of New York City (New York, NY: New York Evening Mail, 1916) pp. 434-440. Two other critics who wrote articles for the paper were Samuel Sidney McClure and H.L. Mencken. Rumely's ownership caused him to be part of three major court cases, mostly due to perjury. In July 1918 Rumely was arrested and convicted of violation of the Trading with the Enemy Act. To get financing for the purchase of the newspaper Rumely was accused of receiving financing from the German government, which Rumely denied, claiming, instead, he had received money to buy the paper from an American citizen in Germany. He had failed to report this when he received the money. President Coolidge granted him a presidential pardon in 1925.Edward A. Rumely Papers, Coll 122, Special Collections & University Archives, University of Oregon Libraries, Eugene, Oregon.  Political activism  From 1926 to 1930 Rumely assisted farmers in obtaining loans through the Agricultural Bond and Credit Company. This began his life's work of educating the public on monetary reform, farm credits in agriculture, and the value of the Constitution. Rumely believed that deflation was destabilizing American agriculture, and that monetary reform was necessary. To this end, in 1932 he formed and served as executive secretary of the Committee for the Nation for Rebuilding Purchasing Power and Prices. This committee sought to lower the gold content of the dollar by fifty percent and, thus, raise commodity prices. This program relied on Populist notions of how money and prices worked and was disputed by most orthodox economists. Franklin Roosevelt followed through on this and took the U.S. off of the gold standard adopted the Agricultural Adjustment Act to support farm prices. Rumely and most members of the Committee for the Nation (as it was soon called) turned against Roosevelt's New Deal policies that they considered anti-business. When Roosevelt proposed to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court many Committee members joined together to oppose the plan in the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government in 1937. Rumely still served as executive secretary of this newly renamed and reformed committee. Rumely was not done yet, in 1941, he helped establish the Committee for Constitutional Government, serving as a trustee and executive secretary. In a mass mailing, the group distributed books and copies of the U.S. Constitution. In a break with Roosevelt over Roosevelt's attempt to increase the size of the Supreme Court, due to the Court's opposition to some of Roosevelt's proposed reforms, Rumely coined the phrase the \\"court packing plan\\" and used the CCG to lobby against the increase. Buchanan's House Select Committee on Lobbying Activities requested the names of those who received the book, believing that a tax evasion movement was involved. Rumely refused to comply, citing the First Amendment, and was convicted. In the landmark decision of United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, the Supreme Court upheld a reversal of conviction made by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  Retirement  Rumely returned to La Porte in 1959 due to ill health. He spent his remaining years promoting cancer education and helped to spread the word on the effectiveness of the Pap smear test. Edward A. Rumely died in 1964.  Bibliography  The Gravest Days; Editorials Reprinted from The Evening Mail of New York City. New York, NY: New York Evening Mail, 1916. Copyright Edward A.

Ecological aspects In the summer this plant floats on the water surface with the leaves just above the surface. In the autumn they become covered with a slimy secretion (calcium carbonate) and the whole plant sinks to the bottom to rise again in the spring. Fossils have been found of this plant. Plants are dioecious, male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. Only the female plant occurs naturally in Britain, though plants with hermaphrodite flowers are also found occasionally. Seed is never set in Britain, the plants increasing mainly by offsets.Clapham, Tutin and Warburg Distribution In Ireland found in shallow waters where it was introduced.Apparently now extinct in the north-east of Ireland.Hackney, P.

Licensed to Dumas, Texas, United States, the station serves the Dumas area. The station is currently owned by Highway 64 Radio, and features programming from ABC Radio . In June 2006, KDDD-FM made a major update to their website. The new site includes local news stories and sports stories for the northern Texas Panhandle.

Duke used and trademarked the popular Ding Dong Daddy from Dumas mascot, that is still used today as part of the station's logo. The trademark was lent to the Dumas Moore County Chamber of Commerce for marketing purposes for the town. Also during this time, rock n roll history was made in 1957, when a local group known as the Rhythm Orchids, featuring Dumas residents Jimmy Bowen, and Don Lanier, both performers on K Triple D AM, teamed up with singer Buddy Knox of Happy, TX in college. At the famed Norman Petty Studios in Clovis, NM they recorded the songs \\"Party Doll\\" and I'm Sticking With You\\", and started the small label Triple D Records, named after the radio station. Roulette Records in New York, bought out the Triple D Records label, and released both songs, with the Buddy Knox and the Orchids name on Party Doll. The song went to #1 on the national charts, while Jimmy Bowen singing lead on I'm Sticking With You, going to #14. The boys were instant stars. Also during this time, Buddy Holly, friends of Knox and the Orchids, performed in concert in downtown Dumas in front of the Evelyn Theater (which still exists) on June 21, 1957. \\"That'll Be The Day\\" was climbing the charts at this time, and went to #1 in October, launching his iconic career. KDDD AM during these years was mostly country, while KDDD FM was beautiful music and then mellow rock, known as Mellow Rock 95.3, with the call letters KMRE. 2004-2019 After struggling for years under different owners, the stations we're saved by local resident, and sports play by play man Darrell Wait. With the help of partners, including Moore County resident and farmer Darren Stallwitz, the stations were saved and made solid again. During this time period, many Dumas Demon and Demonette athletic events have been aired. For their eleven years of ownership KDDD-FM was oldies. In 2018, they wanted to sell the stations, and found a buyer in broadcast veteran Chris Lash of Tennessee. Lash changed the FM station from its long time oldies format, to classic country, known now as Big Country 95.3 K Triple D. Plans are now in the works for KDDD AM, which has been an all ag format, leased by a group in Floyada, TX for the past five years. KDDD AM went all Christmas music on Black Friday, 2019, and will feature a new format on December 26, 2019. KDDD AM, known in the past as the \\"Voice of the High Plains\\", has one of the larger daytime AM signals on the Panhandle of Texas.

Life and career Born Rosa Deschamps in Henderson, Kentucky, she is remembered as one of the great female blues singers of the 1920s and 1930s classic blues era. Her career as an entertainer began in 1913 when she joined her uncle's circus troupe. She married Douglas \\"Slim\\" Henderson in 1918 and began traveling with his Mason-Henderson show. Her career as a musical comedian started during the early 1920s, after she moved to New York, where she performed on Broadway. She eventually also performed in London. Her nine-year recording career began in 1923. During that time she recorded over one hundred songs, sometimes using pseudonyms such as Sally Ritz, Flora Dale, Sarah Johnson, Josephine Thomas, Gladys White, and Mamie Harris. She was accompanied by the Virginians, Fletcher Henderson's Jazz Five, Fletcher Henderson's Orchestra, Fletcher Henderson's Club Alabam Orchestra, the Choo Choo Jazzers, the Kansas City Five, the Three Jolly Miners, the Kansas City Four, the Three Hot Eskimos, and the Four Black Diamonds. She recorded for Ajax Records, Columbia, Paramount, Victor, and Vocalion Records. Her recordings include \\"Afternoon Blues\\" (1923), \\"Doggone Blues\\" (1931), \\"Do Right Blies\\" (1924), \\"He May Be Your Dog But He's Wearing My Collar\\" (1924), and \\"Papa If You Can't Do Better (I'll Let a Better Papa Move In)\\" (1926). She sang the chorus on Fletcher Henderson's May 28, 1924, Vocalion recording of \\"Do That Thing\\". Although there was a marked decline in the number of her recordings after 1926, which was largely due to the death of her husband, Slim, in 1928, she continued performing until 1932, when she took a job in a New York department store. She continued to perform benefit concerts until the 1960s. Henderson had two children and died of a heart attack in 1968. She is unrelated to Fletcher, Horace, Katherine, or Edmonia Henderson.

He is also known as a mainstay of FMW where he was the arch rival of the company's top star Hayabusa and a founding member of the stable Team No Respect included Kintaro Kanemura, Hideki Hosaka, Masao Orihara, Tetsuhiro Kuroda, Mr. Gannosuke, Koji Nakagawa, Horace Boulder, Super Leather, Hido, Gedo and Jado. Career =International Pro Wrestling / International Wrestling Enterprise (1980)= Trained by Isao Yoshihara, Hiromichi Fuyuki made his professional wrestling debut in International Pro Wrestling on May 4, 1980, one week before his 20th birthday. Three months later, IWE folded, and Fuyuki applied to the All Japan Pro Wrestling Dojo. =All Japan Pro Wrestling (1981-1990)= In August 1981, after spending a year training in the dojo, he made his debut in All Japan Pro Wrestling. In November 1984, he went on an excursion of North America, where he made stops in Mexico, Puerto Rico, and San Antonio, Texas, where he wrestled under the name Ricky Fuyuki, in honor of his childhood idol, Riki Choshu. He would also wrestle in Memphis under the name Mr. Helo, teaming with \\"Mr. Shima, and was managed by Tojo Yamamoto. In December 1985, he returned to AJPW, under the name Samson Fuyuki, and began teaming with Toshiaki Kawada, under the team name \\"Footloose\\". As members of Genichiro Tenryu's Revolution Army, Footloose captured the All Asia Tag Team Championship three times between March 9, 1988 and October 20, 1989. Footloose would disband in April 1990, as Kawada teamed with Tiger Mask II, who would later unmask, revealing himself as Mitsuharu Misawa, during a match on May 14, where Fuyuki teamed with Yoshiaki Yatsu. =Super World of Sports (1990-1992)= One of several wrestlers to leave AJPW with Genichiro Tenryu in July 1990, Fuyuki competed in Tenryu's rival promotion Super World of Sports under his real name, also appearing on interpromotional shows for the World Wrestling Federation, with little to no impact. =Wrestle And Romance / Wrestle Association R (1992-1996)= Following the closing of SWS in June 1992, Fuyuki followed Tenryu to WAR. While there, he became one of the top wrestlers and was the main heel. In August 1993, Fuyuki was invited by New Japan Pro Wrestling to participate in the G1 Climax tournament; he defeated Takayuki Iizuka in the first round, but lost to Masahiro Chono in the quarterfinals. In 1994, he would make a brief stint in EMLL in Mexico, once again under the name Samson Fuyuki, feuding with Vampiro. In early 1994, he started teaming with Jado and Gedo as Fuyuki-Gun, with whom he held the WAR World Six-Man Tag Team Championship five times between June 1994 and June 1996, as well as a single reign with UWFI's Yoji Anjo and ECW's Bam Bam Bigelow in October 1996. Lionheart also became a member of Fuyuki-Gun, during their stint in WAR. =Freelance (1996-1997)= Upon leaving WAR in October 1996, he wrestled briefly as a freelancer, wrestling in various promotions such as Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, Big Japan Pro Wrestling, and International Wrestling Association of Japan. Around this time, he started using a shorter variation of his real name, Kodo Fuyuki. =Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling= Fuyuki-Gun (1997) After spending over four months freelancing, Fuyuki found a new home in Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling in February 1997. Fuyuki-Gun made their FMW debut on February 19 by defeating W*ING Alliance members W*ING Kanemura, Hideki Hosaka and Dragon Winger. Fuyuki-Gun initially performed as freelancers on the Japanese independent circuit until they began competing full time for FMW. They appeared at the 8th Anniversary Show, where they defeated Hisakatsu Oya and The Headhunters in a street fight. Fuyuki began feuding with Terry Funk, the leader of Funk Masters of Wrestling, which culminated in a loser leaves FMW match between the two at Fall Spectacular, which Fuyuki lost. As a result, he was forced to leave FMW. He began promoting his own shows under the \\"Fuyuki Army\\" banner. He began competing for FMW full-time on November 15, when Fuyuki-Gun defeated ZEN members Hido, The Gladiator and The Great Fake. They ceased appearing for other promotions and established themselves as a villainous group and entered a rivalry with Atsushi Onita and his ZEN group. Team No Respect (1998-1999) In 1998, Fuyuki formed Team No Respect with several of FMW's leading wrestlers which remained the dominant \\"heel\\" stable until its disbandment in June 2000. From there, he formed multiple stables, which didn't last as long. WEW World Heavyweight Champion (2000-2002) He became the head \\"booker\\" of the promotion in 1999. Attempting to distance the promotion from its earlier reputation for \\"garbage wrestling\\" style, he instead focused more on a \\"sports entertainment\\" approach based heavily on comedic storylines and characters similar to American promotions such as World Wrestling Entertainment. The beginning of the end for FMW was realized after its top star Hayabusa suffered a career-ending injury in October 2001; to make matters worse, Mr. Gannosuke injured both his ankles in January 2002. With Hayabusa and Gannosuke gone, Fuyuki was finally forced to close the promotion in March 2002, one month after it filed for bankruptcy. =World Entertainment Wrestling (2002)= Soon after the close of FMW, Fuyuki opened his own promotion, World Entertainment Wrestling, and briefly appeared in WEW before announcing his retirement after being diagnosed with cancer. Wrestling his last match at a retirement show held by Pro Wrestling Noah, Fuyuki teamed with Yoshinari Ogawa & Mitsuharu Misawa to defeat Tamon Honda, Masao Inoue & Tsuyoshi Kikuchi on April 14, 2002. Death Although continuing to promote events for WEW during the next year, he planned to come out of retirement and had been scheduled to face Shinya Hashimoto before his death. Fuyuki died at approximately 6:50pm on March 19, 2003, after an almost year long battle with intestinal cancer. Fuyuki was perhaps the only wrestler to participate in a match posthumously, as the planned barbed wire deathmatch with Hashimoto indeed went ahead, with Kintaro Kanemura taking Fuyuki's place. After a ceremony in Kawasaki stadium honouring Fuyuki, Hashimoto clutched an urn containing Fuyuki's ashes, and he and Kanemura flung themselves into the barbed wire, both giving Fuyuki a final victory.Pure White: Shinya Hashimoto's Will, Kaoru Fuyuki, 2006 Fuyuki was survived by his wife Kaoru, whom he married in November 1986, and his two daughters. Under his associate Kintaro Kanemura, the promotion reorganized in 2004 as Apache Pro-Wrestling Army, but continued the WEW titles.

It consisted of three four-part series and two Christmas specials, and was performed by Julian Dutton, Peter Baynham, Susie Brann, Alistair McGowan and Mary Elliott-Nelson. It was produced (\\"on stretched goat's vellum\\") by Sarah Smith, the series was nominated for a British Comedy Award for Best Radio Comedy in 1992. The programme was a spoof of boys' comics from the Empire days of the 20th century, \\"a magazine for young and old across the English-speaking world\\" featuring \\"Your old chum\\" the Editor (McGowan) presenting regular features, adventure stories, practical advice, readers letters, etc., complete with advertisements. An enthusiastic young reader (Baynham) could be heard turning (and once accidentally tearing) the pages and occasionally commenting. Much of the humour rested upon anachronistic, politically incorrect attitudes towards such topics as education, class, sex, race, war, and the avuncular, paternalistic style adopted by interwar boys' publications like the Boy's Own Paper in addressing their readers. The reference to whaling in the title was underscored by the illustrated front cover of the magazine, i.e. the opening music/sound effects of the programme. Writing and performances on The Harpoon were of high quality, as was technical production, using 'authentic' voices, sound effects, and music to evoke the era and create the impression of a magazine being read. No commercial release of recordings was made, probably because of the use of copyright music, although episodes from all three series are regularly repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra.  Music  Among other pieces, some music found during the series: *Soldiers of the King by Leslie Stuart (used as opening theme). *Who's Been Polishing the Sun by Noel Gay, sung by Jack Hulbert (closing theme). *Yes, Yes, My Baby Said Yes, Yes by Con Conrad and Cliff Friend sung by Eddie Cantor (incidental music). *Gaudeamus Igitur traditional, (Maisie Drummond's school song)  Signature Sound Effect  A harpoon being fired and apparently hitting some large beast which expires with a theatrical groan that was added in Episode 2.  Recurring Features  As in a real magazine, certain features recur in many \\"issues\\" - * Front-Page - A picture of a whaling ship \\"The Harpoon\\" with \\"oily-skinned sailors greasing their harpoons and dreaming of blubber\\". * Title-Page - \\"..with 6 color plates and numerous black-and-white illustrations..\\", \\"Price, sevenpence ha'penny net\\" (with higher prices for special editions), \\"..available throughout the Empire\\", \\"all rights reserved\\". * Opening Page - introduced by \\"Your Chum, The Editor\\". * A Serial Feature ** Meadowfields Maisie - starring Maisie Drummond - school song \\"Gaudeamus Igitur\\" ** Harpoon Romance - The Brigands of Lanada - an adventure serial \\"in the land of the Dago\\" ** Harpoon Mystery - The Case of The Haunted Moustache * How To - written by the Rev.

Hitler, I'd give up the painting, if I were you, the samples showed little promise, why not try some other hobby, say, public speaking .. few guns might be handy\\". All in a jolly, paternalistic, bombastic and often misogynistic style with sound effects suggesting additional off-mic activities (frequently shooting as he is evidently \\"gun\\" obsessed). His first name is revealed to be Fortinbras when he reads out a letter from a female reader accusing him of abandonment. * Captain Bobbit - Master of the Harpoon.

Using a blend of class styles, she writes letters home with Cockney rhyming-slang expressions but addresses the letter to \\"Mater and Pater\\". Presumably her surname refers to Bulldog Drummond.

The station is currently owned by Monty Spearman and Gentry Todd Spearman, through licensee High Plains Radio Network, Inc. History The 50,000-watt Hereford, Texas-based FM station, which bills itself as \\"Positive and Inspirational 100.5\\", opened its doors in 1998, license out of Dimmitt, TX. It was the brain-child of James \\"Buddy\\" Peeler and his wife Alva Lee. Buddy's background was in secular radio, working 11 years in his hometown of Muleshoe, Texas, then in Hereford, Texas for 30 years. Alva Lee, who loves singing taught piano in both towns. Buddy and Alva Lee originally started their broadcasting company, Liveoak Broadcasting, in 1992 with the purchase of an AM/FM combo in Levelland, Texas, which they later sold in 2000. KNNK signed on the air on June 13, 1998. The staff consisted of Buddy as the on-air announcer, Jack Denison-announcer/engineer, and Alva Lee-traffic and billing. They would later add Darla Parks as their salesperson, after she was hired to paint a mural in the main control room. Buddy started primarily with compact discs produced by Bill Gaither, later adding other gospel artists, including local artists. Ken Branum joined the station in 1999 as a local on-air personality, after Jack Denison left. Terry Smothermon joined the station in 2000 as announcer/engineer and also handled the logging of music into the computer system. Terry left in 2001. Tim Monk joined in 2006, helping out with the mid-morning and afternoon times. His wife Cindy joined the staff in 2008 to replace Darla Parks on the air. Branding The call sign KNNK comes from Buddy and Alva Lee's two grandchildren, Kyle and Nikki; they have since added three more grandchildren. Buddy claims the 100.5 comes from Psalms 100, verses 1-5, which is subtitled \\"A psalm of thanksgiving\\", and begins \\"Make a joyful shout to the Lord, all you lands!\\" KNNK plays mainstream religious music with no radio preachers and no talk shows. That is where KNNK's slogan, \\"The music is the message!\\", originates. Programming Buddy hosted the \\"KNNK Wake Up Show\\" (complete with an actual cowbell) from 6:05 to 7:00 a.m. Daytime programming is devoted to inspirational music, with local information, including obituaries and events from area towns, such as Vega, Canyon, Dimmitt, Friona, Olton and Muleshoe. At 7 p.m. daily \\"Melodies for Moonlight\\", which is instrumentals only, plays, and after midnight, \\"Music Through the Night\\" from Moody Broadcasting plays. Buddy Peeler Buddy was proud to say \\"Real Live Radio Mistakes and All.\\" This was a lighthearted way to say that he was down home and real, and was prone to making a fair number of mistakes. \\"We're just plain folks, native West Texans, with a staff of five people and mom and pop making up 40 percent of the work force,\\" You could find him at the station before sun up and well after sundown. Buddy's favorite phrase was \\"This is the day the Lord has made ... let us rejoice and be glad in it.\\" His weather forecasts in the morning usually had a report of the sunrise the \\"Master Painter\\" had created. Buddy died Feb. 8, 2010. Sale Following Buddy's death, Alva Lee sold KNNK to Monty Spearman and Gentry Todd Spearman for $75,000. The sale, through the Spearmans' High Plains Radio Network, Inc., was consummated on November 30, 2013.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Danny Moynihan, who adapted his own book on the New York art world of the 1990s and titled it based on the Piet Mondrian painting Victory Boogie-Woogie. The film stars Gillian Anderson, Alan Cumming, Heather Graham, Danny Huston, Christopher Lee, Joanna Lumley, Charlotte Rampling, Amanda Seyfried, Stellan Skarsgård and Jaime Winstone. It premiered on 26 June 2009 at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. Plot Boogie Woogie is a comedy of manners, its cast of characters devouring each other in a small world awash with big money. Set against the backdrop of contemporary London and the international art scene, it casts an eye over the appetites and morality of some of its major players. Dealers, collectors, artists, and wannabes vie with each other in a world in which success and downfall rest on a thin edge. Elaine is an art school graduate, and up-and-coming star. Working in the video medium, her works largely consist of recordings of her own sexual exploits, supplemented by conversations she has observed clandestinely or as a third party. Joany is Elaine's muse, and lover (hence a subject in her films) within a volatile, brittle relationship. Elaine is not faithful to her, but is preoccupied with her work, and is ambitious to succeed. The film opens with these two arguing at home. Joany leaves with Elaine in pursuit, and we hear a crash and see a spray of shattered glass behind Joany. Elaine mutters \\"No. Oh no.\\", but begins videoing what she sees. This will be revealed later. Art Spindle is the biggest art dealer in London. Outwardly charming, as a dealer must be, he is in fact greedy and manipulative. Bob and Jean Maclestone are a couple whose marriage is no longer happy. Bob is very wealthy, and collects art voraciously as an investment, with little enthusiasm for its cultural significance. Jean is an art enthusiast, who enjoys Bob's ability to acquire it. Through binoculars from his office, Spindle observes the couple entering the art gallery of his rival, Grossman, much to his disgust. Bob and Jean arrive next at Spindle's gallery. A spin painting that Bob would like to purchase is unavailable, but Spindle suggests another piece. While Bob is out of the room, Jean flirts with Spindle. Beth Freemantle works for Spindle as gallery director. She has ambitions to open her own gallery, and has secretly sought Bob's assistance. Bob has entered her office, where he offers her his recommendations regarding breast augmentation choices she is perusing on her computer. He mentions that he has found a location for her gallery. He also sees a slide of the Rhinegolds' Boogie Woogie painting and decides he must have it. Re-joining his wife and Spindle, he sees the suggested painting (two women measuring each other's large breasts), and wants that too. Alfred and Alfreda Rhinegold are émigrés from Nazi Germany, who have been wealthy but, in retirement, have fallen on hard times. Alfred has amassed a collection of fine modern art, but his wife now tries to persuade him to accept the purchase offers they receive from Spindle to raise funds. Their butler, Robert, also encourages him to sell. Alfred is especially determined never to sell the Mondrian painting, which gives the film its title, because he bought it from the artist in person. Dewey Dalamanatousis is an art enthusiast and friend of Elaine's. Initially, he acts as her promoter. Together with Joany, the three of them attend an exhibition at the Spindle gallery. Paige Oppenheimer is another art enthusiast. At first meeting, we see Paige rollerblading through London, past the Rhinegolds' home in Lower Bond Street, over the River Thames, and to the Spindle gallery. Camera angles invite us to appreciate her obvious sex appeal. Jo Richards is a conceptual artist, whose reputation is beginning to fade. He enjoys the sound of his own voice, and the opportunities that being an artist give him to seduce women. He arrives at the gallery at the same time as Paige, opening the door for her and watching her walk inside. We discover that gallery director Beth is his girlfriend and he asks to borrow money from her. From across the room, Jean Maclestone catches Jo's eye, and he looks back at her with a wry smile. Jean asks Beth to introduce her to Jo. Dewey introduces himself and his companions to Jo (who has forgotten his previous meeting with Dewey and does not impress the women). Instead, Elaine warms to Beth, briefly videos her and invites her to visit Elaine's workplace. Dewey begs Beth for a meeting with Art Spindle. Spindle is in his office, completing the hiring of Paige to work for him. We discover that Spindle knows Paige's father, another collector. Reluctantly, Spindle agrees to spare five minutes to see Dewey. Dewey proposes to curate a show of his own devising at the Spindle gallery. Spindle feigns interest, but as Dewey leaves, he discards the explanatory portfolio. Dewey realises he did not leave a business card, and goes back into the office, where he sees his portfolio in the bin. Later, in a fashionable bar, Dewey laments his bad luck to Elaine (she's videoing as usual). He blames her presence for his failure to keep a boyfriend, but she is distracted by \\"cute\\" Charlotte Bailey, who works at another art museum. Elaine and Charlotte leave the bar together, and video their encounter at Elaine's flat. Leaving the gallery after her successful job interview, Paige reattaches her rollerblades, and Jo takes the opportunity to introduce himself. Later, we see Paige rollerblading through a park. She feels a pain in her midriff, causing her to fall. Bob and Beth visit the location of her prospective gallery, where they kiss. Later, Elaine is showing Beth her videos at the Spindle gallery. Beth is impressed. At the Maclestones' home, Bob is rearranging his collection, giving extra space to his Brâncuși. Jean argues that it looked better before. She pronounces the artist's name in a commonplace way, but Bob insists that it have an authentic Romanian pronunciation. Spindle calls to offer Bob the Boogie Woogie for a higher price than he'd offered the Rhinegolds. He also mentions that he has hired Paige. She limps into his office, and while he dictates a letter to Alfreda, he observes the injury to her leg. He applies ointment, but his hands wander between her legs, causing her to exclaim that she would treat herself later. At that moment, Beth walks in with a message and sees them in the compromising situation. At Jo's workspace. He is dictating notes to himself while lifting a dumbell. At a knock, he abandons the writing, snorts a line of white powder and answers the door. Jean is there. Some of the pieces of work he shows her require the observer to adopt a particular stance giving his hands the opportunity to wander over her from behind and a sexual encounter ensues. Beth is visiting Bob at his office. He asks her if she has ever used an explicit sculpture by the Chapman brothers for sexual gratification, and offers to demonstrate. She suggests reverting their relationship to a strictly professional one, but they proceed to intimacy instead. Back at the Spindle gallery, Art has received Beth's resignation. He resents her betrayal and threatens to make life difficult for her, dismissing her angrily. With her back to the closed door, she smiles in delight. He instructs his accounts department to stop all commissions due to her, audit her expenses, block her password, and terminate her mobile phone. In a bar across town, Spindle is hosting a party to celebrate the success of the current show. Beth is among the group and he thanks her for her efforts while explaining to the others that she is leaving the gallery. Elaine arrives, videoing the party. Dewey finds himself ignored. Elaine and Beth visit the bathroom to do drugs together, and Beth proposes replacing Dewey as Elaine's promoter. Jo invites Paige to visit his workspace, and since his intentions are clear to Jean, she intervenes between them, suggesting that Jo accompany her on a planned trip to New York. They visit the men's room where she performs fellatio. They are almost caught by Bob, and one of Jean's shoes falls under the cubicle partition, where a smiling Bob returns it. At home later, Jean asks Bob for a divorce. Bob accepts without hesitation, and she is upset by that. They argue about how long they've been together, he remarks casually that she seems interested in \\"the artist\\", and he also notices that her shoes look familiar. She leaves for Spindle's home, where she hopes to find refuge and advice. At Elaine's, she is talking with Dewey. She gives him a generous gift, but follows it up with the termination of their business relationship. Dewey takes it badly. Paige is visiting Jo's workspace, where he uses his art installations to attempt a seduction. She declines it. Although a butler to the Rhinegolds, the shadowy Robert Freign is also an amateur artist. He advises Alfreda that Spindle's offer for the Mondrian is too low. Later on, Spindle visits the Rhinegold home, meeting Robert secretly. They agree an improved arrangement, whereby Spindle will increase his offer for the Boogie Woogie and pay to insure it for an even greater amount. Robert gifts Spindle one of his own paintings. Later, Robert phones Spindle and tells him that an even greater offer has been received. Emille is a friend of Jean's, who has experience of three marriages and lucrative divorces. They meet for lunch to discuss Jean's split from Bob. The Maclestones own several houses around the world, but Emille recommends taking possession of their art collection instead. She also recommends not leaving evidence of her relationship with Jo, such as a flight and hotel stay in New York. Bob has the mirror conversation with his lawyer, and when he discovers Jean wants the art he suggests selling it all to avoid giving her a moral victory. He engages Spindle to arrange the sale, demanding strict secrecy from Jean, to which Spindle agrees. Paige has been promoted to be Beth's replacement as director. Bob has bought her flowers by way of congratulation, and invites her to dinner later in the week. Dewey arrives at Elaine's flat (he is her upstairs neighbour). Elaine makes Joany get out of her bath to answer the door, then videos the conversation. Dewey threatens to commit suicide, Joany doesn't believe him. Later, Dewey accosts Elaine in the street and demands to know why she is avoiding him, but gets no satisfaction. To complete his deal for the Boogie Woogie, Spindle visits the Rhinegolds, bringing a box of Alfred's \\"favourite\\" cigars as a gift. The unhappy Alfred directs him to a table where many similar boxes lie. Spindle tells Alfreda that he is disappointed they had entertained the increased offer. He assumes it came from his rival, Grossman, and tells her that the other gallery owner has cashflow problems and so should not be trusted to bid. Alfreda tells him that the other offer had come from Bob Maclestone, and shows him the letter. Alfred insists that he will still not sell the painting at any price. Spindle increases the amount again, but is dismissed. In the taxi after their dinner date, Paige tells Bob that she is ill. They complete their journey, but Bob discovers her unconscious in the bathroom. He cannot resist pulling her dress aside to enjoy a glimpse of her \\"spectacular\\" breasts, but calls the ambulance anyway. Surgery reveals the remains of an unborn twin that had always been hidden within Paige. The doctor believes the waiting Bob to be Mr Oppenheimer, and calls him into an office to explain Paige's condition. Bob asks to see the remains of the twin, and evidently takes it home. Later, at the Spindle gallery, Bob reveals a gift box to the now-recovered Paige. Within is the twin, suspended in formaldehyde, which he proudly explains he has had Damien (Hirst) \\"make a piece of\\". Her perplexed reaction passes over his head. Jean flies home after her New York trip and is appalled to discover the house is empty of art. Jo and Beth are in bed at his flat. It seems that she had, indeed, undergone the breast augmentation she considered near the beginning of the film. Jo found himself unable to perform, blaming tiredness from the transatlantic flight, but Beth suspects the true reason is scarring due to the surgery. The telephone answering machine records Beth's voice complaining about her art loss and demanding his help. Beth realises his sexual betrayal and cancels her promise to arrange his art show. Jean confronts Spindle at home about his part in the art sale. Among her accusations is that he had been caught (by Beth in his office) in a sexual position with Paige. A naked man emerges from Art's bedroom demanding to know the truth (we have only seen ambiguous glimpses of his lover before this). At Elaine's flat, she and Beth are drinking and sharing a cigarette. Beth complains about Jo's behaviour, including the effect her scars had had on him. Elaine is fascinated to see Beth's breasts, and despite Beth's gentle protestations, Elaine then seduces her (which is captured by the nearby video camera). Back at the Rhinegolds', Alfred falls asleep holding the butt of a cigar, which falls onto the carpet. The resulting fire kills him and destroys the house and all its contents. Spindle tells Bob at the gallery how he had been swindled over a Mondrian, but that it had been burnt somehow. At the cemetery, Spindle joins Alfreda and Robert with the others attending Alfred's burial, offering her his condolences. She explains that the insurance payout is expected without a problem, and that she and Robert are planning to move to Tuscany. As a parting gift to Robert, Spindle gives him a slide of a painting he thinks might be of interest, but mutters hateful comments once the car door is closed. At the opening party for Beth's new gallery, the inaugural event is Elaine's show. Her videos are being projected onto the gallery's walls at great size. Various guests have widly differing opinions - some think it tasteless, others brave and powerful. Joany considers it \\"tacky\\" and regrets her own exposure in the films. Spindle arrives with his boyfriend, concealing any resentment he feels, he expresses delight at his own video appearance, and even seems to forgive Bob when he reveals his backing for Beth. Beth has invited her parents, but her father is outraged at having to see a \\"goddamned porno movie starring my daughter\\" and has sent her mother home in a taxi \\"in hysterics\\". Spindle takes Elaine to one side, and tells her that he's planning a new show (based on Dewey's idea that he had rejected), with her as the star. A woman representing Vanity Fair approaches Elaine to suggest writing an article about her, and their lingering eye contact suggests further meetings to come. The video dwells at this point on Joany's storming out of their flat, and especially on Dewey's angry visit and suicide threat. The final seconds of the video explain the opening scene: the crash, the spray of shattered glass behind Joany, and Elaine's commentary \\"Oh no. Oh no, my god... Dewey\\", for sure enough his body has crashed down onto the roof of a parked taxi. Finally, Spindle dictates a business letter to his newly-appointed assistant, Charlotte Bailey. Cast Production Danny Moynihan's novel for Boogie Woogie was published in 2000, based on his hedonistic New York years. Dennis Hopper originally held the option to adapt the novel into a screenplay for a film to be set in New York City; later, Moynihan's friend, Duncan Ward, a documentary film-maker, became involved, with Rachel Weisz agreeing to play the \\"central, nubile gallerist\\" role eventually portrayed by Graham. After Weisz dropped out, producers switched the film's location to London for cost reasons; Moynihan \\"discovered then-unknown Amanda Seyfried living around the corner in Chelsea\\" and got her cast as an \\"art-world nymphet\\"; Charlotte Rampling, a family friend of Moynihan's, got a cameo appearance. Principal photography took place in London in December 2006.Boogie Woogie, production notes from a fansite for Stellan Skarsgård Reception Richard Clayton--in a Sunday Times article about the film that focuses on \\"who inspired its unsavoury characters\\"--called it \\"The Devil Wears Prada and Hangs Out at Private Views, but with a lot more sex and naughty bits.\\" According to a National Public Radio review, \\"just about all the acting in this otherwise pedestrian satire is fabulous, and for want of other diversions you might amuse yourself itemizing all the squandered talent\\"; the film conflates \\"black comedy with cynicism\\" and \\"ends, dispiritingly, pretty much where it began.\\" The Daily Beast called it a \\"dead- on satire of the contemporary art world that is loved by the very audience it savages.\\" Rex Reed called it a \\"tepid spoof that only occasionally evokes a reluctant smile\\" and said it \\"failed to capture the nuances or craft a more brutal, incisive exposé of the art milieu.\\" Miscellaneous The Fat Boy Slim video for Star 69 features video clips from the movie.

Its founders were Christoph Blocher of the SVP and Otto Fischer of the FDP. Throughout its history, the AUNS has had some success. It successfully opposed referendums on abolishing the military (1989 & 2001), joining the European Economic Area (1992), joining the EU (2001), as well as numerous other referendums. Additionally, the AUNS supported the immigration referendum of 2014, which was narrowly accepted. On the other hand, its campaigns against the participation of the Swiss Army in armed UN peace-keeping missions (2001), against Swiss succession to the UN (2002), against the bilateral treaties with the European Union (Bilaterale I (2000), Bilaterale II (2004), right to move directive (2004), Schengen treaty (2005)) and against payment of a billion Swiss Francs to the EU Cohesion Fund (2005) were unsuccessful.

Hence an end correction is sometimes required to appropriately study its properties. The end correction depends on the radius of the object. An acoustic pipe, such as an organ pipe, marimba, or flute resonates at a specific pitch or frequency. Longer pipes resonate at lower frequencies, producing lower-pitched sounds. The details of acoustic resonance are taught in many elementary physics classes. In an ideal tube, the wavelength of the sound produced is directly proportional to the length of the tube. A tube which is open at one end and closed at the other produces sound with a wavelength equal to four times the length of the tube. A tube which is open at both ends produces sound whose wavelength is just twice the length of the tube. Thus, when a Boomwhacker with two open ends is capped at one end, the pitch produced by the tube goes down by one octave. The analysis above applies only to an ideal tube, of zero diameter. When designing an organ or Boomwhacker, the diameter of the tube must be taken into account. In acoustics, end correction is a short distance applied or added to the actual length of a resonance pipe, in order to calculate the precise resonant frequency of the pipe. The pitch of a real tube is lower than the pitch predicted by the simple theory. A finite diameter pipe appears to be acoustically somewhat longer than its physical length.End Correction at a Flue Pipe Mouth A theoretical basis for computation of the end correction is the radiation acoustic impedance of a circular piston. This impedance represents the ratio of acoustic pressure at the piston, divided by the flow rate induced by it. The air speed is typically assumed to be uniform across the tube end. This is a good approximation, but not exactly true in reality, since air viscosity reduces the flow rate in the boundary layer very close to the tube surface. Thus, the air column inside the tube is loaded by the external fluid due to sound energy radiation. This requires an additional length to be added to the regular length for calculating the natural frequency of the pipe system. The end correction is denoted by \\\\Delta L and sometimes by e . In organ pipes, a displacement antinode is not formed exactly at the open end. Rather, the antinode is formed a little distance \\\\Delta L away from the open end outside it. This \\\\Delta L is known as end correction, which can be calculated as: * for a closed pipe (with one opening): : \\\\Delta L = 0.6 \\\\cdot r = 0.3 \\\\cdot D , where r is the hydraulic radius of the neck and D is the hydraulic diameter of the neck;Ruiz, Michael J. \\"Boomwhackers and end-pipe corrections.\\" The Physics Teacher 52.2 (2014): 73-75. Available online at http://www.mjtruiz.com/publications/2014_boomwhackers.pdf * and for an open pipe (with two openings): : \\\\Delta L = 1.2 \\\\cdot r = 0.6 \\\\cdot D . The exact number for the end correction depends on a number of factors relating to the geometry of the pipe. Lord Rayleigh was the first experimenter to publish a figure, in 1871: it was 0.3 \\\\cdot r . Other experiments have yielded results such as 0.576 \\\\cdot r Bosanquet, R.H.M. \\"On the relation between the notes of open and stopped pipes,\\" The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, (1878) 6:34, 63-66, DOI: 10.1080/14786447808639471 and 0.66 \\\\cdot r A.E.

He was known for spreading virulent antisemitic propaganda, although he left the government before the Holocaust in Slovakia was fully implemented. After the war, he joined the Gehlen Organization. Nationalism Born in Rajec, in the Trencsén County of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia), he was educated at the Institute des Hautes Études Internationales in Paris, the University of Bratislava and The Hague Academy of International Law, receiving his law doctorate and working as a professor of law in Bratislava.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, p. 107 Ďurčanský gained a grounding in nationalism in the universities. With Rodobrana declining in influence during the mid-1930s, the focus of Slovak extreme nationalist discontent shifted onto the journal Nástup, which had a university student and graduate readership and which was edited by Ďurčanský.Yeshayahu Jelinek, 'Storm-Troopers in Slovakia: The Rodobrana and the Hlinka Guard', Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 6, No. 3. (1971), p. 102 Unlike some of his contemporaries, who advocated autonomy, Ďurčanský was a supporter of a fully independent Slovakia and when he and Jozef Tiso visited Adolf Hitler in 1938 it was only Ďurčanský who pressed the Nazi leader on the issue.Vojtech Mastny, The Czechs under Nazi Rule: The Failure of National Resistance 1939–1942, New York: Columbia University Press, 1971 In October 1938, he told Hermann Göring that Slovakia's \\"Jewish problem will be solved similarly to Germany's\\". Under the Nazis His followers, who came to be known as the 'Young Generation', held a number of posts in the Slovak People's Party administration of Vojtech Tuka, with Ďurčanský himself serving as Minister for Home and Foreign Affairs.Jelinek, 'Storm-Troopers in Slovakia', p. 108 He was dismissed following the Salzburg Conference, because the Germans disapproved of his independent-minded foreign policy (he had attempted to maintain communication with the Western powers and keep friendly relations with the Soviet Union). Tiso attempted to recall him in 1944 but the Nazis refused. Nonetheless, he remained a strong supporter of Tiso and collaboration, attempting to organise resistance to the Soviet Union until early 1945 when he fled to Austria. Plot exposed The United Nations War Crimes Commission accepted Czechoslovak charges that he had been paid by the Nazi secret service and had been complicit in the deaths of Jews. Condemned to death in absentia, he nevertheless escaped to the west in 1945 and became a stern critic of the communist regime. According to Mark Aarons and John Loftus Ďurčanský was a member of Intermarium, an underground anti-communist network with its headquarters in Paris that played a leading role in helping Nazis escape justice after the war and which was under the control of British intelligence.Mark Aarons and John Loftus, Ratlines: How the Vatican's Nazi Networks Betrayed Western Intelligence to the Soviets, William Heinemann, 1991, p. 217 Having fled to the Vatican, Ďurčanský was said to have linked up with other like-minded members of the group in order to conspire to restore the Slovak regime as well as other rightist totalitarian regimes in the newly communising states of Eastern Europe. To this end Ďurčanský made daily broadcasts to the Slovak areas of Czechoslovakia (according to The New York Times) whilst also publishing leaflets stating that he would soon return to take over as Prime Minister of an independent Slovakia.Aarons & Loftus, Ratlines, p. 218 He established his own Slovak Liberation Committee as a basis for such plots although his attempts were severely undermined in September 1947 when General Ferjenčík concluded an investigation in which he revealed full details of Ďurčanský's group, as well as the level of infiltration by communist agents. Ferjenčík's report was used as the basis for a full takeover by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.Aarons & Loftus, Ratlines, pp. 218-219 The speed with which his coup plot collapsed and the completeness of communist knowledge led to speculation amongst British intelligence that Ďurčanský was in fact a double agent but no evidence was forthcoming and before long he had risen to become President of Intermarium.Aarons & Loftus, Ratlines, p. 219 Later activity Having had his plot exposed Ďurčanský took advantage of the ratlines in operation to escape to Argentina. He had for some time been under the protection of British agent Kim Philby and when he was appointed Senior Liaison Officer to the United States and Canada in 1949 he attempted to arrange for Ďurčanský to be moved to North America. However at this point the Central Intelligence Agency had thrown its weight behind a moderate group called the Czech Democrats and rejected the chance to work with a Slovak separatist with a collaborationist background.Aarons & Loftus, Ratlines, p. 220 Philby did however manage to secure entry into Canada on a British visa in December 1950 for Ďurčanský and he made the country his base of operations for the next few years and visited the country regularly on speaking engagements into the 1970s.Aarons & Loftus, Ratlines, p. 221 Ďurčanský returned to Europe in 1952, settling in Munich and conducting much of his work on behalf of Slovak independence from West Germany. However he spoke to various Slovak groups in the United States in 1959 with the United States Department of State claiming that he was granted a visa as 'membership in or affiliation with the defunct Nazi Party in itself no longer constitutes a ground of ineligibility.'Ralph Blumenthal, 'In the War Crimes Archives: Rifts on Prosecutions' His work against the Czechoslovak communist regime included spells as President of both the Slovak Committee for Action Abroad and the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations. He also wrote extensively for rightist journals such as Nation Europa, Zeitschrift für Geopolitik and Politische Studien. Ďurčanský died of natural causes in Munich.

The Prince's Charities, supported by The Prince's Charities Foundation, is based in the United Kingdom and comprises 19 organisations of which the Prince of Wales is patron or president; 18 were founded personally by Charles. The Prince's Trust Canada is a Canadian entity formed by a collection of nine preexisting charitable organisations with prior connections to the Prince of Wales. All the charities focus on Charles' core interests, including aiding disadvantaged youth, education, responsible business, improvement of the built environment, regeneration of heritage, and environmental sustainability. The Prince's Charities =Structure= Most of the charities are independent of each other and all are each run by their own boards. The Prince of Wales is president of all the charities and founded 17 of them; however, as president, he is a figurehead and public face for the charities involved and has no legal responsibility. The aim of The Prince's Charities is \\"to improve the overall effectiveness of the group, building on shared strengths to ensure their long term success and sustainability.\\" The costs of the office are paid for by The Prince's Charities Foundation. In autumn 2010, Prince Charles published a book, Harmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World, and produced a film, both articulating the principles and underlying philosophies of many of these charities. =Development= Through 2003 and 2004, a small office was established within the Office of the Prince of Wales to deal specifically with Prince Charles' charitable work. Sir Tom Shebbeare took up the new position of Director of Charities, with particular responsibility for the development and good governance of the 16 operational charities in which Charles had a particular interest. By the following year, the group had been given a new identity, The Prince's Charities, and the Charities Office had developed new policies and procedures for the group. The Charities Office, set up at Clarence House, employed by 2008 some eight full-time staff.Guardian Society Jobs Vacancies The Prince's Charities, \\"The Guardian\\", 9 July 2008 The charities form the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the UK and collectively work in 38 countries. They together raise approximately £150 million each year. In addition to independent charities, Charles established a number of separate charitable initiatives, which include Mosaic, a Muslim youth mentoring campaign; The Prince's Wool Project, to support the UK wool industry; START, to help promote sustainable living; The Cambrian Mountain Initiative, to support the economy in that area of Wales; and The Prince's Rainforest Project, to protect rainforests. In 2011, the Pakistan Recovery Fund was developed, which is intended to support the recovery from the floods seen in that country in 2010. =Charities in The Prince's Charities group= The charities in The Prince's Charities group are often grouped according to the areas of charitable activity that they are involved with. ; Opportunity and enterprise * The Prince's Trust *The Prince's Trust International *The Prince's Trust Australia *The Prince's Trust New Zealand *The Prince's Trust Canada * The Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust * PRIME * PRIME Cymru * The Prince's Youth Business International * The British Asian Trust * Youth Business Scotland ; Education * The Prince's Drawing School * The Prince's School of Traditional Arts * The Prince's Teaching Institute * The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts ; The built environment * The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment * The Prince's Regeneration Trust * The Great Steward of Scotland's Dumfries House Trust * The Turquoise Mountain Foundation ; Responsible business and the natural environment * The Prince's Countryside Fund * Business in the Community * Scottish Business in the Community * The Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership * Arts & Business * In Kind Direct ; Closed charities * The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health =The Prince's Charities Foundation= The Prince's Charities Foundation also has a number of wholly owned subsidiary companies: Duchy Originals Ltd, the Prince's Charities Events, and Traditional Arts Ltd.

The Prince's Trust Canada (formerly The Prince's Charities Canada)  The Prince's Trust Canada (PTC) was founded in 2011 with the aid of Galen and Hillary Weston. Its work is focused on the Prince of Wales's core interests, which have been established in the UK for more than 30 years. These include improving the lives of disadvantaged youth, education, responsible business, improving the built environment, regeneration of heritage, environmental sustainability, and support for the armed forces. The PTC works with existing Canadian charities already connected to the Prince and facilitates new opportunities for charitable organisations in Canada and the UK to work together. The organisation does not distribute money; \\"it sees itself as a convener, helping to connect the Canadian charities Charles supports with new opportunities for growth.\\" It was originally known as the Prince's Charities Canada, the name change was announced on 8th August 2018 Sharon Broughton is the current Chief Executive Officer of the PTC. The organisations are grouped under six initiatives: ; The Prince's Operation Entrepreneur Ex-members of the Canadian Forces are provided with financial assistance, further education, and mentoring on business practices through the Canadian Youth Business Foundation (a group long affiliated with The Prince's Youth Business International) and Students in Free Enterprise, Memorial University branch, together within The Prince's Operations Entrepreneur program. ; The Prince's Seeing is Believing The groups Canadian Business for Social Responsibility and the Wellesley Institute work together under The Prince's Seeing is Believing (PSiB) program, which is modelled on that of the same name that was started by Prince Charles in the UK in the early 1990s. It aims to connect corporate leadership with programs serving disadvantaged people in order to demonstrate the benefits of responsible business. The PSiB's first organised meeting between 17 executives from various professional fields and young, homeless individuals involved with the Yonge Street Mission and UforChange took place in January 2012. ; The Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership The National Trust for Canada (formerly the Heritage Canada Foundation) administers and presents annually The Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership to municipalities that have shown commitment to preservation of historic structures and spaces. The concept of the award came following a visit by the Prince of Wales to a restored 18th century house in New Brunswick and a meeting with a member of the National Trust for Canada's board of directors. ; Learning Through the Arts Developed by The Royal Conservatory of Music, the Learning Through the Arts (LTTA) program is a structured curriculum that uses the arts to teach other subjects such as math and science and includes training for teachers and artists. This program was imported by the Prince of Wales to the UK, where it is administered by The Prince's Foundation for Children and the Arts. In several aboriginal communities, the PTC also funds projects to strengthen the survival of traditional arts and crafts. ; The Prince of Wales Award for Sustainable Forestry This prize is presented annually by the Canadian Institute of Forestry to recognize the achievements of an outstanding young forest professional in Canada. The purpose is to encourage engagement in and dedication to the principles of sustainable forest management policy, planning and practice, sound science-based land stewardship, and public outreach and knowledge exchange focusing on the wise use and conservation of forests and the ecosystems that they encompass. ;The Campaign for Wool Initiative Following on the initiative in the UK, the PTC brought to Canada the Campaign for Wool Initiative, intended to demonstrate wool as \\"a sustainable fabric, as something that supports rural livelihoods, rural economies, and a really interesting and versatile fabric that happens to be antimicrobial, [and] flame retardant\\". ;The Prince's Youth Service Awards Created in 2015 in cooperation with We Day and sponsored by the Royal Bank of Canada, The Prince's Youth Service Awards \\"honour exceptional young Canadians who are taking positive actions both here at home and in the global community\\" in four categories: local community development, global action, social entrepreneurship, and sustainability. Individuals may nominate themselves with support from family or educators. The first presentation of the awards is expected to take place. Recipients will be selected by a committee that includes Joe Mimran and Mike \\"Pinball\\" Clemons. Each winner receives a statue, an invitation to a leadership development programme, and a bursary to aid in bringing ideas to fruition. The proceeds from sales of Prince Charles' Duchy Originals products in Canada are donated to the charities associated with The Prince's Trust Canada. More than one million dollars has been raised annually in this manner. There are five objectives for the PTC's 2020-2025 strategic plan: Preparing young people and veterans for the transforming world of work; Championing sustainable solutions for a green recovery; Empowering people and partnerships; Delivering Impact; and Investing in the future. The Prince’s Trust Australia (formerly The Prince's Charities Australia) The Prince's Trust Australia (formerly The Prince's Charities Australia) is a national charity registered in Melbourne, Victoria. Established in 2013, Prince's Trust Australia (formerly Prince's Charities Australia) provided a coordinating presence for the Prince of Wales's Australian and international charitable endeavors. The Prince's Trust Australia aims to assist wherever possible in delivering improved outcomes for the communities of people and of interest served by the Prince of Wales's charities; enhanced coordination of the Prince of Wales's charitable interests in Australia; and increased collaboration and communication between the Prince of Wales's family of charities in the U.K. and similar and related charities in Australia. In July 2017, The Prince's Charities Australia changed its name to The Prince's Trust Australia. In 2017, Prince's Trust Australia officially joined The Prince's Trust Group, which includes The Prince's Trust UK, Prince's Trust New Zealand, Prince's Trust Canada, Prince's Trust America, and The Prince's Trust International. 2013 - 2017 Programs Between 2013 - 2017, Prince's Trust Australia supported initiatives in Health and Wellbeing; The Built Environment; Environment and Sustainability; Regional and Rural; Young People; Defence Members and Their Families; and Arts and Culture. The Trust was led by inaugural Chief Executive Janine Kirk AM. Mr. Tony Beddison AC, Founder of The Beddison Group, was the inaugural Chair of the Trust, followed by Margaret Jackson AC, former Chair of Qantas. In the Health and Wellbeing portfolio, The Trust partnered with Phoenix Australia – Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health, leading an international consortium of mental health researchers to develop a ground- breaking evidence-based recovery program for survivors of natural and man-mad disasters called interPAR (now SOLAR). The Trust also supported and advocated for The E.O.N. Foundation and its Thriving Communities Program, an early- intervention lifestyle and disease prevention program for remote Indigenous communities and schools. In The Built Environment portfolio, The Trust worked in partnership with Defence Housing Australia and South Australian Renewal to develop Australia's first six-star green star rated residential building in Bowden, South Australia. The Prince's Terrace Adelaide merges good design with sustainable building practices, all the while proving its commercial viability and reflecting local heritage. The Prince's Terraces Adelaide received The Urban Developer Awards 2018, Excellence in Sustainability Award; 2018 HIA Australian GreenSmart Award, Townhouse/Villa Development of the Year; 2018 Architecture and Design Sustainability Awards, Green Building of the Year and Multiple Dwelling awards; 2018 UDIA South Australia Awards for Excellence, Environment Excellence and Small-Scale Development; 2018 HIA-CSR South Australian Housing Award, Townhouse/Villa Development of the Year. The Terrace was officially opened in December 2017 by His Excellency the Honourable Hieu Van Le AC, Governor of South Australia, Senator for South Australia and Chair of the Join Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Trade, Senator David Fawcett, and City of Charles Sturt Mayor Angela Evans. In the Environment and Sustainability portfolio, The Trust worked with Greenfleet Australia and the Disney Corporation ANZ to support the development of a “Low Glow” community in Bundaberg to protect the endangered Loggerhead turtle during nesting season and help shape a better understanding and more harmonious existence with the natural environment. In November 2017, Disney sea turtle expert Dr. Blair Witherington visited Bundaberg to collaborate on international best practice. Dr. Witherington penned a Op Ed in Huffington Post to share his insights during the visit. In April 2018, His Royal Highness, The Prince of Wales visited Bundaberg to discuss the Low Glow project and its contribution to Great Barrier Reef conservation efforts. This included a visit to Lady Elliot Island to convene a cross-sector \\"reef roundtable\\" in partnership with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, and attended by The Irwin Family. During this time, the Low Glow collaboration formally expanded to include the Bundaberg Regional Council, the Sea Turtle Alliance and Bundaberg North Burnett Tourism. Since 2019, Bundaberg Regional Council have been managing the Low Glow project after receiving support from the Low Glow collaboration for its Smart Cities Grant. The Council are implementing a digital urban glow light map, allowing residents and tourists to assess the artificial light glow from their own homes at night and change habits during nesting season. In March 2020, works are beginning along the Bagara esplanade, installing smart pathway lighting. Local residents as well as visitors to the region can find out more on the Bundaberg Regional Council's Reducing Urban Glow page. Prince's Trust Australia is also a founding partner of the Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef, a digital platform empowering the global community to commit to working together to save one of the world's most important natural assets. In the Regional and Rural portfolio, The Trust partnered with the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal (F.R.R.R.) on Disaster Resilient: Future Ready, a pilot program seeking to establish a road-tested model of community-led disaster preparedness after discovering a gap in resilience and adaptation indicators for natural disasters and critically, limited evaluation of effective methods for communities and individuals to build their resilience. In the Young People portfolio, The Trust piloted the Get Into program in 2017. Modelled on a similar program at Prince's Trust UK, the Get Into program worked with emploers in hospitality, retail, construction and logistics to support young people to develop sector-specific and employability skills. The Get Into program was delivered by Adelaide-based not-for-profit SYC. In the Defence Members and Their Families portfolio, The Trust pioneered self-employment support for transitioning Australian Defence Force members through The Prince's Lead Your Own Business program. Delivered from 2015 - 2018, the program supported transitioning Australian Defence Force members to develop and grow their own small business. Participants of the program received a Certificate IV in New Small Business from RMIT University over the 12-month program. In 2018, the Prince's Lead Your Own Business program was reimagined through codesign with DeakinCo and the veteran community. The new Enterprise for Veterans program supports veterans and their families, including transitioning defence members, veterans at any stage, and ADF partners of current or former serving members, with the confidence, skills and networks they need to safely explore entrepreneurship. The program is guided by an Advisory Council, chaired by The Governor-General of Australia, His Excellency General The Honourable David Hurley A.C. D.S.C. (Ret’d). In the Arts and Culture portfolio, The Trust partnered with the National Museum Australia in 2016 to deliver the Encounters Indigenous Cultural Workers Fellowship Program. The program was created in response to the 2015 Encounters exhibition, a ground-breaking collection of rare Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander objects representing the living cultural traditions of Australia's first peoples. The inaugural 2016 Fellowship enabled six Indigenous cultural workers from regional and remote communities to take part in an intensive three-month international fellowship, providing them with the opportunity to develop cultural, creative or heritage sector skills and capabilities. In 2019, the second Encounters Fellowship Program was delivered with support from the Australia Government and National Library of Australia. 2018 - Present In 2018, Prince's Trust Australia narrowed its focus from seven to three program portfolios. The Trust champions resilient, sustainable communities and support veterans, their families and young people to overcome systemic barriers and reach their full potential. From June 2018 - June 2020, The Trust was Chaired by John Landerer CBE AM, Founder of Landerer & Company. In June 2020, The Hon Julie Bishop was appointed Chair. From April 2019 - April 2020, Christopher John led The Trust as Chief Executive. The Trust is supported by the Australia philanthropic and corporate sectors, including The Pratt Foundation, The Prior Foundation, DLA Piper and Macquarie as well as The Prince of Wales Charitable Foundation. The employability and work readiness programs (Enterprise and Achieve) of The Trust are underpinned by ten, internationally recognised enterprise skills. They are: Problem Solving, Critical Thinking, Self- Management, Emotional Judgement, Teamwork, Communication, Digital Literacy, Innovation, Professional Ethics, and Global Citizenship. Defence Members and Their Families In 2018, Prince's Trust Australia relaunched its self- employment program as Enterprise for Veterans. The Enterprise program is designed to inspire veterans and ADF families with the confidence, enterprise capabilities and networks they need to explore entrepreneurship and prepare for the future of work. The program blends evidence-based business methodologies and experiential learning with an enterprise skills framework, and includes immersive programs, enrichment activities with industry, and a virtual community. Guided by an Advisory Council, chaired by the Governor General, His Excellency General The Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Ret’d), Prince’s Trust Australia is the only national not-for-profit supporting Australia's veteran community to explore entrepreneurship and self-employment. Young People In 2019, Prince's Trust Australia launched Achieve. Achieve is an inquiry-based framework, engages young people between 11 and 17 years old in learning through careers education and enterprise skills development. It is designed to support and amplify existing education initiatives and interventions to gain better outcomes, including engagement and retention. The framework is designed to support young Australians with the mindsets, skills and capabilities as they need to transition into a rapidly changing world of work. Sustainable Communities Prince's Trust Australia aims to help people and communities to create better places to live. The Trust champions sustainable urbanism and inspires young professionals and those working in design, sustainability, construction, development and government to be leaders in place-making and community building. This is achieved through exemplar building projects, education and training programs, and thought leadership. Following on from the award-winning Prince’s Terrace Adelaide in 2017, The Trust is working in partnerships with New South Wales Government on The Prince’s Quarter, an innovative development project in Glebe, Sydney. The project will champion sustainability and ‘density done well’, while respecting local character, increasing social and affordable housing, and fostering diverse, mixed-income communities.

The group was formed in 2003 by ex-members of the Hungarian hard-core and metalcore band, Newborn. The original line-up consisted of Tibor Szalkai (guitars), Gábor Nagy (guitars), Mátyás Mohácsi (bass), László Szabó (drums) and András Bödecs (vocals). However, three members (Bödecs, Szabó and Mohácsi) of the original line-up left the band in 2009. The band noted for the success of the song Monochrome from their third album entitled Monologue. Band history The band quickly stood up and started to play several gigs in their local area, and soon shows appeared abroad in their schedule. Spending their year to establish a base for the further actions, they realized that it was time for them to create their first record. In the fall of this year they've started the recording, and on a New Year's Eve live appearance of the band the mcd entitled After the Storm (EP) came to life. This three song debut was the product of the collaboration between the guys and a label from Japan called Alliance-Trax. The band HQ was satisfied with the result, and decided a future plan with their Japanese fellows in crime. In the first days of the new year an order arrived from the country of the rising sun: Get in the studio now! After three months of work their debut album titled Brand New Way, Brand New Situation (album) was recorded in late 2004. At the fall of 2004 the band joined the team of the successfully uprising Austrian label Burning Season Records and the full-length album was released in February 2005. In 2005 after recording their 3rd record Hopeless Illusions EP, they decided to leave Burning Season Records and join to Deadbutcher Records what is owned by their good friend Mikita, who helped them in many ways during the past few years. The Idoru combines the forces of metal, hardcore and punkrock genres straight into your face on their latest and fourth studio album called Time, and this \\"time\\" they complete the album with acoustic songs as well. The material was recorded at SuperSize Recording, which is the most professional studio in Hungary, led by well qualified experts, such as Zoli Varga, who has also been the producer for the band over the past several years. By the way, this quintet won the Fonogram award in the category of best modern rock-metal album in 2012 /for the second time in the band's career/ with their latest record,\\"Time”. It is said that this is the most remarkable appreciation by the Hungarian music sphere. The history of the band began in 2003, since then they went through many European underground headliner tours, even in Russia, and played a couple of shows with the California band \\"Ignite\\" in Japan, joined the Misfits on their European tour, and during the years they survived several member changes. In 2012, the current line-up is stronger than ever, which is proved through their new creation. So check it out, and drop some lines! On 28 October 2016, The Idoru's song Refused Day by Day debuted on Rádió Rock 95.8.

The undifferentiated \\"non- African\\" of 70 kya diverged into identifiable East Asian and West Eurasian lineages by about 50 kya. This early East Asian lineage diverged further during the Last Glacial Maximum, contributing significantly to the peopling of the Americas via Beringia after about 25 kya. After the last ice age China became cut off from neighboring island groups. The modern Mongoloid phenotype developed fully only during the Neolithic period (after 10 kya).Matt Cartmill, Fred H. Smith, The Human Lineage, John Wiley & Sons (2009), p. 449. Genetic history =Paternal lineage= Looking at Y-DNA studies, it would seem that one of the earliest groups of humans to reach Asia did so approximately 50-60,000 years ago. People bearing genetic markers ancestral to Haplogroups C and D came through coastal India and proceeded to Southeast Asia. Haplogroup C moved to East Asia and Australia, with at least two subclades of the major East Asian branch migrating into the Americas, and with members of Haplogroup C-M38 spreading throughout Wallacea, New Guinea, Melanesia, and Polynesia. Another group of peoples, bearing the Y-DNA Haplogroup D, has left descendants mostly in the Andaman Islands, Tibet, and Japan. A later group, carrying the Y-DNA haplogroup K was established approximately 40,000-50,000 years ago. Its origins were probably in Southwestern Asia or South Asia. One branch, Haplogroup Q, believed to have arisen in Central Asia or South Asia approximately 17,000 to 22,000 years ago, went north to populate Siberia and the Americas. Some northern Chinese have this genetic marker. Another branch, consisting of Haplogroups N and O, went south and by 35,000 years ago went on to populate first Southeast Asia and then from Southeast Asia, left for East Asia. About 12,000 years ago, the ancestors of the Han Chinese, along with other O3‐M122 lineages, reached the upper and middle Yellow River basin. About 7000 years ago, they and the ancestors of the Tibetans split off from that parent group. About 6,000 years ago, the Han Chinese split from the Proto‐Sino‐Tibetan group, and started their migration to the east and south. About 5,000 years ago, the Han Chinese experienced rapid expansion, with notable gene flow into surrounding populations. Thus before the Xia dynasty (est. 2000-1500 BC), for which there are no written records or direct archeological evidence, the Han Chinese were in rapid expansion. This corresponds to the late period (2600-2000 BC) of the Longshan culture in the middle Yellow River area. As the Neolithic population in China reached its peak, the number of settlements increased. In some locations, such as the basin of the Fen River in southern Shanxi, the Yellow River in western Henan (confined by the Zhongtiao Mountains and Xiao Mountains), and the coastal Rizhao plain of southeast Shandong, a few very large (over 200 ha) centers developed. In more open areas, such as the rest of Shandong, the Central Plain (in Henan) and the Wei River basin in Shaanxi, local centers were more numerous, smaller (generally 20 to 60 ha) and fairly evenly spaced. Walls of rammed earth have been found in 20 towns in Shandong, nine in the Central Plain, and one (Taosi) in southern Shanxi, suggesting conflict between polities in these areas. The expansion and rise of these various settlements could be due to the impetus of the collective benefit of the construction of irrigation works in the late Neolithic: \\"Most of the labor to dike and drain an area is associated with digging a ditch and sidecasting the soil to make an earthen dike. To make the culvert and tide gate you can use an old worn-out canoe for the pipe .... and use just about any good-sized flat stones you can get your hands on. If you have twice as many people making your dike, you can make twice as many linear feet of dike. Doubling the perimeter of a square dike results in quadrupling the area within the dike.\\" The agricultural surplus would have allowed for a rapidly expanding population, which would provide more labor for irrigation. By the time of the establishment of the Xia and Shang dynasties, population estimates were at approximately 13 million people.https://docslide.net/documents/relocation-of-civilization-centers-in- ancient-china-environmental-factors.html \\"Relocation of Civilization Centers in Ancient China: Environmental Factors\\" Studies of DNA remnants from the Central Plains area of China 3000 years ago show close affinity between that population and those of Northern Han today in both the Y-DNA and mtDNA. Both northern and southern Han show similar Y-DNA genetic structure. Han Chinese are clearly genetically distinguishable from Yamato Japanese and Koreans, and internally the different Han Chinese subgroups are genetically closer to each other than any of them are to Koreans and Japanese. But meanwhile when compared to Europeans genetics, the Han Chinese, Japanese and Koreans are closer to each other than to Europeans. Southern Han Chinese and Northern Han Chinese are closest to each other and show the smallest differences when they are compared to other Asians. Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh city Kinh are close to Xishuangbanna's Dai ethnic minority. Koreans are also relatively close to northern Han Chinese. Japanese are more genetically distant from Koreans than Koreans are from northern Han Chinese. However Buryat Mongols and Qinghai Mongols are further from each other than Japanese and Korean despite both being Mongols. Comparisons between the Y chromosome SNP and MtDNA of modern Northern Han Chinese and 3,000 year old Hengbei ancient samples from China's Central Plains show they are extremely similar to each other and show continuity between ancient Chinese of Hengbei and current Northern Han Chinese while other Han Chinese not from northern China were different from the people of Hengbei. This showed that already 3,000 years ago the current northern Han Chinese genetic structure was already formed. =Maternal lineage= Mitochondrial DNA studies likewise support the hypothesis that the ancestors of the Chinese came to Asia from Africa. The M Haplogroup, a descendant of the African L3 Haplogroup, originated somewhere between Africa, India and Central Asia. This marker alone is carried by all populations in South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, Oceania, and most of the Amerindian populations. Study of DNA remains from 3000 years ago show increasing diversity in mtDNA as the distance south and southwestward increase from the Central Plains area, indicating a male bias in the demic diffusion. Climate history During the Last Glacial Maximum, 29,000 to 18,000 years ago, northern China was a treeless steppe with areas of permafrost and southern China lost much of its forest cover. The sea level was much lower. Borneo, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Japanese archipelago may have been accessible by land. With the end of the last ice age, a period of warming occurred lasting from 18,000 to 10,000 years ago. The oceans rose and inundated vast regions leaving little trace of coastal settlements used by these people. We know little about their languages. Their cultures are likely to have been diverse. There are many limestone cave sites in southern China which show human settlements. There is evidence of pottery making. The inhabitants had bone tools, fished, and hunted pigs and deer. It is believed that the climate in southern China was warmer and wetter south of the Qing Ling mountains; elephants are known to have inhabited the Yangtze river region. The climate in Northeast China north of present-day Beijing was characterized as a cold steppe environment during this period. The presence of woolly mammoth is well documented. The climate was also much warmer between 8,000 and 3,500 years ago. In the Shandong region, excavations have found the bones of alligators and elephants. The development of agriculture about 10,000 years ago, with the domestication of millet in the Yellow River valley region and rice in the Yangtze River valley, may have been associated with accelerated growth in the number and size of settlements and the intensified development of local cultures and languages. Settlement patterns Early settlements in the Chinese Upper Paleolithic were either hunter-gatherer societies, or marine environment based societies characterized by shell middens. Relatively speaking the land was sparsely populated, as the peoples followed the coastal regions and the river valleys. Neolithic settlements have been found from Liaoning province in the northeast to the Chengdu region in the southwest; from Gansu province in the northwest to sites in Fujian in the southeast. The settlement pattern in the Tibetan region is still unclear as there is debate as to whether there was a pre-Neolithic population movement into the region. Holocene China The origin of Sino-Tibetan is uncertain. It dates to the Neolithic, or just before the Neolithic. There are various proposals. Van Driem (2005) proposes that Sino-Tibetan originated in the Sichuan Basin before 7000 BC, with an early migration into northeast India, and a later migration north of the predecessors of Chinese and Tibetic. Matisoff (1991) places its origins in the eastern part of the Tibetan plateau around 4000 BC, with the various groups migrating out along the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween and Brahmaputra rivers. Blench and Post (2014) have proposed that the Sino-Tibetan homeland was in northeast India, the area of greatest diversity, around 7000 BC. Blench (2009) proposes that the earliest speakers of Sino-Tibetan were not farmers, since agriculture cannot be reconstructed for Proto-Sino-Tibetan. Rather, early Sino-Tibetan speakers were highly diverse foragers.Blench, Roger. 2009. If agriculture cannot be reconstructed for Proto-Sino-Tibetan, what are the consequences?. Paper presented at the 42nd International Conference on Sino-Tibetan Language and Linguistics (ICSTLL 42), Chiang Mai, November 2-4, 2009. (slides) More recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America point to the origin of the Sino-Tibetan in northern China in the Neolithic Cishan culture and Yangshao culture. The Austroasiatic languages (including Vietnamese, Khmer, etc.) likely originated from Southern China and would have entered Southeast Asia via Yunnan and the Mekong. Likewise, the Miao, Thai, Burmese, and Tibetan languages evolved in China. It is even accepted that proto-Austronesian speakers originated from China, migrated to Taiwan (Formosa), and then to the islands of the Pacific, especially since Taiwan is the place exhibiting the most diversity in Austronesian languages (see Formosan languages). By 3,000 years ago, the sophistication of some of the cultures neighboring that of the Han Chinese can be seen in the bronze artifacts of the Sanxingdui (Sichuan), Ban Chiang (Thailand) and Dong Son (Vietnam). The domestication of the horse 6,000 years ago in the Eurasian steppes led to cultures that mixed animal husbandry and agriculture. Indo-European speakers are known to have reached the Xinjiang region 4,000 years ago (see Tocharians). Because the East Asian landmass was initially populated from the south, and the historical record shows the Han Chinese migrating to the south and southwest, the genetic relationship among all the peoples of China remains a challenging study.

She finally earned her doctoral degree from Columbia University in 1928. In the years leading up to her retirement (1928-1954) she taught at Ohio State University. In all her teaching years combined, she taught for 61 years, including summer sessions until 1964. During so many years of teaching, Zirbes experienced some of the most important issues affecting education in the United States throughout the twentieth century. In Cleveland, she taught a class of fifty-six fourth graders that were all children of immigrants. During her time at Columbia, she listened to Edward L. Thorndike, John Dewey, and William Bagley discuss the value of testing, and heard Bagley argue with William Heard Kilpatrick about Kilpatrick’s Project method. Zirbes coauthored many articles with William S. Gray. Her dissertation made her one of the country’s experts on teaching children to read. She never really considered herself an expert at reading because she did not believe in isolating one subject from other subjects. Zirbes founded the laboratory school at Ohio State, this school continued under her influence for over thirty years. She believed children learned things best when their interest was high. Zirbes supported the child-centered approach only if the teacher had a good understanding of the skills they wanted the children to learn, and carefully lead their class in that direction. The next step in learning was to provide good learning experiences that would enlarge children’s understanding and their vocabulary. Zirbes believed that numerous other elements contribute to learning. The first, that the lesson should be meaningful to the child, and second, that learning should be intrinsically motivating. The final two elements of learning, as Zirbes saw it, were that the lesson should stimulate thinking and lastly it should be integrated with other subjects. As Zirbes neared retirement, critics like Arthur Bestor attacked her beliefs on education. Her answer to this criticism came in the form of a book, Spurs to Creative Teaching (1959).

Many of the services and facilities previously at Withington Hospital were transferred to Wythenshawe in 2004. It provided services for adults and children at Wythenshawe Hospital and Withington Community Hospital (the latter formerly owned by Manchester PCT). It runs Buccleuch Lodge Intermediate Care Unit and the Dermot Murphy Centre in Withington, and the Specialised Ability Centre in Sharston. It merged with Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to form Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust on 1 October 2017. Keep Wythenshawe Special campaign History Withington Urban District Council built a hospital with 100 beds, known as Baguley Sanatorium, for infectious disease on the site now occupied by Wythenshawe Hospital in 1902. It could no longer use Monsall Hospital as Manchester City Council required use of the whole hospital for their own fever patients. Withington had a policy of moving patients with infectious diseases to hospital and paying for their maintenance. The district council was incorporated into Manchester in 1904 and the sanatorium became one of the city hospitals. There were two two-storey buildings each with twelve beds, and two single-storey buildings each with a ten-bedded ward. In 1911 630 patients were admitted. In 1912 it was converted into a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis with 150 beds. in 1916 two more blocks were built, increasing the capacity to 316 beds. Recreation rooms and a dining hall were built. The Hardman Street clinic became the corporation's tuberculosis dispensary. Another sanatorium, established by Chorlton on Medlock Board of Guardians in Abergele with 50 beds was also taken over by the corporation. In 1922 817 patients were admitted and the daily average was 313. 66 patients had been there for more than a year. There were 193 deaths. In 1935 84 more beds were established and a home for 91 nurses was built. San Toy, the Baguley Sanatorium magazine, was first published. It continued monthly until 1954 apart from the war years. In 1939 an Emergency Hospital Service hospital was built on the Baguley site by Manchester Corporation. 17 pavilions were built, some of wood and some of brick, with a total capacity of 680 beds, reduced to 350 because of the specialist nature of some of the units. A plastic surgery and maxillo-facial surgery centre, with three thirty bedded wards, one for women, one for officers and one for other ranks, was established under the leadership of Professor F C Wilkinson. A dental laboratory was set up on a ward veranda. All the civilian TB patients were moved out. The first party of 10 patients came from Dunkirk on 3 June 1940 for maxillo-facial surgery. Patients included German prisoners of war. In 1943 a separate Dental unit and laboratory, a photography unit and two operating theatres were added. In early 1945 the hospital reverted to civilian use but with a military wing of 128 beds for servicemen with pulmonary TB. After the war it became difficult to find sufficient nurses and 120 beds were closed. The plastic surgery and maxillo-facial surgery centre continued and did some work at the Christie Hospital and at the Duchess of York Hospital. Randell Champion was appointed the first plastic surgery consultant in Manchester when the NHS started in 1948. In 1947 469 patients were admitted to the sanatorium and 570 to the plastic surgery unit which also saw 1446 out- patients. There was then a recreation hall with a stage, dressing rooms, cinema projectors and 400 seats. It was also used for religious services, whist drives and other entertainments. There was an excellent bowling green a nursery with greenhouses and a vegetable garden. The secretary-steward, Robert Lawton Hall ran a piggery on the site which supplied pork to the Manchester municipal hospitals and used the hospital slops as food. In 1948 the sanatorium was taken over by the South Manchester Hospital Management Committee when the NHS started. Nine of the seventeen ward blocks were then empty. In 1950 one ward was renovated for use as a children's ward for the removal of tonsils and adenoids. Wythenshawe hospital was officially established on 1 February 1952 using the buildings of the Emergency Hospital Service hospital. It was managed by the Wythenshawe and North Cheshire Hospital Management Committee A women's surgical department and two geriatric wards were opened. Baguley continued to deal with TB, but changed its name from sanatorium to hospital. It had about 400 beds. Bed rest and fresh air were still the main treatment but chemotherapy was being tried. Visiting was only allowed on Saturday and Sunday afternoons for an hour and half an hour on Wednesday evenings. 100 beds were still closed because of a shortage of nurses. In 1957 when Streptomycin and Para-Aminosalicylic acid were used for prolonged chemotherapy surgery was no longer needed for TB. The 14-month waiting list disappeared. In 1959 the hospital radio, Radio Baguley, started. It ran twice-weekly record request programmes. Building a new hospital was proposed by the regional hospital board in 1958, but Manchester Corporation refused to sell the land required unless it would comply with their clean air policy. The Board proposed coal-fired heating. In 1961 it was included among 29 major schemes in Enoch Powell's Hospital Plan. The first phase, the new maternity block, opened in October 1965. There were 60 lying-in and 20 ante- natal beds, 10 special care cots and 20 post-natal beds and an ante-natal clinic. The plastic surgery and maxillo-facial surgery centre and three wards were transferred to Withington Hospital in 1969. Eventually, the new hospital was officially opened in 1973. At that point, the new hospital had 352 beds, but there were around 650 beds in the older buildings. The cardio-thoracic department had developed into a sub-regional specialist service, with three operating theatres, a 12-bed intensive care unit with a bedside computer system and a lung function investigation unit. From 1974 the hospital was run by the South Manchester Health Authority, which also ran Withington Hospital and Christie Hospital. In 1989/90 the authority had a budget of £111.5 million. In 1987 the hospital was designated as the fourth heart transplant centre after £6 million in charitable donations had been raised. In 1994 South Manchester University Hospitals NHS Trust took over the responsibility for the two general hospitals. In that year the Emergency Hospital Service huts were finally demolished. In 1995 the trust had an annual income of £150 million and 5,500 staff. There were 75,000 inpatients and day cases, 300,000 outpatient attendances and 90,000 attendances at the Accident and Emergency Department. Between 1995 and 2002 the trust established two catheterisation laboratories, a large cystic fibrosis unit, transferred from Monsall Hospital and a bigger maternity unit when Withington Hospital was closed. The new acute unit, with 319 beds, 6 operating theatres, 17 intensive care beds, a fracture clinic and a renal unit was built under the Private Finance Initiative and opened in 2002. A 77-bed Mental Health unit was also built on the site for the Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust. Description Its fields of specialist expertise include cutting edge cardiac services based in the new North West Heart Centre. The hospital has occupied a leading position in UK interventional cardiology, cardiac imaging, cardiac electrophysiology and cardiothoracic surgery for over four decades. One of only six UK heart and lung transplantation centres, it is now developing a rapidly evolving Ventricular Assist Device programme. Further nationally recognised departments include respiratory medicine, burns and plastics, as well as cancer and breast care services. The hospital is also recognised in the region and nationally for the quality of its teaching, research and development. Major research programmes focus on cancer, lung disease, wound management and medical education. It runs a specialist service for patients with cystic fibrosis across the North West, a regional Long Term Ventilation Unit and the National Aspergillosis Centre. It had approximately 5,500 staff, including those employed by its private finance initiative partner South Manchester Healthcare Limited. It was the first hospital in the NHS to go from 0 ratings to 3 stars, after the introduction of a new system rating hospitals. UHSM is top in the North West when it comes to patient satisfaction, and 6th best in the country. In October 2010 it got the best ratings in Greater Manchester in a survey conducted by the Manchester Evening News. Relationship with private sector The Trust uses BMI Healthcare's Alexandra Hospital in Cheadle, Greater Manchester to help with elective surgery capacity problems, usually in the winter. This often involves the same surgeon working on a Sunday. It also uses spare capacity in their Cath lab. Performance ;2008 assessment According to the Healthcare Commission assessment in 2008, it was one of a few trusts in the North West to achieve 'excellent' ratings for both parts of the study, both use of resources and quality of services. It also scored as follows in other parts of the report: • 12/13 for safety and cleanliness • 10/13 for waiting to be seen • 5/5 for keeping the public healthy • 9/9 for standard of care • 9/10 for dignity and respect • 17/17 for good management It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 5318 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4.39%. 79% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 71% recommended it as a place to work. Electronic health record The trust is implementing an Electronic health record which is intended to be implemented from January 2017. The contract has been awarded to Allscripts. The will require the building of a new datacentre. The trust will continue to use the Greater Manchester picture archiving and communications system. The trust's Chief Information Officer Mark Hutchinson has successfully implemented an electronic patient record using Allscripts at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. Future plans Following a prolonged consultation process called \\"Healthier Together\\" it was agreed by the Greater Manchester Clinical Commissioning Groups in July 2015 that Stepping Hill Hospital, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Salford Royal Hospital and Royal Oldham Hospital would be the “specialists” in emergency and high risk general surgery. This decision was challenged by consultants at the trust who launched a campaign under the banner \\"Keep Wythenshawe Special\\" and an action for judicial review, claiming the decision was unlawfully based on the impact on travel times for patients outside Greater Manchester. A march and rally in support of the campaign in November 2015 was addressed by Ted Robbins whose heart surgery was performed at the hospital. Dr Attila Vegh, the Chief Executive, resigned shortly before the announcement that the judicial review decision had been unsuccessful. It is planned that the hospital will eventually be served by its own dedicated Manchester Metrolink stop (Wythenshawe Hospital Metrolink station). Plans were announced in 2016 for a merger between the trust and the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust as proposed in a report by Sir Jonathan Michael. The merged trust would then take over North Manchester General Hospital, at present run by Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.

The first came into force in 1975 as an \\"interim\\" measure; the second was approved in a 1992 referendum, and the third one was instituted in 2010. Angola was a colony of Portugal for more than 400 years, beginning the 15th century. Three principal parties, MPLA, National Front for the Liberation of Angola the FNLA and the National Union for Total Independence of Angola the UNITA, fought for independence. After many years of conflict that weakened all of the insurgent parties, Angola gained independence on 11 November 1975, after the Carnation Revolution overthrew the Marcelo Caetano regime in Portugal. A fight for dominance broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements, resulting in a civil war soon after independence. The civil war continued with UNITA fighting against the ruling MPLA. Both parties received support and backing from other countries. Constitutional revisions in 1976 and 1980 more clearly established a revolutionary socialist, one-party state as a national goal. In 1992, the 1975 constitution was completely rewritten to allow a multiparty democratic republic, in the form of a presidential system, starting with multiparty elections and direct election of the president. The 2010 amendment of the Constitution named the president of Angola as head of state, head of the executive branch and commander-in-chief of the Angolan armed forces. The new constitution abolished direct election of the president; under its provisions, the person heading the list of candidates of the majority party in the assembly automatically becomes president, and the second person on the list, vice-president. This constitution, still in effect, limits the president to two five-year terms, but the 30-year term already served by current president dos Santos would start from the parliamentary elections in 2012, allowing him to remain president until 2022. Background Jonas Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, the major opposition party Angola was a colony of Portugal for more than 400 years from the 15th century. Demands for independence picked up momentum during the early 1950s. The principal protagonists included the MPLA, founded in 1956, the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), which appeared in 1961, and the UNITA, founded in 1966. After many years of conflict that weakened all of the insurgent parties, Angola gained independence on 11 November 1975, after the Carnation Revolution in Portugal overthrew the Portuguese regime headed by Marcelo Caetano. A fight for dominance broke out immediately between the three nationalist movements. The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens, creating up to 300,000 destitute Portuguese refugees—the retornados. The new Portuguese government attempted to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements. They initially agreed to terms, but the agreement dissolved mere days later. This failure to agree, which resulted in a devastating civil war that lasted several decades, claimed millions of lives and producing many refugees before it ended in 2002. During the civil war, the MPLA gained control of Luanda—the capital—and much of the rest of the country. With the support of the United States, Zaire and South Africa intervened militarily in favour of the FNLA and UNITA, with the intention of taking Luanda before the declaration of independence. In response, Cuba intervened in favour of the MPLA, and the country became a flash point for the Cold War. With Cuban support, the MPLA held Luanda and declared independence on 11 November 1975, with Agostinho Neto becoming the first president, although the civil war continued.  1975 constitution  Independent Angola's first constitution dedicated the new republic to eliminating the vestiges of Portuguese colonialism. The Constitution provided numerous guarantees of individual freedom and prohibited discrimination based on color, race, ethnic identity, sex, place of birth, religion, level of education, and economic or social status. The Constitution also promised freedom of expression and assembly. Constitutional revisions in 1976 and 1980 more clearly established a revolutionary socialist, one-party state the national goal. As revised, the Constitution vested sovereignty in the Angolan people, guaranteed through the representation of the party, and promised to implement \\"people's power.\\" It also emphasized the preeminence of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) as a policy-making body and made the government subordinate to it, responsible for implementing party policy. Economic development was to be founded on socialist models of cooperative ownership. Other constitutional guarantees included health care, access to education, and state assistance in childhood, motherhood, disability, and old age. In return for these sweeping guarantees, each individual was responsible for participating in the nation's military defense, voting in official elections, serving in public office if appointed or elected, working—considered a duty—and generally aiding in the socialist transformation. Despite its strong socialist tone, the Constitution guaranteed the protection of private property and private business activity within limits set by the state. National economic goals were to develop agriculture and industry, establish just social relations in all sectors of production, foster the growth of the public sector and cooperatives, and implement a system of graduated direct taxation. Social goals included combating illiteracy, promoting the development of education and a national culture, and enforcing strict separation of church and state, with official respect for all religions. The Constitution also outlined Angola's defense policy, which explicitly prohibited foreign military bases on Angolan soil or affiliation with any foreign military organization. It institutionalized the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) as the nation's army and assigned it responsibility for defense and national reconstruction. Military conscription applied to both men and women over the age of eighteen. 1992 constitution  José Eduardo dos Santos won the 1980 and 1986 elections and became the first elected president of the country. The civil war continued, with UNITA still fighting the MPLA, and both parties still receiving international support. There was a ceasefire agreement in 1989 with the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, but it collapsed soon afterwards. As a part of its peace efforts, the MPLA amended its platform of Marxism-Leninism and shifted its policies to a more socialist than communist worldview. In May 1991, Dos Sambos and UNITA's Savimbi signed a multiparty democracy agreement in Lisbon. In 1992 the 1975 constitution was completely rewritten, and amended on March 6, 1991 and August 26, 1992 to allow a multi-party democratic republic, in the form of a presidential system, to start with multiparty elections and direct election of the president.  2010 constitution  José Eduardo dos Santos who won and became the President of Angola in the elections On 21 January 2010 the National Assembly of Angola approved a new constitution to replace the interim constitution that had been in effect since independence in 1975. The Assembly approved this constitution in its entirety, by a 186-0 vote. Two assembly members abstained. The new constitution was drafted by a committee of 60 parliamentarians, advised by 19 experts and a public consultation, and contained 244 articles. The vote in the national assembly was boycotted by the opposition (UNITA) party, which claimed that the constitutional process had been flawed and undermined democracy. The ruling party, MPLA, had an 81% majority on the constitution committee, equal to their parliamentary majority. The constitution needed the approval of President José Eduardo dos Santos and of the Constitutional Court but both steps were seen as formalities. \\"\\"The ruling MPLA says the constitution will increase democracy, but by abolishing the presidential ballot and concentrating all the power on the president it will do exactly the opposite,\\" Fernando Macedo, a political analyst in Luanda, said after the vote. The new constitution established a government similar to those currently operating in South Africa and Botswana. It named the president of Angola as head of state, head of the executive branch and commander-in-chief of the Angolan armed forces. The new constitution abolished direct election of the president; the person heading the list of candidates of the majority party in the assembly automatically becomes president, and the second in the list, vice-president. The constitution limits the president to two five-year terms, but the 30-year term already served by dos Santos doesn't count and under the constitution his term would start from the next parliamentary elections in 2012, and allow him to remain president until 2022. The post of Prime Minister would be abolished, whose role would be taken over by the vice-president. The Assembly retains the right to remove the president from office but such an action must be approved by the Supreme Court. The vice president and the members of the Supreme Court are presidential nominees under the Constitution. The constitution clarified the ambiguous land rights that existed in Angola, stating that all land is owned by the state, which can decide who is entitled to use it, and that the state must only provide land rights to Angolan nationals or to companies registered in Angola. The constitution gives the president the power to appoint judges to the Constitutional and Supreme courts and also to appoint the head of the Court of Audits, which is the body responsible for reviewing public expenditure. The document also maintains the present status of Cabinda, an exclave of Angola surrounded by the Democratic Republic of Congo, as a part of Angola. Oil-rich Cabinda has been claimed by Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) separatists. The new constitution retains the current national flag (which is similar to the flag used by the MPLA during the Angolan Civil War). The constitution guarantees freedom of religion and of the press. The death penalty remains banned. Reception The new constitution of 2010 was hailed as \\"a day of victory and happiness for the people of Angola\\" by Fernando da Piedade Dias dos Santos, then president of the National Assembly, and Bornito de Sousa, who chaired the constitutional commission, said that the charter was \\"a reflection of equality, of good sense, and true representation of the electorate\\". However, UNITA member Raul Danda stated that the constitution was \\"a complete fraud\\" and that his party was wearing black \\"because it's like going to the graveyard to bury democracy\\". UNITA's parliamentary leader, Alda Juliana Paulo Sachiambo, also spoke out against the new constitution saying that it gave \\"excessive executive power\\" to dos Santos. The head of Katiava Bwila University, political scientist Paulo de Carvalho, spoke out against UNITA's concerns in defense of the Constitution. He said that the party-list system is used in democracies in Europe, Asia and South Africa, and that the new document contains many clauses that were in the old constitution. The original vote on the constitution had been expected in March but was then moved to January. There was speculation that this delay was intended to avoid public debate on the matter by holding the vote at the same time that Angola hosts the 2010 African Cup of Nations. Dos Santos had said that as soon as the constitution was passed he would reduce the size of the government and reduce the opportunities for officials to engage in corrupt activities. Angola currently ranks in the top 18 most corrupt countries, according to Transparency International.

After the Concordat of 1801, it was suppressed, and its territory went to the diocese of Autun.Chalons-sur-Saône (Diocese) [Catholic- Hierarchy] Its see was Chalon Cathedral. History Julius Caesar first mentions Cabillonum in his Gallic Wars. Later it is said to be an oppidum or castrum. It was a civitas of the Burgundians. Chalon was not made a city, separate and distinct from Autun, until the fifth century, and it is probably as a consequence of this development that a bishop, Paul (I.), first appears.Courtépée, p. 214. The first Christians in the neighborhood are said to have been a priest of Lyon named Marcellus, who was imprisoned by the Roman government along with other Christians of Lyon and their bishop, Pothinus, ca. 177 in the reign of Marcus Aurelius (161-180). The rest were executed, but Marcellus, eschewing martyrdom, managed to break out of prison and escape north along the Saône river, first to Tournus and then to Chalon. There he was taken in by a pagan, whom he converted to Christianity. Leaving Chalon, Marcellus encountered the provincial governor, who invited him to a celebration in his residence. When the governor began the celebration with an appropriate sacrifice, Marcellus excused himself on the grounds that he was a Christian; the governor ordered him to participate in the sacrifice, and Marcellus refused.H. Quentin (1908), Les martyrologues historiques du Moyen- Age, Paris, 1908, pp. 179-180; 284. This constituted refusal to obey a legitimate order, and, since prayer to the members of the Imperial Cult was involved, refusal constituted treason (laesa majestas) as well. The governor is said to have had Marcellus buried up to his waist on the bank of the Saône, where he died three days later. The method of death may be shocking, but Marcellus was a prison escapee, who refused a patriotic sacrifice, and disobeyed a Roman governor. Christians made him into a martyr.Besnard, pp. 451-456. While Besnard affirms the historical existence of Marcellus, he argues (along with others) that the Acts of the martyr Marcellus are unreliable. Bishop Flavius is credited with the foundation of the monastery of S. Pierre, just north of Chalon, in 584. It was destroyed by the Arabs in the 8th century, and rebuilt by Bishop Gerboldus, ca. 887 as a Benedictine monastery.Courtépée, p. 225. The monastery was attacked by the Huguenots in 1562 and despoiled, and the monks were driven out. King Charles IX turned the monastic buildings into a fortress in 1566 and paid the monks an annual pension in recompense.Gallia christiana IV, p. 961. Bishop Lupus (ca. 600), in a Life otherwise devoid of facts, is credited with founding a school for the study of the scriptures.Acta Sanctorum Januarius III, p. 392: satagebat quoque erga quotidianae eruditionis profectum, et instituta divinorum voluminum schola auditoribus suis caelestis eloquii copiam ministrabat. Batault, p. 9. By the time of Bishop Guillaume de Bellevesure (1294 – 1301), schools were to be found not just in Chalon, but also in towns and villages of the diocese. =Cathedral and other establishments= The original cathedral of Chalon was dedicated to Saint Étienne.Besnard, pp. 461-466. In 541 King Childebert presented the cathedral with relics purported to be those of Saint Vincent of Saragossa, in whose honor the name of the cathedral was changed. That cathedral was destroyed by the Arabs in the 8th century, and rebuilt by Charlemagne. It was in that church that the Council of 813 was held. In 1310 extensive repairs were necessary, and Bishop Robert de Decize taxed every curé in the diocese the sum of its first year's income upon entry into office to pay for the works. This tax was imposed for ten years. Bishop Nicolas de Vères completed two vaults of the choir in 1386. Bishop Hugues d'Orges erected the third vault, and Bishop Jean d'Arsonval the fourth and fifth, with contributions from the Chapter and the people. The consecration took place in 1403 by Bishop Olivier de Matreuil.Courtépée, pp. 216-217. The cathedral was severely damaged by the Huguenots in 1562.E. Fyot (1934-1935), \\"Les spoliations commises par les Calvinistes en 1562 dans la cathédrale Saint- Vincent de Chalon,\\" in: Mémoires de la Société d’Histoire et d’Archéologie de Chalon-sur-Saône 25 (Chalon-sur-Saône, 1934-1935), pp. 124-140. The cathedral was served by a Chapter, which was composed of dignities and canons. There were seven dignities at Chalon: the Dean, the Cantor, the Treasurer (who were elected by the whole Chapter), and the four Archdeacons (who were appointed by the bishop).Gallia christiana IV, p. 861. The Archdeacons were: Cabilonensis, de Bressia, de Trenorchio, and de Oscarensi. Longnon, p. xli. There were once thirty canons, but the number was reduced to twenty in 1218. In 1327 the number was set at twenty-five.Courtépée, pp. 217-218. In 1648 there were twenty-four canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 132 note 1. In 1772 the number was twenty.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 136 note 1. All the cathedral chapters in France were abolished by the Constituent Assembly on 13 February 1790. There was also a Collegiate Church in the city of Chalon, dedicated to Saint George.Adrien Martinet, \\"Note sur le sceau de la collégiale de Saint Georges de Chalon sur Saône,\\" Saint George had originally been a parish church, under the control of the monastery of Saint Pierre. It escaped the fire which destroyed most of the town during the siege of 834, but in 1323 it became a collegiate church with twelve canons. It was served by a Chapter composed of a Dean, a Cantor, a Sacristan, and thirteen prebends. The bishop has the right to confirm the election to vacant canonries. One of the canons was assigned the task of being the priest of the parish.Pouillie general p. 1-2. Courtépée, pp. 223-225. The abbey of Saint Marcellus (Marcel) was founded by King Guntram of Burgundy (561–592), where he completed a church in 577, and in which he was buried. The abbey was ruined by the Arabs in the 8th century, and again in the 10th century. When the Counts of Chalon became abbots commendatory, it recovered its prestige and financial status. The counts ceded their rights to the Abbey of Cluny, when then became one of their priories.Canat de Chizy, pp. vi-vii. Peter Abelard spent his final months at the priory of St. Marcel, where he died on 21 April 1142. His body was interred there for a time, but secretly moved to the nunnery of the Paraclete and the care of Abbess Héloïse. =Church councils at Chalon= A council of the church was held at Chalons c. 470, under the leadership of the Metropolitan, Bishop Patiens of Lyon, to elect a successor to the deceased Paul of Chalon. In the midst of party strife, the bishops fastened on Joannes and made him bishop. In 579 a council was summoned at Chalon by King Guntram to deal with Bishop Salonius of Embrun and Bishop Sagittarius of Gap, who had already been condemned in the second synod of Lyon on charges of adultery and homicide.J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus IX (Florence 1763), pp. 919-922. In 603 a council was held at Chalon, in which, at the instigation of Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia, Bishop Desiderius of Vienne was deposed and exiled.J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus X (Florence 1764), pp. 493-494. Hefele, IV, pp. 434, 463. Around the year 650 thirty-eight bishops met in council at Chalon, among whom was Bishop Gratus of Chalon. The council produced some twenty decisions (canons). Bishops Agapius of Digne and Bobo of Valence were degraded from the episcopal order for disregarding church canons.Mansi, Tomus X, pp. 1189-1198. Hefele, p. 463. In 674 Bishop Desideratus (Diddo) of Chalon and the deposed bishop Bobo of Valence attacked Autun and seized Bishop Leger, their enemy, who had led a revolt of the Burgundian nobility against Ebroin, Mayor of the Palace of Neustria. They blinded him on orders of Ebroin, and held him in a monastery for two years, at which point they cut off his ears and cut out his tongue; after two more years, they killed him.Juedin, Ddd ij. In 732 Chalons was captured and held by the Arabs of Spain, led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, Governor-General of al-Andalus, until after their defeat by Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours. A provincial council of Tertia Lugdunensis was held at Chalon in 813. It produced sixty-six canons.J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XIV (Venice 1769), pp. 91-108. Among the most important was the requirement of the establishment of a school in each cathedral, in which reading and writing and the scriptures would be taught. Batault, p. 6. Mansi, p. 94, Canon III: Oportet ut episcopi scholas constituant in quibus et litteras solertia disciplinae et Sacrae Scripturae documenta discantur... In 875 an assembly of bishops, led by Archbishop Remigius of Lyon, took place at Chalon at the church of S. Marcellus for the consecration of Adalgerius as Bishop of Autun. They then met and confirmed the properties belonging to the monastery of Tournus. Gerboldus Bishop of Chalon was present.Gallia christiana IV, p. 876. J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XVII (Venice 1772), pp. 299-302. Archbishop Remigius died on 28 October 875. In 887 nine archbishops and bishops, Bishop Stephen of Chalon among them, met at the church of Saint Marcellus outside the walls of Chalon, to deal with property issues of churches and villas involving the bishop of Langres.J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XVIII (Venice 1773), pp. 51-52. In 894 three bishops, headed by Bishop Gualo of Autun and including Ardradus of Chalon, met at the church of S. John the Baptist outside the walls of Chalon, to settle the case of the monk and Deacon Gerfredus of Autun, who had been accused of poisoning Bishop Adalgarus of Autun. Gerfredus was able to demonstrate his innocence by taking an oath and receiving holy communion, and was purged of the charge by all of the bishops.Mansi, XVIII, pp. 127-128. On 31 October 915 seven bishops met under the presidency of Austerius, Archbishop of Lyon, at the church of S. Marcellus outside the walls of Chalon to deal with the case of Roculsus, Count of Mâcon, who was threatened with excommunication for his refusal to respect various properties belonging to the church. They also dealt with a dispute between two priests over a parish church which was being usurped.Mansi, XVIII, pp. 325-326. Bishop Ardradus participated. A council was held at Chalon by the papal Apocrisiarius Aldebrannus (Hildebrand) in 1065, to adjudge the ownership of the church of Spinola. The Bishop of Chalon Guido (Wido) was present.J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XIX (Venice 1774), pp. 843-844. Guido's (Guy) presence creates a problem, since the dates usually assigned to his episcopacy are 1044–c. 1058, while Hildebrand did not become Apocrisiarius (Archdeacon) until 1059. A council was held at Chalon by Cardinal Peter Damiani, the Papal Legate, and thirteen bishops in 1063 in the reign of Pope Alexander II. Bishop Drogo of Mâcon had violated the privileges of the monastery of Cluny, and Abbot Hugh had gone to Rome and complained. The council found in favor of Cluny, and Bishop Drogo was compelled to beg pardon.Mansi (ed.), Tomus XIX, pp. 1025-1028. In 1115 a council was held at Tournus in the diocese of Chalon, presided over by Archbishop Guy of Vienne, the Papal Legate, at which Bishop Gualterius was present. The issue was a conflict between the two Collegiate Churches of Besançon, Saint John and Saint Stephen. Pope Paschal II had previously committed the case to Archbishop Guillaume of Besançon, who was unable to bring the two parties to agreement.J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Tomus XXI, pp. 139-144. =Black death= In July 1348 the bubonic plague reached Chalon. The mortality rate, at least in some sections of the diocese, is recorded at fifteen times the normal death rate. =Religious Orders= Bishop Cyrus de Thiard de Bissy was particularly favorable to the religious orders. He brought the Franciscans to Chalon in 1598, the Capuchins in 1604, the Carmelites in 1610, and the Dominicans in 1621.Du Tems, IV, p. 588. Efforts to bring the Jesuits to Chalon also began in the time of Bishop Cyrus, but the impetus came from the town council, which was eager to upgrade the quality of the Collège de Chalon. In 1608 the project was discussed, but the stumbling block was financial. The establishment of a Jesuit college in Autun kindled local patriotism, led by the Sieur de Pontoux who was serving as Mayor, and a committee of lawyers was appointed to try to obtain a royal brevet, which, succeeded, but this second project also failed for financial reasons. In 1618 yet another attempt was made under a new mayor, Sieur Mathieu, who convinced the town council to begin by consulting the Jesuit Provincial in Dijon, Fr. Ignace Armand. The Provincial sent an agent to Chalon to preach a series of sermons, and also to investigate the situation. Their conclusion was that the revenues were inadequate. Then, in 1618, it was learned that the Baron de Huxelles was willing to resign his benefice of the Priory of Saint-Marcel, and the town officials considered whether it could be handed over to the Jesuits. But the Baron's brother intervened, and one of the town councilors was opposed, and the project failed. In 1626 the Marquis de Huxelles inspired the convocation of a general assembly of the burghers and citizens of Chalon to provide the needed funds, but an opposition party proposed the introduction of the Oratorians instead, and nothing was accomplished. It was even questioned whether the assembly was legitimate. When the Prince de Condé obtained the government of Burgundy, he visited Chalons in December 1632, and ordered the Mayor to convoke an assembly, which he would attend personally. The opposition party, however, was able to speak to the Prince during a banquet given by Bishop de Neuchèze, which seriously upset the Prince, who left Chalon immediately. In June 1634, a new set of town officials was able to convince the Jesuit Provincial in Dijon, Fr. Filleau, as well as the Prince, that the arrangements were all in order, and on 26 June 1634 the contracts were finalized and the Jesuits placed in possession of the Collège de Chalon. They maintained the college until their expulsion from France in 1762.Perry, pp. 457-465. In 1784 King Louis XVI handed over the Collège de Chalon to the priests of the Congrégation-Saint-Joseph. In February 1791, the oath of allegiance to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy was demanded, and the priests of the Collège de Chalon refused to take the oath, bringing about their dismissal. Agents of the municipality took their place.Batault, pp. 159-162. In April 1635 Bishop de Neuchèze entertained in the episcopal palace for six days Zaga Christos, the (purported) twenty-two-year-old son of the Emperor of Ethiopia, who was on his way to the French Court.Perry, p. 465. In 1635 a pestilence struck Chalon and all of Provence. The house of the Franciscans in Chalon was very severely hit, and they were helped by a Capuchin, Fr. Mathias de Beaune, who had been sent after an appeal from the magistrates of Chalon. The unhappiness of the population was increased by the end of the siege of Dôle, which let loose on the countryside numbers of marauders who burned villages and robbed everyone and everything. In the same year the government demanded the registration of all adherents of the Protestant religion, and with the agreement of the Prince of Condé and Bishop de Neuchèze this was begun. Feeling ran so high in Chalon that the 'temple' of the Huguenots was burned to the ground.Perry, p. 466. =The end= In 1790 the Civil Constitution of the Clergy abolished (suppressed) more than fifty 'redundant' dioceses in France, as part of an effort to align the ecclesiastical dioceses in France with new political divisions called 'departements'. Chalon-sur-Saône became part of the 'Departement de Saône-et- Loire', with its headquarters at Autun, and was part of the 'Metropole du Sud- Est' with its headquarters at Lyon. On 15 February 1791 the 'electors' of Saône-et-Loire chose Jean-Louis Gouttes as their 'Constitutional Bishop'. He was executed during the Reign of Terror on 26 March 1794, shortly after Religion had been abolished in France and replaced by Reason. On 29 November 1801, Pope Pius VII reestablished the dioceses of France, but Chalon was not one of them. Chalon remained part of the diocese of Autun, with Lyon as its Metropolitan. In 1853, the Bishop of Autun was granted the title of Bishop of Autun-Châlon-sur-Saône-Mâcon, in memory of the suppressed dioceses, and on 8 December 2002, as part of a general reorganization of the ecclesiastical map of France, Pope John Paul II created a new archdiocese at Dijon, and made the diocese of Autun-Châlon-sur-Saône-Mâcon-Cluny its suffragan.

It takes place in 1881 and follows the adventures of teenagers Tad and Cissie as they travel across America with Khush the elephant. The book is mainly written in third person narrative from Tad's point of view, but also contains epistolary segments, consisting of letters from Cissie to her friend Ketty, towards whose home they are travelling. The novel was published in the United States as The Great American Elephant Chase by Holiday House. Plot summary Tad Hawkins is 15 years old and lives in the fictional Pennsylvania mining town of Markle. After his mother died in childbirth, he was taken in by his overbearing aunt, who treats him as an unpaid servant, existing only to be bossed around and humiliated by Mr Jackson, the lodger, and Esther, the hired help. Tad's life is changed when he gets caught up in a crowd on their way to see a travelling elephant show which has just arrived in town. After witnessing the \\"miracle cure\\" of a young crippled girl by the elephant keeper, he spots Esther and Mr Jackson in the crowd and hides in the elephant's trailer. Before he can escape, Khush, the elephant, is loaded into the trailer and Tad is on his way to another town. When Tad is discovered by Michael Keenan, the elephant keeper, he discovers that the cripple who was cured in Markle is in fact Keenan's younger daughter, Cissie. Keenan offers Tad a job looking after Khush to keep him from exposing the scam. Tad takes to life with Khush and the Keenans. However, Tad is not the only person to have discovered the scam. Mr Jackson and Esther are on the Keenans' tail. A train crash kills Keenan and his eldest daughter, Olivia, on the way to Pittsburgh. Mr Jackson arrives, brandishing papers to prove that Keenan sold Khush to him for $500. Cissie, the only surviving Keenan, insists that the papers were faked and that Khush belongs to her. She, Tad and Khush set off on a journey West, towards the Nebraskan home of a friend from the travelling show, Ketty, with Mr Jackson and Esther in hot pursuit. A kind old widower helps them on their way by disguising Cissie as a boy and giving them a boat in which to sail down the Ohio River with Khush. Khush does not take kindly to his confined quarters on the small flatboat and, a few days into their journey, pitches himself and Tad into the river. On being reunited with them, Cissie begins to reveal her heartache over the deaths of her father and sister. The three travellers find rest in a small religious community who have heard of Mr Jackson's claim of ownership. The group's elders agree to take Tad, Cissie and the elephant to the large port of Cairo if Khush shows that he wants to go with the two youths. Khush follows them into the hold of the coal barge and so they carry on along the river. However, Khush again becomes impatient of his dark, cramped surroundings rocks the barge, forcing the Captain to make them disembark 200 miles from Cairo. After walking most of the way to the port, Tad leaves Cissie and the elephant to rest and continues ahead by himself. In Cairo, he is caught by Mr Jackson and Esther, who ply him for information and trick him into leading them to where Cissie and Khush should have been. Luckily, Cissie and the elephant have already left, spurred on by the thought of seeing Ketty in Nebraska. Tad stalls Mr Jackson and Esther and hurries to try and catch up with his friends. Cissie secures passage for herself and Khush on a large boat and Tad, hiding on their pursuers' boat, is helped along his way by a friendly woman travelling in the same direction. When Tad sees a sign on the riverbank that Cissie and Khush have disembarked secretly, he goes ashore to meet them, leaving Esther and Mr Jackson sailing past their prey. The friends are pleased to be reunited and Cissie assures Tad that they are now in Nebraska and near Ketty's house. However, the plains are desolate, with little water for Khush to drink and nowhere to hide from their pursuers. Khush becomes impatient and irritable as the three travellers near Ketty's home. They arrive just as Esther and Mr Jackson catch up with them and Mr Jackson asserts his claim to Khush. However, while agreeing that the papers that Mr Jackson has are not fakes, Ketty reveals that Keenan could not have sold Khush as she owns him herself. Mr Jackson petitions Ketty and her husband to sell him the elephant but, when she refuses, he and Esther eventually leave in a rage. Cissie is upset that Khush belongs to Ketty as she had intended to sell him and give the money to Ketty so that she could remain in Nebraska with her. Tad persuades Cissie that Ketty will take her in no matter what. Ketty, seeing how much the boy and the elephant love each other, appoints Tad as Khush's keeper in exchange for a portion of the elephant's earnings. Reception The Great Elephant Chase has received great critical acclaim. It won the Whitbread Children's book award in 1992Costa Book Awards Past Winners and the Smarties Book Prize.

The stock epithet Kai identifies Bahman as one of the Kayanian kings of Iranian oral tradition. The 3rd-6th century Sassanians claimed to descend from Bahman and the Kayanids. This myth was combined with another legend in which the Sassanians were imagined to have descended from the Achaemenids, and in the post-Sassanid period Bahman came to equated with both Artaxerxes I and Cyrus the Great.  Legends  In the genealogy of the legendary Kayanian dynasty, Bahman is the son of Esfandiyar (hence his also being referred to in Middle Persian as 'Vohuman Asfandyar'), grandson of Goshtasp, husband of [daughter of the Egyptian king ] Komani/Homai, and father of Dara/Darab. Other details vary: Several different Arabic and Persian sources (e.g. al-Tabari and ibn al- Balkhi) assert that Bahman had five children; two sons, Dara/Darab and Sasan/Sassan, and three daughters, Komani/Homai (stock epithet: Chehrazad), Bahmandokht and Farnak. In the Bahman-nama (composed ca. 1100 CE, not to be confused with a 15th-century hagiography of the Deccan Bahmanids) Bahman is portrayed as being asked by Rostam to marry Katayun/Kasayun, daughter of the King of Kashmir. Bahman does so, but subsequently has to flee to Egypt where he marries Homai, the daughter of the Egyptian king, with whom he has a daughter also named Homai. Other sources have Bahman marrying his own daughter Komani/Homai on account of her great beauty, and that Dara/Darab was the result of this union. In one tradition (reiterated by ibn al-Balkhi), the marriage was denied and Homai dies a spinster. The name 'Bahman'/'Wahman' is a theophoric reflecting Middle Persian Vohuman, Avestan Vohu Manah, the Amesha Spenta (Ameshaspand) that is the hypostasis of the \\"Good Mind\\" or \\"Good Disposition.\\" Unlike most figures of Iranian oral tradition, Bahman does not however appear in the surviving Avesta. He is however referred to in the Zand-i Wahman yasn (also known as the Bahman Yasht, which--despite that name-- is not an Avestan Yasht, but a medieval pseudo-prophetic/apocaplyptic text). The figure is also mentioned in the 9-11th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition, specifically, the Middle Persian Bundahishn (GBd 36.9) and the Denkard (VII.6), both of which enumerate the Kayanian kings. In both the Zand-i Vohuman Yasht (3.20-29) and the Denkard, Bahman is described as \\"one of the greatest Mazdayasnian kings of Iran.\\" \\"The importance attached to Bahman's reign in Zoroastrian literature can be seen in a passage in the Bahman yašt where the reigns of the kings are likened to tree branches made of seven metals.\\" In this comparison, which lists the reigns in order of perceived importance, the 'silver' reign of Bahman appears second, after the 'golden' reign of (likewise mythological) Goshtasp and before the 'brass' reign of the Sassanid Ardashir I, the 'bronze' reign of the Arsacid Balash, the 'tin' reign of the Sassanid Bahram V Gor, the 'steel' reign of the Sassanid Khosrow I Anushirvan, with 'iron' (which is considered impure in Zoroastrianism) representing the \\"rule of the shaggy-haired demons (dēws) born of the seed of anger, probably referring to the rule of the Arabs.\\" Persian miniature: Bahman has Faramarz shot full of arrows in Kabul In Firdausi's Shahnameh (ca. 1000 CE), which versifies and embellishes previous tradition, Bahman's father Esfandiar is portrayed as having been killed by Rostam. The Shahnameh goes on to describe how Bahman sets off with a large army to avenge his father's death. In the meanwhile however, Rostam had already been treacherously killed by Rostam's half-brother Shaghad. Frustrated, Bahman instead kills Rostam's son Faramarz, imprisons Rustom's father Zal (whom he however releases on the behest of his uncle Peshotan), and lays waste to Rostam's feudal lands. Again, the details in other sources vary. According to al-Tabari, al-Masudi and al- Atir, Bahman himself killed not only Rostam but Faramarz, Zal and Rostam's brother Zavara as well. Ibn al-Balkhi includes only Faramarz and Zal. The Bahman-nama has Bahman mourning for Rostam, who--along with Zavara--are described as having been killed by the king of Kabul. In this text, Bahman does however travel to Rostam's (now Faramarz's) fiefdom, where he battles Rostam's son (who then flees) but where he takes Zal prisoner. Bahman then pursues Rostam's daughter's Banu Goshasp and Zar Banu to Kashmir, and then Faramarz to India, where Faramarz is finally slain. Having captured Rostam's/Faramarz's lands, Bahman then seeks to destroy the tombs of Rostam and his ancestors (Garshasp, Nariman and Sam). At each of the respective tombs he receives a precious gift and a message asking him to stay his hand, which he does. Chastened, he then frees Zal and Rostam's daughters, and rebuilds everything he had previously destroyed. In the Bahman-nama, Bahman is killed by a dragon while out hunting. In Iranian tradition, such a fate is typically reserved for villains, and this is the only instance in which a legitimate king is said to have been killed in such a fashion. The length of his reign varies; the Middle Persian Bundahishn and most of the Arabic and Persian sources note 112 years, others note 120 and yet others 80 years. The sources agree on the line of succession and state that Bahman selected his daughter (or daughter/wife) Homai to succeed him, instead of Sassan, the heir-apparent (see below for the result of the conflict that ensued). In another version of the tale, Homai succeeds Bahman only because Dara is not yet born when Bahman dies. Although there is no epigraphically attested figure to whom the Bahman of legend corresponds, several post-Sassanid Arabic and Persian commentaries assign the mythological king several features and events that do correspond to historical figures. Several sources ascribe to Bahman deeds that are known to have been performed by Cyrus the Great, including freeing the Jews from Babylonian captivity, and two sources assert that Cyrus was appointed to this task by Bahman. Other sources give Bahman the epithet \\"the long-handed,\\" which identifies him with Artaxerxes I 'Longimanus' (\\"the long-handed\\"). Yet other sources identify the figure of legend as 'Ardeshir Bahman', perhaps a reference to Artaxerxes II 'Mnemon', who probably had the Old Persian form of 'Bahman' (> Greek 'Mnemon' \\"mindful\\") as a name. In one legend, Bahman's elder son Dara(b) is killed in battle with Alexander the Great, that is, Dara/Darab is identified as Darius III and which then makes Bahman a figure of the 4th century BCE. In another tradition, Alexander is the son of Dara/Darab and his wife Nahid, who is described to be the daughter of \\"Filfus of Rûm\\" i.e. \\"Philip the Greek\\" (cf. Philip II of Macedon). In the typically contrived genealogies of Iranian dynasties, Ardashir I--founder of the Sassanid dynasty --traces his lineage to Bahman. In one tale (which in the Shahnameh is a continuation of the above-mentioned story of Bahman and Faramarz), Bahman's second son Sassan, resenting his father's choice of Homai as heir, leaves the house and travels to Nishapur, where he takes a wife, and with whom he has a son whom he names after himself, and who would be the grandfather of Ardashir I. In another tale later in the Shahnameh, Dara has a son named Sassan, who went to India where he took a wife, and whose descendants were all named Sassan, and whose great-great-grandson was the father of Ardashir I. The first Shahnameh story, though differing from the older Bundahishn and al-Tabari in the intervening lineage, concur in that they all trace Ardashir's lineage to Bahram through Bahram's younger son Sassan. On the other hand, the Shahnameh's second story is consistent with the account of the Karnamag in that it traces Ardashir's lineage to Bahram through Humai. \\"In any case all these stories were obviously fabricated in the Sasanian period to provide evidence for the legitimacy of Ardašīr and his descendants.\\" References Bibliography * .

A 1981 survey showed that SAS was ranked no. 14 of 17 airlines in Europe when it came to punctuality. Furthermore, the company had a reputation for being a very centralized organization, where decisions were hard to come by to the detriment of customers, shareholders, and staff. He revolutionized the airline industry through an unrelenting focus on customer service quality. One of the first things Jan Carlzon did at SAS was to introduce the world's first separate cabin for Business Class while at the same time doing away with First Class on its European routes. Within one year of taking over, SAS had become the most punctual airline in Europe and had started an ongoing training program called Putting People First developed by Claus Møller of Time Manager International ('TMI'). The program was focused on delegating responsibility away from management and allowing customer-facing staff to make decisions to resolve any issues on the spot. Jan Carlzon said at the time: \\"Problems are solved on the spot, as soon as they arise. No front- line employee has to wait for a supervisor's permission.\\". These changes soon impacted the bottom-line as well and the company made a profit of $54 million in 1982.

This decentralisation of the organization led to both a large boost in company morale and the formalization of the training methodology of the program in a joint venture in 1982 with TMI called Scandinavian Service School. Scandinavian Service School since went on to establish offices in all three of the Scandinavian countries as well as Finland and the training program was exported to other airlines including British Airways and Japan Airlines. The flat organizational structure, delegation processes, and empowerment of employees adopted at SAS also led to Carlzon writing a book, Riv pyramiderna! (Swe., which translates into Tear Down the Pyramids), published by Bonnier in Stockholm in 1985 and translated into English in 1987 by Harper Perennial under the title Moments of Truth. The American Management Association, in their 75th anniversary issue of their magazine in 1998 called this one of the most important developments in management of the 20th century. The changes at SAS led to Air Transport World naming SAS the Airline of the Year for 1983 in early 1984. Carlzon also oversaw a complete corporate identity re-design, a process which was marred when a journalist gained unlawful access to a hangar with a plane painted in a proposed livery was photographed and widely published in Scandinavian newspapers. Unfortunately, either the brief to the agency, Landor Associates, was not good enough or they had misunderstood it and painted the plane with 5 crowns to symbolize the 5 Nordic countries. This caused a huge public furore as SAS only contains the airlines of the three monarchies Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Incidentally, the other two Nordic countries, Finland and Iceland, are both republics and would therefore not be represented by crowns. The task of re-developing the corporate identity was later given to another firm. In the latter years of Carlzon's tenure at SAS he was coming under increased pressure from shareholders as competitors had caught up with the lead established by SAS in the business market in the early 1980s. At the same time increasing oil prices and a less than profitable first class operation led to SAS scrapping First Class on its intercontinental routes and retiring its Boeing 747s from service, a task completed in 1987. SAS has never since flown aircraft with as large a capacity as it does not believe the flights would be profitable. =After SAS= Carlzon left SAS in November 1993 and founded the investment company Ledstiernan in 1994 where he was chairman. Carlzon was also one of the founders of the Internet retail company CDON AB. In 1999 he became chair of the Swedish Tennis Association and a board member in the International Tennis Federation. He served as chair of the British Swedish Chamber of Commerce between 2003 and 2006British Swedish Chamber of Commerce newsletter Summer 2003 and, until June 2010, he chaired the entrepreneurs' organization Företagarna.Företagarna He was also one of the founders of European telecoms company NETnet International S.A. and is part owner and chair of Karl Stockman AB, a Swedish investment company. Personal life In 1966, he married Agneta Wärn (born 1942), a flight attendant, the daughter Evert Wärn and Evy (née Axelsson). Quotes *\\"We have 50,000 moments of truth every day.\\" – said at the start of the First Wave seminars to turn SAS around in 1982 and referring to every time an employee of the company came into contact with a customer.Later that quote was rewritten in the book \\"Moments of Truth\\" where Carlzon said: \\"Last year each of our ten million customers came in contact with approximately five SAS employees, and this contact lasted an average of 15 seconds each time. The SAS is 'created' 50 million times a year, 15 seconds at a time. These 50 million 'moments of truth' are the moments that ultimately determine whether SAS will succeed or fail as a company. They are the moments when we must prove to our customers that SAS is their best alternative.\\", Carlzon, Jan: Moments of Truth, 1987, p. 3 *\\"An individual without information can't take responsibility. An individual with information can't help but take responsibility.\\" *\\"I learned that, before you reach an objective, you must be ready with a new one, and you must start to communicate it to the organization.

This fort is located in the Ahmadnagar district of Maharashtra. It is on the boundary of Ahmadnagar and Thane districts. The fort is about 400 years old. This fort is often covered with flowering plants in November. Ratangad is also called Jewels of the Fort.http://www.meraevents.com/event/trek-to-ratangad-jewel-of- forts Places to see Ratangad has a natural rock peak with a cavity in it at the top which is called 'Nedhe' or 'Eye of the Needle'. The fort has four gates Ganesh, Hanuman, Konkan and Trimbak. The sculptures of Lord Ganesh and Hanuman are seen on the main gate.http://maharashtratimes.indiatimes.com/maharashtra/pune- news/ratangad/articleshow/54021195.cms It also has many wells on the top.Gadkot - Bhagwan Chile, Shivsparsha Prakashan The main attraction at Ratanwadi is the Amruteshwar Temple, famous for its carvings, dating back to the Hemadpant Era - roughly from the eighth century. The fort is origin for the river Pravara/Amrutvahini. The Bhandardara dam(arthar dam) is built on this river.From the top of the fort neighbouring forts like Alang, kulang, Madan gad, Harishchandragad, Patta are seen easily. The view of entire Bhandardara dam( Lake Arthur) gives sheer pleasure. There are many rock cut water cisterns on the fort. Some of them store potable water throughout the year. There is a natural hole in the mountain top probably caused by wind erosion. It is 10 feet high and 60 feet wide. Due to its shape it is called Nedhe (or eye of the needle in Marathi).On the eastern side of the fort there are two caves, which can be used for overnight stay. This fort can be visited in any part of the year however the beast season is from October–February when the temperature is cool and the vegetation has not dried up.. History The fort is 400 years old.https://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/treasures/fort/ratangad Ratangad was captured by Chhatrapati Shivaji Raje Bhosle. How to reach There are two main routes to reach the fort. One route starts from village Samrad and the other from village Ratanwadi. The base village Ratanwadi is approached by boat from Bhandardara or by road from Ghoti-Bhandardara road. By boat, it is a 6 km journey and further it is a 4 km walk till Ratanwadi. The trek route from Ratanwadi is the simplest one, it passes through dense forest along the northern bank of the Pravara river,http://trekshitiz.com/trekshitiz/marathi/Ratangad-Trek-R-Alpha.html till it reaches a scarp. The final climb is made easy by the iron ladders constructed by the forest department. The local villagers on weekends, erect small shacks on the way to provide tea and snacks for the trekkers. Some villagers provide food and snacks on the fort cave also. The trek route from village Samrad is quite difficult one, it passes over the narrow spur and finally reaches the Trymbak darwaja. The entire fort can be seen by taking a path which moves around the ridge of the fort. A small group of people can make an overnight stay in the cave on the fort.

According to Cyril Toumanoff he may have been a scion of the Pharnavazid dynasty, while Richard N. Frye states that he was an Iranian, possibly related to the royal Sasanian family. Although Amazasp III is unfortunately unknown to the High Medieval & Georgian literary traditions, some Georgian chronicles do record two early kings named Amazasp. However, Amazasp III is indeed attested in a contemporaneous text of the Sasanian Empire, an Old Persian written source, and in the tri-lingual inscription found in Ka'ba-ye Zartosht Temple in which is the lists of the Princedom of Wirričān (Iberia) as among the Persian dependencies and Protectorates and testifies to an privileged diplomatic position of its Princedom. Hamazasp, III was said to be of high rank in the contemporaneous Court Hierarchy of the Persian Sasanian dynasty and entirely of the Old Persian world. He is mentioned early in the tri- lingual inscription only following the names of King Ardashir of Adiabene, King Ardashir of Kirman, and also Queen Denag of Meshan, and preceded by a long list of minor princes, ministers, and satrapal Dukes and Temple Ruler’s of the Royal cities of the Empire. Professor Cyril Toumanoff has suggested that Amazasp III was ‘helped’ to be proclaimed King by the influence of energetic Sasanian High King Shapur I as a helpful anti-king to the although Romano-phile Prince Mihrdat II of Iberia, who is known only and exclusively from the Georgian chronicles. Another Sasanian inscription, of the Zohroastiani high priest indeed alludes to a sunset invasion of Iberia (and of Albania) some time after 260. Amazasp III seems to have been dispossessed of the throne in 265, the moment, precisely, when Shapur’s imperial activity was definitely coming to an end.W.B.

As with most of MacLean's novels, it depicts adventure, treachery, and murder in an unforgiving environment, set this time in the steamy jungles of South America.  Plot introduction  In 1945, with the Allies approaching, two German officers ransack a monastery in Greece and make plans to escape with the loot. One of the Germans is left behind by his partner, while the other escapes by submarine from Wilhelmshaven. Twenty years elapse. A wealthy millionaire, Smith, hires Hamilton, allegedly an expert on the jungle, to lead him to the ruins of a lost Indian civilization recently discovered in the wilderness of the Amazon jungle in Brazil. The entourage faces giant anacondas, giant spiders (only mentioned in a conversation), cannibalistic natives, and so on, discovering a settlement of Nazi war criminals and their descendants, living as if the Third Reich had never ended. It is soon clear that Smith's real purpose has little to do with archaeology, and more to do with revenge. Reception The Globe and Mail book reviewer wrote that \\"It's hard to know what's been happening to Alistair Maclean since he wrote such solidly constructed thrillers as When Eight Bells Toll and The Guns of Navarone. More and more, structure, characterization and originality seem to have yielded to a haphazard mixture of contrived melodrama and bizarre geographic phenomena. His latest, River of Death... almost suggests he is now aiming for the kind of semi- juvenile market that once existed for adventure yarns with incredibly endowed British heroes pitted against nature's perils and foreign villainy in Pago Pago or Walla Walla.\\"Alistair Maclean going through the motions and disintegration in Montreal IT'S A CRIME Murdoch, Derrick.

Background Before colonial rule was established in Botswana, a traditional constitution - a body of laws known as - was used by tribal chiefs, or diKgosi, of the Botswana people.Mafela, Lily (2007-12-15). \\"Batswana Women and Law\\". Cahiers d'études africaines. 47 (187–188): 523–566. . During the early years of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, some non-Botswana also came to be ruled by these laws.Griffiths, J. E. S. (1970).

History. 75: 207–231 – via JSTOR. In 1959, a Constitutional Committee of the Joint Advisory Council drew up the Protectorate's first formal constitution, which came into operation in 1960.Barry,, Morton,. Historical dictionary of Botswana. Ramsay, Jeff,, Based on (work): Morton, Fred, 1939- (Fifth edition ed.). Lanham, Maryland. . OCLC 1037884220 In 1963 consultations began for a second constitution which would confer self-government. The 1965 general election was held under this constitution, which was modelled on the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy: there was a unicameral legislature; a prime minister and cabinet of five ministers responsible to the legislature; and a purely consultative Ntlo ya Dikgosi. When Botswana achieved full independence on 30 September 1966, the prime minister was replaced by a president elected by the legislature (renamed the National Assembly, and given executive powers.Sebudubudu, David (December 2011). \\"Wealth Sharing for Conflict Prevention and Economic Growth: Botswana Case Study of Natural Resource Utilization For Peace and Development\\". University of Botswana. A series of later amendments to the Constitution have increased the number of elected members of the National Assembly, and the size of the Ntlo ya Dikgosi. Other constitutional changes were made in 1994 and 1997.Poteete, Amy. (2018). Renegotiation of Executive Powers and Executive-Legislative Relations in Botswana. Structure The constitution is divided into 9 chapters, each detailing certain areas such as individual rights and the delegation of executive powers. # The Republic # Protection of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual # Citizenship # The Executive # Parliament # The Judicature # The Public Service # Finance # Miscellaneous = The Republic = This section declares Botswana an independent nation as well as defines the public seal. = Protection of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual = This section defines the rights of the citizens. It begins by stating that everyone is guaranteed rights regardless of race, creed, or sex. The rights are as follows: \\"(a) life, liberty, security of the person and the protection of the law; (b) freedom of conscience, of expression and of assembly and association; and (c) protection for the privacy of his or her home and other property and from deprivation of property without compensation, the provisions of this Chapter shall have effect for the purpose of affording protection to those rights and freedoms subject to such limitations of that protection as are contained in those provisions, being limitations designed to ensure that the enjoyment of the said rights and freedoms by any individual does not prejudice the rights and freedoms of others or the public interest.\\" = Citizenship = This section was repealed from the constitution. = The Executive = This section defines the executive branch including the President, Vice President, and Cabinet.  The President  The President is the chief executive of the state. The President is elected president by members of the National Assembly. These members state on the ballot who they would support for President if elected, and after election to the National Assembly vote for whomever they indicated they would elect as President. The President has the following requirements: (a) is a citizen of Botswana by birth or descent; (b) has attained the age of 30 years; and (c) is qualified to be elected as a Member of the National Assembly. The Presidents term is limited up to 10 years, or however long the President holds office in the National Assembly. The executive power of Botswana resides solely in the President. The President is also the commander of the armed forces. The president also has the power to pardon a person convicted of a crime.  The Vice President  The Vice President is chosen by the President from among the members of the National Assembly. The Vice President takes over for the President when the President is unable to fulfill his duties either because of illness, death, or other reasons. The Vice President is second-in-command to the President and carries out the missions of the President.  The Cabinet  This Cabinet is composed of the President, the Vice President and no more than six ministers who are appointed by the President from the National Assembly. The Ministers in the Cabinet are responsible for advising the President with respect to policy of the government. = Parliament = This section describes both the National Assembly as well as the Ntlo ya Dikgosi which together create the Parliament of Botswana.  National Assembly  The Parliament consists of the President and National Assembly. The president is a voting member of the National Assembly. There are an additional 57 elected members of the National Assembly. There is also a speaker of the Assembly who is elected by the members of the Assembly, but does not necessarily have to be a member of the assembly themselves. There is also a deputy speaker elected by the Assembly. In order for a person to be eligible to be a member of the Assembly they must: be a citizen of Botswana, be 18 years old, is registered to vote, and is able to speak and read in English. There are many conditions that disqualify a member from eligibility, most of these dealing with allegiance to other countries. Botswana is divided into the number of constituencies that they have members of parliament so that each district sends one member to the Assembly. People in Botswana are eligible to vote if they are: 18, a citizen, and have resided in Botswana for 12 consecutive months.  Ntlo ya Dikgosi  In addition to a parliament, Botswana also has a Ntlo ya Dikgosi. The Ntlo ya Dikgosi acts as an advisory body to the Parliament of Botswana. This body consists of 33-35 members. In order to be eligible to be a member one must be 21 years old and a citizen. There are similar disqualifying conditions for this body as there are for the National Assembly. The member is appointed for 5 year terms. No member may participate in party politics, and many members are tribal chiefs. This body possesses no legislative power, including approval or veto power, rather they advise the Parliament on bills and measures. A power the body does have is to summon members of the government to appear before it. = The Judicature = This section describes the varying parts of the judiciary in Botswana including the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the Judicial Service Commission.  High Court  The High Court of Botswana acts as the supreme legal source, in which the court possesses unlimited original jurisdiction to hear any cases. The court has a Chief Judge as well as a number of other judges, in which the number is determined by the Parliament. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President, as well as all of the other Justices but these can be advised to the President by the Parliament. In order to be qualified to be a judge on this court one must have either been a judge, been an attorney, been a law professor with a law degree, or been a Chief Magistrate. Appointments to this court are until the person reaches the age of 70. The only other reason a judge would leave the high court is if the Parliament decides the person is no longer able to properly perform their duties. The High Court has authority to interpret the constitution. If there is disagreement on any interpretation, that disagreement is settled by the High Court.  Court of Appeals  The Court of Appeals has the right to hear any case in Botswana in which one party has appealed the decision found. This court consists of a President of the Court of appeals, a number of other judges, and the entirety of the High Court. Like the High Court, the President is appointed by the President as are the other judges, with the advice of Parliament. In order to be qualified a person must have been either a judge, attorney, or law professor. As is with the High Court a person is appointed until the age of 70, barring Parliament does not find them incapable during their tenure.  Judicial Service Commission  The Judicial Service Commission is created to help advise the President on judicial nominations. It consists of the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeals, the Attorney-General, the Chairman of the Public Service Commission, a member of the Law Society nominated by the Law Society, and a person of integrity and experience who is not a legal practitioner appointed by the President. = The Public Service = This section details rules and regulations regarding public service. This section states anything not stated in the constitution or by an act of Parliament will be under the jurisdiction of the President. There will also be a Public Service Commission of 2-4 members serving 3 year terms. This commission hears all appeals of public servants who have been removed from their position and would like to return to it. If a person disagrees with the ruling of this commission they may appeal directly to the President. The President is allowed to appoint or remove people to or from: Ambassador, High Commissioner, Secretary to the Cabinet, Attorney-General, Director of Public Prosecutions, Permanent Secretary, Commissioner of Police, and f. any other superscale office. This section also establishes 5 year renewable terms for the Director of Public Prosecutions as well as establishes a 60 year age limit for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Auditor-General. Finally, this section protects pre-existing pensions for people receiving pension before the creation of the Constitution. = Finance = This section describes the varying financial rules. It begins by setting up a Consolidation Fund in which all revenue made by the country will be combined into one fund. Parliament regulates the use of this fund. Contingency funds may also be created by Parliament in emergencies in order to make it easier to use funds outside of the Consolidation Fund. There is an Auditor General position who is accountable for the accounts of the country. = Miscellaneous = The final part of the Constitution details 3 main ideas. First, it establishes a process for a public servant to resign from their position. Second, it states a person can be reappointed to a public servant position unless explicitly not allowed by the Constitution or a law of Parliament. Third, it defines shortened versions of phrases used such as \\"Assembly\\" for the National Assembly.  Scholarly critiques of the Constitution  While the constitution has been relatively stable in terms of being the governing document, some scholars, including Gretchen Bauer, Druscilla Scribner, John Holm, as well as others have argued that the constitution does not adequately protect women or minorities. In Botswana there have been movements in order to try and establish gender quotas in the constitution, so that women are more able to win seats in the National Assembly.Bauer, Gretchen, and Jennie E. Burnet. \\"Gender quotas, democracy, and women's representation in Africa: Some insights from democratic Botswana and autocratic Rwanda.\\" Women's Studies International Forum. Vol. 41. Pergamon, 2013. This is due to the fact that with Botswana's first past the post electoral system, it is very hard for women of any party to win seats. While these gender quota initiatives have been largely ineffective, they prove the point, according to some scholars, that the constitution has failed to account for the need of constitutional provisions protecting female representation. Botswana's constitution is noted for being extremely gender neutral, with only one reference to sex in the entire document.Scribner, Druscilla, and Priscilla A. Lambert. \\"Constitutionalizing difference: A case study analysis of gender provisions in Botswana and South Africa.\\" Politics & Gender 6.1 (2010): 37-61. Some would argue that this is beneficial as to show gender equality; however, others point to this gender neutrality as acceptance of de facto discrimination. Those who argue this state that women have to fight for laws in the negative, that is they have to get laws to allow them to do things that should already be granted to them in the constitution. Another criticism of the constitution is that it was written by the current, and so far only, ruling party in the country.Holm, John D. \\"Botswana: A paternalistic democracy.\\" World Affairs 150.1 (1987): 21-30. The Bechuanaland Democratic party (BDP) was founded by Seretse Khama before Botswana was an independent nation, and since the countries independence the BDP has been the only party to rule, although in fairness they have been elected through democratic elections. Due to the continuous rule of this single party, many fear that the constitution in place unfairly biases the electorate toward the party and its supporters. This has also led to criticism about class and ethnicity conflict. Some praise the constitution for its allowance of political competition.Solway, Jacqueline S. \\"Navigating the neutral state: Minority rights in Botswana.\\" Journal of Southern African Studies 28.4 (2002): 711-729. Because the National Assembly is elected democratically by the people, it allows for minority representation in the Assembly. This is important because minority voices can sometimes be hidden in certain electoral systems, but some say that the way the constitution of Botswana was written, it protects the voices of the minorities. Another argument that some scholars make is in reference to the power of the President.Molomo, Mpho G. \\"Democracy under siege: the Presidency and executive powers in Botswana.\\" (2000). The constitution places a lot of power in the position of President, and as the country has had only one ruling party there is little checks place on who becomes President and who is able to advise and consent to certain presidential actions. This has led some scholars to call for direct elections of the President so that the President is held more accountable by the people as well as by the National Assembly. Another criticism is the constitutions handling of tribes and tribal law.Nyati- Ramahobo, Lydia. \\"From a phone call to the high court: Wayeyi visibility and the Kamanakao Association's campaign for linguistic and cultural rights in Botswana.\\" Journal of Southern African Studies 28.4 (2002): 685-709. The constitution does do a lot to cater to the tribal system, including the Ntlo ya Dikgosi or tribal advisory body; however, some argue that this unfairly favors powerful tribes leaving smaller tribes to be ruled by a body that does not represent their interests. This argument states that the constitution should be amended to include an easier and fairer way to divide power among tribes, especially because the current divisions were created with the constitution in 1966. Overall, many of the scholars cited here, including Jacqueline Solway, Mpho Molomo, and Lydia Nyati-Ramahobo, praise the constitution of Botswana for being extremely progressive for its time in its attempt to have gender and minority equality; however, there are scholars that have been cited here who feel there is still work to be done in order to have a truly equal and fair constitution for all people of Botswana.

Life He was born on 4 February 1788 at Exeter, the eldest son of Timothy Kenrick, Unitarian minister, and his first wife, Mary, daughter of John Waymouth of Exeter. He was educated at the local grammar school run by the Rev. Charles Lloyd and later at the nonconformist academy conducted by his father and the Rev. Joseph Bretland. In 1807, Kenrick matriculated at Glasgow University. He was the first prizeman in his class for three successive years, won the Gartmore gold medal for an essay on the English constitution in the Tudor period, and a silver medal for an essay on the aberration of light. He graduated MA in 1810. Later that year, Kenrick became classics tutor at Manchester College, York. In 1819, he was given leave of absence to spend a sabbatical year in Germany, reading history at Göttingen. He returned to York in 1820 and began translating German classical works, including August Wilhelm Zumpt's Latin Grammar, Rost and Wusteman's Introduction to Greek Prose Composition and Matthiae's Greek Grammar. In 1840, when the college returned to Manchester, Kenrick became professor of history, a post he held until his retirement in 1850. He continued to live in York, and travelled to Manchester to deliver lectures. Several of his pupils became celebrated for their writing, most notably John James Tayler (1797–1869), James Martineau (1805–1900), and George Vance Smith (1816–1902). Kenrick died on 7 May 1877 and was buried in York Cemetery. Works He published The Egypt of Herodotus (1841), Ancient Egypt under the Pharaohs (1850), and Phoenicia (1855). Family Kenrick married, on 13 August 1821, Laetitia Wellbeloved (1795-1879), daughter of the principal of Manchester College, York, Charles Wellbeloved. They had no children.

Only the option in favor of the Republic has remained permanent. The successive changes of political regimes and of governments have not blunted the determination of the Béninese people to search for, in their own spirit, the cultural, philosophical and spiritual values of civilization which sustain the forms of their patriotism.

It was originally opened in 1850 as a railway between Cork and Passage West, but was converted to gauge in 1902. An extension southwards from Passage West to Crosshaven opened in 1904. The railway closed in 1932 and has since been replaced by a public pathway and nature area.  Route  The path in 2012 The railway operated along the west bank of the River Lee and Cork Harbour from Cork to Blackrock and Passage West. Thereafter the 1904 extension headed inland towards Carrigaline before running alongside the south bank of the Owenabue River to Crosshaven. Stations were : *Cork Albert Street railway station (replaced the earlier Cork Victoria Road railway station) *Show Ground Halt railway station *Blackrock (CBPR) railway station *Rochestown railway station *Passage railway station *Glenbrook (CBPR) railway station *Monkstown railway station *Rafeen railway station *Carrigaline railway station *Crosshaven railway station  Early years  The initial, northern, part of the railway (Cork to Passage West) was less than long; it opened on 8 June 1850. The station at Cork was originally located at City Park, but relocated to Albert Park in 1873 (close to the Albert Quay station of the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway). Three steam locomotives were built. The company also operated ferries, but lost a considerable part of the traffic from Cobh following the opening of a direct railway from Cobh to Cork in 1862. The of track provided insufficient revenue for the company. To improve profitability, the company decided to build a 9½ mile extension to Crosshaven. To reduce construction costs, the extension line would be built to narrow gauge and the original section converted. The last broad gauge train operated in October 1900. Four new narrow gauge locomotives were built for the line by Neilson Reid in Glasgow. Upon rebuilding to narrow gauge, the section between Cork and Blackrock was converted to double track - unique on an Irish narrow gauge railway. The CB&PR; had a busy commuter traffic (to and from Cork). The southern extension from Passage West to Monkstown opened on 1 August 1902 and the final section to Crosshaven opened in 1904; the extension included a tunnel at Passage and large lattice viaduct near Crosshaven. The cost of the extension (£200,093 or around €18M 2007/8 equivalent) was considerably more than the company had originally estimated; the works were carried out just at the time when the railway started to experience serious competition from the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company, which included services to Blackrock (via Blackrock Road) and Douglas.  War years  The company's fortunes started to seriously deteriorate in 1914 due to disruption caused by conflict. This compounded the difficulties caused by competition from the electric trams. = World War I = The line ran close to several naval installations, notably at Haulbowline. Crosshaven station was closed on security grounds, heavily curtailing revenue. In 1917 the Government took over control of all railways in Ireland for the remainder of the War. = Irish Civil War = The railway suffered extensive damage during the Irish Civil War of 1922–1923. The workshops at Passage were damaged. The viaduct at Douglas was partly destroyed, but was repaired (mainly by engineers of the Irish Army).  Final years  In 1924 the company was incorporated into the Great Southern Railway. As an economy measure, the double track section of the railway was singled in 1927. Competition from motor buses started to become intense (and the Cork tramways were also affected, closing in 1931). The section between Monkstown and Crosshaven closed on 31 May 1932. The rest of railway closed on 10 September 1932. Upon closure, some of the line's steam locomotives were transferred to the Cavan and Leitrim Railway.  Recent times  A pedestrian bridge at the Rochestown end of the path Since the closing of the railway, the line has been paved over to serve as a recreational walkway, with lighting and benches put in place. Two bridges were put in place along the Rochestown area of the path for pedestrians. The Albert Road station building has survived. It was for many years occupied by Metal Products Ltd. who operated a factory producing nuts, bolts and other metal components. It is currently occupied by Carey's tool hire company. The section of former rail between Albert Road and the Atlantic pond has been mostly removed. From the Atlantic Pond to Rochestown a paved footpath follows the route of the rail line. The rest of the walkway to Passage consists of a gravel walkway that follows the river. There is evidence of the rail line between Passage and Monkstown, then onto Carrigaline. From the eastern edge of Carrigaline town the walkway continues to the outskirts of Crosshaven. Along the route you can still see various remains of the original rail line. The Blackrock signal house and platform are still intact, it is located under the bridge on the Blackrock road close to Blackrock church (the house is now privately owned). The bridge over the Douglas estuary, between Blackrock and Rochestown is still standing, although it had fallen into disrepair until the late 1990s when extensive repair work was completed. The remains of the Rochestown platform can be seen from the Rochestown road, opposite the pub \\"The Rochestown Inn\\". At various points on the route from Passage to Monkstown and Carrigaline, smaller bridges, old water towers and tunnels are visible. Along the length of walkway from Carrigaline, signal lights for the trains have been restored and line the Owenabue River to Crosshaven. Work began in May 2017 to improve the path that connected to the Marina Park, as well as the park itself.http://www.eveningecho.ie/corknews/Work-begins-on-Corks-new-Marina- Park-633db92e-b84e-44a6-a2da-3f42d4d73e23-ds From the pedestrian bridge over the South Ring Road just past the Rochestown area to the park, construction is taking place to improve the surface of the path, maintain the trees along the path, and install new walkways down from footpaths above.

Early life About 1396, Zafar Khan's son Tatar Khan, leaving his baggage in the fort of Panipat, made an attempt to capture Delhi. But Iqbál Khán took the fort of Pánipat, captured Tátár Khán’s baggage, and forced him to withdraw to Gujarát. On the death of Nasir ud din Muhammad Shah III in 1392, his son Sikandar assumed the throne but he died just after 45 days. He was succeeded by his brother Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq II but his cousin Nusrat Khan also claimed similar rank in Firuzabad. In prevailing situation, Timur invaded India and marched on Delhi in 1398. In early 1399, he defeated Mahmud II and looted and destroyed the much of Delhi. Sultan Mahmud II escaped and after many wanderings, reached Patan. He hoped to secure Zafar Khan's alliance to march to Delhi but Zafar Khan declined. He went to Malwa where he was declined again by local governor. Meanwhile his Wazir Iqbal Khan had expelled Nusrat Khan from Delhi so he returned to Delhi but he had no longer enough authority over provinces which were ruled independently by his governors. Reign In 1403, Zafar Khan's son Tatar Khan urged his father to march on Delhi to take advantage of the situation, which he declined. As a result, in 1403, Tatar imprisoned him in Ashaval (future Ahmedabad) and declared himself sultan under the title of Muhammad Shah I. He humbled the chief of Nandod in Rajpipla. He marched towards Delhi, but on the way he was poisoned by his uncle, Shams Khán Dandáni at Sinor on the north bank of Narmada river. Some sources says he died naturally due to weather or due to his habit of heavy drinking. After the death of Muhammad Shah, Zafar was released from the prison in 1404. Zafar Khán asked his own younger brother Shams Khán Dandáni to carry on the government, but he refused. Zafar took over the control over administration. In 1407, he declared himself as Sultan Muzaffar Shah I at Birpur or Sherpur, took the insignia of royalty and issued coins in his name.

They are the earliest surviving examples of Greek panel painting. Location The four panels, two of them highly fragmentary, were discovered during the 1930s in a cave near the village of Pitsa, in the vicinity of Sicyon. They can be stylistically dated to circa 540–530 BC, i.e., to the late Archaic period of Greek art. Technique The tablets are thin wooden boards or panels, covered with stucco (plaster) and painted with mineral pigments. Their bright colours are surprisingly well preserved. Only eight colours (black, white, blue, red, green, yellow, purple and brown) are used, with no shading or gradation of any sort. Probably, the black contour outlines were drawn first and then filled in with colours. Motifs The tablets depict religious scenes connected with the cult of the nymphs. One of the two near-complete examples shows a sacrifice to the nymphs. Three or more females, dressed in chiton and peplos, are approaching an altar to the right. They are accompanied by musicians playing the lyra and aulos. The person nearest the altar appears to be pouring a libation from a jug. A small figure behind her, perhaps a slave, is leading a lamb, the sacrificial victim. An inscription in the Corinthian alphabet names two woman dedicators, Euthydika and Eucholis and states that the tablet, or the depicted offering, is dedicated to the nymphs. The second well- preserved tablet also has a written dedication to the nymphs and shows three partially overlapping female figures, perhaps the nymphs themselves. Function and context The tablets are votive offerings, connected with the rural cult of the nymphs, which was widespread throughout Greece. Stylistically and technically, they probably represent rather low quality panel paintings of their time. This, as well as references to wooden painted or inscribed votives at other Greek sanctuaries (e.g. Epidaurus), indicates that the Pitsa tablets belong to the types of votives available to the lower, or poorer, sections of population. Such simple votives may have been far more numerous originally, but the fact that they are made of perishable materials, whereas richer votives were of stone, bronze or precious metals, has led to their near-total disappearance from the archaeological record. Significance Most ancient paintings that survived are either frescoes or vase paintings. It is known that panel paintings were held in much higher regard, but very few of them have survived. The best known examples of ancient panel painting, the Fayum mummy portraits and the Severan Tondo, are of Roman date. The Pitsa panels, probably preserved due to the unusual climatic conditions inside the cave, are by far the earliest examples of this technique to survive. As the only pre-Roman specimens, they represent virtually all the evidence for a whole style of art. Incidentally, the ancient Greeks believed that panel painting was invented in Sicyon, not far from Pitsa.

The constitution is the framework for the organization of the Tunisian government and for the relationship of the federal government with the governorates, citizens, and all people within Tunisia. Tunisia's first modern constitution was the Fundamental Pact of 1857. This was followed by the Constitution of 1861, which was not replaced until after the departure of French administrators in 1956, by the constitution of 1959. It was adopted on 1 June 1959 and amended in 1999 and 2002, after the Tunisian constitutional referendum of 2002. Following the revolution and months of protests, a Constituent Assembly was elected to draft a new constitution, the Tunisian Constitution of 2014 (, ) which was adopted on 26 January 2014. Constitutions preceding the creation of the Tunisian state The territory of modern-day Tunisia knew its first form of political organization with the constitution of ancient Carthage. Its text was extensively referred to by Aristotle in his work, Politics.Aristote, Politique, II, XI, 1-16Maria Giulia Amadasi Guzzo, Carthage, éd. PUF, Paris, 2007, p. 82 In this, Aristotle speaks highly of the Carthaginian constitution and describes it as a model of a balanced constitution, having the best characteristics of other political regimes; It combines elements of monarchic (kings or shophets), aristocratic (senate) and democratic (people's assembly) regimes. Fundamental Pact of 1857 Beginning in 1839 the Ottoman Empire introduced a number of reforms in government starting with the Hatt-ı Şerif of the Gülhane, but these were not applied in Tunisia due to the independence of the Husainid Dynasty and the conservatism of the ruling Bey, Ahmad I ibn Mustafa. It was the death of Ahmad I and the Batto Sfez Affair and its aftermath that allowed France and England to pressure the Bey into granting reforms. Samuel \\"Batto\\" Sfez was a Jewish teamster who worked for Jewish political boss Nasim Shamama. Following a traffic accident, Sfez was involved in an altercation with a Muslim. His opponent subsequently brought charges against Sfez, charging him with insulting Islam, a capital offense under Maliki law. There were plenty of witnesses who had heard Sfez curse his opponent and his religion. A notary investigated and took sworn statements. The court considered the matter for some time, while Shamama tried to muster support from the British and French legations. However, Nasim Shamama had previously upset the Bey, Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn, by forcing him to deal with a case of a Muslim who had murdered a Jew, where the unpopular conclusion was the execution of the Muslim. As a result, Muhammad II issued the execution order the same day that the court came down with its decision of guilty, and Sfez was summarily beheaded. This upset not only the local Jewish community but also the local European businessmen and hence the legates from France, Leon Roches, and Britain, Richard Wood, who had already been pressuring the Bey for greater religious tolerance and equal treatment before the law, primarily in support of European commercial interests. European warships steamed into Tunisian harbors including an entire French squadron into the port of Tunis (Halq al-Wadi). Under this pressure and given the support of the liberal former general and Marine Minister Hayreddin Pasha, Muhammad II agreed to what became known as the Fundamental Pact of 1857. That document, which had many similarities to the 1839 Ottoman Hatt-ı Şerif, abolished slavery, guaranteed people to be secure in their lives and property, granted equality of taxation (thus implicitly abolishing the jizya), granted religious freedom, granted equality before the law, granted foreigner the right to own land and participate in all types of businesses and set up separate commercial courts, among other things. Although adopted under foreign pressure, to open the country to international trade, these ideas of equality from the Age of Enlightenment found fertile ground in the Tunisian reform movement, contributed to the ideas advocated by Mahmud Qabadu and Ahmad ibn Abi Diyaf and gained the support of Hayreddin Pasha and his followers, especially generals Rustum and Hussein, despite concerns about the broadening wedge of European commerce.In general, see volume one of These ideas later inspired the national movement in its claims against the French protectorate, especially within the Constitutional Party (Destour Party). Constitution of 1861 Following the Fundamental Pact, a commission was set up to draft a real constitution; it was submitted on 17 September 1860 to Muhammad III as-Sadiq, the new Bey after Muhammad II. The constitution came into effect on 26 April 1861. It was the first written constitution in Arab lands,\\"coğrafyasında kendi türünün ilki sayılan Kânûnu'd-Devle adlı bir anayasayı ilanla sonuçlandı.\\" (\\"the first of its kind in Muslim territories.\\") as well as the first constitution established by a state with Islam as its religion. At the time in the West it was known as the \\"Buyuruldu of the Bey of Tunis\\". One or more translation(s) of this was/were made in French and circulated in Europe; Johann Strauss, author of \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire: Translations of the Kanun-ı Esasi and Other Official Texts into Minority Languages,\\" wrote that it became \\"widely known\\" on the continent. (info page on book at Martin Luther University) - Cited: p. 38 (PDF p. 40) The Ottoman Empire newspaper Ceride-i havadis printed an Ottoman Turkish version on 17 March 1861 (Turkish date: 6 Ramadan (Ramazan) 1861). The text of 114 articles established a constitutional monarchy with a sharing of power between an executive branch consisting of the Bey and a prime minister, with important legislative prerogatives to a Grand Council, creating a type of oligarchy. It established an independent judiciary; however the guardian of the constitution was the legislature which had sovereign authority to review unconstitutional acts by the executive. In addition, the sovereign was not free to dispose of the resources of the state and must maintain a budget, while he and the princes of his family were to receive stipends. Issues of national representation and elections were omitted. In fact in actual practice the members of the Grand Council were appointed more through cronyism and favor swapping than national interest. Many of the old Mamluk class were appointed, keeping the bureaucracy firmly in Mamluk hands. For this reason, and others such as the provision for general military conscription and retaining the provisions granting rights to foreign nationals, many did not approve of the Bey's actions. Universal application of the mejba (head tax), under the equal taxation clause, incurred the wrath of those who had formerly been exempt: the military, scholars/teachers and government officials. Matters came to a head in 1864 when traditionalist Ali Ben Ghedhahem led a revolt against the Bey. The constitution was suspended as an emergency measure and the revolt was eventually suppressed. Ali Ben Ghedhahem was killed in 1867. It used portions of the Edict of Gülhane from the Ottoman Empire. Constitution of 1959 After Tunisia gained its independence from France in 1956, a new constitution was drafted. It was adopted on 1 June 1959. The 1959 constitution declares Tunisia to be an independent state, governed by a three branch presidential parliamentary system. It bestows certain rights on the people, including the right of ownership and right to confidentiality in personal correspondence (excluding cases of suspected criminal activity). In addition, the constitution bestows various freedoms upon the people; some of these include freedom of opinion, expression, press, and organization. It establishes Islam as the official state religion, and Arabic as its official language. The constitution was amended on 12 July 1988, 29 June 1999, 1 June 2002, 13 May 2003, and 28 July 2008. Arab Spring 2011–2013 transition During the Tunisian revolution, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali left Tunisia on 14 January 2011 and Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi stated that he became the acting President under Article 56 of the Constitution. Al Jazeera claimed that lawyers disagreed with Ghannouchi's claim, since under Article 57 of the Constitution of Tunisia, the Constitutional Council should meet and the leader of one of the houses of the Tunisian parliament should become an interim President. The Constitutional Council declared that \\"the post of president is definitely vacant\\" and declared that, under Article 57, Fouad Mebazaa should become the interim President, with the obligation to call for elections within 45 to 60 days. On 15 January 2011, Mebazaa was sworn in as interim President. Various decrees in early 2011 permitted the continuation of the interim government and the Legislative Decree of 23 March 2011 provided for initial elections.Legislative Decree No. 2011-14 of 23 March 2011 On 12 December 2011, Moncef Marzouki was elected President. Constitution of 2014 On 23 October 2011, a Constituent Assembly was elected to draft the text of a new constitution. On 16 December 2011 they issued a constitutive law Law on the provisional organization of public authorities, which superseded the Legislative Decree of 23 March 2011 and the 1959 constitution. This law provided for three branches of government and guaranteed human rights during the time it takes for the new constitution to be written and ratified. Many Tunisian intellectuals and political commentators felt compelled to comment on the progress of both the transitional government as well as the various stages of the constitution. Dr. Mohamed-Salah Omri, a professor at St. John's College, University of Oxford said, with regards to post revolutionary transitional period, that \\"the transfer of power in the early days of 2011 and the several transitional phases since then reveal much about the power of constitutionalism in the country. One may indeed speak of an orderly, leaderless transfer of power in January 2011 specifically because constitutionalism was strong and alive.\\" It was initially hoped that a constitution would be drafted within a year's time. However, vigorous debate and two assassinations delayed the document. Progress quickened after the ruling Islamist Ennahda party agreed to give up power when a new constitution was passed. After two years of work, a 146-article draft constitution was completed. It was put to a vote on 26 January 2014, requiring a two-thirds majority to pass. The Constituent Assembly adopted the document by a 200–12 vote with 4 abstentions. President Marzouki remarked: \\"With the birth of this text, we confirm our victory over dictatorship\\", and signed it into law the following day. During the drafting process, the main points of contention were the role of religion in the government, the requirements to run for president, and the details of how the transition period after the document was passed would be handled. The new constitution makes Tunisia a decentralized and open government. It recognizes Islam as the official state religion, but protects freedom of belief. It provides for some restrictions on free speech, most notably in banning attacks on religion and accusations of being a non- believer. The constitution provides for gender equality in rights and responsibilities, protects the nation's natural resources and demands the government take steps to fight corruption. Executive power is divided between the president and prime minister. A newly selected cabinet led by former minister Mehdi Jomaa will oversee the country until elections are held to select a president. The 2014 parliamentary election was held on 26 October 2014. Discussions on the Outcomes: While the Tunisian Constitution and its outcomes were met with various reactions across the globe and among Tunisians both at home and in the diaspora, a summary of the process and outcomes can be found in the following article: The Tunisian Constitution: The Process and the Outcome.
