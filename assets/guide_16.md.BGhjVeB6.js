Biography Graf was born in Oslo, Norway. He is the older brother of the bass guitarist of LAVA, Rolf Graf (1960‚Äì2013), and the jazz singer Randi Elisabeth Graf (born 1966).  Career  Graf resides in Los Angeles, US, where he is working as a keyboard player, songwriter, and producer. He has been involved in numerous projects during the years, composing much of the music in addition to playing keyboards on the albums New Born Day (1973), Ranshart (1974) and Let Your Light Shine (1976) within the band Ruphus. They received great acclaim in Norway and in several European countries, including Germany. He also played in the band 'Moose Loose' including with Jon Eberson. Later they opened the band Blow Out together. He also initiated the band Hawk on Flight with Matz Nilsson, Niels Nordin, and Ulf Wakenius. Graf has played with P√•l Thowsen on several of his albums and received Spellemannprisen for best jazz album in the alternative genre. The tune \\"Nearly in Rio\\" composed by Graf was highlighted during the citation. Graf was a judge on the 1988 Spellemann Committee for the jazz category. Graf has also cooperated with Jan Garbarek and Jon Christensen, and the trio toured extensively in Norway. This was a collaboration that started in the late 1970s. He has also released several jazz albums with his band Graffiti, accompanied by tours including Scandinavia, Germany and the US. He has a long musical career behind him, and have cooperated with a series of famous musicians such as Roger Daltrey, Alan White, Jamie Moses, Natasha Beddingfield, Phil Collins, Mark Hudson and Simon Kirke. In Norway, he has also worked with Terje Rypdal, and arranged, composed and produced the music for Finn Kalvik. Graf also toured with renowned guitarist Frank Gambale, after being contacted by him during the 1994 Graffiti concert at Musicians Institute in Los Angeles. The collaboration led to tour the United States in 1994 and in Scandinavia in 1995. Graf has also toured with Paul Jackson and Mike Clark (bassist and drummer of Herbie Hancock's Headhunters known from legendary recordings as \\"Thrust\\"). Haakon was musical director for jazz clubs Hothouse, Jazz Alive and Blue Monk 80's and 90's. Lately Graf has been touring with his own Haakon Graf Trio including Erik Smith (drums) and Per Mathisen (bass), releasing the album License to Chill (2010), and appearing on the 2013 Kongsberg Jazzfestival. Keyboard Player magazine reviews Graf as \\"a spirited and intelligent player. Rather than exhaust the audience with non-stop flash, he builds his solos carefully, keeping the listener interested from beginning to end. He has chops to spare, but never scoundrels them. I can't wait to hear more from him\\". The Coast Radio, Las Vegas when reviewing Graf states: \\"Haakon's talent is never ending, he has great passion for his music. He is one whose talents need to be recognized in his ability to write and create great compositions. The Coast Radio and myself MJ have enjoyed his music and his interview. Haakon is very professional, and I wish him all the best in his projects to come and hope to hear more of him in 2011.\\"  Selected discography =Ruphus *1973: New Born Day (Polydor) *1974: Ranshart (Polydor) *1976: Let Your Light Shine (Polydor) Vanessa *1975: City Lips (On) H√•kon Graf / Sveinung Hovensj√∏ / Jon Eberson / Jon Christensen *1977: Blow Out (Compendium) Hawk on Flight *1979: In Time for Hawk on Flight (Nordisc) *1980: Hawk on Flight (Amar) *1984: Blue Eyed (Four Leaf) H√•kon Graf / Jon Christensen / Sveinung Hovensj√∏ *1982: Hideaway (Strawberry) deLillos *1991: Varme Mennesker (Sonet) Graffiti *1994: Good Groove (Lipstick) Haakon Graf Trio, including with Per Mathisen and Erik Smith *2010: License to Chill (Nordic) *2016: Sunrain (Losen)  ReferencesExternal links * Category:20th-century Norwegian pianists Category:21st-century Norwegian pianists Category:Norwegian jazz pianists Category:Jazz-rock musicians Category:Norwegian jazz composers Category:Musicians from Oslo Category:1955 births Category:Living people ","title":"Haakon Graf"},{"id":"41027688","text":"Bexhill High Academy (formerly Bexhill High School) is a coeducational secondary school with academy status, located in Bexhill-on-Sea in the English county of East Sussex.

It optimizes its own properties for the functions it has carried out in the past. The device mimics the behavior of the property of neurons called spike-timing-dependent plasticity, or STDP. Structure Its structure is similar to that of a field effect transistor, where an ionic liquid takes the place of the gate insulating layer between the gate electrode and the conducting channel. That channel is composed of samarium nickelate (, or SNO) rather than the field effect transistor's doped silicon. Function A synaptic transistor has a traditional immediate response whose amount of current that passes between the source and drain contacts varies with voltage applied to the gate electrode. It also produces a much slower learned response such that the conductivity of the SNO layer varies in response to the transistor's STDP history, essentially by shuttling oxygen ions between the SNO and the ionic liquid. The analog of strengthening a synapse is to increase the SNO's conductivity, which essentially increases gain. Similarly, weakening a synapse is analogous to decreasing the SNO's conductivity, lowering the gain. The input and output of the synaptic transistor are continuous analog values, rather than digital on-off signals. While the physical structure of the device has the potential to learn from history, it contains no way to bias the transistor to control the memory effect. An external supervisory circuit converts the time delay between input and output into a voltage applied to the ionic liquid that either drives ions into the SNO or removes them. A network of such devices can learn particular responses to \\"sensory inputs\\", with those responses being learned through experience rather than explicitly programmed.

Abbey Mausoleum was a mausoleum in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States founded in 1924. One of the most luxurious burial places in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, many famous individuals, judges, and military leaders were buried there. The mausoleum encountered financial difficulties and declared bankruptcy in 1966. It suffered vandalism numerous times, and several graves were desecrated. Remains buried there were disinterred and reburied elsewhere, and it was demolished in February 2001. Several architectural features of the structure were salvaged.

Maria Custis Syphax, the matriarch of the family, was the mulatto daughter of George Washington Parke Custis, grandson of Martha Washington and founder of the Arlington Estate on the banks of the Potomac River (later the home of Robert E. Lee).Abbott, Dorothea E. \\"The Land of Maria Syphax and the Abbey Mausoleum.\\" Arlington Historical Magazine. October 1984, p. 64-79. The Spyhax family sold the land to John Dormoyle in 1901, who then sold it to Frederick Rice in 1924. Rice subdivided the property into two lots, and sold one lot to the U.S. Mausoleum Corporation the same year. The lot was rectangular in shape and located next to the Hobson Gate.Committee on Military Affairs, p. 59. The structure was Neoclassical in style (although it has also been described as Romanesque Revival). The single-story structure was made of granite, with the interior and exterior clad in white Italian marble. The foundation was made of reinforced concrete, and the roof consisted of reinforced concrete ceiling, roof beams, and roof. The roof was externally clad in asphalt roofing materials. The entire structure was from grade to rooftop. The floor was a marble base. Stained-glass windows by Tiffany & Co. provided light. There were 654 crypts, stacked six high below high ceilings. Crypts included 60 niches for cremated remains. Interior light was provided by skylights. Abbey Mausoleum contained two types of coffin vaults: a casket vaults and couch vaults. Casket and couch vaults were made of concrete, and sometimes lined with paper. Once a vault was occupied, it would be sealed with concrete. A marble plate (or \\"shutter\\") was screwed into the wall to cover the vault. Cremation niches were also made of concrete, but rarely lined with paper and not sealed with concrete. Their sole seal was the marble shutter. The mausoleum was constructed by the Stone Mountain Granite Corporation of Atlanta, Georgia. Abbey Mausoleum was dedicated on March 26, 1926, although it was completed in 1927. U.S. Mausoleum encountered financial difficulties in 1927, and sold the building and grounds to the Stone Mountain Granite Corporation before dissolving. In 1928, a new corporation, Abbey Mausoleum Inc., was formed by local D.C. area businessmen, and it purchased the crypt and land from Stone Mountain Granite. Abbey Mausoleum Inc. then purchased in 1928 the second lot offered for sale by Rice, and invested additional funds to complete the finishing touches on the crypt. The first interment was that of Lilla Jewel Kenney. The date of her interment is not entirely clear, but it could have been as early as February 25, 1925, or before March 26, 1925, or before the mausoleum's completion in 1927. Over the next three decades, Abbey Mausoleum interred 245 remains in crypts and 60 remains in cremation niches.Scannell, Nancy. \\"Mausoleum for Sale.\\" Washington Post. April 28, 1986. Enclosure by Henderson Hall and bankruptcy The United States Marine Corps headquarters moved to the Navy Annex Building adjacent to the south side of Arlington National Cemetery in November 1941. A Headquarters and Service Company was organized on March 1, 1942, and a Women Marine Company organized as part of the Headquarters unit on April 1, 1943. To house both companies, the Marine Corps began acquiring, through purchase, easement, eminent domain, and other means, property to the west and northwest of the Navy Annex Building. This included all the land around Abbey Mausoleum. Henderson Hall was built on this property in September 1943 to house both companies. All told, were acquired, and athletic fields, a bowling alley, chapel, firing range, gas station, gym, hobby shop, officers' and enlisted men's clubs, post exchange, post office, radio station, supply depot, and swimming pool were all built on the site. Land acquisition ended in 1952, and on February 1, 1954, the state of Virginia executed a document ceding political jurisdiction over the land to the U.S. federal government.2013 Guide to MCSS Henderson Hall. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Marine Corps, 2013, p. 5. Accessed 2013-11-07. In 1943, the federal government purchased most of the second lot from Abbey Mausoleum Inc., leaving the mausoleum with just of land, (another source says of land)Stark, George. \\"The History of the Abbey Mausoleum.\\" Henderson Hall News. January 19, 2001. Accessed 2013-11-06. Security concerns during World War II led the Marine Corps to close Abbey Mausoleum to the public. The federal government also barred new interments, and the sale of empty crypts and niches ended. It is unclear if Abbey Mausoleum Inc.'s financial troubles were caused by the land sale or merely exacerbated by it, but the mausoleum began to be neglected about this time. Legislation was introduced in Congress in 1945 to give the United States Department of War $550,000 to acquire the crypt and its land,Committee on Military Affairs, p. 57. but the bill was not enacted. The corporation's directors abandoned the company and its assets on January 1, 1957. The tax-exempt corporation's remaining $27,000 were placed into a trust fund, but it was rapidly depleted. Abbey Mausoleum Inc. went bankrupt in 1966. Frank B. Tavenner, an attorney for crypt buyers, was named bankruptcy trustee by the Circuit Court of Arlington County. A $17,000 trust was established to provide maintenance, but that fund also ran out. From the mid-1960s to mid-1980s, a number of individuals buried at Abbey Mausoleum were disinterred at private expense and reburied elsewhere. Vandalism, disinterments and demolition It is unclear when burials at the mausoleum ended. At least once source says 1942 and another \\"during World War II\\", but others say 1964 and 1974. Many crypts had been purchased, but not all were in use. Some individuals had been disinterred and reburied elsewhere, while 105 crypts had been purchased but never used. In 1984, Tavenner suspected that many owners of unused crypts had been buried elsewhere due to the federal government's ban on new burials at Abbey Mausoleum. By 1976, the land around the mausoleum was so heavily covered with tall grass and dense brush that the mausoleum was partially obscured. Arlington County Police began patrolling the site in the late 1970s after several break-ins. But their patrols were infrequent and irregular, because police had to gain permission to access the Marine base. In 1984, Marine Corps guards began patrolling and maintaining the exterior grounds to reduce vandalism. Vandalism In the early 1970s, Abbey Mausoleum was routinely vandalized. Its stained glass windows were boarded up for protection.\\"Restored to Light.\\" Arlington Connection. January 5, 2005. Accessed 2013-11-08. Between 1979 and 1994, Abbey Mausoleum was broken into and vandalized at least six times. According to Arlington County police, vandals usually entered the building by prying open windows leading to the crawl space below the crypt, then entering the tomb through an air vent grating in the floor. In the fall of 1976, vandals opened and desecrated 12 coffins and 10 urns. One crypt was completely opened and the coffin removed. The vandals opened the coffin, and placed a copy of Circus (a heavy metal music magazine) on the chest of the skeleton. The vandals also broke into a funeral niche, poured the human ashes on the floor, and drew a smiley face in them.White, Gordon Eliot. \\"Vandals Desecrate Sutherland's Tomb.\\" Deseret News. December 13, 1976. Accessed 2013-11-08. One of the worst cases occurred in 1979, in which 45 crypts were broken into, coffins removed, and the remains decapitated. The vandals then stuck the skulls on broomsticks and left them upright. In another case in the late 1980s, vandals removed urns from niches and poured the ashes onto the floor, mixing their contents and writing in the ashes. In 1994, police discovered bloody handprints, candles, dead cats, pentagrams, and other signs of occult worship. Two crypts were opened, the coffins placed on the floor, and the remains exposed. Police had no leads, as the vandalism appeared to be several years old.Hong, Peter Y. \\"Vandalism in Va. Mausoleum Said to Indicate Satanism.\\" Washington Post. June 23, 1994. Closure and demolition Tavenner attempted to sell Abbey Mausoleum several times. The Marine Corps wanted to buy the land, but Congress declined to appropriate the funds. A private cemetery agreed to take over operation of the site, but only if the mausoleum and land were donated to it. Arlington National Cemetery officials declined to purchase it because it was outside the cemetery's boundaries. The Marine Corps secured a $1.9 million appropriation from Congress to acquire Abbey Mausoleum in 1995. In November of that year, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began administering the tomb. A plan for identifying and contacting descendants, providing for private disinterment and reburial, and for relocating all remaining graves was then devised. A U.S. federal court approved the burial relocation plan in December 2000. By this time, only 283 people were still interred at the mausoleum, according to the Corps of Engineers. The Corps located 109 relatives of the dead, but only 10 made their own arrangements for disinterment and reburial. The Corps moved the remaining bodies and ashes to a mausoleum at National Memorial Park, a cemetery near Falls Church, Virginia. Although still structurally sound, demolition of the structure occurred on February 5, 2001.Kunkle, Fredrick. \\"Giving Up Its Ghosts.' Washington Post. January 27, 2001. Artistic salvage The United States Navy and the Arlington County Planning Department signed an agreement prior to Abbey Mausoleum's demolition to salvage many of the structure's components for historic preservation. Arlington County was granted explicit ownership of the stained glass windows at the site, as well as any interior or exterior architectural elements it wished. The demolition contractor was given salvage rights to all other materials. Upon examination by stained glass experts, the windows were revealed to have been designed and crafted by Louis Comfort Tiffany, the son of the founder of Tiffany & Co. Twelve of the windows consisted of geometric and floral patterns mingled with religious symbols. The thirteenth and largest window depicted Jesus with his hand raised in benediction. Experts determined that the windows were dedicated to E. St. Clair Thompson, a wealthy Freemason interred at Abbey Mausoleum in 1933. The windows were probably commissioned by the Thompson family. Many of the windows were damaged by vandalism, and most had suffered cracks, fading, and missing pieces due to neglect and age. The windows were sent to Shenandoah Stained Glass, an art glass restoration company, for repair. Workers spent three months hand-cleaning each piece of glass and fitting each window chosen for preservation into a new aluminum frame. According to stained glass restorer Mark Russel, the windows suffered significant fading damage due to sunlight and lack of care. Shenandoah workers discovered that the windows were made of common opal glass and high-quality \\"cathedral glass\\" from the Kokomo Opalescent Glass Works in Kokomo, Indiana. To repair the windows, Shenandoah Stained Glass found identically-colored opal or Kokomo-produced glass and glazed it to replace broken pieces. The large religious-themed window (which was square) proved too expensive to restore, and five others were too heavily damaged to repair. These windows were partially cannibalized to restore the others.\\"Westover Library Installations.\\" Press release. Arlington Arts Center. Arlington County, Virginia. 2009. Accessed 2013-11-08. Fragments of glass were also collected from the floor of the mausoleum, and used to reconstruct the remaining windows. Epoxy was used to fill in small cracks and chips. Three of the restored windows were installed at the Arlington County Arts Center at 3550 Wilson Boulevard. Four other restored windows were installed at Arlington County's Westover Library at 1644 North McKinley Road. Abbey Mausoleum's skylight was also restored, and is installed (as a working skylight) at the Fairlington Community Center at 3308 South Stafford Street in Arlington County.\\"Untitled (skylight).\\" CultureNOW.com. 2013.

This great work of bridging across the mighty andvcapricious waters of the Oxus cost altogether 301,674 roubles, of which 141,674 roubles were for labour, tools etc., and 160,000 roubles for material, all of which had to be brought from Russia. At first the intention was to make shift with some kind of a ferry to connect the two ends of the railway, and a considerable amount of money appears to have been wasted overpremature contracts made in England. A bridge of iron would have cost some six or seven millions, which was more than the estimates would bear, and so finally M. Bielinsky, a Polish engineer, was engaged to build it of wood. It is expected to last at least ten years. The trains at could initially only crawl over it to reduce the risk of collapse.George Dobson: Russia's railway advance into Central Asia. W. H.

Early life Adler was born in London on 1 December 1868. She was the daughter of Hermann Adler, who would later succeed his father as chief rabbi, and Rachel Adler. She was educated at a private school and classes. Career Adler began social work as a school manager under the London School Board. She was honorary secretary of the Committee on Wage Earning Children, 1899‚Äì1946. She was a Member of Council of the Anglo-Jewish Association and a member of the Jewish Board of Guardians. She was a justice of the peace. Political career Adler was a Liberal Party member, which in London local government was aligned with the Progressive Party. She was first politically active in her home area of Hackney. Her main political interest was in education. She was a member of the governing bodies of the Dalston County School, of the Hackney Downs School and the Hackney Technical Institute. Due to her interest in educational matters she was co-opted onto the London Education Committee by the Progressive majority in 1905, serving as on that body until she was elected to it following the 1910 London County Council election. When the Liberal government first created the London County Council in 1899 there was no stipulation that women could not stand as candidates for election and two Progressive women candidates stood and were elected. However, there was a legal challenge made by one of the defeated conservative candidates and as a result, neither of the women were able to take their seats. When the Liberal Party returned to power, they changed the law in 1908 to allow women to be elected to the London County Council and this change came into effect for the 1910 elections. Adler was one of two women who were elected, as one of the representatives for the constituency of Hackney Central in 1910. Hackney Central in London In March 1913 she was re-elected, although her running mate lost to the Municipal Reform Party; In March 1919, following the end of the war, the boundaries for her constituency were slightly altered and she was returned unopposed due to an electoral agreement of the Progressive and Municipal Reform parties to only adopt one candidate each; Hackney Central in London In March 1922 the electoral arrangement between the Progressive and Municipal Reform parties continued; Adler From 1922 to 1923 she served as deputy chair of the London County Council. She was defeated in 1925. She was a Member of the Departmental Committee on Charity Collections, 1925‚Äì27. Following the demise of the Progressive Party she was re-elected to the LCC in 1928 standing as a Liberal Party candidate; She was finally defeated in 1931. Despite her election defeat in 1931, she was co-opted onto the London County Council Public Health Committee for a three-year term.

The vaccine is considered important as acute hantavirus infections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that about 1.5 million cases and 46,000 deaths occurred in China from 1950 to 2007. The number of cases is estimated at 32,000 in Finland from 2005 to 2010 and 90,000 in Russia from 1996 to 2006. The first hantavirus vaccine was developed in 1990 initially for use against Hantaan River virus which causes one of the most severe forms of HFRS. It is estimated that about two million doses of rodent brain or cell-culture derived vaccine are given in China every year. The wide use of this vaccine may be partly responsible for a significant decrease in the number of HFRS cases in China to less than 20,000 by 2007. Other hantaviruses for which the vaccine is used include Seoul (SEOV) virus. However the vaccine is thought not to be effective against European hantaviruses including Puumala (PUUV) and Dobrava- Belgrade (DOBV) viruses.

She was best known for the classic long-term study of the Tonga people of the Gwembe Valley in Zambia and Zimbabwe, which she began in 1956 with Thayer Scudder, 11 years after she obtained her doctorate and while Scudder was a second-year graduate student. Dr. Colson focused her research on the consequences of forced resettlement on culture and social organization, the effects of economic pressure on familial relationships, rituals, religious life, and even drinking patterns. Biography Colson was born in Hewitt, Minnesota on June 15, 1917. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in anthropology from the University of Minnesota and her Ph.D in Social Anthropology in 1945 from Radcliffe College. Colson received a fellowship from the American Association of University Women in 1942‚Äì1943. She was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1977 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. While at Radcliffe College, she experienced sex-discrimination in academia and would later work to eradicate this discrimination at the University of California. Her work was based on ethnography and focused on long-term, data supported research. Colson later became a Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. She died in Monze, Zambia in August 2016 at the age of 99.In Memoriam: Elizabeth Florence Colson Research=Gwembe Tonga Project In 1956, Elizabeth Colson was sent by the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute to study the potential effects that the construction of a dam and hydro-electric power plant would have on the Gwembe Tonga of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). She partnered with Thayer Scudder in order to collect data on the residents of Gwembe. Colson then outlined the social reactions observed during the resettlement of the Gwembe Tonga in her project report titled \\"The Social Consequences of Resettlement, the Impact of Kariba Resettlement Upon the Gwembe Tonga\\".Jennifer Cash, Elizabeth Colson's Indiana.edu Biography, \\"Indiana University\\", May 1998 The reactions from the Gwembe expressed in Colson's report include: social upheaval, hostility towards the government, loss of legitimacy of local leaders who supported the resettlement of the Gwembe, increase of force on the part of the aforementioned leaders, and general instability in the Gwembe social structure. This research directly contributed to the academic discussions of resettlement, migration, and refugee communities in applied and development anthropology. Colson's research with Scudder on the Gwembe and the social and political aspects of their resettlement is ongoing.

After hijacking the aircraft, the terrorists demanded to be flown to Libya. The terrorists agreed to land in Luxor instead, after being persuaded that the aircraft needed to be refuelled. In Luxor, Sa'ka Forces stormed the aircraft and captured the hijackers. No passengers were injured during the operation. The terrorists were convicted and sentenced to hard labor for life. Background On August 23, 1976, three armed terrorists claiming to be from the Abd Al-Nasir Movement hijacked the Egyptian Cairo-Luxor flight and asked the pilot to land in Tripoli. One of the three hijackers was a 21-year-old Palestinian, Mohammed Naguid, who was working in Kuwait. They demanded the release of five Libyans imprisoned in Cairo in connection with two assassination attempts. The context was the deterioration of relations between Egypt and Libya after the Yom Kippur War due to Libyan opposition to Sadat's peace policy. There had been a breakdown in unification talks between the two governments, which subsequently led to the Libyan-Egyptian War. Fifteen minutes after takeoff from Cairo International Airport, an Italian pilot called the airport to report that he had received a beam aerial from the Egyptian aircraft heading to Luxor that it had been hijacked and the flight was under terrorist control. The Operation President Sadat ordered the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense to make the necessary decisions to protect the passengers and arrest the terrorists. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense quickly flew to Luxor International Airport where they started a secret meeting in the airport's tower, while Major General Abdul Hafiz Al-Bagori, Governor of Qena started negotiations with the three terrorists in order to gain time. In a call between the cockpit and the airport, the pilot complained about a problem in the aircraft - that it hadn't shown that the aircraft needing refuelling - and that the aircraft needed maintenance. The terrorists were persuaded to allow the aircraft to land in Luxor for refuelling. Negotiations continued until 3 p.m., when the governor told the terrorists that engineers were ready. The engineers were two disguised Sa'ka Officers, who went inside and outside the aircraft several times in order to appear to be maintenance workers. Minutes later three officers stormed the aircraft and captured the hijackers. The on-site commander of the Egyptian commandos was Colonel Sayed El Sharkawy. He and the other commandos have received the Star of Honor medal from President Sadat following the successful operation. Aftermath The 95 passengers, mostly tourists, and 6 crew members were all rescued unharmed. During investigations the hijackers said they had received directions from Libya, that had the operation succeeded they would have received a $250,000 reward from Muammar Gaddafi, and that they had already received 1/5th of this reward. The Palestinian Revolution Movement also claimed credit for the hijacking. Reactions * - The Palestine Liberation Organization condemned the hijacking and stressed that it was not related to actions intended to harm the Palestinian struggle. * - Sudanese president Gaafar Nimeiry called Egyptian president Sadat to congratulate him in the name of the Sudanese people for the success of the Egyptian Special Forces in rescuing the passengers.

Plot The Encounter follows 5 strangers living in California: Nick, a former NFL player and owner of a chain of burger restaurants; Hank and Catherine, whose marriage is falling apart; Melissa, a Christian on the way to visit her boyfriend (who is an atheist), and Kayla, a hitchhiker escaping her horrible living conditions in Los Angeles. When a detour road is closed off, the 5 are stranded in a diner with its omnipresent owner, who discreetly reveals himself to be Jesus, and attempts to help each of the patrons to face the truth in his or her life, particularly its dark side, to seek repentance and go for reconciliation. Along with serving them, Jesus helps Hank and Catherine re-establish dialogue as a couple, helps Melissa think of the long-term difficulties she will face in a relationship, and marriage, with her boyfriend who is a non-believer, and helps Kayla find in her heart the strength to forgive her abusive stepfather, despite everything he has done. Each patron at the diner ends up being either born again or is brought to a life-changing decision except for Nick, whose pride and selfishness block him and cause him to reject all questioning of his lifestyle and purpose, in spite of acknowledging having been deeply loved by his grandmother. Officer Deville (the police officer who first informed the patrons of the road being closed off) returns and tells everyone that the road has been re-opened. Nick happily leaves with Deville, who gloats that he has \\"taken one\\" from Jesus, who counters that he has \\"saved four\\". As the other patrons leave the diner, they learn from an officer on the road that the road is closed again, because of a serious car accident. They learn that Nick was involved in the crash, which killed him instantly. He also reveals that he has never heard of a Police Officer named 'Deville'. Then Kayla realizes that Deville is actually the Devil in disguise based on the pronunciation of his surname. The next day, Hank and Catherine find that the diner has mysteriously vanished because Jesus has managed to accomplish his mission of turning their lives around. In Thailand, Jesus shows up as a waiter, alluding to the 2012 sequel film, The Encounter: Paradise Lost.

As an alternative Fintech lender in the property market, LendInvest provides fast finance to property professionals and small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) around the UK. It also makes it possible for individuals, corporates and institutions to invest in secured property loans originated and underwritten by its mortgage team. LendInvest is regarded as one of the leading FinTech companies in the UK, and has been referred to as a 'future billion dollar' business. LendInvest was launched in 2013 when it was spun out of Montello, a London-based specialist short-term property finance lender. LendInvest is a privately held company and is backed by Atomico, the European venture capital investment fund co-founded by Niklas Zennstr√∂m, which invested ¬£17 million in the company in March 2016. LendInvest operates throughout the UK with staff based regionally covering Southern England, Northern England and Scotland.  History  Since 2015, LendInvest has published an independently audited Annual Report on its website. In the year to 31 March 2017, LendInvest reported 20% revenue growth to ¬£40 million and an underlying profit from operations of ¬£2.6 million. As at 31 March 2017, LendInvest had lent ¬£811 million to property investors, landlords and developers, and was managing and advising on ¬£412.5 million of facilities on behalf of a range of UK and international investors. In February 2017, LendInvest published a report entitled \\"Starting small to build more homes: A blueprint for better policymaking in the property SME market\\", that revealed that SMEs in the housebuilding sector have been failing at alarming rates, and argues that the government could help to resolve the country's chronic housing shortage by rebooting its strategy to help smaller property firms. The report was formally launched on 21 March 2017 by Conor Burns MP. In June 2017, LendInvest received a third SQ1 Servicer Quality Rating from European ratings agency ARC Ratings. ARC Rating assesses the process used by LendInvest to originate, underwrite and service property loans. In September 2016, LendInvest launched the LendInvest Property Development Academy, a non-profit two day course for aspiring property entrepreneurs to learn how to better equip themselves with the skills they need to grow their property development portfolios. Academy courses are held in London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Bristol and Birmingham. The Academy was launched in collaboration with the University of Reading and is supported by the Home Builders' Federation. The initiative was attended by the Scottish government in June 2017 when Minister for Housing Kevin Stewart MSP launched the Edinburgh course.  Products  On 10 August 2017, LendInvest successfully launched a listed retail bond on the London Stock Exchange. The process to raise LendInvest's first retail bond was closed early and oversubscribed. The retail bond is the first to be issued by a FinTech business and constitutes a fourth funding channel for the company. LendInvest's first retail bond was added by the Daily Telegraph's Questor share tip column to its ¬£500,000 Income Portfolio on 4 August 2017.

It was coined by UW President Charles Kendall Adams in an 1894 final report from a committee exonerating economics professor Richard T. Ely of censurable charges from state education superintendent Oliver Elwin Wells. The phrase became a local byword for the tenet of academic freedom.  History  Professor Richard T. Ely, whose work sparked a state challenge to academic freedom In the 1890s, University of Wisconsin economics professor Richard T. Ely's philosophy and radical practice came under fire from state education superintendent Oliver Elwin Wells. Ely was known to be liberal and pro-union, having published a book on socialism. Wells protested Ely's socialist beliefs, teaching, and public speaking to UW president Charles Kendall Adams and the Board of Regents, who did not censure Ely. A committee appointed to address the charges produced a report that exonerated Ely upon acceptance by the regents. The report introduced the idea of \\"sifting and winnowing\\": UW‚ÄìMadison President Adams, who coined the phrase Ely later referred to the report as the \\"Wisconsin Magna Charta\\" for its guarantees of academic freedom in pursuit of truth. In Decades of Chaos and Revolution, Stephen J. Nelson contends that UW's sentiment on academic freedom had been set \\"well before\\" the 1890s. He added that the 1894 statement \\"sounds the trumpet of the fundamental principles of the academy: an unending, unlimited belief in the creed of academic freedom and inquiry.\\" The \\"sifting and winnowing\\" construction was coined by Adams, the UW president, who had defended Ely publicly and read his book. It was later invoked by UW‚ÄìMadison Chancellor Robben Wright Fleming when responding to protestors during his tenure. In a later incident, sociology professor Edward Alsworth Ross was censured upon inviting anarchist Emma Goldman to address his class. He did not share her beliefs, but supported her free speech. In memorial of the incident, the Class of 1910 created a commemorative \\"sifting and winnowing\\" plaque of the phrase in its context, which the regents rejected. After the Class appealed to area newspapers, the regents relented. The plaque was installed on Bascom Hall in 1915, where it remains. It was rededicated in 1957.

Facts  Miller had acquired an estate by means of his occupation as a professional gambler. His assets had subsequently disappeared under suspicious circumstances, leaving only liabilities. Miller's wife possessed fixed property, which she had received while Miller was pursuing his occupation. In an application by Janks to sequestrate Miller's estate, Miller contended that sequestration was not competent because he had no assets and, therefore, no estate.  Law  In Ex parte Collins, the judge had held that an estate consists both of assets and of liabilities. If there were no assets but only liabilities, there could be no estate (and vice versa). Were this proposition correct, no order of compulsory sequestration could be granted where the debtor, immediately prior to the application for sequestration, had got rid of all his assets by a series of depositions.  Judgment  The court granted an order sequestrating Miller's estate. It rejected Miller's argument that, because he no longer had any assets, he had ceased to have an estate and that therefore sequestration was not possible.

It was unveiled by President Woodrow Wilson on June 4, 1914 (the 106th anniversary of the birth of Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America). The memorial grounds have changed slightly due to burials and alterations since 1914. Some major changes to the memorial were proposed over the years, but none has been implemented. Since the memorial's unveiling, the President of the United States has almost always sent a funeral wreath to be laid at the memorial every Memorial Day.

The first military burial at Arlington (a white soldier, William Henry Christman) was made on May 13, 1864,Cultural Landscape Program. Arlington House: The Robert E. Lee Memorial Cultural Landscape Report. National Capital Region. National Park Service. U.S. Department of the Interior. Washington, D.C.: 2001. Accessed 2012-04-29. close to what is now the northeast gate in Section 27.Dennee, p. 4. Accessed 2013-07-29. However, formal authorization for burials was not given by Major General Montgomery C. Meigs (Quartermaster General of the United States Army) until June 15, 1864. Confederate military personnel were among those initially buried at Arlington. Some were prisoners of war who died while in custody or who were executed as spies by the Union,Parzych, p. 43. but some were battlefield dead. For example, in 1865, General Meigs decided to build a monument to Civil War dead in a grove of trees near the flower garden south of the Robert E. Lee mansion at Arlington. The bodies of 2,111 Union and Confederate dead within a radius of the city of Washington, D.C., were collected. Some of the dead had been interred on the battlefield, but most were full or partial remains discovered unburied where they died in combat. None were identifiable. Although Meigs had not intended to collect the remains of Confederate war dead, the inability to identify remains meant that both Union and Confederate dead were interred below the cenotaph he built.Heidler, Heidler, and Coles, p. 78. The vault was sealed in September 1866. Other Confederate battlefield dead were also buried at Arlington, and by the end of the war in April 1865 several hundred of the more than 16,000 graves at Arlington contained Confederate dead.Jacob, p. 157. The federal government did not permit the decoration of Confederate graves at the cemetery, however. As Quartermaster General, Meigs had charge of the Arlington cemetery (he did not retire until February 6, 1882),Brown and Bushong, p. 580. and he refused to give families of Confederates buried there permission to lay flowers on their loved ones' graves. In 1868, when families asked to lay flowers on Confederate graves on Decoration Day (now known as Memorial Day), Meigs ordered that the families be barred from the cemetery. Union veterans' organizations such as the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR; whose membership was open only to Union soldiers) also felt that rebel graves should not be decorated.Trout, p. 126. In 1869, GAR members stood watch over Confederate graves at Arlington National Cemetery to ensure they were not visibly honored on Decoration Day.Marling, p. 25. Cemetery officials also refused to allow the erection of any monument to Confederate dead and declined to permit new Confederate burials (either by reburial or through the death of veterans).Mayo, p. 176.Martinez and Harris, p. 177. The 1898 McKinley speech The federal government's policy toward Confederate graves at Arlington National Cemetery changed at the end of the 19th century. The 10-week Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898 marked the first time since prior to the Civil War that Americans from all states, North and South, were involved a military conflict with a foreign power.Fuller, p. 7. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War ended in August, a series of celebrations (\\"peace jubilees\\") were held in major cities in the United States from October through December. However, many Southerners were lukewarm in their support for the war and for President William McKinley's territorial expansion in Cuba and the Philippines,Blair, p. 179. and it was not clear that the Treaty of Paris (the agreement ending the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War) would win the approval of the United States Senate.Rowe, p. 624; Nickeson, p. 491. President McKinley made a trip across the Deep South by train in December 1898 to promote Senate ratification of the Treaty of Paris and racial harmony.Blair, p. 179-180 McKinley saw untended Confederate graves in Fredericksburg, Virginia, during his campaign for the presidency in 1896, and the sight bothered him.Blair, p. 181. In his speech at the Atlanta Peace Jubilee on December 14, 1898, McKinley not only celebrated the end of sectionalism but also announced that the federal government would now begin tending Confederate graves since these dead represented \\"a tribute to American valor\\". The speech impressed many Southerners, who saw it as a grand gesture of reconciliation and a symbol of national unification. The Confederate section at Arlington Dr. Samuel E. Lewis, 1904 The McKinley speech encouraged Dr. Samuel E. Lewis to seek additional improvements to the care and treatment of Confederate graves. Lewis, a former Confederate States Army (CSA) surgeon who then practiced medicine in Washington, D.C., was the leader (\\"commander\\") of the Charles Broadway Rouss Camp No. 1191 of the United Confederate Veterans (UCV), a veterans organization for those who fought for the Confederacy. Lewis had inventoried all Confederate graves at Arlington National Cemetery in early fall 1898 as part of the local group's historic documentation efforts. He discovered 136 identifiable Confederate graves, far more than the six or seven cemetery officials assumed existed. The graves were scattered all over the existing burial grounds, and the headstones were similar to those of civilian employees and African American \\"contrabands\\" (runaway slaves). The similarity to the headstones of black people especially angered Lewis. In early 1899, his group discovered another 189 graves in the Soldiers' Home National Cemetery in the District of Columbia.Blair, p. 188. On June 5, 1899, Lewis and other Confederate veterans sent a petition to President McKinley asking that the Confederate dead at Arlington be disinterred and reburied in a \\"Confederate section\\". McKinley approved of the idea. Former Confederate Brigadier General Marcus Joseph Wright (by 1898 an agent of the War Department collecting Confederate war records) drafted legislation to approve the reinterments, and Senator Joseph Roswell Hawley (a former brevet major general of volunteers for the Union) introduced it in Congress.Poole, p. 132. Congress approved the bill in 1900 and authorized $2,500 for the plan, which specified that the reburials occur near the field where Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War dead had recently been interred. McKinley signed the bill into law on June 6, 1900. A list of the dead at both Arlington and the Soldiers' Home was published so that families who wished to do so might remove their loved ones' remains from Arlington and reinter them closer to home. Opposition to the section After June 1900, however, several women's groups‚Äîamong them the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and the Ladies of the Hollywood Memorial Association‚Äîopposed allowing any Confederate dead to remain at Arlington. The reasons for this resistance were complex and varied. Most of the women's societies argued that Confederate dead should lie in Southern soil, Confederate families should not rely on Union \\"charity\\" (e.g., free grave space at Arlington), the GAR would desecrate the graves, and Confederate soldiers should rest among their comrades in Southern cemeteries.Blair, p. 188-189. Some of the women's societies also saw reburial of Confederate dead in the South as a way of maintaining their relevance and recruiting new members, while others wanted reburial in the South so they could erect pro-Confederate monuments over the graves. Some groups perceived the offer of a Confederate section at Arlington as a sign of Southern accommodationism with the United States.Blair, p. 189-190. Competition between different women's societies also played a role. For example, the Confederate Southern Memorial Association (CSMA) also opposed the creation of a Confederate section at Arlington. The CSMA was formed in 1900 as an umbrella group for the ladies' memorial associations, which were rapidly losing members. The CSMA feared being absorbed by the UDC, which had formed in 1894 both as a commemorative body and as a benevolent society for Confederate women and patriotic goals.Cox, \\"United Daughters of the Confederacy\\", p. 559; Gross, p. 190. The CSMA sought a way to differentiate itself from the larger body, and so advocated reburial, too‚Äîbut not in Richmond (as the UDC did) but in local towns and cities throughout the South.Blair, p. 191. To overcome this opposition, Lewis tried to identify support for a \\"Confederate section\\" as well as convince the administration to proceed. He secured the endorsement of a Confederate section by a number of former high-ranking Confederate officers. He also polled other chapters of the United Confederate Veterans and found they approved of the legislation as well. Lewis and his supporters argued that only the federal government had the financial resources to adequately maintain the large number of Confederate graves found at Arlington and the Soldiers' Home, and that failing to spend the $2,500 appropriation would discourage Congress from protecting Confederate graves in the future. Critically, Lewis won the support of Hilary A. Herbert, an Alabamian and former colonel in the 8th Regiment Alabama Infantry who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1877 to 1893 and as Secretary of the Navy under President Grover Cleveland. Herbert argued that leaving the Confederate graves at Arlington made a greater impression on the public than isolating them in the pro-Confederate South.Blair, p. 190. Lewis' efforts convinced most members of Congress and relevant administration officials that the women's groups represented only a small minority of Southerners. He did so in part by winning the support of other key Southern groups. First he won over his own organization, the United Confederate Veterans, which in March 1901 unanimously passed resolutions asking the government to proceed with creation of the Confederate section.Blair, p. 190.Foster, p. 153. He also won the support of the Ladies Southern Relief Society, an important Confederate women's group in Washington, D.C.Blair, p. 190-191. Lewis also won over Congress and the administration by undermining the UDC and CSMA's opposition to the reburial plan. Once more working through his own veterans' group, the UCV convinced a number of government officials that the CSMA was too new (just a year old) to accurately represent Southern views.Blair, p. 191-192. Lewis dampened the outcry by the CSMA and other ladies' memorial associations by convincing them that their importance in the South would be maintained. Lewis realized that these groups continued to thrive in part because they set the dates for and organized Civil War commemorations. Lewis convinced the CSMA and many Southern women's groups that they would be able to do so at Arlington as well, which would enhance their prestige.Blair, p. 192. These tactics worked: In the late spring of 1901, a delegation from several Confederate veterans' groups visited Secretary of War Elihu Root and convinced him to proceed with the reburials at Arlington. Process of reburial The 1903 layout of the burials in the Confederate section. After the process of informing families ended, reburials began in April 1901 and were completed the following October. It is unclear how many Confederate dead were disinterred and reburied in the new Confederate section. In 1912, the House Committee on Appropriations observed that legal authority existed for interment of 264 Confederate soldiers‚Äî128 of which came from the Soldiers' Home National Cemetery and 136 of which came from Arlington National Cemetery.Subcommittee on Appropriations, p. 702. More modern sources provide different numbers, however. One historian says just 128 bodies were reinterred, although the majority of sources say 264Dodge, p. 26Morman, p. 10Communications & Outreach Support Division. \\"History and Development of the National Cemetery Administration.\\" National Cemetery Administration.

Discrepancies may be attributable to a law, the Act of August 24, 1912 (37 Stat. 440), which permitted any Confederate veteran living in or near Washington, D.C., to be buried in the Confederate section at Arlington.Quartermaster General of the Army, p. 42. Accessed 2013-08-01. The Confederate dead were reburied on of ground on the west side of Arlington National Cemetery. The graves were laid out in a pattern of concentric circles, rather than straight rows as elsewhere at Arlington, to emphasize the South's attempt to find its place in the new united country.Poole, p. 133. Landscaping of the area was completed in the spring of 1903. The 1899 legislation required the federal government to provide a standard issue tombstone for the new Confederate graves. These headstones were tall, wide, and thick. They were made of granite or marble, as the others in the cemetery were. The tops of these markers were pointed, to make the Confederate graves stand out from Union ones (not, as legend would have it, so that Northerners would not sit on them and desecrate them). Each marker was inscribed with a number, the name of the deceased, the regiment in which the individual served, and the inscription \\"C.S.A.\\" The first Confederate Memorial Day observances in the Confederate section were held on June 7, 1903.Foster, p. 154; \\"For Confederate Graves.\\" Washington Post. May 27, 1903. These were informal ceremonies, however, and the first formal program did not occur until June 5, 1904.\\"Decorate Graves of Gray.' Washington Post. June 5, 1904. Building a memorial War Department officials laid out the circular pattern of the graves in the Confederate section. The circular area contained a cruciform set of walkways whose north-south axis was parallel to the road that is now McPherson Drive. At the intersection of the walkways was a grassy area surrounded by a circular path. Although the 1900 reburial legislation did not mention a memorial, on its maps the Army Corps of Engineers marked this central grassy area with an \\"M\\"‚Äîindicating that it was reserved for a memorial.Herbert, p. 13. This did not go unnoticed by Confederate groups, several of which began independently discussing the construction of a memorial as soon as it became clear that the Army would allow one to be built in the Confederate section.Cox, \\"The Confederate Monument at Arlington...\\", p. 150. One of the groups which sought to build a memorial was the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC). Mrs. Mary Taliaferro Thompson of Stonewall Jackson Chapter No. 20 (located in Washington, D.C.) asked the War Department in 1902 for permission to construct a memorial in the Confederate section. Her request was not granted. She asked again in 1903 and 1905, but was turned down each time. Nonetheless, various UDC chapters, convinced they would eventually be successful, began raising money for a memorial.Cox, Dixie's Daughters, p. 53. In 1904, Robert E. Lee Chapter No. 644, UDC (also located in Washington, D.C.) began raising money for a monument. It had about $111 ($ in dollars) by the end of February 1904, and later raised $1,000 ($ in dollars). Stonewall Jackson Chapter No. 20 also raised $1,000.Herbert, p. 14-15. Mrs. Thompson tried again to win approval for a monument in 1906. This time she was successful, in large part because she worked closely with Representative John Sharp Williams (D-Mississippi), the influential House Minority Leader. On March 4, 1906, Secretary of War William Howard Taft gave the UDC permission to erect a memorial in the center of the Confederate section at Arlington. Taft's letter, however, reserved to the War Department the right to approve the monument's design and inscriptions. On March 13, 1906, Mrs. Lizzie George Henderson, President-General of the UDC, accepted Taft's terms.Herbert, p. 15. Taft's letter was made public by Rep. Williams at Confederate Memorial Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery on June 4, 1906. Williams called for a monument to be built, and suggested an inscription (which was not used). He then donated the first $50 toward the memorial's construction. Forming the ACMA Cornelia Branch Stone in 1908. Mrs. Stone conducted most of the fund- raising for the Confederate Memorial, and chaired the design committee. The Arlington Confederate Memorial Association (ACMA) was founded in 1906, although sources differ as to the exact date. On June 7, 1906, John M. Hickey of Camp No. 171, United Confederate Veterans, submitted a resolution to his local chapter authorizing the establishment of a committee on \\"ways and means\\" to erect the memorial. According to Hilary A. Herbert, the resolution in its final form established the ACMA.Herbert, p. 14. But historian Karen Cox puts the organization's founding at a meeting organized by Thompson and sponsored by the UDC on November 6, 1906. Local news media, however, reported that the founding occurred on December 28, 1906, when Confederate organizations in Washington, D.C., met under the auspices of Camp 171.\\"Honor Confederate Dead.\\" Washington Post. December 30, 1906. Even the list of founding directors is not agreed upon. Herbert says the board consisted of himself as well as Hickey, J.T. Callaghan, James McDowell Carrington, F.M. Hare, the Reverend Doctor Randolph H. McKim, and Judge Seth Shepard. The Washington Post, however, did not list Callaghan, Carrington, or Hare and instead included former Brigadier General Frank Crawford Armstrong (CSA), former Missouri Senator Francis M. Cockrell, and former West Virginia Senator Charles J. Faulkner. It quickly became apparent, however, that the scope of work under discussion by the ACMA would overwhelm the small board of directors. Herbert records that the ACMA submitted a petition in November 1906 asking the UDC to support the ACMA organizationally and financially. This resolution was approved by the UDC. But still the work overwhelmed the ACMA. By mid-1907, it was clear that the UDC would have to completely take over the memorial's fund-raising, design, and construction. On June 19, 1907, Mrs. Lizzie George Henderson, President- General of the UDC, asked the ACMA to delegate its functions to the UDC, with the UDC and Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) retaining certain powers to themselves. The ACMA quickly agreed. The UDC asked Cornelia Branch Stone (a member of Veuve Jefferson Davis Chapter No. 17 in Galveston, Texas, and chair of the UDC committee which awarded the organization's Southern Cross of Honor) to meet with representatives from the ACMA's founding organizations and reorganize the association. The first meeting occurred on December 12, 1907, but no agreement was reached. (Stone noted that Charles Broadway Rouse Camp No. 1191 declined to participate.) A second meeting on December 21 led to the ACMA's agreement to re-establish itself as a constituent body of the UDC.United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Sixteenth Annual Convention..., p. 281-282. Accessed 2013-10-30. A committee was appointed by the UDC to revise the ACMA's articles of incorporation. Under the new articles, the President-General of the UDC became the ex officio President of the ACMA. The board of directors consisted of a representative from each state in which the UDC had a chapter, with this individual to be appointed by the President-General of the UDC in consultation with the UDC state division president. An Executive Committee was also created. Its membership consisted of representatives from UCV Camp No. 171 and Camp No. 1191; one representative from Camp No. 172 of the SCV; and three representatives to be appointed by the five UDC chapters in the District of Columbia.Herbert, p. 16-17. The executive committee was empowered to appoint (with concurrence of the president) a nine- member Advisory Board, which was chaired by the association's treasurer.Herbert, p. 7. The association's new officers consisted of a president, first and second vice presidents, corresponding and recording secretaries, and a treasurer. An Executive Board oversaw the organization between meetings of the board of directors. The executive board consisted of the first vice president (who served as chairman), treasurer, recording secretary, and corresponding secretary. A representative chosen from the board of directors served as its vice-chairman, and five other members of the board of directors served as members of the executive board.Herbert, p. 5-6. The ACMA's first president was Cornelia Branch Stone, who served from 1907 to 1909.Herbert, p. 17. For its part, the UDC supervised the work of the ACMA through a committee composed of eight delegates from each of the five chapters of the UDC then extant in the District of Columbia. The ex officio chairman of the committee was the President of the Division of the District of Columbia. An advisory committee was also established, which consisted of four members from UCV Camp No. 171, four members from UCV Charles Broadway Rouss Camp No. 1191, and four members from each chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in the District of Columbia.United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Fourteenth Annual Convention..., p. 24. Accessed 2013-10-30. These two committees were established to oversee the work of the ACMA. But, in fact, the UDC agreed to accept the work of the ACMA \\"without conditions\\"‚Äîwhich meant the UDC had no real control over the memorial.Cox, \\"The Confederate Monument at Arlington...\\", p. 150, fn. 9. Fund-raising During the period between the ACMA's formation and its reconstitution, the UDC contributed $500 ($ in dollars).Herbert, p. 16. The Washington Post reported that the ACMA had $3,000 to $4,000 ($ to $ in dollars) on hand in December 1906, with a goal of raising $25,000 ($ in dollars). Furthermore, the UDC agreed to donate $1,500 ($ in dollars) annually beginning in 1907 until the memorial was finished. Fund- raising occurred rapidly during Stone's tenure as president, but there are conflicting accounts of just how much money was raised over the next several years. In July 1907, the press reported that multi-millionaire stockbroker Thomas Fortune Ryan donated $10,000 ($ in dollars) to the Confederate monument fund.\\"Ryan Contributes $10,000.\\" Washington Post. July 26, 1907. But according to Hilary A. Herbert, the ACMA's First Vice President and the chief executive officer of the association, the ACMA had raised just $3,460 ($ in dollars) by November 1907. To boost fund-raising, the ACMA sought and won the endorsement of several prominent individuals. Former CSA Lieutenant General Stephen D. Lee strongly endorsed the memorial project in September 1907 and asked all UCV camps to contribute to the fund-raising drive.\\"Arlington Shaft to Gray.\\" Washington Post. September 24, 1907. In February 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt also endorsed the project in very strong terms.\\"For Confederate Monument.\\" Washington Post. February 7, 1908.

One of her last acts was to propose the appointment of a memorial design committee. She suggested creating a seven-member committee and offered for the delegates' consideration the names for six people who might serve on the committee. She asked the UDC convention to ratify her choice as well as pick a seventh member to act as chair. The convention approved her resolution, and selected Stone as the seventh member. Sources vary as to who was on the design committee. According to Herbert, the six members included Mrs. Marion Butler, Hilary A. Herbert, Mrs. Thomas W. Keith, the Rev. Dr. McKim, Judge Seth Shepard, and Wallace Streater.Streater was the Commander of the D.C. United Sons of Confederate Veterans, and an Inspector General in the U.S. Armuy.

Accessed 2013-10-30. McKim then proposed that an artist of national renown be selected to propose a design. Hilary Herbert recommended Moses Ezekiel, a Confederate Army veteran and well-known artist who was already one of the top sculptors of Confederate images in the United States.Mills, p. xix; Sutherland, p. 314-315. The UDC was worried that Ezekiel would turn them down. For one, he was rumored to be highly temperamental. For another, he had lost several competitions for federal Civil War monuments (including the prominent Admiral David G. Farragut memorial in Washington, D.C.), and Ezekiel was on public record against art competitions. To placate him, the UDC design committee agreed ahead of time to give Ezekiel complete artistic authority in designing the memorial.Jacob, p. 165. Meetings with Moses Ezekiel Ezekiel had already heard about the planned Confederate Memorial long before being contacted by the design committee, and had already conceived a design.Herbert, p. 18.\\"Sculptor Ezekiel Arrives.\\" Washington Post. May 25, 1910. Ezekiel lived in Italy, but had returned to the United States on May 24, 1910, for the dedication of his life- size bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson outside the Rotunda at the University of Virginia. He visited President William Howard Taft at the White House before traveling to the university, and it was while waiting to see Taft that the idea for the Confederate Memorial came to him.Gibson, p. 192-193. Herbert and the author Thomas Nelson Page (a friend of Ezekiel's) visited with the sculptor in Washington, D.C., on November 5, 1910. Ezekiel expressed his intense desire to obtain the commission. Herbert, Page, and Ezekiel then visited the Confederate section at Arlington National Cemetery and discussed the size and placement of the memorial.United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Twenty-First Annual Convention..., p. 277. Accessed 2013-10-30. Ezekiel sketched out his idea on a piece of paper for the two men.Jacob, p. 166. He also made it clear that he would work in Italy, and would not accept any design input from the ACMA. The following day, the design committee held an emergency meeting. Dr. McKim could not attend, but advised the committee that he approved of Ezekiel's selection. Mrs. Keith also could not attend, but offered no proxy. At the emergency meeting, Ezekiel outlined his proposal for the memorial: a heroic female figure symbolic of the South with a wreath in one hand and the other resting on a plow, standing atop a circular base around which figures representing the sacrifices of the South were grouped. The design committee was deeply impressed with Ezekiel's proposal and offered the commission to him. On November 7, Ezekiel signed a contract to design and manufacture the memorial. The finished memorial was to be delivered by November 1913 at a cost of $10,000 ($ in dollars). Art historian Timothy Sedore says Ezekiel accepted the commission only because he had final control over the design.Sedore, p. 115. Hilary Herbert also agrees that Ezekiel was given a free hand. UDC historian Karen L. Cox, however, says that the ACMA design committee worked with Ezekiel to ensure that the memorial adhered to the theme of \\"peace for the living and honor to the dead\\".Cox, Dixie's Daughters, p. 56. Working out the design The UDC convention opened in Little Rock, Arkansas, just three days after the contract with Ezekiel was signed. Excited by the news that Moses Ezekiel had won the design commission, convention attendees voted to increase the cost of the memorial by $15,000 ($ in dollars) to $50,000 ($ in dollars) to make it larger and grander. Of this amount, $10,000 ($) was set aside for shipping the memorial to the United States from Italy and for its erection at Arlington National Cemetery. Upon learning of the funding increase, Ezekiel immediately made a new, larger model.McSherry, Virginia Faulkner. \\"Construction of Arlington Monument.\\" Confederate Veteran. XIX:4 (April 1911), p. 147. Accessed 2013-10-30.

Accessed 2013-10-30. Ezekiel felt that the monument was the most important commission he ever worked on, and he refused all other work so that he could devote all his time to it.Cox, \\"The Confederate Monument at Arlington...\\", p. 154. He also discouraged visitors from coming to his Rome studio so that there would be little public discussion of his design. Nonetheless, some changes were made in response to comments made by visitors to his workshop. For example, Ezekiel originally intended for the shield against which the fallen woman leans to be inscribed with the words \\"free trade\\" and \\"state's rights\\". He changed the words to \\"Constitution\\" after a visit to his studio by a friend.Ezekiel, p. 411. In time, the ACMA design committee began asking Ezekiel for design details, clearly with a mind toward reviewing his work. He declined to give them. But with work on his design nearly complete in late 1911, Ezekiel began sending occasional photographs of his work to the ACMA design committee. He asked, however, that these be kept private to reduce interference with his work.\\"South to Honor Dead.\\" Washington Post. February 4, 1912. A two-thirds size model was finished in early 1912. Fund-raising to cover enlarged design Additional fundraising occurred after 1910 to raise the money to cover the additional cost. A number of small donations came from Union soldiers,\\"Roses For Their Dead.\\" Washington Post. June 10, 1912. with the 23rd New Jersey Regiment contributing $100 ($).Herbert, p. 31. Ezekiel agreed to donate his services as sculptor, so that all the money set aside for the memorial could go toward the purchase of raw bronze and for the memorial's casting. By February 1912, $24,000 ($) still needed to be raised. Over the next four months, an additional $4,000 ($) came in. As casting on the memorial neared completion in November 1913, the ACMA announced that it had raised $50,442.59 ($ in dollars), of which $3,517 ($ in dollars) went to construction of the concrete foundation, fund-raising, and expenses associated with the cornerstone-laying ceremony.United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention..., p. 342.

Accessed 2013-10-30. Building the memorial=Laying the cornerstone Construction of the foundations for the Confederate Memorial in 1912. Work on the memorial proceeded on schedule. In June 1912, the ACMA announced that it was planning a dedication to occur 12 months later, just before the Blue-and-Gray reunion at Gettysburg Battlefield in Pennsylvania. The ACMA set Tuesday, November 12, 1912, at 2:00 P.M. as the date and time for laying the cornerstone for the memorial. The date coincided with the first day of the UDC's annual convention, which that year was to be held in Washington, D.C. The UDC claimed it was the first time the convention had been held outside the boundary of the old Confederacy\\"Taft to Welcome Southern Women to Capital of Union Next Week.\\" Washington Post. November 3, 1912. (although that was not true, as the convention was held in San Francisco, California, in 1905.)Cox, \\"The Confederate Monument at Arlington...\\", p. 155. The organization invited President William Howard Taft to speak to the convention,\\"Plan Big Convention.\\" Washington Post. February 22, 1912. and he agreed to do so in mid-October.\\"South to Honor Dead.\\" Washington Post. October 14, 1912. As the date for the cornerstone-laying ceremony approached, more than 10,000 people were expected to attend the event.\\"United Daughters of Confederacy Gather Here for Big Convention.\\" Washington Post. November 10, 1912.\\"U.D.C. Meet Today.' Washington Post. November 11, 1912. Plans for the cornerstone ceremony appeared to be disrupted when the 1912 presidential election was held just a week before the event and Taft lost the election to Woodrow Wilson. It was widely expected that Taft would cancel his speech, but Taft reaffirmed his commitment to speak at the cornerstone-laying event. It was considered an important speech, since it was his first speaking engagement since losing the election. The cornerstone laying occurred as scheduled on November 12. The turnout of about 6,000 people was, however, lighter than expected.\\"Begin U.C.V. Shaft.\\" Washington Post. November 13, 1912. The 15th Cavalry Regiment Band provided music for the event,Herbert, p. 28. and Bishop Robert Atkinson Gibson of the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia delivered the invocation. Speakers included former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and Hilary A. Herbert. On the spur of the moment, Herbert asked Corporal James R. Tanner, former Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic (a veterans organization for Union soldiers) to briefly address the crowd.Herbert, p. 34. Tanner lost both legs in the war, became a stenographer, and took eyewitness testimony on behalf of the government in the hours following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He had briefly led the Bureau of Pensions in 1889, and helped organize the American Red Cross. Nonetheless, there were murmurs of disapproval from the audience when Tanner spoke. When the speeches ended, the cornerstone was laid. The cornerstone contained a time capsule in which a large number of objects and documents were placed, including a certified copy of the Act of June 6, 1900; the letter from Secretary of War Taft giving the ACMA permission to build the memorial; membership rosters of the UDC and other organizations; flags of the states which joined the Confederacy; and examples of Confederate and modern paper money and coins. A ceremonial trowel of mortar was laid beneath the cornerstone by Herbert, Tanner, and Miss Mary Custis Lee, the 77-year-old only living child of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The cornerstone was then lowered into place. Mrs. Cordelia Powell Odenheimer, the First Vice President of the UDC, then placed mortar atop the stone. This ended the ceremony. The Rev. Dr. Randolph McKim delivered the benediction. After the ceremony ended, members of the UDC planted a redwood tree near the monument. It was named \\"Robert E. Lee\\" in honor of General Lee. The total cost of the event was $594.05 ($ in dollars). Dedication delays Unveiling of the Confederate Monument on June 4, 1914. While work on the monument initially progressed on schedule, delays began to occur. Funding was not the issue: By November 1913, the ACMA had paid $20,000 to Ezekiel to secure raw bronze, and almost $22,725 remained in the organization's coffers to complete the memorial, ship it to America, and assemble and erect it.\\"Laud South's Heroes.\\" Washington Post. June 9, 1913. The first delay was small but significant, and occurred in early 1913 when Ezekiel could not obtain copies of the Confederate state shields in a timely fashion.United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention..., p. 347. Accessed 2013-10-30. This forced the ACMA and UDC to give up on a June 1913 dedication, and November 5 was informally set as the new date for the event.United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention..., p. 340. Accessed 2013-10-30. Yet more delays occurred. About July, Ezekiel said he needed 10 more days to complete casting, and the UDC changed the dedication date to November 15. But on August 19, an accident occurred in the casting process which delayed delivery of the memorial by yet another three months. The Confederate Memorial was finally complete in November 1913, and shipped to the United States via a Hamburg America ocean liner in early 1914. It was sent by barge up Potomac River and arrived at the Washington Navy Yard on January 10, 1914.\\"Confederate Statue Here.\\" Washington Post. January 11, 1914. The Confederate Memorial consisted of a number of pieces which required assembly. Civil engineer A. C.

Accessed 2013-10-30. The memorial was stored in crates not at the Navy Yard but at the Army Quartermaster's headquarters at Fort Myer, next to Arlington National Cemetery.\\"Rites for Dixie Shaft.\\" Washington Post. February 17, 1914. The ACMA decided to uncrate and erect the memorial in early March 1914 (as soon as winter weather permitted), and established a new the dedication ceremony date for April 27. But construction problems again forced a delay in the dedication ceremony. With the assistance of Representative James Luther Slayden of San Antonio, Texas,\\"What Texas Offers in Stone.\\" Stone: An Illustrated Magazine. 35:1 (January 1914), p. 29. Accessed 2013-11-05. the ACMA had contracted with a Texas firm to provide the granite for the memorial's base. But the company could not furnish enough granite in time to meet the April 27 dedication deadline. The ACMA canceled its contract, and commissioned a Maryland firm to provide the granite instead. The Maryland company said the base would be completed by May 22, so the ACMA rescheduled the dedication for Confederate Memorial Day, June 4.\\"Unveil Shaft in June.\\" Washington Post. March 22, 1914. President Wilson speaks at the dedication ceremony for the Confederate Memorial. Dedication of the Confederate Memorial was the most prominent project the UDC had ever undertaken, and the organization desired to make it a special occasion. Florence Butler (wife of former North Carolina Senator Marion Butler) chaired the dedication program committee. She called it a \\"disagreeable job\\", for it involved declining hundreds of requests from people who wanted to read speeches, sing or play songs, and recite poetry. Butler, however, was convinced that there should be a bare minimum of speeches, and none of them should be lengthy. President Woodrow Wilson, a native Virginian, was invited to be the keynote speaker, and an invitation he readily accepted. His participation was almost derailed, however, when Wilson decided against attending the Grand Army of the Republic's Memorial Day ceremonies. An outraged GAR demanded that Wilson withdraw from the Confederate Memorial dedication. But Wilson quickly agreed to attend the GAR's event, and the scandal died down.\\"Peace Dove Returns.\\" Washington Post. May 31, 1914. Dedicating the memorial The dedication ceremony for the Confederate Memorial was held on June 4, 1914. Although numerous dignitaries and Confederate groups were invited to attend, only a single Union veterans' group was asked to do so (because, the UDC said, there was limited seating).\\"Child to Bare Memorial.' Washington Post. June 3, 1914. The Union veterans' group which was invited was the 23rd New Jersey Regiment, which made a major donation early in the fund-raising process. But its leaders could not be reached and no representative from the unit attended. The ceremony began with music from the 5th Cavalry Regiment Band,\\"Arrive for Unveiling.\\" Washington Post. June 4, 1914.\\"Gray and Blue Join.\\" Washington Post. June 5, 1914. which entertained the more than 4,000 people who attended the ceremony, including all members of Congress. The invocation was delivered by the Rev. Dr. Randolph H. McKim, pastor of the Church of the Epiphany (a historic Episcopal church located at 1317 G Street NW). Hilary Herbert acted as the master of ceremonies. Former Confederate general Bennett H. Young, National Commander of the United Confederate Veterans, spoke first, followed by Washington Gardner, a former sergeant with the 65th Ohio Volunteer Infantry and National Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic.\\"Pay Tribute to South.\\" Washington Post. May 24, 1914. Colonel Robert Edward Lee III (USA), grandson of General Robert E. Lee, then addressed the audience on the meaning of the memorial. Herbert spoke briefly and then, on behalf of the ACMA, turned the memorial over to the UDC. Mrs. Daisy McLaurin Stevens, President of the UDC, accepted the memorial and delivered her own a brief oration. Following the speakers, the Confederate Memorial was unveiled by 11-year-old Paul Herbert Micou, grandson of Hilary Herbert. A 21-gun artillery salute followed, and then Mrs. Stevens presented the memorial to President Wilson as a gift to the American people. The dedication program was to have concluded with a major address by President Wilson followed by mass singing, wreath-laying and other floral tributes, a benediction by Reverend Andrew R. Bird of the Church of the Pilgrims (a Presbyterian church located in Washington, D.C.), and a wreath-laying at the Civil War Unknowns Monument. But a thunderstorm broke over the crowd as the President neared the end of his remarks. With no marquee or other shelter nearby for the crowd, most attendees rushed for their automobiles and returned to the city. The President left as well, and the dedication ceremony ended abruptly. The floral tributes were quickly deposited at the foot of the memorial, and the wreath hurriedly placed at the Civil War Unknowns memorial.Herbert, p. 69. The cost of the ceremony was $2,660.30 ($ in dollars). About the memorial Figure representing \\"The South\\" atop the memorial. The Confederate Memorial stands in a circular grassy area in the center of Stonewall Jackson Circle in Section 16 in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia. Section 16 is completely surrounded by Section 17, and Jackson Circle may be reached via a short path connecting the circle to McPherson Drive.Atkinson, p. 29. Sculpted in the Baroque styleFederal Writers' Project, p. 521, accessed 2013-10-31; Wurman, p. 198. by Moses Ezekiel in his Rome, Italy, studio, the cost of the bronze and casting was about $41,770 ($) (although the press reported the number as $35,000 [$ in dollars]).

The memorial consists of a bronze statue atop a bronze plinth, which stand on a granite base which rests on concrete footings.Sedore, p. 114. The base consists of a rectangular lower base and a taller upper base in the shape of a nearly-square Maltese cross, which together are about high.United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Twenty-First Annual Convention..., p. 278. Accessed 2013-10-30. The two elements which make up the base are of polished Woodstock granite from Maryland, while the plinth above the base is made of bronze. Prior to laying the foundations, the entire Confederation section was regraded. Roads through the section, built in 1901-1903, were closed and removed and replaced with turf. The road around the site was converted to a cement walk and gutters installed. The cost of these alterations, borne by the UDC, was $1,020.70 ($ in dollars). The statue is generally referred to as the \\"Confederate Memorial\\" and sometimes as the \\"Confederate Monument\\". It has no official name, although Moses Ezekiel preferred the title \\"New South\\".Poole, p. 155. The memorial is richly decorated, and reflects Ezekiel's training in Germany as well as the ornate Romantic style of Victorian decorative arts.Gibson, p. 193. At in height,Herbert, p. 64. the Confederate Memorial is among the tallest of the memorials and monuments at Arlington National Cemetery. It is often claimed to be the tallest,Johnson, p. 61. but this is incorrect as the obelisk over the grave of Major General Joseph Wheeler is taller ().Poole, p. 350, fn. 58. Figure of \\"The South\\" The topmost portion of the memorial consists of a larger-than-life figure of a woman representing the South. The orientation of the figure and its face is toward the south, in part to honor the Confederacy\\"Confederates Here June 4.\\" Washington Post. May 13, 1914. but also so that the sun may shine on the face of the figure at all times (which is symbolic of being favored). The figure's head is crowned with an olive wreath, which is both sacred to Minerva (Roman goddess of war and wisdom) and a symbol of peace. The figure's left hand extends a laurel wreath toward the south in acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by the South's men in arms and as a symbol of the past. The figure holds a pruning hook in its right hand, which in turn rests on a plow. This represents peace and reconciliation as well as the hope that the labor of the South will lead to new glory. The figure stands on a round pedestalHerbert, p. 65. decorated with palm branches and four cinerary urns. Low relief numbers on the urns refer to the four years of the American Civil War (1861, 1862, 1863, and \\"1864-5\\"). Beneath the round pedestal is a round plinth in the form of a wreath of wheat. Below the plinth is a round base on which is inscribed: \\"And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks.\\" It is a partial quotation from Isaiah 2:4. Below the base is a frieze of 14 inwardly inclined shields, each of which depicts the coat of arms of one of the 11 Confederate states, as well as the border states of Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland.Herbert, p. 64-65. 32 figures on the mount Sculptor Moses Ezekiel included the weeping figure of the loyal black mammy as a correction to what he and the UDC saw as lies about history perpetrated by the North. Below the frieze is a cylindrical mount on which are 32 life-size figures. In the front (or south- facing side) of the mount is the panoplied figure of Minerva.Jacob, p. 167. Minerva attempts to support the figure of a fallen woman (who also represents the South). The woman is leaning against a shield emblazoned with the words \\"The Constitution.\\" Behind Minerva's head, allegorical \\"Spirits of War\\" trumpet in every direction, calling the citizens of the South to aid their country. One spirit resembles a gorgon, while another holds a cinerary urn. On either side of the fallen woman are figures depicting those who came to the South's aid. They represent each branch of the Confederate armed forces: Miner, sailor, sapper, and soldier. There are four figures (two in high relief, two in low relief) facing Minerva on the southwest corner of the mount. There are six figures (three in high relief, three in low relief) facing Minerva on the southeast corner of the mount. A uniformed black slave, following his master to war, is depicted among the six figures on the southeast. The slave is not a soldier, although the image is often referred to as a \\"black soldier\\". It is, as the UDC pointed out in 1914, \\"a faithful Negro body-servant following his young master\\".Loewen and Sebesta, p. 374. This particular image was inspired by Thomas Nelson Page's 1887 Lost Cause story, Marse Chan: A Tale of Old Virginia.Herbert, p. 65-66. On the east, northeast, north, northwest, and west sides of the cylindrical mount are the remainder of the figures in high relief. These figures are intended to represent the sacrifices, devotion, and heroism of all social classes of people in the Confederacy. The figures depict: *A military officer kissing his infant child, who is held in the arms of a weeping black mammy while another child clings to her skirts;Herbert, p. 66. *A shirtless blacksmith leaving his anvil and tools behind as his sorrowful wife looks on; *A clergyman and his grieving wife saying goodbye to their teenage son (who has enlisted); and *A young lady binding a sword and sash onto her beau. The inclusion of the \\"faithful black servants\\" was purposeful. Sculptor Moses Ezekiel included them because he wanted to undermine what he called the \\"lies\\" told about the South and slavery in Harriett Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin and wished to rewrite history \\"correctly\\" (his word) to depict black slaves' support for the Confederate cause. An oak tree spreads its branches behind the couple and their son and the blacksmith's family. It represents the support family lends to the Confederate cause, as well as the strength of Confederate families.Herbert, p. 67. Base The fallen figure of a woman, also representing \\"The South\\", leans on a shield emblazoned with the words \\"The Constitution\\" as a symbol of what the UDC believed the South fought for. Cinerary urns and shields bearing the coat of arms of each state support the topmost figure on the memorial. The 32 life-size figures stand on an irregular octagonal base. The front (or south-facing side) of this base depicts the Great Seal of the Confederacy in low relief. In raised letters below the seal are the following words: > TO OUR DEAD HEROES > BY > THE UNITED DAUGHTERS > OF THE CONFEDERACY > VICTRIX CAUSA DIIS > PLACUIT SED VICTA CATON This Latin phrase means: \\"The Victorious Cause was Pleasing to the Gods, But the Lost Cause Pleased Cato.\\" It is a quotation from the poem Pharsalia by the ancient Roman poet Lucan. It refers to the attempt by the Roman Senator Pompey to prevent Julius Caesar from becoming dictator of Rome in 49 BC. Although he lost, Pompey's actions pleased the great philosopher and statesman Cato (who was noted for his moral integrity). On the north face of the memorial in raised letters are the following words:Wilson, p. 41-42; Herbert, p. 67-68. > NOT FOR FAME OR REWARD > NOT FOR PLACE OR FOR RANK > NOT LURED BY AMBITION > OR GOADED BY NECESSITY > BUT IN SIMPLE > OBEDIENCE TO DUTY > AS THEY UNDERSTOOD IT > THESE MEN SUFFERED ALL > SACRIFICED ALL > DARED ALL ‚Äî AND DIED > RANDOLPH HARRISON MCKIM On the northwest face of the octagonal base, in raised letters, are the words: > M. Ezekiel * Sculptor > Rome MCMXII On the northeast face of the octagonal base, in raised letters, are the words: > MADE BY > AKTIEN-GESELLSCHAFT GLADENBECK > BRONZE FOUNDERY > BERLIN-FRIEDRICHSHAGEN-GERMANY The east and west sides of the octagonal base are flanked by pedestals, on top of which are urn-like lamps topped with \\"eternal flames\\" of bronze. Critical assessment The Washington Post lauded the memorial when it was unveiled. It was effusive in its praise for the monument's focus on peace and the future, its emphasis on the South's fight for constitutional rights and not slavery, and its repetitive images focusing on the sacrifices made by the heroic common soldier. Unnamed European art critics cited by The Sunday Star newspaper said it was \\"a marvel of facial expression and allegorically perfect\\".\\"Confederate Memorial Sculptor Arrives Here.\\" The Sunday Star. May 31, 1914. Colonel William Couper, a faculty member at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), praised it in 1933 as \\"magnificent and impressive\\".Couper, p. 67. Modern critics have been somewhat more equivocal. Keith Gibson, executive director of the VMI museum system, says the Confederate Memorial is a \\"superb example of Ezekiel's style and imagery\\", and one of the artist's most significant works. Gibson nevertheless faults the memorial for its static posing and \\"hard contours\\". Historian Katherine Allamong Jacob, however, notes that while the memorial is \\"intensely dramatic\\" it is also \\"not a little sentimental\\".Jacob, p. 166-167. In 2007, Washington Post reporter Linda Wheeler found the memorial ornate and romantic and praised it as a vivid reflection of Victorian artistic taste. Kirk Savage, associate professor of art history and architecture at the University of Pittsburgh, criticizes the memorial for being \\"clearly the product of white supremacist thinking and practice\\".Savage, p. 183. Historian Erika Lee Doss agrees, calling it a \\"pro- Southern textbook\\".Doss, p. 11.

But the $40,000 ($ in dollars) budgeted for design and casting of the monument fell short of the actual cost. Ezekiel was forced to spend about $5,000 ($ in dollars) of his own funds casting the piece, as the money paid to him barely covered the cost of materials.United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Twentieth Annual Convention..., p. 345. Accessed 2013-10-30. Many UDC leaders felt fundraising should continue since the Little Rock convention of 1910 had implicitly promised to pay Ezekiel more money. The resolution which enlarged the memorial and increased the amount of money budgeted for it read: \\"...that the monument in Washington shall cost not less than $50,000, with the hopes of $75,000, and that a contract be made to this effect...\\".United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Twenty- First Annual Convention..., p. 272. Accessed 2013-10-30. Although Ezekiel declined to press the issue, UDC leaders felt morally bound to try to pay him the additional $25,000 ($ in dollars). In November 1914, with nearly all the costs of the memorial, its erection, and dedication paid, there remained a memorial fund balance of $1,770.92 ($ in dollars). This money was paid to Ezekiel.United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Twenty-First Annual Convention..., p. 271.

At the Savannah convention of 1914, the delegates agreed to pay Ezekiel a total of $8,229 ($ in dollars) above the $40,000 already sent to him. Savannah convention raised just $1,503.75 toward this sum, and the UDC general treasury donated another $1,000 from its treasury. Moses Ezekiel died in March 1917, and it is unclear whether the UDC ever paid the outstanding $3,955.25 ($ in dollars). At the November 1917 UDC convention in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the ACMA treasurer reported that the Confederate Memorial fund now showed a deficit of $1,325.25 ($ in dollars). There is no indication in the UDC convention minutes as to why this deficit was incurred. The organization's treasurer proposed that the necessary funds be raised by donations at the convention and that any remaining deficit paid for by the UDC out of its treasury.United Daughters of the Confederacy, Minutes of the Twenty-Fourth Annual Convention..., p. 71-72.

Burials in the Confederate section continued after the Confederate Memorial was completed. The first of these was Thomas Findley, who was buried on June 11, 1914, just days after the dedication ceremony. His interment, however, proved controversial because the War Department gave him full military honors.\\"Burial First of Kind.\\" Washington Post. June 12, 1914. This created widespread anger nationally among GAR members because Findley was not honorably discharged from the armed forces of the United States, as required by law.\\"Burial Rites Illegal.\\" Washington Post. June 14, 1914. Four notable burials occurred at the compass points of the Confederate Memorial, and stand out from the rest of the graves nearby for not being part of the concentric circles of burials. These are the graves of Moses Ezekiel, Lieutenant Harry C. Marmaduke, Captain John M. Hickey, and Brigadier General Marcus J. Wright. The first of these burials was that of Moses Ezekiel, which occurred on March 30, 1921. Ezekiel died in Italy on March 27, 1917. He requested that his body be brought back to the United States for burial, but this was not possible as World War I prevented it. His body was returned to America after the war and a funeral held in Arlington Memorial Amphitheater on March 30, 1921‚Äîthe first funeral ever to be held in the year-old structure.\\"Impressive Rites for Moses Ezekiel.\\" Washington Post. March 31, 1921; Peters, p. 78-79; Jacob, p. 171. His body was buried on the east side of the memorial, and a small granite pedestal surmounted by a bronze plaque placed at the head of the grave. The second of the four notable burials was that of Brigadier General Wright, which occurred on December 29, 1922.\\"Gen. Wright Funeral Today.\\" Washington Post. December 29, 1922. He was interred on the south side of the memorial. The third burial was that of Captain Henry H. Marmaduke, the last known surviving officer of the ironclad warship CSS Virginia (which famously fought the in the Battle of Hampton Roads on March 9, 1862). A midshipman at the time of the battle, he lived in the District of Columbia after 1883 and was buried on the west side of the memorial on November 17, 1924.\\"Last Monitor Merrimac Officer, 82, Dies Here.\\" Washington Post.

Hickey Funeral Tomorrow.\\" Washington Post. October 2, 1927. It is unclear why these four were buried next to the memorial and not elsewhere in the Confederate section. Ezekiel, Wright, and Hickey all played major roles in creating the Confederate section and bringing the memorial into being, but it is less clear why Marmaduke warranted burial at the foot of the memorial (although his notable war service may have justified it). Also unclear is why no other notable burials occurred next to the memorial. Other history of the memorial The Confederate Memorial is the focus of Confederate Memorial Day exercises in the Washington, D.C., area. President Woodrow Wilson attended the first four events (1915, 1916, 1917, and 1918) held at the memorial, although he spoke only at that of 1917. It is unclear when Wilson began sending wreaths to the event, although historians agree the tradition began with Wilson. President Warren G. Harding spoke at the first Confederate Memorial Day event of his presidency in 1922,\\"Tells Confederates Reunion Is Complete.\\" Washington Post. June 5, 1922. but did not attend in 1923.\\"South's Cause Again Lauded.\\" Washington Post. June 4, 1923. Harding's successor, Calvin Coolidge, spoke at the memorial on Confederate Memorial Day in 1924 (held that year on May 25).\\"President to Lead Services Today for Confederate Dead.\\" Washington Post. May 25, 1924. Coolidge sent a wreath beginning with the 1925 Confederate Memorial Day, but never again attended the event.\\"President Honors Confederate Dead at Arlington Rites.\\" Washington Post.

Attendance at the Confederate Memorial Day event at the memorial has fluctuated wildly. For example, more than 2,000 attended Confederate Memorial Day ceremonies at the memorial in 1912, but just 600 did so in 1925 (the 60th anniversary of the end of the war). \\"Several hundred\\" attended the 1931 event, while more than 2,000 came in 1932. A thousand were there in 1934.\\"Spirit of South Nation's Need, Veterans Told.\\" Washington Post. June 4, 1934. Although media coverage of the event was sparse in the 1930s, more than a thousand people attended the 1942 ceremony.\\"Thousand Pay Tribute to Confederate Dead.\\" Washington Post. June 8, 1942.

Conclusion of the Confederate Memorial Day exercises in 1922. Note the much different landscaping around the memorial compared to photos from the 2000s, the still-extant sidewalks, and the far fewer graves. Another set of memorials was proposed for the Confederate section in 1931. The idea was sparked by a controversy over the burial of LaSalle Corbell Pickett, wife of Major General George Pickett (CSA). Pickett died in Norfolk, Virginia, on July 30, 1875.Brown, p. 730. After a brief interment in a cemetery in Norfolk,Selcer, p. 54. his remains were reburied in the Confederate military section of Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, on October 24, 1875.\\"The Late Gen. Pickett.\\" New York Times. October 25, 1875. LaSalle Corbell Pickett died on March 22, 1931. Her wish was to be buried next to her husband, but Hollywood Cemetery officials refused, citing regulations that only men could be buried in the Confederate section of Hollywood Cemetery.\\"Burial of Pickett Widow Is Refused in Richmond.\\" Washington Post. March 25, 1931. Mrs. Pickett's grandson and eldest surviving male descendant, Lieutenant George E. Pickett III, was outraged by the cemetery's decision. He sought to have his grandmother buried in the Confederate section of Arlington National Cemetery, and have his grandfather's remains disinterred and brought to D.C. for burial beside her. Lieutenant Pickett then conferred with representatives of the War Department and Colonel Robert Lee Longstreet, son of Lieutenant General James Longstreet. The three parties devised a plan to erect statues to Generals Pickett, Longstreet, and Robert E. Lee in the Confederate section.\\"Confederates Plan Arlington Shrine.\\" Washington Post. March 29, 1931. The three statues would be grouped together where Jackson Circle and McPherson Drive met, creating what Pickett and Longstreet called a \\"tri-hero corner\\". Additionally, Longstreet conceived of a site adjacent to the Confederate section where Confederates could be buried or reburied, and additional memorials to them erected. He brought his idea to War Department shortly after the tri-hero corner concept was broached.\\"Dead of Lost Cause May Get U.S. Shrine.\\" Washington Post. March 30, 1931. Alarmed not only at the loss of Pickett's remains but at a potential shift in focus from Richmond to Arlington, Hollywood Cemetery officials quickly agreed to inter Mrs. Pickett next to her husband. With this decision, the rationale for a tri-hero corner largely went away, and neither it nor Longstreet's memorial section plan were implemented. There were also attempts to erect additional Confederate memorials at Arlington National Cemetery in the 1930s. The first of these was a legislative proposal by Representative Hamilton Fish III in 1935 to erect a statue of Robert E. Lee somewhere in the cemetery.\\"Women Oppose Statue of Lee In Arlington.\\" Washington Post. May 16, 1935. The UDC had previously sought to erect a statue of Lee near Arlington House about 1900, but abandoned this plan to pursue the Confederate Memorial. The UDC strongly backed the Fish bill, but the legislation generated widespread opposition and died in Congress in 1936 without being acted on.\\"G.A.R. Opposes Lee Memorial At Arlington.\\" Washington Post. September 25, 1936. A second Confederate memorial was proposed for Arlington Memorial Amphitheater. It is unclear who or what group made the suggestion (although the Washington Post implied it was a project of the Sons of Confederate Veterans), but it was proposed to inscribe the names of leading Confederate figures on the columns on either side of the apse in Memorial Amphitheater. These square pilasters on either side of the apse list the names of famous American generals (left, as one faces the stage) and admirals (right) from the American Revolutionary War through the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898.\\"The Arlington Memorial Amphitheater.\\" Architectural Forum. January 1921, p. 94. Accessed 2013-05-13. When the UDC learned of the proposal, many of its members wanted to add the names of Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson to the columns as well. A resolution to this effect was offered at the UDC convention in 1937. However, delegates amended the resolution on the floor to deny UDC support for the changes unless the name of Confederate President Jefferson Davis was added as well. The resolution was then adopted.\\"Eyebrows Lifted Over New Names At Amphitheater.\\" Washington Post. November 13, 1937. But only Congress had the authority to change the pilasters, and no legislation to add names was ever introduced. Confederate Memorial Day ceremonies moved to Arlington Memorial Amphitheater from the Confederate Memorial in 1936. Although wreath layings and other brief ceremonies were still conducted at the base of the memorial, most of the event was held in the amphitheater.\\"Reynolds Says Confederacy's Spirit Lives On.\\" Washington Post. June 8, 1936\\"Confederates Honor Dead At Arlington.\\" Washington Post. June 6, 1938\\"New South Rising, Pepper Says At Confederate Day Services.\\" Washington Post. June 5, 1939\\"Confederate Veterans, at Arlington Rites, Hear Leader and Sen. Hill Assail Hitler.\\" Washington Post. June 3, 1940.\\"Boys in Gray Pay Tribute To Their Dead.\\" Washington Post. June 7, 1937. The ceremonies from the amphitheater (but not the memorial) were first broadcast on radio by NBC in 1937. The ceremonies moved back to the Confederate Memorial in 1941,Hart, Scott. \\"South's Sacrifices Can Teach Lesson Now, Gray Service Told.\\" Washington Post. June 2, 1941. but returned to the amphitheater in 1942. More recent ceremonies in the 1990s and 2000s have been at the Confederate Memorial, although it is unclear when the event moved out of Memorial Amphitheater. Former Secretary of the Navy Jim Webb spoke at a Confederate Memorial Day exercise at the memorial on June 3, 1990.; In 2010, the Confederate Memorial made its first known appearance in a work of fiction. It was mentioned prominently in author Alice Randall's 2010 novel Rebel Yell, in which two African American characters discuss the inclusion of black slaves in the memorial's imagery and the confusion and meaning it has for African Americans today.Randall, Alice. Rebel Yell: A Novel. New York: Bloomsbury, 2010, p. 135. A color guard provided by the Maryland Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans retires the colors on June 8, 2014, during Confederate Memorial Day exercises commemorating the 100th anniversary of the memorials' dedication. The 100th anniversary of the dedication of the Confederate Memorial was noted with a ceremony on Confederate Memorial Day hosted by the United Daughters of the Confederacy on June 8, 2014. Recent controversies about the memorial Beginning with Woodrow Wilson in 1919, almost every President of the United States sent a wreath to the Confederate Memorial Day exercises. This tradition was broken by President Harry S. Truman in 1949 and again in 1950.\\"Sons of Old South Resent Truman's Wreath Omission.\\" Washington Post. June 5, 1950. Truman resumed the tradition in 1951, and a presidential wreath continued to be donated each year for the next four decades.\\"Confederate Memorial Day Marked at Arlington.\\" Associated Press . June 5, 2011. Accessed 2013-06-23. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush declined to send a wreath to the ceremony, citing infighting among Confederate groups.York, Anthony. \\"Confederates in the Attic.\\" Salon.com. December 20, 2002. Bush declined to send a wreath again in 1991 and 1992. But President Bill Clinton resumed the tradition in 1993,McCaslin, John. \\"Wreaths For All.\\" Washington Times. May 29, 2003. and it was continued by his successor, President George W. Bush. When African-American Senator Barack Obama was elected President in November 2008, he faced a dilemma about continuing the tradition. As Kirk Savage, art historian, put it, \\"a black president suddenly became in charge of a tradition steeped in white supremacy\\". In 2009, several dozen university professors and historians asked President Obama to end the tradition, and the issue received some mass media attention. Confederate heritage groups denounced any attempt to end the presidential wreath tradition, arguing it would be an insult to Southerners. A few days before the 2009 Confederate Memorial Day, Savage argued in a Washington Post editorial that the Southerners were essentially correct. He concluded that to end the tradition would only reinforce racist attitudes in America and do little to promote an understanding of the role of slavery in American history and society. President Obama himself never addressed the issue. Instead, Obama sent a wreath not only to the Confederate Memorial but also instituted a new tradition of sending a presidential wreath to the African American Civil War Memorial in Washington, D.C. Position of Ezekiel's descendants In 2017, after the violence at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, gave additional impetus to the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials, twenty of Ezekiel's descendants published in The Washington Post a letter calling for the monument to be removed: > Like most such monuments, this statue intended to rewrite history to justify > the Confederacy and the subsequent racist Jim Crow laws. It glorifies the > fight to own human beings, and, in its portrayal of African Americans, > implies their collusion. As proud as our family may be of Moses‚Äôs artistic > prowess, we ‚Äî some twenty Ezekiels ‚Äî say remove that statue. Take it out of > its honored spot in Arlington National Cemetery and put it in a museum that > makes clear its oppressive history.

Williams, Paul Anderson, Barclay Press, 2006 Based in Canton, Ohio, it is composed of over 90 churches and church plants, and is part of Evangelical Friends Church International (EFC-I). The administrative office for Evangelical Friends Church - Eastern Region is located in Canton, OH. Nearby is the campus of Malone University, which is affiliated with EFC-ER. Evangelical Friends Headquarters in Canton, OH History The Ohio Yearly Meeting of the Friends Church (OYM) was established on October 12, 1812 by the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends. At the time the Ohio Yearly Meeting included most of the Friends meetings West of the Allegheny Mountains. The first OYM yearly meeting was on August 14, 1813 in Short Creek (Ohio) with Horton Howard presiding. The first Yearly Meeting House was erected in 1814 in Mt. Pleasant, Ohio. Many new local ‚Äúmeeting houses‚Äù followed. During the 1800s the Friends movement experienced a separation over theology that would today be characterized as a debate between Unitarian/Universalism and Orthodoxy (Hicksites & Orthodox Meetings). Later the Society of Friends again wrestled over traditional Friends practices and Evangelicalism (Wilburite and Gurneyite Meetings). These separations resulted in multiple groups using the name \\"Ohio Yearly Meeting\\". In 1917 the evangelicals (Gurneyites) moved their headquarters to Damascus, Ohio and became known as the Ohio Yearly Meeting (Damascus). The Yearly Meeting House in Damascus was used from 1866 until a few years before it was razed in the 1970s. Later, they relocated again, this time to Canton, Ohio. In 1965 the Ohio Yearly Meeting (Damascus) joined the Evangelical Friends Alliance. In 1971 Ohio Yearly Meeting (Damascus) became Evangelical Friends Church - Eastern Region (EFC-ER). Baptism and communion By the 1870s, a noted evangelist, David B. Updegraff, supported baptism and communion in Friends churches. His teachings were considered a near-scandal in Friends meetings throughout the world, and resulted in some yearly meetings agreeing to allow for freedom of conscience in those practices. Updegraff largely solidified the EFC-ER's participation in the Evangelical-Holiness camp. Malone University The Evangelical Friends Church - Eastern Region was heavily influenced by the leadership of J. Walter and Emma Malone. In 1892, they founded the Cleveland Bible Training Institute ‚Äî now Malone University in Canton ‚Äî to train pastors and missionaries. Walter became the first General Superintendent in 1889, although the title was not formalized until 1891. The first missionaries to come out of the school were Esther Baird and Delia Fistler, who served in India. In fact, the school (either officially or through its graduates) helped to sponsor eight other schools of higher education around the country and around the world. Twentieth century Into the twentieth century, EFC-ER expanded its churches, missions, leaders and prominence amongst evangelicals worldwide. Leaders and members of note include Everett L. Cattell (pastor, missionary, author, and college president), Walter Williams (pastor, missionary, and superintendent), Cliff Robinson (missionary, one time song leader for Billy Graham and founder of the Presidential Prayer Breakfasts), and Charles DeVol (renowned botanist and missionary).  Today  The mission of EFC-ER is to equip churches to make disciples.

Cliff's Variety Store and Hardware is a hardware, home goods, variety, and fabric store located in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco, California since 1936.SF Bay Times It has been in business for over 75 years, is considered a neighborhood institution, and predates the neighborhood becoming the first widely recognized gay mecca starting in the 1960s.\\"Castro Street change follows AIDS crisis,\\" The Evening News, September 15, 1985.\\"SPOTLIGHT: SAN FRANCISCO;AIDS threat changes tempo of \`The Castro',\\" USA TODAY, August 18, 1988. Page 7A. It is one of the oldest family-run stores in the city.Cliff's Variety History Hilario DeBaca, a former merchant and schoolteacher, wanted something to do during his retirement years, so opened the first Cliff's variety store - named after his youngest son Clifford - at 575 Castro a block south of its present-day location.Cliff's Variety It was \\"mostly a one-man operation.\\" The concept of the variety store originated in the late 1800s with nickel and dime stores offering a wide assortment of inexpensive items for personal and household use. The originator of the concept is the Woolworth Brothers whose F. W. Woolworth Company experimented with goods people could touch. Before this, clerks had to work with each customer individually, handing them goods from cases or shelves. This required more clerks, with greater knowledge, and so cost more. Inflation eventually dictated that the stores were no longer able to sell any items for five or ten cents, and were then referred to as variety stores. DeBaca's eldest son Ernie, was also a budding entrepreneur who started several businesses, and stores before traveling with his family and eventually moving back to San Francisco in the mid-1930s and re-opening his repair shop. In 1942 Hilario moved the store 1/2 block, and closer to the main intersection of the neighborhood where Castro and 18th streets intersect.Cliff's Variety It was twice the size of his first store but still considered small. It was called Cliff's Trading Post. A few years later in 1946 Ernie had an accident which kept him off his feet for months; he closed his separate repair shop and set up a workbench in the back of Cliff's where he could repair small appliances. Also in 1946, Cliff's began hosting a children's Halloween festival that featured a costume contest and ice cream-eating contest. Between the two men they had during the time of the second store introduced mechanical displays that would save on the limited counter space while utilizing the unused ceiling for storage racks. In the late 1950s the second store was forced to close as the Hibernia Bank (now a Bank of America branch) was introducing drive-through banking. The third Cliff's opened up on the other side of 18th street at 495 Castro. By this time Hilario had died and Ernie's daughter, Lorraine Asten, had born a son and named him Ernie. Ernie Asten was old enough to work in the store, and he was joined by other employees, including his girlfriend Martha, who he later married in 1969.Cliff's Variety The neighborhood was quickly changing demographics and real estate values were rapidly rising. Since the advent of automobile and driving culture and post-WWII growth of suburbs, the declining Irish Catholic and Scandinavian populations were giving way to the much more liberal young people who were overflowing from the \\"Summer of Love\\" Haight- Ashbury neighborhood just over the hill. In the 1960s and 1970s the Castro became a \\"center for gay liberation.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/us/30gay.html?_r=0 Cliff' landlord explained that the rent would be tripling for the store at the end of 1971. Luckily Bon Homme, a variety store just a few doors away was going bankrupt and Ernie DeBaca was able to buy the building outright. The original Castro Theatre was located at the present location of Cliff's at 479 Castro Street. The floor was sloped for the theater and had to be excavated for 2-3 years creating a storage basement for the incoming store The Castro Theatre originally opened at 479 Castro Street in 1910.Cliff's Variety The building was later remodeled into a retail store in the mid-1920s after the larger Castro Theater was built up the street. At the root of what was to become the best known gay mecca was the politicizing efforts of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay city supervisor in San Francisco, who started the Castro Street Fair and was later assassinated in SF City Hall in 1978. Milk had also started the Castro Village Association to provide an alternative to the \\"stodgy\\" Eureka Valley Merchants Association that was not as accepting of the new gay businesses. Milk together with Martha Asten put out information about the new emerging businesses of the Castro. The Castro had become very gay-friendly as gay bars replaced straight ones and Cliff's became the first Castro business to hire openly gay workers. Also in the 1970s a basement had been excavated for storage. By 1979, the Children's Halloween ended as the neighborhood's population shifted from families with children to more single men. But in the mid-90s, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence revived Children's Halloween with an annual party held at the Eureka Valley Recreation Center, including a costume contest and gifts from Cliff's.San Francisco Chronicle (Nov. 3, 2006) Halloween started as a kids' costume contest.

Facts  In the applicant's application for surrender of his estate, it appeared that his wife (to whom he was married out of community of property) had worked for him. He had paid a monthly amount from their joint estate to his creditors. One of these creditors opposed the application, saying that the surrender of the estate was not to the advantage of creditors, and that he (the opposing creditor) would be better off if the applicant was forced to continue the monthly payments.  Judgment  The court held that nobody could force the applicant's wife to work if she did not want to. If she stopped working (as, for example, for health reasons) there would, on the facts, scarcely be sufficient to meet the requirements of the family. Accordingly, applicant's wife's contribution towards the monthly payments could not be taken into account in deciding whether the surrender of the estate would be to the advantage of creditors in terms of section 6.

His colleague in the office as mesazon was Loukas Notaras. Demetrios first appears in history as one of the courtiers who advised John VIII to support the Ottoman prince Mustafa in his bid to seize control of the Ottoman Empire on the death of his brother Mehmet I in 1421. When Mehmet's son Murat emerged as the victor, he was selected as one of the envoys (the other two being Matthew Laskaris and Angelos Philomattes) to meet with Murat. The Sultan showed his annoyance that the Byzantines had supported his uncle by putting them in prison; none of them were released until the conclusion of a treaty between John VIII and Murat in February 1424. He played other prominent roles in diplomatic affairs as mesazon to the two emperors. He was a witness to John's treaties with the Republic of Venice in September 1423, May 1431, October 1436, September 1442, and July 1447. He also played a heroic part in the final defense of Constantinople; according to Donald Nicol, he commanded a unit of 700 men stationed in the neighborhood of the Church of the Holy Apostles with his son-in-law Nikephoros Palaiologos, while Steven Runciman assigns him to a command of a portion of the Theodosian Walls next to the Sea of Marmora., drawing on the account of Makarios Melissenos, Chronicum majus; translated in Marios Phillipides, The Fall of the Byzantine Empire: A Chronicle by George Sphrantzes, 1401-1477 (Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1980), p. 111. Steven Runciman, The Fall of Constantinople, 1453 (Cambridge: University Press, 1969), p. 92 Demetrios' fate following the fall of Constantinople to Sultan Mehmet II's army is unclear. Du Cange writes that he and his son-in-law were killed defending the city; Steven Runciman writes that Demetrios was captured alive.Runciman, Fall of Constantinople, p. 141. Donald Nicol notes that a Demetrios Kantakouzenos is recorded as escaping from the fallen city, with his family and other refugees, on the ship of the Genoese admiral Zorzi Doria. Doria took them as far as Chios, where the Venetian captain Thomas Celsi gave them passage to Candia (modern Heraklion) in Crete. Nicol also mentions the record of the daughter of \\"one Demetrios Kantakouzenos and his wife Simonis Gadelina, called Maria\\" marrying Theodore, the son of Paul Palaiologos, in Corfu in November 1486. Nicol offers no information on the names of Demetrios Palaiologos Kantakouzenos' parents, although he states that Demetrios was the cousin of Emperor John VIII. The name of his wife has not come down to us, although he had a daughter who, as mentioned above, married Nikephoros Palaiologos, and Demetrios is presumed to be the father of a protostrator Kantakouzenos who was executed along with Loukas Notaras and Andronikos Palaiologos Kantakouzenos five days after the capture of the city.

History  Fifteen men began planning for Second Presbyterian Church in 1809. The Reverend Andrew Flinn organized the congregation to accommodate the growing congregation at First (Scots) Presbyterian Church on lower Meeting Street. The new church was built at 342 Meeting St., Charleston, South Carolina at the then substantial cost of $100,000, and on April 3, 1811, it was dedicated as \\"The Second Presbyterian Church of Charleston and Its Suburbs.\\" The land had been obtained from the Wragg family. An act of the state legislature authorized the holding of a public lottery to raise funds for the building. Second Presbyterian was included in an 1875 illustrated guide to Charleston. Second Presbyterian Church was photographed here in 1892.  Architecture  The church, built in the Jeffersonian style is the fourth oldest church structure in the city. The brothers James and John Gordon were both the builders and the architects. The church's steeple was not completed due to structural issues that developed in its tower. The church bell was given to the Confederacy in 1862 for use as cannon metal. Before the Civil War, the galleries were used by the church's more than 200 black members. The sanctuary was completely renovated after a fire in 1959. Situated on one of the highest points in the city, the church appeared on mariners' maps as \\"Flynn's Church,\\" so called after the first pastor. The Classic Revival sanctuary is stuccoed brick with two tiers of windows, a square tower with an octagonal belfry, and a tetra Tuscan portico. The size of the sanctuary presented a problem because it strained the voices of the ministers. Therefore, in 1833 the floor was raised three feet, the ceiling lowered sixteen feet, and the rear wall of the nave moved to enlarge the vestibule. In addition, side doors on the north and south were closed and pews were added. The pews used today were installed in 1849. Church pews were rented with the rental fee also purchasing a space in the cemetery plot. This custom ended in 1924, but the numbers on the pews remain.  Wragg Square  In front of the church is a long open space known as Wragg Square because it was dedicated to the public by the wealthy Wragg family from their extensive holdings in the neighborhood. In 1935, the city considered using Works Progress Administration funds to build a public auditorium on Wragg Square, but the church opposed the plans based on its long history as an open space. The auditorium was not built.

Real world signals, which are generally continuous time signals, have to be discretized (sampled) in order to ensure that digital systems can be used to process the signals. It is during this process of discretization where sampling comes into picture. Although there are many ways of obtaining a discrete representation of a continuous time signal, periodic sampling is by far the simplest scheme. Theoretically, sampling can be performed with respect to any set of points. But practically, sampling is carried out with respect to a set of points that have a certain algebraic structure. Such structures are called lattices.Ton Kalker,\\"On Multidimensional Sampling\\", Philip Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, chapter 4, section 4.2 Mathematically, the process of sampling an N-dimensional signal can be written as: :w(\\\\hat{t}) = w(V.\\\\hat{n}) where \\\\hat{t} is continuous domain M-dimensional vector (M-D) that is being sampled, \\\\hat{n} is an M-dimensional integer vector corresponding to indices of a sample, and V is an N X N Sampling Matrix.  Motivation  Multidimensional sampling provides the opportunity to look at digital methods to process signals. Some of the advantages of processing signals in the digital domain include flexibility via programmable DSP operations, signal storage without the loss of fidelity, opportunity for encryption in communication, lower sensitivity to hardware tolerances. Thus, digital methods are simultaneously both powerful and flexible. In many applications, they act as less expensive alternatives to their analog counterparts. Sometimes, the algorithms implemented using digital hardware are so complex that they have no analog counterparts. Multidimensional digital signal processing deals with processing signals represented as multidimensional arrays such as 2-D sequences or sampled images. Processing these signals in the digital domain permits the use of digital hardware where in signal processing operations are specified by algorithms. As real world signals are continuous time signals, multidimensional sampling plays a crucial role in discretizing the real world signals. The discrete time signals are in turn processed using digital hardware to extract information from the signal.  Preliminaries = Region of Support  The region outside of which the samples of the signal take zero values is known as the Region of support (ROS). From the definition, it is clear that the region of support of a signal is not unique.  Fourier transform  The Fourier transform is a tool that allows us to simplify mathematical operations performed on the signal. The transform basically represents any signal as a weighted combination of sinusoids. The Fourier and the inverse Fourier transform of an M-dimensional signal can be defined as follows: :X_a(\\\\hat\\\\Omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} ! x_a({\\\\hat{t}})e^{-j\\\\hat{\\\\Omega}^{T}\\\\hat t}d\\\\hat{t} :x_a(\\\\hat{t})= \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi^M}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} ! X(\\\\hat\\\\Omega)e^{(j\\\\hat{\\\\Omega}^{T}\\\\hat t)} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\hat{\\\\Omega} The cap symbol ^ indicates that the operation is performed on vectors. The Fourier transform of the sampled signal is observed to be a periodic extension of the continuous time Fourier transform of the signal. This is mathematically represented as: :X(\\\\omega)= \\\\frac{1}{det(V)}\\\\sum_k! X_a(\\\\hat\\\\Omega-Uk ) where \\\\omega=\\\\tilde V\\\\Omega and U=2\\\\pi \\\\tilde V is the periodicity matrix where ~ denotes matrix transposition. Thus sampling in the spatial domain results in periodicity in the Fourier domain.  Aliasing  Aliasing of a bandlimited signal A band limited signal may be periodically replicated in many ways. If the replication results in an overlap between replicated regions, the signal suffers from aliasing. Under such conditions, a continuous time signal cannot be perfectly recovered from its samples. Thus in order to ensure perfect recovery of the continuous signal, there must be zero overlap multidimensional sampling of the replicated regions in the transformed domain. As in the case of 1-dimensional signals, aliasing can be prevented if the continuous time signal is sampled at an adequate sufficiently high rate.  Sampling density  It is a measure of the number of samples per unit area. It is defined as: : S.D = \\\\frac{1}{det(V)}=\\\\frac{det(U)}{4\\\\pi^2}. The minimum number of samples per unit area required to completely recover the continuous time signal is termed as optimal sampling density. In applications where memory or processing time are limited, emphasis must be given to minimizing the number of samples required to represent the signal completely.  Existing approaches  For a bandlimited waveform, there are infinitely many ways the signal can be sampled without producing aliases in the Fourier domain. But only two strategies are commonly used: rectangular sampling and hexagonal sampling.  Rectangular and Hexagonal sampling  Fourier domain representation with a rectangular ROS In rectangular sampling, a 2-dimensional signal, for example, is sampled according to the following V matrix: : V_{rect}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} T1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & T2 \\\\end{bmatrix} where T1 and T2 are the sampling periods along the horizontal and vertical direction respectively.Dan E. Dudgeon and Russell M. Mersereau, \\"Multidimensional Digital Signal Processing\\", Prentice Hall, 1984, chapter 1, pp. 43‚Äì44. Fourier domain representation with a hexagonal ROS In hexagonal sampling, the V matrix assumes the following general form: : V_{hex}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} T1 & T2 \\\\ T1 & -T2 \\\\end{bmatrix} The difference in the efficiency of the two schemes is highlighted using a bandlimited signal with a circular region of support of radius R. The circle can be inscribed in a square of length 2R or a regular hexagon of length \\\\frac{2R}{\\\\sqrt{3}}. Consequently, the region of support is now transformed into a square and a hexagon respectively. If these regions are periodically replicated in the frequency domain such that there is zero overlap between any two regions, then by periodically replicating the square region of support, we effectively sample the continuous signal on a rectangular lattice. Similarly periodic replication of the hexagonal region of support maps to sampling the continuous signal on a hexagonal lattice. From U, the periodicity matrix, we can calculate the optimal sampling density for both the rectangular and hexagonal schemes. It is found that in order to completely recover the circularly band-limited signal, the hexagonal sampling scheme requires 13.4% fewer samples than the rectangular sampling scheme. The reduction may appear to be of little significance for a 2-dimensional signal. But as the dimensionality of the signal increases, the efficiency of the hexagonal sampling scheme will become far more evident. For instance, the reduction achieved for an 8-dimensional signal is 93.8%. To highlight the importance of the obtained result , try and visualize an image as a collection of infinite number of samples. The primary entity responsible for vision, i.e. the photoreceptors (rods and cones) are present on the retina of all mammals.D.Phil Jonathan, T. Erichsen and J. Margaret Woodhouse,\\"Human and Animal Vision\\", Cardiff School of Optometry and Vision Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK These cells are not arranged in rows and columns. By adapting a hexagonal sampling scheme, our eyes are able to process images much more efficiently. The importance of hexagonal sampling lies in the fact that the photoreceptors of the human vision system lie on a hexagonal sampling lattice and, thus, perform hexagonal sampling. In fact, it can be shown that the hexagonal sampling scheme is the optimal sampling scheme for a circularly band-limited signal.D. P. Petersen and D. Middleton, \\"Sampling and Reconstruction of Wave-Number-Limited Functions in N-Dimensional Euclidean Spaces\\", Information and Control, vol. 5, pp. 279‚Äì323, 1962.  Applications = Aliasing effects minimized by the use of optimal sampling grids  Recent advances in the CCD technology has made hexagonal sampling feasible for real life applications. Historically, because of technology constraints, detector arrays were implemented only on 2-dimensional rectangular sampling lattices with rectangular shape detectors. But the super [CCD] detector introduced by Fuji has an octagonal shaped pixel in a hexagonal grid. Theoretically, the performance of the detector was greatly increased by introducing an octagonal pixel. The number of pixels required to represent the sample was reduced and there was significant improvement in the Signal-to- Noise Ratio (SNR) when compared with that of a rectangular pixel. But the drawback of using hexagonal pixels is that the associated fill factor will be less than 82%. An alternative method would be to interpolate hexagonal pixels in such a manner that we ultimately end up with a rectangular grid. The Spot 5 satellite incorporates a similar technique where two identical linear CCD's transmit two quasi-identical images that are shifted by half a pixel. On interpolating the two images and processing them, the functioning of a detector with a hexagonal pixel is mimicked.  Hexagonal structure for Intelligent vision  One of the major challenges encountered in the field of computer graphics is to represent the real world continuous signal as a discrete set of points on the physical screen. It has been long known that hexagonal sampling grids have several benefits compared to rectangular grids. Peterson and Middleton investigated sampling and reconstruction of wave number limited M dimensional functions and came to the conclusion that the optimal sampling lattice, in general, is not hexagonal. Russell M. Mersereau developed hexagonal discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and hexagonal finite extent impulse response filters. He was able to show that for circularly bandlimited signals, hexagonal sampling is more efficient than rectangular sampling. Cramblitt and Allebach developed methods for designing optimal hexagonal time-sequential sampling patterns and discussed their merits relative to those designed for a rectangular sampling grid. R. M. Cramblitt and J. P. Allebach, ‚ÄúAnalysis of time-sequential sampling with a spatially hexagonal lattice,‚Äù J. Opt. Soc. Am., vol. 73, p. 1510, June, 1983. Distance between successive samples One of the unique features of a hexagonal sampling grid is that its Fourier transform is still hexagonal. There is also an inverse relationship between the distance between successive rows and columns (assuming the samples are located at the centre of the hexagon). This inverse relationship plays a huge role in minimizing aliasing and maximizing the minimum sampling density. Quantization error is bound to be present when discretizing continuous real world signals. Experiments have been performed to determine which detector configuration will yield the least quantization error. Hexagonal spatial sampling was found to yield the least quantization error for a given resolution of the sensor. Consistent connectivity of hexagonal grids: In a hexagonal grid, we can define only a background of 6 neighborhood samples. However, in a square grid, we can define a background of 4 or 8 neighborhood samples (if diagonal connectivity is permitted). Because of the absence of such a choice in Hexagonal grids, efficient algorithms can be designed. Consistent connectivity is also responsible for better angular resolution. This is why hexagonal lattice is much better at representing curved objects than the rectangular lattice. Despite of these several advantages, hexagonal grids have not been used practically in computer vision to its maximum potential because of the lack of hardware to process, capture and display hexagonal based images. As highlighted earlier with the Spot 5 satellite, one of the methods being looked at to overcome this hardware difficulty is to mimic hexagonal pixels using square pixels.

Last Clear Chance was distributed by Union Pacific in 1959, and was circulated widely in the years that followed. It was well received by safety workers. The film was featured in a 1993 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Clips from the film were used in the 2004 film Panorama Ephemera. A copy of the film is preserved in the Prelinger Archives, where it is able to be downloaded or streamed online free of charge. Plot Idaho police officer Hal Jackson (William Boyett) arrives at the funeral for young Frank Dixon, Jr. (Bill Agee), who has died in a car accident. Hal, a friend of the Dixon family, does not go inside, feeling it would be too difficult to take. Hal finds it hard to believe that, only a few days ago, the Dixons were a relatively regular family. In flashback, he recounts what led to Frank Jr.'s death. Frank Jr. has returned home for the summer to aid his father, Frank Sr. (Harold Agee), on the family farm. He also visits his girlfriend Betty Hutchins (Christine Lynch). When Frank Sr.'s new tractor arrives at the local train station, Frank Jr.'s brother Alan (Tim Bosworth) wishes to drive it, having recently taken a driver's test. His father disallows it, so Frank Jr. drives it home. The next day, Alan discovers that his license has arrived in the mail. Ecstatic, he wishes to drive immediately, asking his family members if they need help with any errands. Later, Hal shows up at the Dixon home. Knowing that Alan's license had been scheduled to arrive, he begins to talk to Alan, telling him about things he should know in order to be able to drive safely, the primary emphasis being on railroad crossings: heeding signal lights, listening for train horns and being wary around double-track crossings. As Jackson finishes giving the advice, Frank Jr. and Betty return home. Alan asks his father if he can drive the car into town. His father lets him, and Frank Jr. and Betty agree to go with him to make sure he arrives safely. Alan begins driving the car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a railroad with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right into the path of the train and are struck off-camera. In the aftermath, the car is wrecked on its side, a sheet is pulled over Frank‚Äôs nearby body, and Betty is on a gurney and being loaded into the rear of an ambulance by somber medics. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, determined to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring, notably in the name of convenient law breaking. While the primary focus is on driver safety near railroad crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic look back at the early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways‚Äîin the late 1950s still a relatively new concept‚Äîweren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his point is that the human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded. Production The entire film is in the public domain, as a copyright was never registered. Last Clear Chance was produced and directed by Robert Carlisle. The production was supervised by Francis B. Lewis, who was the Union Pacific Railroad's Director of Safety and Courtesy. Assistance on research for the film was provided by staff of the National Safety Council. A note at the end of the film gives thanks to the Idaho State Police, the Colorado State Patrol, and their respective staffs for \\"their unstinted cooperation and assistance in making this film.\\" The film features William Boyett as police officer Hal Jackson. Frank Dixon, Sr. is played by Harold Agee, while his wife Suzanne (billed only as \\"Mrs. Harold Agee\\") plays the role of Mrs. Dixon. Future corporate executive William Agee, Harold's real- life son, plays Frank Dixon, Jr. with Christine Lynch appearing as his girlfriend, Betty Hutchins. Tim Bosworth was cast as Alan Dixon, and Lou Spraker plays the grandfather. The film, written by Leland Baxter, features a scenario that was inspired by a real-life family. Bert Spielvogel served as the cinematographer for Last Clear Chance, with Peter Norman working as assistant cameraman. Shot in Kodachrome.

Mort Fallick was the film's editor. Made five years after The Days of Our Years, another Union Pacific Railroad-sponsored safety film, Last Clear Chance was produced by Wondsel, Carlisle and Dunphy, Inc. in order to inform young drivers how to make sure to avoid accidents. Archivist, author, and filmmaker Rick Prelinger notes that the film also includes other themes, such as \\"a teen‚Äôs feeling of invulnerability, the police officer as authority figure, and the train‚Äôs dual role as economic partner and potential killer.\\" Prelinger believes that \\"longer films aspire to higher goals, and one way to achieve these goals is to pack them with hints of meaning in many directions.\\" Release and legacy Last Clear Chance was originally distributed only in western states that were served by Union Pacific. It was released in 16 mm film, and by 1960 was described as being \\"shown widely in all sections of the country.\\" A copyright on the film was not registered, and it is in the public domain under Public Domain Mark 1.0. A copy of the film is in the Prelinger Archives, and as such it is available to be freely downloaded or streamed from the Internet Archive. The film was received positively by many people who worked in the safety industry, with it being reported that many of them considered it to be \\"the most moving and hard-hitting educational film on highway grade crossing accident prevention and traffic safety in recent years.\\" It received an award at a national safety film contest. Rick Prelinger described the film as being \\"engaging\\" and opined that it was a \\"skillful drama.\\" Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict branded the film as \\"hyper somber\\" and wrote that \\"we learn, finally, why reckless driving, trains, and painful automotive accidents don't mix. The question everyone keeps asking is 'Why don't they look?' The answer is simple. They're dopes!\\" Rick Prelinger used clips from Last Clear Chance in his film Panorama Ephemera. Last Clear Chance was featured in an episode of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000. Last Clear Chance appeared in the twentieth episode of the fifth season, which was originally broadcast on December 18, 1993. Last Clear Chance became a \\"huge hit\\" thanks to its appearance on the show, and it has been described as one of the \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000 favorites.\\" Actor and writer Kevin Murphy, who plays Tom Servo on the show, opined that Last Clear Chance \\"is right up there with my all-time favorite shorts.\\" Rhino Entertainment has released the segment featuring Last Clear Chance on VHS, as part of Mystery Science Theater 3000 - Shorts Volume 2. Shorts Volume 2 was later re-released on DVD in 2003, as part of Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection, Volume 3.

Members * Rock ‚Äì Samuel LaRoquette was an African-American born to a low-income inner city family. This fueled his desire to see the natural world, where he grew into an explorer who survived all Earth's ecosystems, then gained an academic career with that acclaim. However, he became involved with a student and angrily punched the university dean when confronted about this. He then got a job with Argo Industries, but his headstrong attitude during a petroleum expedition overruled recommendations to retreat, where an earthquake killed two of his men. LaRoquette finally joined Hulkbusters along with Craig Saunders, but both men struggled with amnesia after Nick Fury shut down the unit, where they eventually fell in with Samuel Sterns. Leader coated his body with pliable stone, giving his body a near-indestructible exoskeleton. His name \\"Rock\\" referred to his earlier love of nature, as well as the opposite of his unchecked prior temper. * Redeemer ‚Äì Craig Saunders Jr. was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D as an advisor alongside Sam LaRoquette where they were manipulated by the enhanced Leader into becoming his brainwashed pawn. He originally was a US Army officer specializing in explosive ordinance disposal. Per chance at an airport terminal he detected a terrorist bomb hidden in an unattended briefcase and kicked it into a ladies' room, failing to realize a young woman and her infant daughter were inside when it detonated. The resulting bad publicity ruined Saunders' military career, and he hoped to atone for his mistake by joining the Hulkbusters, hence his name \\"Redeemer\\". * Hotshot ‚Äì Louis Lembert is a high school athlete and the boyfriend of Jessie Harrison who was mutated by the gamma bomb where he sported green skin and yellow hair. He can project energy bolts from his hands. When his girlfriend's powers got out of control, Hotshot had no choice but to kill her to save his fellow Riot Squad members. He was later taken into police custody, but committed suicide in his jail cell out of grief for killing Jailbait. * Jailbait ‚Äì Jessica Harrison is the girlfriend of Louis Lembert who was mutated by the gamma bomb where she sported green skin and an increased bust size, and outfitted herself in a leotard. Before the gamma bomb detonated she was a teenager in an unauthorized relationship with the slightly older Louis Lembert, and had planned to elope with Lembert to flee her parents (who were immediately killed in the blast). She can create energy cages around what she sees, but her powers eventually got so out of control she proved a threat to friend and foe alike, and was killed by her paramour Hotshot. * Ogress ‚Äì Diana Davids is a lawyer who was mutated by the gamma bomb where it gave her green skin, a large muscular physique, and excessive body hair. She possesses superhuman strength and invulnerability. * Omnibus ‚Äì Burt Horowitz is a traveling encyclopedia salesman who was mutated by the gamma bomb where he gained green skin and a tall head. He possesses superhuman intelligence, and 'any super-power he already believes he has'. * Soul Man ‚Äì Jason McCall is a priest who was mutated by the gamma bomb where he gained green skin, but in later editions he reverted to his original skin color. Before the gamma bomb went off, Jason was due to stand trial for embezzlement of tithing funds of the church he ministered. His transformation made him a near-omnipotent being who can recall people from death, but he must keep his concentration to do so.

When he was young, Shin Kyong-rim frequented the people of Korea's rural villages and collected the traditional songs they sang. Much of his poetry represents a modernization of things he heard then Shin Kyeong-nim graduated in English Literature from Dongguk University, from which time he strove to become a creative writer. In 1955 and 1956, he made his formal literary debut with the publication of poems \\"Day Moon\\" (Natdal), \\"Reeds\\" (Galdae) and \\"Statue of Stone\\" (Seoksang). He taught elementary school in his hometown for a period of time, before moving to Seoul to work as an editor for Hyundae munhak and Donghwa Publishers. But his strong desire to create poetry continued. Work Shin, widely known as a poet of the people, has literally spent decades writing verse on basically one subject: the life and people of Korean farming villages. Although the focus of his debut works, \\"Reed‚Äù (Galdae) and \\"Graveside Epitaph‚Äù (Myobi) is not restricted to the lives of farmers, the bulk of his remaining poems do treat of that particular topic. The poems of his first collection, Farmer's Dance (Nongmu, 1975), are coherent in their depiction of the actualities of farming life but retain a certain sense of poetic lyricism that lends them a measure of grace. While Shin's poetry is largely concerned with farmers and farming villages, he makes a great deal of effort to present them in their full historical and social context. And although he does treat of trials and travails of the farmers and village people, the works are usually firmly based in sense of warm and placid emotion. Generally speaking, Shin Gyeongrim's poetry tends to display less of the pent-up anger and violent protest of the workers' poems by other poets, but it doesn't not necessarily follow that Shin's farmer poems hold no significant message. In fact, the farming villages present in most of his poems can easily be understood as symbols for the national community, and, symbols aside, the same grievances that Shin sets forth in his poetry on behalf of his farmers could easily be extended to cover the grievances of the other laboring classes as well, with little to no stretch of the imagination. Always taking the side of the poor and oppressed, Shin displays more of a solemn ideology than a refined artistry, and composes verses reminiscent of folk songs in form and in that they are readily accessible to all readers. Shin actually did borrow some technical elements from traditional Korean folk songs, such as the familiar rhythm of four beats and the patterns of repetition and refrain. Shin's various poetry collections, such as The Pass (Saejae), A Folksong Travel Diaries (Minyo Gihaeng), The South Han River (Namhangang), and The Path (Gil), further reveal his love of things Korean, and take as their subjects Korean folk songs and places. In particular, the narrative poem ‚ÄúThe South Han River‚Äù (Namhangang) is an active attempt to observe history with farmers as the protagonists. It is an extensive work that displays an epic scale. His prizes include the Han Yong-un literature prize, awarded in 1974 for Nongmu (Farmers' dance), the Korean literature writers award in 1981, the Isan literature prize in 1990, and the Ho-Am Prize 2009 Works in translation * Variations: Three Korean Poets (3Ïù∏ ÏãúÏÑ†-ÏÇ¨ÎûëÏùò Î≥ÄÏ£ºÍ≥°) * Farmers' Dance (ÎÜçÎ¨¥) * A love song for the earnest (Ïã†Í≤ΩÎ¶º ÏãúÏÑ†Ïßë) * „Äé„É©„ÇØ„ÉÄ„Å´‰πó„Å£„Å¶„ÄèÁî≥Â∫öÊûóË©©ÈÅ∏ÈõÜ (Ïã†Í≤ΩÎ¶º ÏãúÏÑ†Ïßë ‚ÄòÎÇôÌÉÄÎ•º ÌÉÄÍ≥†‚Äô) * Le r√™ve d'un homme abattu (Ïì∞Îü¨ÏßÑ ÏûêÏùò Íøà) Works in Korean (partial) Poetry Collections * Let's Cross Over the Moon, (Dal neomse, 1985) * A Poor Love Song (Gananhan salangnolae, 1988) * Dreams of the Fallen (Sseurujin Ja-ui kkum, 1993.

The movie first released on the Hallmark Channel on December 2, 2012 and stars Teri Polo, Paul Essiembre, and Ty Wood. The film's premise follows a group of neighbors that come together to help provide emotional support for a teenage boy that needs a heart transplant. Plot The neighbors along Arthur Avenue in Cleveland have a forty-year tradition of lining their quaint street with Christmas luminaria. However, one year the tradition is placed on hold out of respect for the Normans (Ann and Mike), whose son Matt is seriously ill and in need of a heart transplant. The situation causes their younger son, Tommy, to emotionally withdraw. In Detroit, a man expecting his first child suddenly dies. His heart is found to be a match for Matt; however, a lack of transportation threatens to keep it from getting to Cleveland. Finally, a small plane is found (a two-seater which must now carry three people: the pilot, a nurse carrying the heart, and a surgeon dressed as Santa), but is unable to land due to a blizzard arriving in Cleveland. Meanwhile, the donor's wife goes into labor back in Detroit. Tommy refuses to believe that Matt is going to die, and decides he's going to light the luminaria (with the help of Bob, a neighbor known along the street as somewhat pessimistic). Between them all the luminaria are lit, which provides a surprise - the small plane sees the lit street and manages to land the plane on it (at that same time the donor's wife gives birth), eventually getting the heart to the Cleveland Clinic and transplanted into Matt.

His sister Patricia Heaton remembered the script Heaton had written and sent a copy of his treatment to Hallmark, who purchased the treatment and the script. Filming for The Christmas Heart took place in Winnipeg, Manitoba during March 2012. Due to the unseasonably warm weather in Winnipeg, the film crew had to make snow to make it look \\"like winter\\", but was also able to find \\"a snow bank in the parking lot of a church\\". Reception Critical reception was mixed to positive, and the Christian Film Database stated that they found the film \\"very touching\\". A reviewer for the Philadelphia Inquirer remarked that the film \\"[followed the] made-for-TV Christmas formula\\" and that it \\"would work better if we were a little more invested in young Matt and his survival\\", but that the ending was satisfying. The Akron Beacon Journal also commented that the film held \\"no surprises\\" but that \\"If you are willing to surrender to its unabashed sentimentality, you may find reason for a sniffle or two, and maybe a reason to smile at the end\\".

She participated in one major battle during the Gunboat War between Britain and Denmark. After the war she served at Saint Helena for five or six years. On her return to Britain in 1820 she was laid up; she was finally sold in 1833. Career Commander William Hellard commissioned Podargus in September 1808 for the Downs. On 15 August 1809, Podarguss master and a master's mate arrived at the French prisoner-of-war prison at Verdun. The master's mate escaped in 1813, but it is not clear how the men came to be captured. On 19 August 1809 Podargus captured the Fortuna. Three days later she recaptured the Margaretha. was in sight for the recapture of the Margretha. Podargus also carried Major General Broderick and his suite to Corunna. Commander John Lloyd recommissioned Podargus in November 1810. On 2 December Podargus was on station off Boulogne when her crew retrieved an abandoned, swamped Dutch boat. The boat had to be over-turned to bring her on board Podargus, but even so, money was found aboard her, amounting to 13 gold guineas, four half-guineas, and some silver French coins.Edinburgh Annual Register, (December 1810), Vol. 3, p.242. Then in October 1811 Commander John Bradley replaced Lloyd. Commander William Robilliard commissioned Podargus in November 1811 for the Baltic. On 4 October 1812 Podargus captured the Danish sloop Speculation and shared the prize money with , , and by agreement. Then on 17 October Persian and Erebus were again in company with Podargus when Podargus captured the Danish vessels Anna Maria, Twende Brodre, and two market-boats. Next month, on 11 November Podargus captured Syerstadt, with Persian and Erebus in company. Napoleonic Wars Battle of Lyng√∏r In 1812, during the Gunboat War, the British saw an opportunity to enforce the blockade and break the back of Dano- Norwegian seapower. They therefore sent a small squadron consisting of the 64-gun Third Rate ship-of-the-line (Captain James Patteson Stewart), and three brigs, the 18-gun Cruizer class brig-sloop (Commander Weir), Podargus, and the 14-gun gun-brig (Lieutenant Thomas England), to seek out the Danes. On 6 July 1812, the squadron was off the island of Merd√∏ on the coast of Norway, when the squadron sighted and chased a Danish squadron. Robilliard and Podargus led the British attack because she had a man onboard who had sailed in those waters some time ago; nevertheless, she grounded. During the subsequent Battle of Lyng√∏r Flamer stayed with her to protect her. However, Dictator and Calypso succeeded in destroying the new, 40-gun frigate Najaden and badly damaging the 18-gun brigs Laaland, Sams√∏e, and Kiel, as well as a number of gunboats. The British captured and tried to take out Laaland and Kiel but abandoned them when they grounded. The British did not set fire to either as the Norwegian vessels still had their crews and wounded aboard. The action cost Dictator five killed and 24 wounded, Calypso three killed, one wounded and two missing, Podargus nine wounded, and Flamer one killed and one wounded. Najaden lost 133 dead and 82 wounded and the Danes acknowledged losing some 300 men killed and wounded overall. Commander Weir received immediate promotion to post-captain; Robilliard received his promotion on 14 December; Dictators first lieutenant, William Buchanan, received promotion to commander.James (1837), Vol. 4, pp.53-4. In 1847 the surviving British participants were authorized to apply for the clasp \\"Off Mardoe 6 July 1812\\" to the Naval General Service Medal. Several days later the British sent the cutter Nimble to reconnoiter the situation. Nimble reported seeing four vessels at Christiansand, two of 18 guns and two of 16 guns. Nimble also saw numerous gunboats about. The Battle of Lyng√∏r effectively ended the Gunboat War. Commander George Rennie replaced Robilliard in January 1813. Podargus then served under Viscount Keith in the Channel and in the Royal Navy's Bordeaux operations. On 21 March 1814, Rear- admiral Penrose, in the 74-gun , anchored in the Gironde with a squadron that included Podargus. On 2 April the boats of captured one gun-brig, six gun- boats, one armed schooner, three chasse-mar√©es, and an imperial barge. They burned one gun-brig, two gun-boats, and one chasse-mar√©e.James (1837), Vol. 6, pp.258-9. The squadron shared the subsequent prize money. Two days later, the 74-gun joined Egmont to prepare for to attack the French 74-gun R√©gulus, three brig-corvettes, other vessels lying near her, and the batteries that protected them. Before the British could launch their attack, the French burnt R√©gulus and the other vessels. Between June and August 1814, Podargus was under the temporary command of Commander Houston Stewart. Commander James Wallis then recommissioned her.Wallis had been aboard when the French captured her in 1804. He spent almost ten years in captivity before escaping from Verdun in 1813. The captain of Vincejo had died in captivity in 1804 under suspicious circumstances. On 9 July 1815, Podargus captured the French vessel Deux Amis. Post-war Wallis sailed Podargus to St. Helena. Napoleon Bonapart, though denying any involvement in Captain Wright's death, apparently was quite angry at Wallis being appointed to St Helena, viewing the appointment as a deliberate British provocation. In April 1817, the transport brig , belonging to the Cape Town Dockyard, was the first European vessel to enter the Knysna. She struck a rock, now known as Emu Rock, and was holed. Her crew ran Emu ashore to prevent her sinking. In late April Podargus arrived to render assistance. After surveying the area, Wallis sailed Podargus into the Knysna and retrieved Emus cargo.Asiatic Journal and Monthly Miscellany, (1818), Vol. 6, p.317. Commander Henry John Rous recommissioned Podargus at St Helena in November 1817. In January 1819, while Podargus was still at St Helena, the London Gazette reported that Parliament had voted a grant to all those who had served under the command of Admiral Viscount Keith in 1812, between 1812 and 1814, and in the Gironde. Podargus was listed among the vessels that had served under Keith in 1813 and 1814. She had also served under Kieth in the Gironde. Lieutenant James Webb Cairnes was appointed to replace Rous in 1818, however, he did not take command until 1819. Cairnes had been first lieutenant of .Naval Chronicle, Vol. 39, p.342. Rous was still in command of Podargus when he wrote a letter on 29 March 1819 to Admiral Robert Plampin, extolling the virtues of Hout Bay, 14 miles from Cape Town, as the site of a dockyard. Fate By 1820 Podargus was back in Britain and laid up in ordinary at Portsmouth. The Admiralty offered her for sale on 7 August 1833, still at Portsmouth. She was sold on that day to Mr. John Small Sedger, Rotherhithe, for ¬£510 for breaking up.

Biography Born in Connecticut in 1936, Lawder attended Williams College and the National Autonomous University of Mexico as an undergraduate, and studied at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. While at the University of Munich, he became a test subject for a neurologist researching phosphenes at around 1960. During these experiments, he was injected with measured amounts of LSD, mescaline and psilocybin, and \\"spent a whole day in the clinic\\". In this, he became an early subject of psychedelics. Afterwards, he received his doctor of philosophy as an art historian at Yale University. His thesis, which was later published as The Cubist Cinema, examines the correlation between the history of film and its impact on modern art, described as a holistic overview by Anthony Reveaux in Film Quarterly. His body of work is purported to span over 25 films and his literary works encapsulates several essays on experimental film. His first endeavors with experimental films started in his basement during a sabbatical of his in the late 1960s and early 1970s. One of his works during this span, Necrology, has been cited by fellow filmmaker Hollis Frampton as \\"the sickest joke I've ever seen on film\\". For several decades Standish ran a Community Non-Profit Darkroom called the Denver Darkroom. It began as Standish's dream workspace which he cordially extended to visiting Filmmakers, Artists, Journalists and Friends. It was an artistic hotspot housing a large commercial-size black and white darkroom, studios, a library, a kitchen, a dining room/ gallery and sleeping lofts/ prop storage. The demand for the community darkroom was huge and it became a non-profit in 1998, accepting paid memberships to cover operating costs. Beginning in 2000 classes in Photography were offered by Artists and faculty of Metropolitan State College of Denver (now MSU) at the Denver Darkroom. Lawder's wife, Ursula, was the daughter of Richard Strauss- Ruppel and Frieda Ruppel, who later married Dadaist artist Hans Richter. Lawder died in 2014. Inventions For the production of his first two films, Runaway and Corridor, Lawder built his own contact printer using an incandescent light bulb housed within a coffee can.

Biography Bolizza was born in Kotor, at the time part of the Republic of Venice (now Montenegro). He studied at the University of Padua and, having embraced a priestly life, moved to Venice where he became a secretary of nuncio Giovanni Battista Agucchi. Bolizza wrote Agucchi's funeral oration with a dedication to his mentor Claude de Mesmes, comte d'Avaux, the French ambassador to the Republic of Venice. A member of the Bolizza family, his ancestor and family progenitor was Zuane Bolizza, mentioned in 1538.

Many of the Eastern Orthodox Christians in Guatemala are ethnic Mayans. Although the dominant religion in Guatemala is historically Roman Catholicism, in recent decades other Christian denominations have gained adherents there. Eastern Orthodox Christianity in particular has been growing rapidly, as a number of schismatic Catholic groups have expressed their desire to become Eastern Orthodox and have been received under the jurisdiction of Eastern Orthodox hierarchs. Currently, there are two distinct Eastern Orthodox communities in Guatemala, the Antiochian and the Constantinopolitan. Antiochian Eastern Orthodox Christianity arrived in Guatemala at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century with immigrants from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. In the 1980s two Catholic women, Mother In√©s and Mother Mar√≠a, converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity and established a monastery dedicated to the Holy Trinity. In 1992 they were received into the Antiochian Patriarchate and in 1995 the Catholic Apostolic Orthodox Antiochian Church in Guatemala was formally established. The state orphanage of Hogar Rafael Ayau, established in 1857, was privatized and transferred to their care in 1996. The Antiochian Eastern Orthodox Church in Guatemala is part of the Antiochian Patriarchate's Archdiocese of Mexico, Venezuela, Central America and the Caribbean. Its first temple was dedicated in 1997. On 5 November 2017, the Monastery of the Holy Trinity, referenced above, and the associated orphanage, Hogar Rafael Ayau, were canonically transferred from the Orthodox Church of Antioch to the Serbian Orthodox Church, His Eminence Amfilohije, Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral and the Administrator of South-Central America himself coming to Amatitl√°n to greet Mother In√©s. http://www.spc.rs/eng/serbian_orthodox_church_central_america_got_new_monastery retrieved 04/06/2018 Constantinopolitan A different, mostly indigenous Mayan, group was accepted into the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 2010. This had been a group which was part of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal movement and had rocky relations with the Roman Catholic Church. Eventually, the group's leader, Father Andr√©s Gir√≥n, who had previously served as a congressional representative, as a senator in 1991 and as an ambassador to the United Nations, left the Roman Catholic Church over tensions related to his support for land reform and their support for \\"liturgical reform\\". Gir√≥n and his followers, who numbered between 100,000 and 200,000, first joined the Society of clerks secular of Saint Basil, and later moved towards Orthodoxy, being received into the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 2010. According to Father Peter Jackson, this may well be the largest mass- conversion to Orthodoxy since the Christianization of Kievan Rus' in 988. The Orthodox Church promptly sent missionaries to Guatemala to educate and catechize the newfound converts. The membership estimates for Gir√≥n's group vary widely. Various self-reported figures were published: 120,000 members in 2004, then 550,000 members (of which 5,000 were Greek) in 2015. Jesse Brandow, one of the Orthodox missionaries in Guatemala, estimates that there are \\"roughly 40,000 people and 100 parishes\\" and that \\"it is one of the largest mass conversions in the history of Orthodox Christianity.\\" He also reports that there is a great need for additional priests, and that \\"the people self- identify as Orthodox and are generally eager to learn, but they are still at the very beginning of a long process of transition.\\" NotesReferences See also  * History of the Eastern Orthodox Church * History of Eastern Christianity * Mayan religion * Western Rite Orthodoxy  External links  * Abba Seraphim: Orthodox Mission In The Twenty-First Century: Guatemala * Introducing Mayan Orthodoxy.

(Although Percival Brookfield had been killed and Thomas Ley murdered several political opponents.http://www.theage.com.au/comment/arthur-calwell-how- dodging-the-bullet-spared-the-people-20140618-zsda8.html) Assassination attempt Arthur Calwell in 1966 On the evening of 21 June 1966, while campaigning for the 1966 federal election, Arthur Calwell addressed an anti- conscription rally at Mosman Town Hall in Sydney. Senator Douglas McClelland described the meeting as \\"quite a rowdy one\\", although Calwell himself stated it was \\"without incident\\". Peter Kocan, a 19-year-old factory worker, stood waiting in the town hall's lobby. At some point he left to retrieve a sawn-off .22 caliber rifle that he had hidden on the grounds of a nearby Methodist church; he concealed it under his overcoat. He later told police that he had sawn off the barrel and stock the night before, as it was too big to fit under his coat. The meeting concluded at about 10:45 p.m., after which Calwell walked to the waiting Commonwealth car to be driven back to his hotel. He sat in the front passenger seat next to the driver Frederick Smith. Calwell usually travelled with his car window open, but it was closed when Kocan shot at him from point-blank range. According to Calwell, \\"there was an exploding sound coming from my left and the glass in the front nearside window shattered and I felt a stinging sensation to the front of my face in the vicinity of my chin\\". The bullet shattered the window before coming to rest in the left lapel of Calwell's coat. He received a number of wounds to his face from the shattered glass and bullet fragments, and his shirt was \\"badly blood-stained\\". Calwell re-entered the town hall briefly to telephone his wife, and was then driven to Royal North Shore Hospital where he spent the night. He was released the following evening. Kocan attempted to flee, but was restrained by members of the crowd, including Bob Gould, Barry Robinson, Wayne Haylen (son of Les Haylen). The police said Kocan told them after his arrest: > Unless I did something out of the ordinary I realized I would remain a > nobody all my life. I came to the conclusion that however hard it was I > would have to do something that would set me apart from other nobodies. I > would not have done anything so cruel as shoot someone if I had any > alternative. That's why I shot Mr Calwell. I'm sorry I caused pain to Mr > Calwell... I went there with that intention [to shoot him] and when I fired > a shot I didn't care if I hit him or not. I just wanted to get it over > with... When I read an advertisement in the paper last Saturday about the > meeting... [The rifle was ..] was too bulky. If I was going to assassinate > anyone like Mr Kennedy from a window it would have been all right, but it > was too bulky to conceal under any clothing... I stood in the lobby of the > town hall. I just waited for Mr Calwell to come out, and he came out and > talked to various people, and then he went towards his car talking to other > people. He got into his car; time was running out.

I wanted to > assassinate some public figure. I did not agree with Mr Calwell's politics > and that made it easier to choose him. Kocan later reflected, \\"the shooting logic was in the air at the time\\", pointing to the assassinations of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, John F. Kennedy, Hendrik Verwoerd and Malcolm X. \\"Unfortunately, we are creatures who pick up on what's around\\", he said. \\"If it had been a different era, my actions may have been different... Insofar as I had any thoughts about what would happen after the shooting, I assumed I'd be cut down in a hail of bullets.\\"http://users.tpg.com.au/waldrenm/kocan.html Sentencing Kocan was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The presiding judge Leslie Herron ruled that: > It is necessary for me to pass such a sentence to deter any other person > from even considering an attempt upon the life and safety of our public > men... You have pleaded guilty to one of the most serious crimes in the > criminal calendar and the plain fact must be faced that on June 21 at Mosman > Town Hall a bullet fired by you lodged in the lapel of Mr Calwell's coat and > portion of it, with shattered glass, stuck in his chin.

But community in Australia does not want > the introduction of such criminal acts here. Public men in Australia must be > free to go about their important affairs of State without fear of danger to > life or limb. I must see that the law protects them to its utmost.

With the expansion of air travel in the 20th century, there were safety concerns about the ability of pilots and air traffic controllers to communicate. In 1951, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recommended in \\"ICAO Annex 10 ICAO (Vol I, 5.2.1.1.2) to the International Chicago Convention\\" that English be universally used for \\"international aeronautical radiotelephony communications.\\" Despite being a recommendation only, ICAO aviation English was widely accepted. Miscommunication has been an important factor in many aviation accidents. Examples include the Tenerife accident in 1977 (583 dead) and the 1996 Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision (349 dead). The crew of Avianca Flight 52 failed to impart their critical fuel emergency to air traffic controllers which led to their fatal crash (73 dead). ICAO has acknowledged that \\"communications, or the lack thereof, has been shown by many accident investigations to play a significant role\\". In 2003, the Organization \\"released amendments to annexes of its Chicago Convention requiring aviation professionals involved in international operations to demonstrate a defined level of English language proficiency in the context of aeronautical communications. ICAO requires that this level of proficiency is to be demonstrated by means of a formal language proficiency assessment, and that the results of this assessment are to be recorded as an endorsement on the professional licences of pilots and controllers.\\" ICAO has defined the language skills to be assessed in its Holistic Descriptors of Operational Language Proficiency (Appendix to Annex 1 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation), and has provided the means to describe the extent of proficiency in these skills in its Language Proficiency Rating Scale (Attachment to Annex 1 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation). The minimum level of proficiency in English required by pilots and air traffic controllers involved in international operations is that described at Operational Level 4 in this Scale. Although the language proficiency of L1 English aviation professionals may typically be considered to be equivalent to Expert Level 6 on the ICAO Scale, they may also be sub-standard communicators in Aviation English, prone to the use of non-standard terms, demonstrating impatience with non-native speakers, and speaking excessively, and too quickly. Such native speaker failings tend to worsen in emergency situations. Aviation English is a type of English for specific purposes, with several specific idiosyncratic structures: for example, any correction of a misspoken word must always be conveyed using the word \\"correction\\". Tests The need for specialised language proficiency assessments to allow pilots and controllers to demonstrate compliance with the revised 2008 ICAO language proficiency standards has led to the creation of a large number of Aviation English tests. Examples of such tests are the English Language Proficiency for Aeronautical Communication (ELPAC) by Eurocontrol, the Test of English for Aviation (TEA) by Mayflower College, UK, the Test of English for Aviation Personnel (TEAP) by Anglo-Continental School, UK, and the English for Aviation Language Testing System (EALTS) by LTAS Ltd, UK. While the ELPAC test for air traffic controllers (developed by Eurocontrol, in partnership with Zurich University of Applied Sciences/ZHAW) and ENOVATE) is currently the only test formally recognized by ICAO as being fully compliant with ICAO Doc 9835, the TEA, the TEAP, and the EALTS all have recognition from numerous National Aviation Authorities and licensing authorities, including the UK CAA, as being both ICAO Doc 9835 and EASA compliant. Language assessment bodies The testing of the Aviation English for pilots and air traffic controllers is provided by organisations termed 'Language Assessment Bodies' (LABs). The term Testing Service Provider (TSP) is also used with the same meaning. Around the world, language assessment bodies are approved by National Aviation Authorities (NAA) for the purpose of the testing of English for Aviation language proficiency.

Designed by Sid Lee and Gsmprjct¬∞, the Ajax Experience was an interactive experience which shared the philosophy of the club with the public, as well as bring the audience closer to the likes of Johan Cruijff, Marco van Basten or Wesley Sneijder. Various national and international trophies that were won by the club over the years were on public display as well. With an estimated 3,5 million to 4,5 million fans in the Netherlands, and even more abroad, the Ajax Experience aimed to cater to the various fans who not only frequent the Amsterdam ArenA or Sportpark De Toekomst, but also those who are visiting Amsterdam as a tourist destination who are not looking to deviate too far from the trusted central area near by frequented destinations such as Stopera, Joods Historisch Museum, Tunfun, or Artis. Location Situated on the famed Rembrandtsplein in Amsterdam-Centrum in a former ABN-AMRO banking facility, the 1,400 m2 space proved to be optimal to provide the needed room to supply an interactive experience which featured cinematic match summaries, while showcasing the overall successes and big names associated with the club on the historic downtown square. Dissolution On 23 July 2013 it was announced that Ajax would discontinue the Ajax Experience, citing a loss in revenue as the cause for the discontinuation of the establishment. The World of Ajax situated at the stadium would however continue to serve as a touristic function for the club, while the fanshop situated at the same location as the Experience remained open until 1 February 2014.

On the discovery of gold in Australia in 1851, Larnach, in conjunction with his colleagues, entered largely into the purchase of the precious metal on account of the Bank, and in 1852 doubled the capital out of profits. In the latter year he returned to England and became manager of the London branch, in the founding of which he was the active spirit.

Early life Wilson was born on February 16, 1886, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. He spent the first eleven years of his life on his family's farm in Charlottetown, where he began his work with horses. Before he reached his teens, Wilson's family moved to an apartment in Boston. Business Due to his family's economic circumstances, Wilson had to stop attending school after eight grade to take a job as a messenger boy at the Frost Forwarding Company. However, he was able to complete a three-year night school course in business at a local high school. After two or three years with the company, Wilson had moved up to the position of head clerk. While still in his teens he became foreman and assistant superintendent. When Wilson was 21, the firm's superintendent died and Wilson was chosen to succeed him. Three years later, Wilson joined the A. Towle Company, a larger competitor of Frost Forwarding, as an equal partner. Jockey Wilson was one of the top amateur harness racing drivers in the United States. He competed in Grand Circuit races in Avon, Connecticut, Goshen, New York, and Syracuse, New York. Track executive Wilson began his career as a track executive in 1917 as the owner and operator of Sage Park, a harness track in Windsor, Connecticut. Wilson turned the run-down track into one of the showplaces of harness racing in the 1920s. He created area's first $5,000 and $10,000 stake events for two- and three-year-olds as well as a $10,000 stakes for aged horses. Wilson's races attracted horsemen from as far away as St. Louis and Milwaukee. In July 1928 Wilson held a $25,000 Pacing Derby, which was won by Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame horse Grattan Bars. On January 12, 1921, Wilson was elected president of the Short Ship Circuit, a harness racing chain. From 1929 to 1935 he was president of the Bay State Light Harness Circuit. In 1932 Wilson played an instrumental role in bringing the Grand Circuit back to Rockingham Park. He served as manager of the meet, which was sponsored by the Boston Garden Corporation in connection with its New England States Fair. It was the first Grand Circuit meet at Rockingham since 1913. In 1933 he secured the rights to host The National and The Great American Stakes, two tune-up races for the Hambletonian Stakes, for Rockingham Park. On January 12, 1935, Wilson was elected vice president of Eastern Racing Association, Inc., a corporation formed to open the Suffolk Downs thoroughbred race track in East Boston. Six months later he was given the additional duty of managing director. He retained this post until it was abolished in December 1936. In 1939, Wilson was one of the financial backers of a proposed horse track in Natick, Massachusetts. In 1945, Wilson returned to Suffolk Downs as president and general manager. He remained in the position after the track was sold to a group led by John C. Pappas in 1946. On April 17, 1948, Wilson resigned as president and general manager. He was asked to stay on as chairman of the board, but declined because he wanted to cut down on his business and racing responsibilities. In 1950, Wilson was named vice president and general manager of Scarborough Downs. He was succeeded by Sidney M. Goldfine after the track's first season. Stable owner Wilson owned a horse stable based in Newton, Massachusetts. His son, Allan, Jr. was one of his drivers. Death Wilson died on October 27, 1963, in Dover, Massachusetts.

The Stone Fort dates to the Late Woodland period and was constructed and used in the period from c. AD 600‚Äì900; it is one of ten such sites known in Southern Illinois. All ten were constructed atop either promontories or hilltops; the Giant City site is in the former group, as it sits atop a sloped ridge. The purpose of these enclosures is unclear; while archaeologists originally theorized that they were military fortifications, the present archaeological consensus suggests that the sites were used as meeting places or ceremonial locations of some nature. The original stone wall of the fort was dismantled by European settlers in the region, who used the stone as a building material; the stone base is all that remains of the original wall. In 1934, the Civilian Conservation Corps reconstructed the wall while improving the state park. The first professional archaeological investigations of the site were conducted in 1956 by archaeologists from Southern Illinois University, while the first in-depth survey of the site took place in 2000‚Äì2001.

Uruguay joined IWS in 1970. The IWS was the overseas extension of the Australian Wool Corporation and eventually was merged into it. In 1997, IWS changed its name to The Woolmark Company. Since 2007, the Woolmark Company has been a subsidiary of Australian Wool Innovation Limited (AWI), a nonprofit organization that conducts research, development and marketing along the global supply chain for Australian wool on behalf of approximately 60,000 woolgrowers that cooperatively fund the company. History  In 1936, in response to the surge in the production of artificial fibres, such as rayon (now polyester), used in place of wool, woolgrowers in the three main woolgrowing countries, led by Australia, voted to impose a 6 pence levy for each wool bale produced, with the funds going to research and promotion. (Germany alone produced 9,200 tons of these artificial fibres in 1934, 19,600 tons in 1935 and 45,000 tons in 1936. It had been estimated that the production for 1937 would be 90,000 tons.)Artificial Wool Evening Post, Volume CXXIV, Issue 121, 18 November 1937, Page 27 On July 1 1937, they formed the International Wool Publicity and Research Secretariat, which was quickly renamed the International Wool Secretariat (IWS). Based in London, the IWS had offices in every major wool-producing country by the mid-1950s. In 1964, IWS developed and launched the Woolmark logo. In December 1993, the Australian Wool Corporation (formed in 1973) and the Wool Research and Development Corporation were merged to form the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation (AWRAP). https://www.acronymfinder.com/Australian-Wool-Research- and-Promotion-Organisation-(AWRAP).html International Wool Secretariat (IWS) and Australian Wool Innovation Limited (AWI) were subsidiaries of AWRAP. In 1997, IWS‚Äôs name was changed to The Woolmark Company Pty Ltd (TWC). In 2001, Australian Wool Services Limited (AWS) was formed to resolve 36 legacy issues stretching back more than 80 years through previous administrations, including AWRAP and its two subsidiaries. AWI was de-merged from AWS in 2002 and TWC was sold by AWS to AWI in 2007. What remained of AWS became Graziers‚Äô Investment Company Limited (GIC), which went into liquidation in October 2017, with A$20 million in its bank account.

A certification mark used on pure wool products that met the standard of quality set by IWS. The logo was launched in August 1964 after it had been selected following a 1963 competition won by Milanese Francesco Saroglia (most probably a pseudonym chosen by designer Franco Grignani). The two main objectives were to position wool at the top of the textile market and to ensure that products bearing the Woolmark label were made from pure new wool and manufactured to the highest standards. It was such a success it eventually ranked with a large scallop shell or three-pointed-star in terms of consumer recognition and understanding.Ted Henzell, Australian agriculture: its history and challenges. CSIRO Publishing,Australia, 2007. In 2011, British design magazine, Creative Review, declared the Woolmark number one of the top twenty logos of all time. International Woolmark Prize In 1953, IWS launched the International Woolmark Prize, with winners including Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld. The award continues to recognise outstanding designers across the globe. It was later suspended. The International Woolmark Prize was relaunched in 2012 by IWS‚Äôs successor, The Woolmark Company (TWC). The objective of the award is to generate long-term demand for Australian Merino wool by increasing the knowledge of and lifetime loyalty to the fibre amongst the competition‚Äôs designers around the globe.

His best known work is the symphonic poem Sardegna, a tribute to his native Sardinia, which premiered in Florence in 1933. Life and career Porrino was born in Cagliari and studied at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome. He later studied with Ottorino Respighi from 1932 to 1935. According to Alfredo Casella, he became one of Respighi's disciples, championing an Italian national music movement and openly opposing composers such as Casella, Dallapiccola, and Malipiero for their Modernist music.Slonimsky, Nicolas and Kuhn, Laura (2001). \\"Porrino, Ennio\\".

In the course of his career, Porrino taught at the conservatories of Rome, Venice, and Naples, and in 1956 became the director of the Cagliari Conservatory. That same year he married Malgari Onnis (born 1935), a painter and theatrical designer.

He was the president of the Munjangsa publishing company, and is presently a professor in the Department of Creative Writing at the Seoul Institute of the Arts.\\"Oh Kyu Won \\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: Work Oh Kyu Won's early poems use witty, sparkling, and ironic language in an effort to destroy established forms and provide a critique of the baseness and emptiness of capitalist consumer culture. Through the process of the endless deconstruction and regeneration of his poetic material, he refashioned everyday words and recognizable images in order to produce the ‚Äúunconsciousness of modernity,‚Äù and in doing so capture certain realities of everyday life particular features of our mental landscape that are generally passed by unnoticed. His poems thus derive strength from the quotidian, but only by recreating and reconceptualizing it. Irony is another of Oh's techniques adopted to criticize a false and fetishistic ideal world. By thus lifting aspects of the mundane and banal up to his scrutinizing eye, out of the fabric of our ‚Äúmodern unconsciousness,‚Äù he captures the contradictory and complex features of the modern petit bourgeois and helps us to rediscover our own lives. Oh's poems also demonstrate the influence of the fable and his fascination with the most common of words, which often serve him as elements of parody and ironic critique. Oh Kyu Won's work has attempted to demolish old conceptual frames and stale assumptions and to look at the world in its naked reality. In order to do this, Oh frequently uses the technique of reversal: :The coffin of the man asphyxiated by coal briquet gas :Passes through the gate of the apartment dragging two men along :A lilac tree steps out of the crowd of onlookers and leaves reality in the company of the coffin. Through such reversals of death and life, mobile and immobile, Oh tries to provide a fresh point of view, one that might even be characterized as Brechtian.

Habitat This is an epigeic species, one which occurs on the soil surface in leaf litter and in the top layers of the soil, up to 10 centimeters deep. It prefers substrates rich in organic material, such as rotting wood and other plant matter, compost, peat, and manure.Dominguez, J. and C. A. Edwards.

Biological Invasions 8(6), 1223-34. allowing it to thrive in the acidic litter of conifers. Biology The species has a high rate of reproduction, and can complete its life cycle in 75 days. There are morphs that reproduce sexually and by parthenogenesis, producing young without fertilization. While the worms themselves are sensitive to cold temperatures, the cocoons are very cold- hardy. They can stay viable over the winter in temperatures below ‚àí40 ¬∞C. In an experiment, 50% of a sample of cocoons kept at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (‚àí196 ¬∞C) for 24 hours still had viable embryos. Their ability to survive such cold comes from their very low water content and the presence of cryoprotectant compounds such as sorbitol. In cold climates the adults die off and the cocoons overwinter, a new generation emerging when temperatures rise. As an invasive species This is one of many European earthworms that are now familiar worldwide as introduced and sometimes invasive species. For example, the Upper Midwest region of the United States has no native earthworms today, the last native taxa having been extirpated during the Ice Age. With European settlers came European earthworm species such as D. rubidus, which now make up the local earthworm fauna. A similar pattern occurred on parts of the Russian Plain, which has a few native earthworms and many introduced species. D. rubidus and other exotic epigeic earthworms are considered invasive because they alter the composition and stratification of the leaf litter on the forest floor as they consume it; this alters the ecosystems involved with the various soil horizons, a change which has a cascading effect through other ecosystems. One common way this species spreads is through the release of bait worms into the habitat. It is a \\"nightcrawler\\", an earthworm used as fishing bait, and one of several species sold in American bait shops as \\"red wigglers\\". It can often be found in shipments of worms labelled as another species, such as Lumbricus terrestris or L. rubellus. Bait worms are commonly lost and dumped in the habitat on fishing trips; sites of invasive populations are often near lakes. Exotic earthworms in general are also introduced when the cocoons are transported on vehicles and machinery, in ballast, and on the water itself. There are no good control methods for exotic earthworms that do not have the potential to affect other organisms, so prevention of introductions is more important.

Initially the site of a tenement building, the property was transformed into a Neo-Renaissance and Neo-baroque style residence during the years 1888 to 1903. History The view from the palace gardens The history of the palace goes back to the 1860s. It was during this time that Kalman Pozna≈Ñski, a Polish-Jewish trader from Kowal in the Kuyavia region, arrived and began to live in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Kalman started a cotton industry, but it was not successful. However, when the business was taken over by his son Izrael Pozna≈Ñski (1833‚Äì1900), there was a phenomenal rise in the price of cotton around the world. Izrael made a fortune from cotton and spent a large part of his earnings on the palace, which eventually took on his name.http://culture.pl/en/place/the-museum-of-history-of-the-city-of-lodz When Izrael Pozna≈Ñski acquired the site of the palace, there was a modest two-story building standing already. He renovated and expanded the building into a large residence. Taking his inspiration from the French neo-Renaissance, architect Hilary Majewski (and later Adolf Zeligson who modified the building) designed a suitably lavish abode which was meant to be the residence of Pozna≈Ñski, one of the key industrialists that drove the textile revolution in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The palace was marked for its opulence and grand size, and distinguished itself from the surrounding residences. The palace is also notable because of its L-shaped design. Another feature of the palace is the southern wing, which is topped with the tall domed roofs. It also included gardens filled with \\"botanical phenomena\\" so rare to the country that their Latin names had no Polish equivalent at the time, a shooting range and exteriors boasting majestic domes, fancy embellishments and sculptures representing allegories of industry. Inside, a ballroom, a chamber of mirrors and a glass-ceilinged winter garden were also added to the labyrinthine layout. The interior decoration of the large Dining Room as well as the Ballroom was designed by a renowned ≈Å√≥d≈∫ artist and painter Samuel Hirszenberg. Before the outbreak of World War II, members of the Pozna≈Ñski family emigrated to the Western Europe. During the German occupation, the palace served as headquarters of Nazi German authorities. After the war, the building served as the seat of the voivodeship office. Since 1975, the palace has housed the Museum of the City of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (Muzeum Miasta ≈Åodzi). The museum possesses rich collections of numismatics, iconography, painting, sculpture, graphics, books and manuscripts. In 2015, the palace was officially included on the List of Historic Monuments of Poland. In 2017, the process of revitalization of the palace was initiated, and work began on renovating the palace's facade. Renovation of the palace was completed in 2020 on the 200th anniversary of \\"Modern ≈Å√≥d≈∫\\" and the building \\"(has) regained its perch as one of the nation‚Äôs most magnificent urban structures.\\" Gallery File:Ignacy P≈Ça≈ºewski, Pa≈Çac Izraela Kalmanowicza Pozna≈Ñskiego przy ulicy Ogrodowej w ≈Åodzi, I-4722-3.jpgIzrael Pozna≈Ñski Palace in the 1950s File:SM ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Pa≈Çac Izraela Pozna≈Ñskiego 2017 (2) ID 613175.jpgEntrance from the palace gardens File:≈Å√≥d≈∫ - detale pa≈Çaca Pozna≈Ñskiego - panoramio.jpgDecoration detail File:Sala jadalna w pa≈Çacu Izraela Pozna≈Ñskiego.jpgInterior  See also  * Manufaktura * History of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ * Industrialization References External links  * Museum of the City of Lodz ‚Äì the Palace of Izrael Pozna≈Ñski * Lodz Tourist Information ‚Äì Izrael Pozna≈Ñski's Palace Category:Houses completed in 1903 Category:Palaces in Poland Category:Buildings and structures in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ","title":"Izrael Pozna≈Ñski Palace"},{"id":"41030122","text":"Usha Sangwan is a Managing Director at Life Insurance Corporation of India, India's biggest life insurance company.

It mimics a bird dropping in its appearance and the way it behaves. Description The bird-dropping spider is a master of deception. It crouches stationary on a leaf or other level surface and exhibits an elaborate combination of form and colour, the posture it adopts and the character of its web so as to simulate accurately a patch of bird's excreta. The underside of its abdomen is chalky white and its legs black. It weaves a small irregular white web on the surface of a prominently placed leaf and adopts an upside-down pose near the centre of the web with its legs folded, anchoring itself in place with some spines on its legs. The effect of this is to create the impression of a semi-solidified bird's dropping with a white raised centre with black specks, a surrounding thinner, more liquid portion and even a drip effect on the lowest margin ending with a little knob. The mimicry is enhanced by the fact that the spider emits an odour not unlike bird excreta. Discovery Here is how the Scottish naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes described how he first came to discover the spider: Later Forbes found another specimen on Sumatra and sent it back to Britain. He was a believer in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection but found it difficult to understand how the mimicry of a variable object like a bird dropping could have evolved. The arachnologist Reverend Octavius Pickard-Cambridge brushed his doubts aside. The spider was not attempting to mimic the dropping and the web spun on the surface of the leaf was solely to anchor the spider in a position where it could await the arrival of winged prey. The fact that it then in some way resembled a bird dropping was fortuitous and natural selection merely acted to enhance the similarity. References 6\\\\.

Life Bonham was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1581, and M.A. in 1585. He was incorporated B.A. at Oxford in 1584, and on 9 July 1611 was M.D. there. He practised his profession in London, and was an assistant to the Society of Medicine-Chirurgians. His death occurred about 1629. Bonham's Case Bonham was a physician by qualification, with a Cambridge medical degree (date now unclear), styling himself a medical doctor by 1602. He was not thereby qualified to practise in London by administering internal remedies, without a license from the College of Physicians of London. Bonham took the side of the surgeons, then a separate profession, who in 1605 petitioned parliament, unsuccessfully, for full rights as doctors. Then putting himself forward for examination by the College of Physicians in 1605, and 1606, he had a confrontation with Henry Atkins of the College on the second occasion. Finding himself in Newgate Prison for contempt of the College, he was freed by his lawyer under habeas corpus. Still faced with a large fine from the College for unlicensed practice, Bonham pursued the matter by legal means, which set the Court of Common Pleas against the Court of King's Bench. Sir Edward Coke in the Common Pleas ruled for Bonham, who was again in prison, and fined the College, at the same time commenting on the College's status (a charter confirmed by parliament) as potentially subject to the common law. Coke's decision outraged the king and some leading lawyers, and continued to resonate for two centuries. Works Bonham left books and papers to his servant, Edward Poeton, by whom they were edited and published as The Chyrurgians Closet, or Antidotarie Chyrurgicall, London 1630. The work was dedicated by Poeton, then residing at Petworth in Sussex, to Frances, Dowager Countess of Exeter, second wife of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter.

Storgatan (\\"Main Street\\" or literally \\"Great Street\\") is one of the longer streets in Ume√• (Sweden), about 4 kilometers long. Storgatan passes by the main city areas on the north side of Ume River. The street reaches from the old city limits at Tv√§r√•n in the west to Ume√• East Station, near the Norrland's University Hospital, in the east. Along Storgatan lies a number of Ume√• Municipality's historic buildings, and five of the city's major parks. On average around 8,900 vehicles per day passes on this street (2006).Nul√§gesbeskrivning (2006), page 62  History  When Ume√• was founded in 1622, on the northern side of the Ume River, it was staked out in a grid pattern with two longitudinal streets parallel to the river and five perpendicular alleys that ran all the way to the river. The southern long street (nowadays Storgatan) continued onwards from the city limits in the form of the coastal road that ranged between Stockholm and Tornio.Lassila, page 3 The coastal road's local route went from R√∂b√§ck, to the ferry location on the Ume River at Backenkyrkan (literally \\"The Hillside Church\\"), through Ume√• and then around Nydalasj√∂n's southern tip and on to Innertavle.Lassila, page 80 In 1780, Storgatan was paved and in 1782 the houses along it received house numbers, since it was decided that all houses and farms in Ume√• should be numbered. The number had to be painted on a wooden board and nailed above the main entrances.Steckzen, page 277 In 1864 Ume√• got a new city plan, which had influences from Nikolaistad (Now the City of Vaasa) that was rebuilt after a fire in 1852. In this plan the width of the streets were extended. The width of Storgatan increased from about 4‚Äì5 meters to roughly 18 meters (60 feet). The new plan also made room for sidewalks and plant beddings along the street. These approximately 3 meters (10 feet) wide beddings had to be planted with flowers and shrubs at the homeowner‚Äôs expense. The house owners even got a fencing obligation, meaning that a property facing the street must be enclosed by a plank wall or fence, and it had to be built in a \\"tasteful\\" style.Eriksson, page 67-69 and 74 However those rules did not apply to already developed areas, for cost reasons.Eriksson, page 73 In 1866 the new building ordinance for Ume√• established that along the pavement edge suitable broadleaf trees had to be planted at regular intervals and thus Ume√• had it first street birches. These were planted along the western part of Storgatan. However, the planting of birches on the city sidewalks was not done on a large scale until after the 1888 fire.Forsberg, page 10 and 12 In 1892 it was decided that the birch tree was the most suitable tree to plant on the city sidewalks.Eriksson, page 164 The transformation of the City Centre in the 1950 - 1960 centuries also affected the buildings along Storgatan. Only a few of the old wooden houses were spared from being demolishing and the rest was replaced by modern buildings, such as the 1963 Domus department store (the current MVG mall) that has one of its sides to Storgatan.Forsberg, page 15 and 78 In 2002, the center part of Storgatan was restored to have a more original look. The street got a 6.5 meter wide carriageway and a 5 meter wide walkway with birch trees on both sides of the roadway. Between the birches parking spots where added.Nul√§gesbeskrivning (2006), page 19  Listed buildings along Storgatan  Along Storgatan a number of listed buildings are located: Gamla lasarettet, Bagare Thillmans g√•rd, Gamla sl√∂jdskolan, L√∂jtnant Grahns g√•rd, The Court of Appeal for Upper Norrland, F√§rgare H√∂glanders g√•rd, von Ahnska magasinet, Gamla bankhuset (\\"Sm√∂rasken\\"), Sparbankshuset, Ume√• Town Hall, Handelsbanken, Riksbankshuset, Moritzska g√•rden, Scharinska villan, Ringstrandska villan, L√§nsresidenset and Ume√• Old Prison.

Five days after the killing, around 30 middle- aged women walked naked through Imphal to the Assam Rifles headquarters, shouting: \\"Indian Army, rape us too... We are all Manorama‚Äôs mothers.\\"http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne090206the_siege.asphttp://www.e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=1.10.160704.jul04 Padma Shree author M. K.

Recently, in December 2014, in a case filed at Supreme Court of India, the apex court told to government to pay a compensation of Rs. 10 lakhs to Manorama's family. The case was accepted for hearing in the court. It was seen as one of the partial victory, but the doubt remains the same as even in past, compensations were declared for victims of AFSPA, but courts could not spell any judgement against culprits for awarding punishment. http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/right-to-justice-deprived- by-state-case-of-manorama-vs-afspa-from-manipur-india/ References Category:People from Manipur Category:1970 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Violence against women in India Category:People murdered in India Category:Indian murder victims Category:Indian women in war Category:Women in 21st-century warfare Category:20th-century Indian women ","title":"Thangjam Manorama"},{"id":"41030505","text":"Pachaimalai Arulmigu Subramanyaswamy Temple (Pachaimalai Balamurugan Temple) is one of the two major hill temples (other being Pavalamalai) located in Gobichettipalayam, Tamil Nadu, dedicated to Tamil God Murugan. The temple constructed in the Tamil style of architecture, is located on top of a small hillock in the outskirts of the town of Gobichettipalayam.  Meaning of Name  Pachaimalai means Green hill. It is believed that the presence of a water- spring directly below the sanctum sanctorum gives the hill/ temple its name. During the drought years of 2001 ‚Äì 2005, when the wells went dry in the areas around the hill, water was still available on top of the hill. History Once upon a time, Saint Durvasar visited the Shiva Temple at Kunnathur on his sojourn to Kongu Nadu. His mystic powers revealed him that Modachur (near Gobichettipalayam) was the most suitable place for undertaking a penance on Lord Shiva. On reaching Modachur, he invokes Lord Shiva and goes into deep meditation. However, he longs for the dharshan of Lord Murugan. On Lord Shiva's advise, he reaches a small hillock, Pachaimalai. He worships Sri Murugan as Dhandayuthapani and installs his statue facing towards the west. As years rolled by, the temple at Pachaimalai was forgotten and was in a dilipidated state. In 1954, Amarar. P. K. Kuppusamy Gounder is said to have a seen a divine light emanating from the Sanctum Sanctorum of the shrine. He endeavoured to start regular poojas and codified the practices/events at the temple. The temple was slowly but completely rebuilt by 1980 due to his untiring efforts. Architecture The temple has a five-storey main Gopuram built according to the Dravidian architecture. The main deity is Balamurugan, the child form of Lord Murugan. The main deity faces west similar to Palani Dhandayuthapani temple. The temple also has a 40 feet statue of Lord Senthilandavar, which is visible from the town of Gobichettipalayam. It is one of the largest Murugan statues in the state. The temple also has shrines dedicated to various gods and goddesses including Vidya Ganapathy, Maragatheeswarar and His consort Maragathavalli, Kalyana Subramanyar with His consorts Valli and Deivanai, Maragatha Venkatesa Perumal with His consorts Sridevi and Bhoodevi, Dakshinamurthi, Bhairavar and the Navagraham. The speciality of Navagrahangal at Pachaimalai is that they can be seen with their consorts seated on their respective mounts. This is very rare.

The Deity faces towards west. Swarnabandanam - the gold plate covering the pedastal has been done for Moolavar.  Lord Shanmugar  Pachaimalai is renowned for Lord Shanmugar , who is the manifestation of Lord Murugan with six faces. The poojai for Shanmugar at Pachaimalai is similar to those at Thiruchendur. Every month during the days of Visakam, Shasti and Kiruthigai, Abihekam and special Shanmugarchanai is performed for the Deity. During Skandha Shasti, Shanmugarchanai is done for six days consecutively. During the annual Bhramotsava which falls in the month of Panguni, one can witness Lord Shanmuga in three attires. In the first one, Lord Shanmuga and his consorts are adorned completely in White conveying that he is Brahma, the Creator, the second, Red attire conveys that he is Shiva, the Destroyer. On the day of Panguni Uthiram, he is clad in Green, symbolizing that he is Vishnu, the Protector. Devotees offer green flowers, clothes and rose water to the Deity on that day.

Kalyana Urchavam or the marriage ceremony is performed for Lord Subramanya during Panguni Uthiram, Thai Poosam and Kandar Shasti. He also goes on fast for seven days during Kandar Shasti and Soorasamharam( ‡Æö‡ØÇ‡Æ∞‡Æö‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æπ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Øç) is enacted by him in Gobichettipalayam town. It is believed that the statue of the Subramanya is older than 600 years. File:Pachaimalai Kalyana Subramanayar - Thaipoosam 2020.jpgArulmigu Kalyana Subramaniar  Kadamba Tree  The Kadamba Tree is revered as the Sthala Viruksham at Pachaimalai. It is very rare to find this tree. It is considered very auspicious for Lord Murugan. The name \\"Kadamban\\" for Lord Murugan is derived from the name of this tree. Its flower has a beautiful and a characteristic fragrance. It flowers only during the month of Chitirai. Schedule and Pujai The temple is open on all days from 6 AM to 1 PM and 4 PM to 8 PM. There are 7 timely poojas scheduled daily. The late evening 7 PM pooja is considered auspicious. Every Tuesday, New Moon day (Amavasai), Sankatahara Chathurthi, Pradhosham, Full Moon day (Pournami), Theipirai Bhairavar Ashtami, Shashti and Kiruthigai are celebrated with special poojas. The temple has a golden peacock and a golden chariot in which the Deity is taken in a procession at 7 PM in the evening. Arulmigu Dhandapani is taken to the golden chariot in his mount 'golden peacock' in complete golden attire. File:Pachaimalai Golden Peacock May 2017.jpgGolden Peacock File:Pachaimalai Thanga Ther.jpgGolden Chariot Fairs and Festivals= Panguni Uthiram  The Brahmotsavam festival of the temple is celebrated in month of Panguni. Lord Kalyana Subramanyar is taken in a procession around the hill on the first six days in different mounts like Bootha Vahanam, Yaanai Vahanam (Elephant), Rishaba Vahanam (Ox), Annapatchi Vahanam (Swan) and Attukidai Vahanam (Goat). On the sixth day, Thiru Kalyana Utsavam is performed and the Sri Subramanyar graces the Wooden Chariot. On Panguni Uthiram day, the temple is thronged by thousands of devotees who carry 'Kavadi' and perform abishekam. The massive temple chariot is run on the same evening. Annadhanam is done to feed the thousands of devotees who visit the temple throughout the day.  Skandha Shasti Soorasamharam  The Skanda Shasti Soorasamharam festival is enacted in the town of Gobichettipalayam. The Deity, mounted on an elephant, presides over the function to defeat and give salvation to Soorapadman, the personification of Ego. This is a symbolic celebration of the victory of the good over evil. The Deity and devotees undertake \\"Kandar Shasti Viratham\\", which is essentially fasting for 7 days. The fast is broken on the day after Kandar Shasti, after the Thirukalyana Utsavam.  Thai Poosam  During the first half of the day, Kavadi abishekam is performed continuously. During the later part of the day, the presiding Deity of the temple graces in Thanga Kavasam - the golden Kavacha.  Vaikaasi Visaagam 'Lacharchanai'  The annual Lacharchanai is conducted during Vaikasi Visakam, for three days. On the final day, Shatru Samhara Homam and a grand abishekam is done for the Deity.  Special Practices = Shatru Samhara Thirisadai Archanai  Shatru Samhara Thirisadai Archanai invokes Lord Subramanya using the six syllables of Sa-Ra-Va-Na-Bha-Va in different arrangaments and glorifies Him. It is done at Pachaimalai every Tuesday morning. The specialty is that, unlike other places, Devotees are encouraged to recite the mantras along with the acharyas. One can hear a multitude of voices at the same time which gives a sense of peace to the mind. One should be prepared to come early by eight‚Äôo clock, to participate in the full archanai. Don‚Äôt be surprised if you find a huge crowd. The participation in this archanai will lead to the destruction of evil and enemies. It is also considered to bestow the boon of marriage and children.  Shatru Samhara Homam  Shatru Shamkara Homam is the yagna invoking Lord Subramanya to free oneself from evils within oneself like anger, ego, jealousy and arrogance . It also cures the ill effects pilli soonya (black magic). Shatru Shamkara Homam is done in a grand manner at Pachaimalai during Vaikasi Visagam(birth star of Muruga). It is done for six days consecutively during Skandha Shasti and Panguni Uthiram. It involves six sivacharyas who perform the Shatrusamhara thirisadai Archanai which is followed by the yagna.  Thaarabishekam  Thaarabishekam is a vedic ceremony in which milk is made to drip slowly on the Deity, through a Tharai or a Vessel, accompanied by the recitation of Rudram eleven times, invoking Shiva as Rudra and Parabrama. Thaaraabishekam is done simultaneously for Sri Balamurugan (the presiding Deity) and Sri Maragatheeshwarar. It is done regularly during Agni Natchatiram, the hottest period of the year.  Thei Pirai Ashtami Bhairava Pooja  On every Thei Pirai Ashtami, special poojas and homam are conducted for Kala Bhairava. The rituals begin in the evening with the ‚ÄòMaha Kala Bhairava Homam‚Äô. It is believed that participation in this homa will protect us from evil and black deeds. The homam or the yagna is followed by special abisheka( ritual bathing) for Kala Bhairava. ‚ÄòPunuku‚Äô, a kind of natural scent is offered to the deity. You can also find hundreds of deities offering eleven ‚ÄòEllu Deepam‚Äô , considered sacred to Lord Bhairava. At the end, ‚ÄòBitter gourd Rice‚Äô and ‚ÄòVada‚Äô is given as Prasadam. This Pooja attracts hundreds of devotees every month.  Annadhaanam  Pachaimalai is renowned for Annadhaanam - the act of feeding the devotees. The golden chariot procession and every other ceremony at the temple is usually followed by Annadhanam. This temple is covered under the 'Annadhaanam Scheme' of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Every afternoon, fifty people are being fed with sumptuous meal at the temple under the scheme.  Similarities between Palani and Pachaimalai  Pachaimalai Subramanya Swamy Temple has the following similarities with Palani Murugan temple. # The presiding Deity is Sri Bala Dhandayuthapani in both the temples. # The shrines face towards the west. It is rare to find temples facing west. # The Kadamba Maram (Neolamarckia cadamba) is considered Sthala Vriksha at both the temples. # Swarnabandhanam (Gold plating affixing the Deity to the pedestal) is seen at both places. How to reach Pachaimalai is situated near Pudupalayam in the outskirts of Gobichettipalayam. To get there by road, reach Gobichettipalayam and travel further 1 km to reach Pachaimalai. The temple is located on top of a hillock which can be accessed by road or by foot from the base of the hill. By rail, reach Erode (40 km) and then travel by road via Gobichettipalayam. The nearest airport is Coimbatore, 85 km away.

His primary research fields were astrophysics, nuclear physics, quantum mechanics, mathematical physics, and statistics, as well as electrodynamics and optics.  Biography  J√°nossy was the adopted son of influential Marxist philosopher and politician Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs (1885‚Äì1971). He was also the brother of the economist and engineer Ferenc J√°nossy (1914‚Äì1997). He married the physicist Leonie Kahn (1913-1966) who he met during his studies in Berlin: together they were parents to physicists Mih√°ly J√°nossy (1942‚Äì2004), Andr√°s J√°nossy (1944), also a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and Istv√°n J√°nossy (1945), as well as Anna J√°nossy (1938-1999), a medical researcher. After the 1919 fall of the early Hungarian Soviet Republic, his mother and stepfather, Gertr√∫d Borstieber and Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, left the country together, and moved to Vienna. Thus, from the age of 6, J√°nossy lived abroad: he attended university in Vienna and, later, in Berlin. He worked in the laboratory of Werner Kolh√∂rster in Berlin (1934‚Äì1936) focusing on astrophysics until he and his wife had to move again, feeling Nazism. He started working with P.M.S. Blackett ‚Äî who became a Nobel laureate in 1948 ‚Äî concentrating on cosmic radiation at Birkbeck College in London, heading the cosmic radiation research group and later at Manchester University. In 1947 invited by Walter Heitler and Erwin Schr√∂dinger he joined the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies as a professor and group leader of the cosmic rays research laboratory. In 1950, invited by the Hungarian Government, J√°nossy returned home to Budapest ‚Äî not only for reasons of promised scientific possibilities, but also because his foster father and his mother had also returned there from their emigration in Moscow. J√°nossy was charged with the task of managing the Cosmic Radiation Department at the Central Research Institute for Physics (Hungarian abbreviation: KFKI) founded in 1950. He was very active in scientific organisation, education and public life. He was appointed deputy director of the KFKI from 1950 to 1956, and director from 1956 to 1970. In addition, he was also active as a university professor; the Department of Nuclear Physics at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University was established for him. He was the first head of the Department of Nuclear Physics from 1957 to 1970. His political engagement is attested by his membership, from 1962 until his death, in the Hungarian Socialist Workers 'Party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee.  Work  At the beginning of his career in Germany, England, and Ireland, J√°nossy focussed on cosmic rays, both experiment and theory. His name is linked to Geiger's coincidence detector development with special application to cosmic- ray secondary components created in the upper layers of the atmosphere (mesons such as kaons, muons, gamma rays). He demonstrated how primary cosmic rays colliding with the Earth's atmosphere produced secondary penetrating showers cascading to the surface of the earth (1940‚Äì1941). From an early age to his death, he had a wide-ranging interest in the mathematical and statistical aspects of physical analysis, and, in particular, the application of probability and calculus to experimental results in nuclear physics and particle physics. He is known for his statistical analysis methods for cosmic rays. Specifically, during his stay in Dublin, he completed his classic monograph on cosmic rays (1948)Janossy, L. (1948): Cosmic Rays, Oxford, Clarendon Press, p. 424 Online copy and published important monographs on particle showers (1950), introducing the eponymous joint probability densities‚Äînow called J√°nossy densities‚Äîin the theory of random point processes.Janossy, L. (1950): \\"On the absorption of a nucleon cascade\\", Proc. Roy. Irish Acad. Sci., A53, 181‚Äì188; Janossy, L. (1952): \\"Studies on the Theory of Cascades,\\" Acta phys. Acad. sci. Hung., 2 289‚Äì333; Janossy, L. and Messel, H. (1950): \\"Fluctuations of the electron ‚Äì photon cascade ‚Äì moments of the distribution\\", Proc. Phys. Soc. (London)., A63, 1101‚Äì1115. ; Until the 1950s, the most important field in the research of high-energy particles was the investigation of cosmic radiation. But as the large accelerators started to take over the leading role, J√°nossy turned away from the investigation of cosmic radiation and focussed on theoretical problems of quantum mechanics, the dual character of light, as well as the theory of relativity. Together with KFKI colleagues, he carried out a famous low- intensity interference experiment, a quantum-mechanical process in which low- intensity photon beams interfere with themselves‚Äîalthough the experiments originally sought to refute this possibility. These interference results involving a small number of photons are significant for appreciating the quantum nature of light. The measurements he carried out in connection with the dual character of light (self-interference of few photons) supplied results that were expected on the basis of quantum mechanics; yet, due to the requirements of extremely high accuracy, measurements of this kind had not been carried out before J√°nossy. Spurred by this famous photon experiment, Schr√∂dinger was quick to write a letter, in which he emphasized the importance of the result. In both the measurement of cosmic radiation and the low intensity interference experiment, precision of the correct results is of fundamental importance, which justified J√°nossy's interest in the statistical evaluation of measurements. In the last one and a half decades of his theoretical activity, he was engaged in the hydrodynamic model of quantum mechanics and the interpretation problems of the theory of relativity. He had an interest in the physics philosophy of interpretation, and practical aspects of physics education and the promotion of physics as well. He was also active in the organization of public scientific. From 1953 until his death, he co- edited the Hungarian Physical Journal, and he was a member of the editorial board of Acta Physica Hungarica and Hungarian Science, as well as Foundations of Physics.  Memberships and awards  Member (1950) and, later, vice- president (1961 to 1973) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (1961), the Royal Irish Academy (1949), the Mongolian Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic (1954). Awarded the Kossuth Prize (1951); Academic Gold Medal (1972); Vice chair of the E√∂tv√∂s Physical Society (1950‚Äì1969); chair of the National Atomic Energy Commission. From 1966 till his death, president of the Hungarian Stamp Collectors' Association.

The first Wool Board, in 1936, together with the Wool Boards of New Zealand and South Africa decided to form an organisation to promote wool, to meet the growing challenge from synthetic fibres, which led to the formation in 1937 of the International Wool Secretariat. There have been other reorganisations of the management of the wool sector in Australia since. The functions of each three Boards varied, with third reincarnation having the widest powers that included the promotion of the use of wool and wool products in Australia and other countries; the power to inquire into, and from time to time report upon the methods of marketing wool and any other matters connected with the marketing of wool; and such other functions as are conferred on the Board by the Australian Government or as approved by the Minister for Primary Industries. The activities of the Board were funded by a levy on woolgrowers first instituted to finance wool promotion activities in 1936 and later supplemented by funding from the Australian Government. Objectives The objectives of the third Wool Board were: * Joint international promotion of wool products through the International Wool Secretariat with the Wool Boards of New Zealand, South Africa, and Uruguay;page 800, Official Year Book of the Commonwealth of Australia No. 58, 1972 * Provision of testing services for wool and wool products; * Provision of advice to government on wool research activities by government bodies in relation to the needs of the wool industry; and * Oversight of all aspects of wool marketing but without executive powers over marketing. Subsequent reorganisations The Australian Wool Bureau existed between July 1953 and May 1963. The Australian Wool Commission (AWC), created in November 1970, was replaced in January 1973 by the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). The International Wool Secretariat (IWS) was an overseas extension of Wool Corporation and was merged into it. IWS had established the Woolmark trade mark in 1964 and owned it. In 1991, the functions of the AWC were divided between three newly established entities: the Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC), the Australian Wool Corporation [II] and the Wool Research and Development Corporation (WRDC).Milestones ‚Äì a brief history of the Australian wool industry AWRC continued to operate until 2002, with the main task being the liquidation of the wool stockpile arising from the failed Australian Wool Reserve Price Scheme. In December 1993, the Australian Wool Corporation and WRDC were merged to form the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation (AWRAP). AWRAP had two subsidiaries: IWS and Australian Wool Innovation Limited (AWI). In 1997, the name of IWS was changed to The Woolmark Company. Australian Wool Services Limited (AWS) was formed in 2001 and succeeded AWRAP. AWI was de-merged from AWS in 2002 and The Woolmark Company was sold by AWS to AWI in 2007.

Rankings and research Corruption in Australia is relatively uncommon when compared to other nations worldwide. Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perceptions Index ranks the country 13th place out of 176 countries. Public sector corruption in Australia is similar to that in other developed nations like Canada and Norway as of 2014. However, according to this same index, corruption perception is increasing in Australia. In the 2015 Index Australia ranked 13th, dropping six positions since 2012. The phenomenon has also been studied by the Australian National University, which produced a report called Perceptions of Corruption and Ethical Conduct (2012), which concluded: \\"there is a widespread perception that corruption in Australia has increased\\" and that \\"the media, trade unions and political parties were seen as Australia's most corrupt institutions. Research published in 2015 by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand found government and private firms in Australia and nearby New Zealand both display widespread \\"complacent\\" attitudes about corruption, particularly in regards to companies bidding for government contracts.Lannin, Sue. Australian firms too 'complacent' about corruption ABC.net.au, 17 September 2015; accessed 16 May 2016 In January 2018, a discussion paper published by the Australia Institute, suggested that the trust in the Australian government is at a historical low, which could have reduced the GDP by as much as 4% or $72.3 billion. A report by Australian Public Service Commission's released in 2018, stated that investigations were conducted in only 0.3% of the workforce, meaning a total of 596 employees.

Symptoms of infection are often a severe combination of pneumonia, encephalitis and damage to the immune system, which greatly impair the cetacean's ability to swim and stay afloat unassisted. Since its discovery in 1987, CeMV has been responsible for numerous epizootics of mass mortality in cetacean populations.

It is located between Vykhino and Zhulebino and opened, together with Zhulebino, on 9 November 2013. The station is constructed below the intersection of Khvalynsky Boulevard and Lermontovsky Avenue, hence the name of the station, and is located outside the Moscow Ring Road, approximately from Kosino railway station. The construction of Lermontovsky Prospekt and Zhulebino was needed to unload Vykhino, which by the time of construction was the most heavily used station of Moscow Metro. Lermontovsky Prospekt is a shallow single-vault station. It is located below the central line of Lermontovsky Avenue, approximately from northwest to southeast. The station has five exits. Two of them are located at the northwestern side, at both sides of Lermontovsky Avenue, and three more at the southeastern side, at both sides of Khvalynsky Boulevard. On 3 June 2019, the inaugural stretch of the Nekrasovskaya line was opened. Lermontovsky Prospekt was connected by a transfer to Kosino, the former west terminus of the line. Location The territory at which the station currently located was until 1984 a part of the town of Lyubertsy of Moscow Oblast. In 1984 it was transferred to Moscow, and subsequently rapid urban development started. The whole area, along with Lyubertsy and other areas along the Kazansky and Ryazansky suburban directions of Moscow Railway were strongly dependent on the station of Vykhino, then the terminus of the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line and a transfer station to both railway directions. In the 2000s, Vykhino was heavily overloaded. Eventually, the decision was taken to extend the Tagansko- Krasnopresnenskaya Line beyond Vykhino. The construction of the first stretch, with the stations of Lermontovsky Prospekt and Zhulebino, started in August 2011. The tunnels were completed by September 2013.

Only one was constructed. Design and development The Roma was designed by Angelo Mori and built by the Grupo Volo a Vela Tommaso Dal Molin () in Varese. It was a cantilever high-wing monoplane, its high aspect ratio, single spar wing constructed with a wooden frame and covered in plywood and fabric. It was mounted with some dihedral and in plan was straight tapered with elliptical tips. Ailerons occupied about half the span. The fuselage of the Roma was flat sided aft of the wing, which sat on top of it. Between the trailing edge and close to the tail it was fabric covered; the rest, like the forward fuselage, was skinned with ply. All the fuselage surfaces were treated with ship's waterproof paint. The cantilever horizontal tail, mounted on the fin just above the fuselage, was slightly straight tapered. The fin was very small, serving only to mount a large, slightly curved, balanced rudder. This extended below the fuselage, moving within an elevator cut-out and partly protected by a ventral fin. The cockpit was immediately ahead of the wing leading edge, with a curved upper fuselage reaching forwards to the nose. Different cockpit enclosures were used, though the order is uncertain. One placed the pilot under a separable, multi framed canopy; with the other the pilot after entry was surrounded by a demountable ply covering which filled the larger aperture, allowing his head to emerge from within an open, circular, collared hole. The interior was lit by glazing in the cover just in front of the seat. The Roma was an amphibian and had a single step, flying boat style hull with the step under mid-chord. Small stabilizing floats were mounted under the wings at about two-thirds span, each attached by two spanwise parallel pairs of V-struts. Land operation used a standard glider skid, running from just aft of the nose to aft of the trailing edge. A dolly was used for launches. Operational history The Roma's first flight was in May 1933, flown by Romeo Sartori from Lake Schiranna near Varese. Plinio Rovesti later flew it from the summit of the Campo dei Fiori di Varese to Lake Maggiore, about away. On 16 September 1934 the Roma, flown again by Rovesti led eight Anfibio Vareses (another Mori design), bungee launched, from the Campo dei Fiori to alight at Schiranna. Rovesti continued to fly it from Campo dei Fiori and from Mottarone over local lakes. During World War II, the Roma was stored at Vizzola Ticino but was burned by retreating German occupation forces.

It was filmed in Vienna and Munich in autumn 1970 and released in March 1971.  Plot  1969\\\\. In a Vienna bookshop the Argentine chemist Rafaelo Aranda is poisoned by the bookseller Valerie Steinfeld. The bookseller commits suicide immediately afterwards. It seems the bookseller has never met him before. The chemist's son, Manuel Aranda, wants to find out the background of this murder. He finds out that his father has developed chemical weapons of mass destruction and offered to sell them to the United States, the Soviet Union and France. The Secret Services of these countries try to prevent Aranda from publishing these facts. Aranda survives a first sniper attack without even noticing it. Manuel Aranda learns that Valerie Steinfeld was involved in a risky paternity trial during the Third Reich. Her half-Jewish son was to be protected from the Nazis. Valerie Steinfeld had persuaded a friend to claim he was her son's father. The friend had no Jewish background and was a registered member of the Nazi Party. Slowly the suspicion arises that Steinfeld and Rafaelo Aranda might have had to do with each other at this time. With the help of Irene Waldegg, the niece of Valerie Steinfeld, Manuel Aranda finds out about the Nazi past of his father. But Valerie Steinfeld also had her personal secret. Not even Irene Waldegg had known that she also was a part of Valerie Steinfeld's past.

The will originally provided for an almshouse in Rochester High Street: The Poor Travellers House; over time, the money later provided for almshouses in Maidstone Road, along with other accommodation in Rochester, totalling 66 self-contained flats. Other charities absorbed by the Richard Watts Charity include St Catherine‚Äôs Hospital founded under the Charity of Symond Potyn in 1315. Early history The original charity created the post of \\"provider\\" to run the charity. The provider was appointed by, and reported annually to, the mayor. His role encompassed supervision of the house, collection of rents and provision of materials to the poor. Provision was also made for housekeeper to \\"be resyant [resident] there ... clean make the Bedds wash the linen ... and look well to the furniture.\\" Both posts could be held by one or several persons, and that of housekeeper specifically mentions 'he or she or they'. A further agreement between the mayor, bishop, bridge wardens and aldermen in 1615 provided for \\"..poore children ... who would otherwise lyve in Idleness and be fitt for noe use...\\" On this basis the charity continued uneventfully until 1671. The original will had used the terms 'Parish of St. Nicholas' and 'City of Rochester' fairly interchangeably, however the indenture consistently refers to the city. The problem arose because the city at that time included three parishes: St. Nicholas', Rochester (the area of the medieval walled town, based on the Roman town walls); St Margaret's Without (the area outside the city walls stretching southwards) and St. Nicholas', Strood (the other side of the river). In the early part of 1671 the parish of St. Margaret requested that the outdoor relief should include their people. The charity refused the application so the following year St. Margaret's and Strood jointly applied to the Court of Chancery for a ruling which was decided in their favour. The parish of Strood utilised some of the money to provide a workhouse for the poor, see the inscription alongside. In 1693, there were allegations of misemployment of the revenues. A new agreement was drawn up whereby the Mayor's role was replaced by the 'Committee for Charitable Uses'. It was to consist of nine members selected annually by the Grand Jury of the Court Leet. It was to meet at least four times a year and to examine the Provider's accounts. The arrangement lasted until 1836. In 1808 the parish of Chatham followed the lead of St. Margaret's and Strood in filing a bill in Chancery for funding. It was not until 1833 that the matter was settled and Chatham received some help from the charity. The funds for poor relief were now split into 32 parts: St. Nicholas' parish received 20 parts, St. Margaret's 6, Strood 4 and Chatham 2. Watts' original will had provided that leases on the lands and property he left were to be for a term no more that 21 years. While this was reasonable with sixteenth century artisan buildings and farms, it was not suitable for nineteenth century brick and stone developments. Indeed on at least one occasion there was no response to an invitation to tender for four houses on land owned by the charity. Eventually the trustees had to apply to the Court of Chancery for permission to extend leases to 99 years, which permission was given. The 1832 Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws rethought the whole problem of relief for the poor. As well as establishing a national system of poor relief it also led to charities coming under consideration. The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 replaced the mayor and citizens of Rochester and the oversight of the charity passed to the municipal trustees appointed by the Courts of Chancery. 1853 onwards The Charitable Trusts Act of 1853 brought a large number of independent trusts and charities under the supervision of the newly created Charity Commissioners. Watts' Charity was no exception. A new scheme was devised for the running of the charity. The charity was run buy municipal trustees who appointed a clerk and receiver. They also appointed a master and matron to manage the poor travellers house. ¬£4,000 was used to build a new set of almshouses for 20 people in Maidstone Road. ¬£100 was set aside to provide an apprenticeship premium for children who had distinguished themselves at school. ¬£2,000 was spent on the building of the Watts Public Baths with ¬£200 per annum for maintenance. In 1935 they passed into the hands of the Corporation of Rochester though the annual grant towards costs continued for a further 20 years. ¬£4,000 was granted to the trustees of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Rochester to enable them to build a \\"Hospital and Dispensary for the relief of the Sick poor\\". The charity was also to pay ¬£1,000 (later raised to ¬£1,500) per annum to the hospital and gained the right to nominate as patients up to 20 people at any one time. These donations were maintained until 1948 until the hospital came under the control of the National Health Service. In 1886 there was a further scheme extending the work of the charity. 11 outpensions of 7/- (35p) per week were established and two exhibitions of ¬£100 made available annually, one each to Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School and Rochester Grammar School for Girls. There were five exhibitions for pupil teachers, each of ¬£6/5/0 annually for three years. The Watts Nursing Service was established with two full-time nurses (one midwife, one district) and six occasional nurses. The 1934 supplementary scheme increased certain payments and handed the baths over to the council. Post War The 1942 Beveridge Report led to the establishment of the modern British Welfare State. The previous, limited, National Insurance Act 1911 was extended to most workers by the National Insurance Act 1946. The National Health Service Act 1946 introduced universal health care and the National Assistance Act provided a safety net replacing the old Poor Laws. The upshot was that by 1950 much of the charity's former purpose had been taken over by the state. A review of operations led to the scheme of 1954. Some money was available to help travellers in need of financial assistance and some for \\"amenities or samaritan funds\\" at hospitals within the city. Some money was available for apprenticeships, for books, tools, fees and examinations. Power was obtained for discretionary grants to relieve hardship or distress, either directly or via other institutions. By 1976 sufficient funds were available to extend the almshouses. In 1977 yet another scheme came into operation. Several charities, some of which were already administered by the trustees of Richard Watts Charity were amalgamated under the title: \\"Richard Watts and the City of Rochester Almshouse Charities\\": * Richard Watts General * Hayward's Almshouses * The Chatham Intra Charity of Richard Watts * St. Catherine's Hospital Charities Six Poor Travellers House The Poor Travellers' house The Six Poor Travellers House is a 16th-century charity house in Rochester, Medway, founded by the local MP Richard Watts to provide free lodgings for poor travellers. Watts left money in his will for the benefit of six poor travellers, each of whom, according to a plaque on the outside of the building, would be given lodging and \\"entertainment\\" for one night before being sent on his way with fourpence. The house was the inspiration for Charles Dickens' short story \\"The Seven Poor Travellers\\" (with Dickens himself, as narrator, being the seventh traveller). Watts' benevolence and the Dickens story are remembered during Rochester's fancy dress Dickensian Christmas Festival, when a turkey is cooked and ceremonially distributed to \\"the poor\\" at the house. The house features restored small Elizabethan period bedrooms, along with a herb garden in the rear, and is open to the public from March through October. The small almshouse now known as the Six Poor Travellers existed before Watts left it money in his will. His will refers to \\"the almshouse already erected and standing\\", desiring it to be \\"reedified\\" [rebuilt] as well as extended with rooms for the travellers. The work had been completed before the signing of the Indenture Quadripartite in 1593, probably around the time of the remarriage of Marian in 1586. Whilst the exclusion of rogues seems obvious, that of proctors has led to local controversy. In 1772 Denne claimed that Watts used a proctor to write an early draft of his will, and the proctor perverted Watts' wishes for his own ends. Later authors claim that the proctors in question were beggars on behalf of lepers. A statute of Edward VI provided for lepers and bedridden people to appoint proctors to beg on their behalf. There had been a leper hospital a short distance away since 1315 (see below). W Gibson Ward describes them as \\"... mendicants who swarmed ... under the pretence of collecting Alms for the support of Leper houses...\\". The English Heritage listing entry includes \\"...or proctors (ie lawyers)\\" but does not elaborate further. In 1615 the charity admitted poor children to the house. There were to be up to ten \\"men children\\" who could remain until aged 18 and six \\"women children\\" who could remain until 16. There was provision also for the children to be apprenticed to \\"some honest citizen, or tradesman, or husbandman\\". Vouchers from this period show the Mayor requesting \\"Mr. Provider\\" to assist those \\"ver ill\\" or \\"poor and impotent\\". Occasionally the definition of traveller was stretched somewhat as in 1703 when the Mayor requested \\"relieve these 127 prisoners with fourpence each\\". It appears that the travellers presented themselves to the Mayor, or a deputy, who would then issue a chit for the Provider. The trustees kept the house in good repair and in 1845 added a sitting room for the use of the travellers in the evening. In 1855 the supper provided for each traveller \\"every evening at 7 o'clock\\" was of meat, or bread and of coffee. In the morning a further pint of coffee was served and the traveller sent off with fourpence. After 1880 when Watts Public Baths were available the selection of inmates was performed at the baths, which the travellers were obliged to attend. In 1923 bathrooms were added to the house, however in 1935 the council (who had taken over the public baths) were still allocating facilities for the Inspector of Poor Travellers to make his selection there. Electric light was installed in 1935 with electric radiators in the bedrooms the following year and in the dining room by 1937. The Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939 prohibited casual wayfarers in Protected Areas such as Rochester. Following notice from the Chief Constable the house finally closed its doors to travellers on 20 July 1940 after 354 years of continuous service. The building was converted in 1948 to provide two flats for two elderly couples, the ground floor being retained as a museum. In 1977 the building was surveyed and repaired. The building was returned to its former state with the ground floor and travellers' rooms as a museum with a residence above. In 1950 the building was listed as grade I, number 1086479. The 1858 structure is still the original timber framed building but with the 1771 Portland stone facing. Originally there was one room per floor, but the 1604 rebuild (the \\"reedified\\" mentioned above) included the rear stair turret and probably the dividing of the rooms. The remarkable (according to the listing) survival is the extension for the poor traveller's rooms. Modelled on a contemporary coaching inn it has three rooms opening onto the courtyard and three opening onto an unglazed gallery above. Below the handrail the gallery is filled in with lath and plaster, the whole supported on four large chamfered uprights to provide a dry walkway below. The rooms each have a door, window chamfered ceiling beams and a brick fireplace. There is a cellar (not currently open to the public) which contains a \\"rubble wall that may be early\\". The house was the inspiration for Charles Dickens's short story, \\"The Seven Poor Travellers\\". Watts's benevolence and the Dickens story are remembered during Rochester's fancy dress Dickensian Christmas Festival, when a turkey is cooked and ceremoniously distributed to 'the poor' (that is, anyone passing by at the time) at the house. Henry Lucy described a visit to the house in \\"Christmas Eve at Watts's\\" in Faces and Places and throws an interesting light on Dickens' story through the words of the house-keeper. There is also a very detailed account of \\"Richard Watts's Charity, Rochester\\" in Chapter VI of A Week's Tramp in Dickens-Land, by William R. Hughes. Watts Almshouses Watts Almshouses, Maidstone Road In 1857 the trustees purchased a site in Maidstone Road, Rochester for ¬£1,412 10s 0d on which to build new almshouses. The site had been a former Hospital which had been used in turn as a pest house, prison for prisoners of war and lately let for private dwellings. The trustees had been empowered under the 1855 scheme to spend up to ¬£4,000 building the almshouses, but the 1857 plans could not be built for that amount. Tenders were invited and one of ¬£3,449 from Charles Foord accepted, but with alterations the final cost was ¬£4,510. The building is of red and yellow brick with limestone dressings. The central block in contrast is in rustic rubble ragstone. This central block houses the main entrance, with attached common room and kitchen, and above the Trustees' boardroom. The board room has a robust hammer-beam roof and notable internal brickwork described by English Heritage as \\"the brickwork and fine pointing of very high quality\\". To one side were the men's apartments, to the other the women's. The apartments were built along a gallery and each one contained a sitting room, bedroom and scullery. All the inhabitants were evacuated during World War II to Eylesden, a Georgian house in Sutton Valence. At the almshouses the ARP (Air Raid Precautions) shelters were made available to the public and two gun emplacements installed. Prior to the inmates' return in 1946 the almshouses were repaired and electricity installed. In 1970 the almshouses were assigned a grade II listing, English Heritage number 1086457. In 1976 additional new almshouses were built on the Fort Clarance site which was part of the original 1857 purchase. Ten dwellings, a Warden's house, laundry and guest room were built for a tender of ¬£127,593. Watts' Nursing Service The scheme of 1855 set up a nursing service to provide maternity care and to care for the afflicted poor of the parish. Any of the inmates of the Almshouses were able to call on their services in time of sickness. Care was free. A Head Nurse supervised the service, relying on nurses to provide the actual care. The Head Nurse periodically attended on all those in the care of nurses to check on the standard of work. She also had to visit all inmates of the almshouses once a week, ensure adequate fire precautions and prepare the boardroom for meetings. Things did not always go smoothly. Thomas Aveling complained in January 1871 about \\"the reported inefficiency of the Nurses ... more than twelve months since\\", which is interesting because as mayor 1869‚Äì70 he had a level of supervision of the charity. On 2 June 1871 he was appointed to be a trustee at around the same time he left the council. During the 1930s home-helps were employed by the charity to assist new mothers for up to 21 days after the birth. They were expected to attend from 8 am to 8 pm and to cook, supervise older children (getting them to school and afterwards to bed) and wash the children's clothes. Washing the patient and making the bed were, however, the prerogative of the nurse. Although the scheme seemed to work well, it was too expensive for the charity and the home-helps were discontinued after 1938. The scheme was not without problems. In 1941 the Royal College of Nursing expressed concern to the trustees for \\"advertising for a SRN [State Registered Nurse] for district work at a salary of ¬£130 p.a.\\". Eventually an increase of ¬£50 p.a. was agreed for each nurse. In 1945 the Nurses' Salaries Commission reported and the Ministry of Health established norms for the profession. Thereafter the rates agreed by the Whitley Council were paid. The coming of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1946 brought a dramatic change to the charity. The county council had the task of organising a free home nursing service for all persons who needed it. Local organisations could participate, they would need to fund 25% of the cost, the county providing the remaining 75%. The charity's nursing service was incorporated on this basis into the NHS with the county funding ¬£2,000 and the charity ¬£1,500. The Charity Commissioners were not happy with a charity becoming permanently involved in the NHS and only permitted the arrangement to run until December 1950. The nursing service continued to provide a reduced independent service until all patients were transferred to the NHS on 31 March 1958. The Nursing Branch of the charity then ceased to exist. Watts Public Baths The 1855 scheme empowered the trustees to erect public baths and wash-houses. There was a site by the river which had been occupied by the baths of the Castle Club. The trustees duly obtained it and built new baths, opening in 1880. Both private baths and swimming baths were provided. The swimming baths were used by schools and between 1882 and 1925 some three and a half thousand children had learnt to swim there. The baths were never run profitably, a yearly grant of ¬£200 from the charity being required. Finally in 1935 the baths were handed over to Rochester Corporation, though the annual grant remained for a further 15 years. Apprenticeships and educational work The 1615 scheme provided for care of poor children. The 1601 Poor Law had made it the duty of Overseers of the Poor to find apprenticeships for pauper orphans and the almshouse followed this lead. Evidence in the records of the 17th and 18th century showed this practice continued, but by the early 19th century all references to children had ceased. The 1855 scheme set aside ¬£100 per year for providing apprenticeship premiums. Applications were invited each year from prospective apprentices who were interviewed (as were the prospective masters) and a selection made. The apprenticeships were from four to seven years. Between 1856 and 1925, 1,265 apprenticeships were funded. However, the numbers fell from 41 in 1927 to 5 in 1939. Tools, travelling and clothes were also sometimes provided. Economic changes after the war reduced the number of apprentice premiums required and by 1958 no further apprenticeships were given. At the start of the nineteenth century, virtually all schooling was provided by the Public Schools. As the century wore on, more provision was made for the schooling of all children by the establishment of various state and church primary schools. By 1883 primary education was mandatory and free. Secondary education lagged behind. Pupils were either fee- paying or had to obtain scholarships. It was against this background that the Watts' Charity Education Foundation was established at a committee meeting in October 1894. ¬£100 was made available annually for ten boys age twelve and over to attend the Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School. Another ¬£100 was provided for eight girls to attend the Rochester Grammar School for Girls. A further ¬£100 was provided in total for eight boys and eight girls who were pupil teachers. Initially the exhibitions were tenable for two years, but the trustees could extend them for a further year. The age for pupil teachers was raised in line with the Education Department's requirements to 15 years in 1899. At the same time, the ages for the other grants was raised to between 13 and 16 years. The pupil teacher system was closed down by the Education Act of 1902 and the money allocated for it was allowed to accumulate to be used for other educational purposes. In 1922, some of the money was used to fund special scholarships at the two schools which had been started by the schools themselves in 1917. In 1930, three-year scholarships were provided for pupils at the Rochester Junior Technical School (three boys) and Fort Pitt Junior Technical School for Girls (three girls). The trustees had discretion in awarding grants. Where all exhibitions were filled, it was possible for the trustees to fund a child as a fee-paying pupil at the charity's expense. The 1944 Education Act made many previously fee-paying schools into free state schools. Both of the Rochester grammar schools followed this route and as a consequence the exhibitions ceased. The trustees were able under the 1947 Act to resume payments of ¬£100 per annum to each school to be used for the encouragement of Music, Drama and the Arts, though the detailed application now lay with the school governors, not the trustees. The charity has made a number of grants to assist pupils at the King's School, Rochester, an independent school founded in 604 to provide choristers for the cathedral, though now with a much wider pupilship. Grants have also been made to enable Mathematics School boys and Grammar School girls to sail with the Sail Training Association (now called the Tall Ships Youth Trust). Grants have also been made to the Scouts. St. Catherine's Hospital In 1315, Symond Potyn founded a leper hospital near Rochester called St. Catherine's Hospital. The original building was at the foot of Star hill. In 1805, the hospital moved to new premises at the top of Star Hill, where it remains. In 1974, a proposal was made to amalgamate it with the Richard Watts Charity. Amalgamation duly occurred on 11 August 1975, thus ending 660 years of independent existence. The existence of a leper hospital in the area may have been the reason for banning proctors from the Six Poor Travellers house. Proctors begged on behalf of the lepers and were regarded both as a nuisance and a health risk.

Geography  It is part of the central massif of this mountain range and also lies on the Palatine Watershed. This massif stretches roughly from Hochspeyer via Johanniskreuz to the B 10 federal highway near Hauenstein. The region between Johanniskreuz and Hermersbergerhof is rather like a high plateau that is bounded by deeply incised valleys. From the Eschkopf hill, the ridge runs northwest over the Schindh√ºbel to the Blosk√ºlb () near the Elmstein village of Iggelbach. This ridge separates the upper tributaries of Speyerbach and Helmbach.  Viewing tower  On top of the Schindh√ºbel is a 17-metre-high observation tower, which was built in 1975 by an engineer unit from Speyer. From here there are views of the eastern Palatine Forest as far as the Haardt, as well as the striking mountain mass of the Donnersberg to the north and, in good visibility, the great Hornisgrinde mountain in the Northern Black Forest, 83 kilometres away to the south.

Life The fourth son of Sir Edmund Moundeford and his wife Bridget, daughter of Sir John Spelman of Narborough, Norfolk, he was born at Feltwell. He was educated at Eton College and admitted a scholar of King's College, Cambridge, on 16 August 1568. On 17 August 1571 he was admitted a fellow, and graduated B.A. 1572 and M.A. 1576. On 18 July 1580 he moved to the study of medicine. From 1580 to 1583 he was bursar of King's College and left the college in August 1583. He continued to reside in Cambridge till he had graduated M.D. Moundeford then moved to London, and 9 April 1593 was a licentiate of the College of Physicians, and 29 January 1594 a fellow. He lived in Milk Street in the City of London. He was a royal physician, attending Elizabeth I and then James I. Among his patients in the 1590s was Mary Glover, who became prominent as a supposed victim of demonic possession; Moundeford took her condition to be natural. The matter went to a celebrated trial, of Elizabeth Jackson accused of bewitching Glover, that divided the College, Francis Herring testifying for the prosecution case. Edward Jorden and John Argent supported the defence; but they lost the argument, with Moundeford apparently weighed on the other side. Moundeford was seven times a censor of the College of Physicians, was treasurer in 1608, and president 1612, 1613, 1614, 1619, 1621, 1622, and 1623. In 1611 he was called in to attend Arbella Stuart. Taking her side, or at least advocating for more sympathetic treatment, he suffered brief imprisonment at the time she was planning to escape to France. In later life, Moundeford became blind. He died in 1630 at the house of his son-in-law Sir John Bramston in Philip Lane, London. He was buried in the church of St. Mary Magdalen, Milk Street. Works In 1599 Moundeford published a translation of a French work by Andr√© Du Laurens into Latin, as De morbis melancholicis Tractatus. He became a recognised expert on melancholia. Moundeford published in 1622 a small book entitled Vir Bonus, a summary of what experience had taught him.It was dedicated to James I, John Williams, and four judges (Sir James Lee, Sir Julius Caesar, Sir Henry Hobart, and Sir Laurence Tanfield), part of his legal acquaintance through Bramston. The book is divided into four parts, \\"Temperantia\\", \\"Prudentia\\", \\"Justicia\\", and \\"Fortitude\\". He praised the king, denounced smoking, and alluded to the Basilicon Doron. He drew on his reading in the classics and Church Fathers. Family Moundeford in 1583 married Mary Hill, daughter of Richard Hill, mercer, of Milk Street, London. His wife died in her ninety-fourth year, in 1656, in the house in which they had lived together in Milk Street. Mary was a devout Anglican; their parish priest was James Speght, a neighbour and father of Rachel Speght. Moundeford's Vir Bonus showed him to be an admirer of Theodore Beza, They had two sons: Osbert, admitted a scholar of King's College, Cambridge, on 25 August 1601, aged 16; and Richard, admitted a scholar of the same college on 25 August 1603. Both died before their father, and their epitaph, in English verse, is given in John Stow's London. It was in the church of St. Mary Magdalen. He had also two daughters, Bridget, who in 1606 married Sir John Bramston, and Katharine, who married Christopher Rander of Burton, Lincolnshire.

In the area of constitutional litigation, the court dealt with the question of its jurisdiction in constitutional matters. The interpretation by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) of section 26 of POCA had been challenged on the grounds that it had failed to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, particularly the right to a fair trial. This was a constitutional matter, so the Constitutional Court had jurisdiction to hear it. On the issue of leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court, the court found that, since POCA was an Act of considerable importance and complexity, and since there were prospects of success in challenging the SCA's interpretation of the Act, leave to appeal should be granted.  Facts  Section 26 of POCA authorised the High Court to issue a restraint order prohibiting a person who has or will be charged with an offence under POCA from dealing in any manner with any property subject to the restraint order. The High Court also had a discretion in terms of section 26(6) to make provision in the restraint order for the reasonable living and legal expenses of the defendant. This case is concerned with the exercise of that discretion. Fraser argued that the failure to make such provision violated his right to a fair trial, including the right to legal representation. Fraser was arrested in 2003 and charged with racketeering, money laundering and drug-related offences. In November 2004, the High Court ordered a provisional restraint order against his property, placing it in the hands of a curator. He subsequently applied, in terms of section 26(6), to the Durban High Court for an order directing the curator to sell the property and use its proceeds for payment of the legal expenses in his criminal trial. ABSA, a creditor of Mr Fraser with a four-year-old default judgment against him in its favour, applied to intervene in the proceedings. It opposed the application for the provision of legal expenses on the basis that, if Mr Fraser were successful, it would be unable to recover its judgment debt.  High Court  The High Court confirmed the provisional restraint order, dismissed ABSA‚Äôs application to intervene, and granted Mr Fraser‚Äôs application. ABSA applied for and was granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA).  Supreme Court of Appeal  The SCA reversed the High Court‚Äôs decision. It granted ABSA‚Äôs application to intervene and dismissed Mr Fraser‚Äôs application for provision for legal expenses. The SCA held that the legislature could not have intended that a concurrent creditor, who had pursued a claim and obtained a default judgment prior to the issuance of a restraint order, would be prevented from satisfying that judgment simply because the debtor‚Äôs assets had been restrained. As a consequence of the SCA‚Äôs decision, ABSA‚Äôs claim against Mr Fraser was secured. Mr Fraser applied for leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court against the judgment and order of the SCA.  Constitutional Court = Jurisdiction  This Constitutional Court's jurisdiction is governed by section 167(3) of the Constitution, which limits it to constitutional matters and issues connected with decisions on constitutional matters.s 167(3)(b). In matters other than constitutional matters, the SCA is the highest Court in the land. \\"To attempt to define the limits of the term 'constitutional matter' rigidly,\\" held Van Der Westhuizen J, > is neither necessary nor desirable. Philosophically and conceptually, it is > difficult to conceive of any legal issue that is not a constitutional matter > within a system of constitutional supremacy. All law is after all subject to > the Constitution and law inconsistent with the Constitution is invalid.Para > 36. Nor was it appropriate, in a system of constitutional supremacy, to construe the term \\"constitutional matter\\" narrowly.Van Der Westhuizen cited the case of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of SA and Another: In re Ex parte President of the Republic of South Africa and Others 2000 (2) SA 674 (CC); 2000 (3) BCLR 241, in which the Constitutional Court had held that \\"the exercise of all public power must comply with the Constitution, which is the supreme law, and the doctrine of legality, which is part of that law.\\" In S v Boesak 2001 (1) SA 912 (CC), furthermore, the court had recognised that \\"the jurisdiction vested in the Constitutional Court to determine constitutional matters and issues connected with decisions on constitutional matters is clearly an extensive jurisdiction.\\" Nevertheless, Van Der Westhuizen continued, > the fact that s 167(3)(b) of the Constitution limits this Court's > jurisdiction to constitutional matters presupposes that a meaningful line > must be drawn between constitutional and non-constitutional matters and it > is the responsibility of this Court to do so.Para 39. In this regard, a contention that a lower court reached an incorrect decision \\"is not, without more, a constitutional matter.\\" Moreover, the Constitutional Court would not assume jurisdiction over a non-constitutional matter \\"only because an application for leave to appeal is couched in constitutional terms.\\" It was incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate the existence of \\"a bona fide constitutional question.\\" As Van Der Westhuizen cautioned, \\"An issue does not become a constitutional matter merely because an applicant calls it one.\\"Para 40. The applicant in Fraser had not challenged the constitutional validity of any of the provisions of POCA itself, or of the restraint order. Rather, he claimed that the SCA's interpretation of POCA was constitutionally problematic,Para 41. Section 39(2) of the Constitution, held Van Der Westhuizen, \\"requires more from a Court than to avoid an interpretation that conflicts with the Bill of Rights. It demands the promotion of the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights.\\"Para 47. The applicant contended that the SCA had failed to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights, particularly the right to a fair trial. This, Van Der Westhuizen found, was a constitutional matter, which meant that the Constitutional Court had jurisdiction to hear it.  Leave to appeal  Section 167(6) of the Constitution provides for appeals from another court to the Constitutional Court \\"when it is in the interests of justice and with leave of the Constitutional Court.\\" The Constitutional Court determines whether it is in the interests of justice to grant leave to appeal \\"through a careful and balanced weighing up of a number of factors.\\"Para 48. The court held that leave to appeal to it in the present matter should be granted, * because the constitutional matter raised was of considerable importance and complexitylPara 49. and * because \\"it cannot be said that there are no prospects of success.\\"Para 50.  Merits  The court upheld the SCA‚Äôs decision to allow ABSA to intervene in the proceedings, but held that the SCA was incorrect in holding that ABSA‚Äôs claim against the applicant was secured against the provision for his reasonable legal expenses. A decision to allow a creditor to intervene does not automatically result in an order to \\"ring- fence\\" its claim against competing claims and the defendant‚Äôs claim for reasonable legal expenses. The court interpreted POCA on the basis of its wording and structure, but also in the light of constitutionally-protected fair-trial rights. When a defendant applied in terms of section 26(6) for provision for reasonable legal expenses in a restraint order, the High Court had a discretion to provide for legal expenses. It also had a discretion to permit any creditor who applied to intervene to join the proceedings, and to then grant an order which was fair under all the prevailing circumstances. In doing so the Court had to take into account * an accused person‚Äôs right to legal representation; * the interest of the state in preserving the property; and * the interests of creditors. Under the circumstances of this case, the court held that it would be fair as well as practical to refer the matter back to the High Court to exercise its discretion in terms of section 26(6) of POCA.

In 1959 the Unionist candidate Robert Taylor had reduced the Labour majority to just 714 votes, thereby coming close to a surprise victory. The 43 year old Dr Taylor was selected again as the Unionist and National Liberal candidate. The Communist Party selected 50 year old David Bowman, a local engine driver who had contested the seat in the previous three elections. On 22 September 1963, local councillor Peter Doig was chosen ahead of five other people to be the Labour Party candidate. Doig, a bakery supervisor, was chairman of the Labour group on Dundee Town Council. He was also deputy chairman of the council and honorary city treasurer of Dundee. The short leet of six had been drawn up from a field of at least ten candidates. This included three other Dundee-based aspirants, one of whom was Doig's fellow councillor Bailie James L. Stewart. The Scottish National Party selected James C. Lees and were reported to have high hopes of achieving a good result following their strong showing the West Lothian by-election the previous year.

After also attending Ohio Northern University, he then graduated from Ohio University in 1908, playing football at all three schools. Lever then began teaching at today's Valley City State University in North Dakota that same year, where he also served as athletic director. The next year, he married Marguerite Sherburne, with the marriage producing nine children. After a few years the family moved to Missouri to farm.

It is located in extreme south-East in the Jaude Square, in the city centre.  History  In 1960, the local council wanted to refurbish the district called ‚Äúfond de Jaude‚Äù to build a shopping mall, housing and offices. This quarter was unhealthy and particularly depreciated. It was destroyed and the construction work for the shopping mall started at the end of 1978. The shops opened their doors on September 11 of 1980.  Architecture  Jaude Centre in 2007 Centre Jaude was designed by the architect Jean-Loup Roubert. The building is mostly made of concrete. At the top of it and to light up the different spaces where people walk there is a glass roof. Since its construction, the building was modified. The several changes are : ‚Ä¢ The addition of a new storey, which is now used by the shop Fnac and its bookshop department. ‚Ä¢ During 2008 a further extension was added which represents 500 square meters of retail space. The exterior facades opening onto Jaude square were partly renovated with the addition of window pane on top of the white panes which did not receive a good support from the public and were often criticized since the shopping mall's opening.  Importance  Jaude Centre is composed of a shopping arcade on three storeys, representing 22646 square meters and eighty shops. In 2005, it was ranked the fifth national commercial surface for the amount of money spent per square meter. The influence of the Centre Jaude is not only measurable for the city of Clermont-Ferrand but for the entire region because of the lack of other commercial centres in the area. Indeed, Centre Jaude received 6 million visitors each year from the four departments of Auvergne.  Present Shops  Sizes of the biggest shops: ‚Ä¢ C&A; (4 300 square metres), ‚Ä¢ The Fnac (2 200 square metres), ‚Ä¢ Go Sport (1 150 square metres), ‚Ä¢ Habitat (950 square metres), ‚Ä¢ Cinemas, Cin√© Alpes (Cin√© Jaude 2000 square metres) : a seven-screen cinema.

The applicants were South African citizens and their spouses, who were neither citizens nor permanent residents of South Africa. The case examined the constitutional right of spouses to cohabit and the need for Parliament, when granting government officials powers that touch on constitutional rights, to lay down proper guidelines. The case concerned an application to the Constitutional Court for confirmation of an order of constitutional invalidity, but the government had withdrawn its opposition to the order of confirmation. This, the court held, did not put an end to the proceedings; the court still had to determine whether to confirm, vary or set aside the order. Furthermore, the court had to determine what, if any, ancillary orders to make, and the relevant government department was best placed to assist the court in this regard. The court held that, if this is not done, its ability to carry out its constitutional mandate is hampered; indeed, the constitutional scheme itself is put at risk.  Facts  Section 25(9) of the Aliens Control Act required applicants for immigration permits to be outside of South Africa when their permits were granted, but it exempted spouses, permanent same-sex life partners, dependant children and destitute, aged or infirm family members of South African citizens and permanent residents: these people were permitted to remain in the country pending the outcome of their applications, provided they had valid temporary residence permits.  Judgment = Withdrawal of government opposition  Justice Kate O'Regan, writing for a unanimous Court, noted that the Minister and Director-General were respectively the political and administrative heads of the national government department responsible for the implementation of the Act, and the foremost sources of knowledge about its terms and objectives and general application. Their last-minute abandonment, both of their appeal and of their opposition to the confirmation proceedings, was \\"inconvenient and discourteous,\\" O'Regan wrote.Para 14. \\"Much more serious\\" in its consequences was the absence of legal representation on behalf of the respondents at the hearing. Where the confirmation of an order of constitutional invalidity was under consideration by the court, O'Regan held, the abandonment of an appeal did not put an end to the proceedings. The court still had to decide whether to confirm or vary or set aside the order. Moreover, the Court had to determine what ancillary orders should be made, if any. The relevant government department was best placed to assist the court in crafting such ancillary orders, by informing it of the potential disruption that an order of invalidity might cause. A common or frequent issue arising in such matters was the time the department would need to replace the unconstitutional provision.Para 15. Section 8(2) of the Constitutional Court Complementary ActAct 13 of 1995. provides that, when an order of constitutional invalidity is referred to the Constitutional Court for confirmation, the President of the Court may request the Minister of Justice to appoint counsel to present argument to the court at the confirmation proceedings. This provision, O'Regan wrote, \\"enables the Court to ensure that it obtains the necessary argument in relation to such proceedings.\\" By withdrawing from these proceedings \\"at such a late stage,\\" the respondents had not only deprived the court of the benefit of being able to canvass the issues relating to confirmation fully at the proceedings, but also had made it \\"impossible,\\" she wrote, for the President of the Court to ask the Minister of Justice to appoint counsel to assist the court.Para 16. In the constitutional scheme, which \\"recognises the separation of powers, holds high the rule of law and enjoins all organs of State to protect the Constitution,\\" the Constitutional Court had \\"the special and onerous responsibility\\" finally to determine the constitutionality of legislation, and to declare unconstitutional legislation invalid. The court could best carry out this task if careful and detailed evidence and argument was placed before it by those in government qualified to do so, particularly when legislation was under challenge. If this is not done, \\"the Court's ability to perform its constitutional mandate is hampered and the constitutional scheme itself may be put at risk. It is for these reasons,\\" O'Regan wrote, \\"that the late abandonment of the appeal and the absence of the respondents at the confirmation hearing were unfortunate.\\"Paras 17.  Merits  O'Regan noted that there was no automatic entitlement to such temporary permits. Each application was to be considered on its merits, and the grant or extension of a temporary-residence permit to a foreign spouse might be refused. The South African spouse would then be forced to go abroad with the foreign spouse or remain behind alone, pending the outcome of the application. Many were too poor to have this choice, and had to remain in South Africa without their spouses. Enforced separation, O'Regan found, places strain on any relationship, and may destroy the marriage relationship altogether. Although the right to family life is not expressly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, such right is constitutionally protected. The right to family life is recognised in international treaties and receives protection in a variety of ways, while marriage and the family are of vital importance to society. Also, human dignity, entrenched in section 10 of the Bill of Rights, is of fundamental importance to South African society and constitutional interpretation, especially because of the country's past, when it was routinely and cruelly denied. Human dignity, O'Regan observed, is a foundational value which informs the interpretation of many, perhaps all, other rights. The right to enter into and sustain permanent intimate relationships, furthermore, is part of the right to dignity. Entering into and sustaining a marriage relationship are of defining significance for many people. Not only legislation that prohibits the right to form a marriage relationship infringes the right to dignity; any legislation that significantly impairs the ability of spouses to honour their obligations to one another would also limit such a right. A central aspect of marriage, she found, is cohabitation and the right and duty to live together. She held that legislation which significantly impairs the ability to honour this obligation therefore constitutes a limitation of the right to dignity. There may be, O'Regan conceded, constitutionally acceptable reasons for refusing the grant or extension of a temporary residence permit, but they were not identified in the Act. The legislature must identify the policy considerations that would render a refusal of a temporary residence-permit justifiable. It must take care to limit the risk of an unconstitutional exercise of the discretionary powers it confers, as it has a constitutional obligation to ‚Äúrespect, promote, protect and fulfil the rights in the Bill of Rights.‚Äù The omission from the Aliens Control Act of criteria relevant to a refusal to grant or extend temporary residence permits introduced an element of arbitrariness that was inconsistent with the constitutional protection of the right to marry and establish a family. Section 25(9)(b) was therefore found to be invalid, the invalidation being suspended for two years. In the meantime officials, when dealing with applications for the granting or extension of temporary residence permits of spouses of South African citizens or permanent residents, and the other persons exempted, must take into account the constitutional rights of such people, and issue or extend temporary residence permits to them unless good cause exists to refuse: for example, where even the temporary issue or extension of a permit would constitute a real threat to the public.

The operation began on 24 April 1954\\"1954: British crackdown on Kenya rebels\\" On this Day BBC: 24 April accessed 9 November 2013 and took two weeks, at the end of which 20,000 Mau Mau suspects had been taken to Langata, and 30,000 more had been deported to the reserves.\\"Operation Anvil\\" at History of Kenya accessed 9 November 2013  Background  In the early 1950s militant nationalism emerged in the United Kingdom's colony of Kenya in East Africa. By 1952 guerrilla attacks against white settlers and indigenous moderates, perpetrated by the \\"Mau Mau\\" movement, had proliferated the region occupied by the Kikuyu. On 20 October the colonial governor declared a state of emergency, initiating efforts by the British military to put down the insurgency. The first months of the British campaign were plagued by a lack of discipline, communication, coherent strategy, and useful intelligence and little progress was made against the Mau Mau. An assault on the Naivasha police station and a massacre of civilians in the village of Lari in March 1953 dramatically escalated the conflict. Mau Mau activity also began to surface in the city of Nairobi, which had a large Kikuyu population. Many Kikuyu were sympathetic to the Mau Mau cause and provided the insurgents with supplies. They also housed them, thereby facilitating attacks in the city and the neighboring Kiambu District. Lieutenant-General George Erskine (centre), observing operations against the Mau Mau. Erskine played a leading role in planning and carrying out Operation Anvil. In June General George Erskine was dispatched to Kenya to assume control over British forces. He immediately began instituting reforms and organised a series of attacks against the Mau Mau. In January 1954 the British captured rebel leader Waruhiu Itote, who gave them critical information about Mau Mau deployments and strategy under interrogation. Two months later the colonial command structure was overhauled, increasing decision-making efficiency and granting Erskine greater influence in the process.  Prelude  Erskine intended on relocating all Kikuyu, Embu, and Meru people from Nairobi, but the colonial government rejected the plan, citing potential harm to the local economy and administration. The operation was based on one British security forces had conducted in Tel Aviv, Palestine. Its legality was assured by the Emergency Regulations and the Control of Nairobi Regulations of 1954, the latter of which permitted the colonial governor to issue \\"Evacuation Orders\\" to remove and detain individuals from the city so they could be screened for connections with the Mau Mau. Four battalions were earmarked for the action. In the weeks preceding the operation rumors circulated among the African population that Nairobi was due to be subjected to a security sweep. Some insurgents moved to the outskirts of the city and were thus outside the cordoned area.  Operation  On 04:30 on 24 April British forces initiated Operation Anvil, sealing off every road and track leading in or out of Nairobi. Government forces then surrounded locations which were home to substantial Kikuyu populations in the city such as Makongeni, Bahati, Kariokor, Ziwani, and Pumwani, to prevent Mau Mau from escaping. Informers disguised with hoods identified suspected rebels to the authorities. Within 48 hours the British had detained 206 known insurgents. In the following weeks over 50,000 Africans were detained and questioned. Nevertheless, numerous leading figures among the rebels managed to escape from Nairobi into the countryside. The operation ended on 26 May.  Aftermath  Operation Anvil marked a turning-point in the British campaign against the Mau Mau. The action left the insurgents mostly isolated in the forested mountains of Nyandarwa and Kirinyaga without access to supplies and the assistance of passive supporters. It proved to be the most sophisticated undertaking of the Kenyan Emergency. In the following weeks Mau Mau activity surrounding Nairobi remained minor, though a few insurgents reestablished themselves in the outskirts. The British maintained a large security force in the city, conducted regular searches of the African districts, and monitored traffic in and out of the metropolis through the end of October. In the process of expelling the majority of Nairobi's Kikuyu inhabitants, the British had removed most of the city's unemployed and vagrant population. The local juvenile court was tasked with adjudicating the fate of the younger detainees, but was nearly overwhelmed by their numbers; in the months following the operation magistrates handled over 2,700 prisoners, in comparison to the 558 managed the previous nine months. The demographics of the city's labour force also changed dramatically, with only a quarter of Nairobi workers coming from Kikuyu, Embu, and Meru areas after the operation. The British devised a three-tiered classification system to handle their prisoners. The \\"White\\" grade consisted of detainees set to be released back into Nairobi or transferred to the native reserves. The released initially consisted of mostly trusted members of the armed forces or the colonial administration, though as the sorting process continued the category broadened. Around 2,150 women and 4,000 children were sent to the reserves. The \\"Grey\\" grade was made up of prisoners believed to be passive Mau Mau sympatherisers though for whom strong evidence suggesting their true loyalties was lacking. The last category, \\"Black\\", was reserved for detainees identified by the hooded informers or the Special Branch of the Kenya Police as potentially violent insurgents or terrorists. A few may have been prosecuted by the government, but most were funneled through the \\"Pipeline\\", a system of work camps, decreasing in brutality until an individual was \\"re-educated\\" and deemed safe to release on a native reserve.

This village is best known of its people who are mostly Madey-Khel Miagaan (The ancestors of Madey Baba and Serai Baba). The people of Gunyar are very hard working, honest dealing and guest-loving. There is a very healthy trend of education among the people of Gunyar. Primary and middle schools separate for boys and girls and the colleges situated on Gunyar Road (Degree College and Commerce College) are the best examples of this trend. The nearby villages of Gunyar are Thana, Chapai, Maizara, Aladhand Dherai and Nalu. Most of the people of this village also live in Karachi(In Karachi, the population of Gunyari people is greater than the village population), U.A.E, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and England. 2- Gunyar/Gunnar is a male first name of Nordic origin (in Old Norse Gunnarr [1]). The name Gunyar/Gunnar means fighter, soldier, and attacks, but mostly is referred to by the saying which means brave and bold Viking warrior (the towers of \\"war\\" and arr \\"warrior\\"). Gunder is a Nordic variant, G√ºnther is the modern German variant, and Gonario is the Italian version. Some people with the name Gunyar or Gunnar include. Medieval history Odigram near Barikot 25 kilometer northeast of Gunyar was the capital of the ancient Swati tribes which was overrun by Alexander in 327BC. The Greek warrior could not establish any durable rule but disturbed the region that called for intervention by the Indian Maurya Empire in 305 BC.

Shah Mansur a cousin of Malik Ahmad and a prominent leader of the Yousafzai was a follower of Mian Peer Dad and was given endowment of coveted property near Landaki popularly known ‚ÄúShah Mansur‚Äù during the land distribution among the Yousafzai clans (1525-1535) and was given the title ‚ÄúSarai Baba‚Äù. This was the property that the Khan Khel of Thana claimed during 1942-1946 but lost the bid because Quazi Mohammad Yousaf assisted by Sultan Mahmud produced evidence of Madhay Khel ownership in the court of Kenneth Pickman, political Agent Malakand (1942-1944).

The principality was proclaimed in 1813 when the victors of the Napoleonic Wars established a political reorganisation of Europe, which would eventually be defined by the Congress of Vienna. Proclamation The triumvirate assuming power on 21 November 1813 William Frederick, Sovereign Prince of the United Netherlands After the liberation of the Netherlands from France by Prussian and Russian troops in 1813, a provisional government took over the country. It was headed by a triumvirate (Driemanschap) of three Dutch noblemen, Frans Adam van der Duyn van Maasdam, Leopold of Limburg Stirum and Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp. This Driemanschap formally took control over the liberated country on 20 November and declared the Principality of the United Netherlands a day thereafter. It was a foregone conclusion that any new government would have to be headed by William Frederick, the son of the last Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic, William V. Although many members of the provisional government had helped drive out William V eighteen years earlier, most of its leading members agreed that it would be better for the Dutch to invite William Frederick themselves rather than have him imposed by the Allies. After receiving an invitation from the Driemanschap, William Frederick returned from his exile in England. He disembarked from HMS Warrior and landed at Scheveningen beach on 30 November 1813. While the Driemanschap offered to make him king, William Frederick turned it down, instead proclaiming himself \\"Sovereign Prince\\" of the United Netherlands on 2 December. He also insisted on \\"a wise constitution\\" for the liberated country. Constitution Later that year, a commission seated by Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp was assembled and tasked with drafting a constitution. On 29 March 1814, a so-called \\"Assembly of Notables\\" met in Amsterdam to vote for the final draft. 474 of the 600 members of this assembly showed up to vote and only 26 of them, mostly Catholics, voted against it resulting in the draft being accepted by a vast majority. The constitution, which would be in force for over a year, introduced a centralised monarchy in which the prince held much power, although it did contain some democratic elements. A unicameral States General was introduced with its 55 members elected provincially by the States- Provincial. Those States were in turn elected by cities, countryside and nobility. The States General had the right of initiative and had to approve or disapprove all proposed legislation. However, the prince could settle many affairs by decree, greatly limiting the say of the States General. The power of the provinces and cities was considerably limited compared to during the Dutch Republic. Several fundamental rights were adopted from the French period. The constitution included freedom of religion and there were provisions of law and criminal procedure. William Frederick was formally inaugurated as sovereign prince by the assembly in the New Church in Amsterdam on 30 March. Reunification In the former Austrian Netherlands, conquered by France in 1794 and annexed in 1795, the Allies made quick progress also. This presented the problem of what to do with this country. The thirty most prominent families of Brussels expressed the wish to restore the old Governorate-general of the Austrians and this was provisionally instituted by the Allies in February 1814 as their military government. However, Austria itself expressed little interest in resuming its rule. Therefore, the Allies provisionally apportioned the country to the new Dutch state in the secret annexes to the Treaty of Chaumont. This was further formalised in the Treaty of Paris of 30 May 1814, in which Belgium on the left bank of the river Meuse was apportioned to the (future) Netherlands, whereas the fate of the right bank area was to be determined later.Colenbrander, p. LXX How this was to be structured was however still to be decided, while certain expectations had been raised by the representatives of the Belgian people at Chaumont in February that also needed to be honoured in some way. These \\"loose ends\\" were taken care of in the protocol that came to be known as the \\"Eight Articles of London\\". Under this treaty signed on 21 June 1814, William Frederick was awarded with the former Austrian Netherlands. He became Governor-General of Belgium on 1 August, leading to personal union between Northern and Southern Netherlands. For all intents and purposes, William Frederick had completed the House of Orange's three-century quest to unite the Low Countries. William Frederick subsequently tried to get the assent of the (carefully selected) representatives of the Belgian people to the Dutch constitution, but encountered opposition from those who were suspicious of designs to undermine the position of the Catholic Church in those provinces. Nonetheless, the reunification was finalised on 16 March 1815 when William Frederick was crowned King William I of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in Brussels.Edward et al., pp. 522-524 References Category:States and territories established in 1813 Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands Category:States and territories disestablished in 1815 ","title":"Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands"},{"id":"41031291","text":"Robert Moln√°r (; born 24 June 1991) is a Ukrainian football defender of Hungarian ethnicity who plays on loan for Szolnoki in the Hungarian National Championship II.

He began publishing poetry in 1969, leading to his first volume Manweol (Full Moon in 1976). Ten years passed before his second collection. Lee served as vice-president of Chagjak gwa bipyeong Publish Company for maNy years. He has also worked as the manager of the Creative Writing Center at Dankook University, and in 2012 he entered the position of Chairman of the Board of the Writers Association of Korea. .\\" Work A poet of delicate sensibilities, Lee began his career depicting the gloomy everyday life under the Park Chung-hee military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s from the perspective of ordinary people‚Äîthe subject he has explored with much love and sympathy. Such love has manifested in his desire to seek more than mere confessional release in his poetry: Lee aims to transform his art into a song for the suffering masses. His early poems are long and prose-like even, expressing his compassion towards the poor and the weak, and at the same time, embodying his fierce determination to preserve his humanity even amidst hardships. In the 1990s Lee's poems became drastically shorter in length. Composed of no more than two or three lines, they came to resemble Zen Buddhist poems in their use of minimal language and compacted form to encapsulate profound meaning and symbolic resonance. Lee's poems from this period recall the fact the poet had made his literary debut with sijo or traditional Korean poetry characterized by highly restricted form.\\"Seo Jeongju\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Such evolution in Lee's poetic mode indicates that the urgency and the wrenching emotions of his early years have been replaced with psychological calm and contemplative leisure. Lee has acknowledged that it is perfectly fine for him if his poems are no more than small ‚Äúripples‚Äù that carry his heart out to the readers and ‚Äúlap at their feet for a moment like fallen leaves‚Äù before disappearing. Lee now hopes that in this age of excess, his poetry will remain just such small ripples. Lee's poetry is at once a gentle reproach to overly emotional poets and at the same time the humble confession of an aging poet who has weathered much hardships and has remained true to his art.

After the massacre the bodies were buried or dumped in wells.  Background  Bagbati Union was situated 14 km to the north west of Sirajganj sub-divisional headquarters. It is now under Sirajganj Sadar Upazila of Sirajganj District. When the Pakistan Army launched the Operation Searchlight and occupied Sirajganj, hundreds of Bengali Hindus from Sirajganj and the surrounding areas took refuge in the villages of Bagbati, Harinagopal, Pipulberia and Dhaldob under Bagbati Union. A day before the massacre, a meeting was held at Ghorachara School between the Razakars and the Peace Committee. At the meeting it was decided that more than 500 people of Bagbati, Haringopal and Alokdia would be eliminated.  Killings  On the early morning of 27 May, in a joint operation the Pakistani army, Al Badr, Razakars and the Peace Committee, surrounded the villages. The Al Badrs opened fire indiscriminately and killed more than two hundred people, mostly Bengali Hindus. Numerous residences were looted on set on fire by the Al Badr, Razakars and the Peace Committee. The Pakistan Army raped the womenfolk. Days after the massacre, the survivors dumped the dead bodies in the wells of the deserted houses of the erstwhile landlords of Bagbati and Dhaldob.  Commemoration  The victims of the massacre are remembered through memorial services every year. A few years back a small memorial was constructed in one of the wells where the victims bodies were dumped, in a joint initiative between the Bagbati Union Parishad and the locals. The locals have demanded the restoration of the mass killing site and the mass graves.

Uludaƒü. Initially, as an aerial tramway line, it went in service in 1963, and served for fifty years until it was replaced by a modern system of gondola lift and extended into a ski resort area. The installation of a new line became unavoidable due to increased demand by tourists. History The initial line was an aerial tramway built by the Swiss company Von Roll Holding to enable easy access to the country's biggest ski resort area on Uludaƒü. Construction work began in 1958 and the line opened on 29 October 1963, the 40th anniversary Republic Day. The base station is situated at Teferr√º√ß neighborhood of Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m district in southern Bursa. The long line served two stations at Uludaƒü, Kadƒ±yayla and Sarƒ±alan Yaylasƒ±. Two 20-seater cabins transported hourly 120 passengers. The service of aerial tramway ceased on 29 October 2013, after fifty years, to make way for a modern and higher capacity aerial lift system. New aerial lift The new aerial lift line was designed, and all the technical equipment was delivered by the Italian company Leitner Ropeways on a build‚Äìoperate‚Äìtransfer financing base for a lease period of 30 years. The stations were designed by Yama√ß Korfalƒ± from Bursa, who had worked with the renowned Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid in London. The transportation of material and the support towers to the difficult accessible areas in the national park was done by an aerial crane of Heliswiss. The construction works were carried out by Bursa Teleferik Company. The new line is long using the existing line of , and extending it to the area of Oteller as the end station, where hotels are situated. In the past, the hotels and the ski areas could be reached only by taxi or bus after arriving at the end station in Sarƒ±alan Yaylasƒ±. There are a total of 45 support towers between the end stations. 174 eight-seater gondola-type carriers are capable of transporting 1,500 passengers hourly between Teferr√º√ß Station at and the end station Oteller at an altitude of . There are also VIP cabins with four seats. The capacity of the new line is more than 10-times of the old one. The journey between the end stations takes 22 minutes. As such, it is the world's longest gondola lift line. The opening, initially planned to take place on 29 October 2013, the 90th anniversary Republic Day, was postponed due to delay in construction works of a new bigger station building in Sarƒ±alan Yaylasƒ± caused by a court order. * Teferr√º√ß, Bursa: * Kadƒ±yayla, Uludaƒü: * Sarƒ±alan Yaylasƒ±, Uludaƒü: * Oteller, Uludaƒü: See also * List of gondola lifts in Turkey References Category:Transport in Bursa Category:Aerial tramways in Turkey Category:1963 establishments in Turkey Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1963 Category:2013 establishments in Turkey Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 2013 Category:Tourist attractions in Bursa ","title":"Bursa Uludaƒü Gondola"},{"id":"41031387","text":"The Ruck Family massacre took place during the Mau Mau Uprising.

Between June 1953 and October 1955, the RAF provided a significant contribution to the conflict‚Äîand, indeed, had to, for the army was preoccupied with providing security in the reserves until January 1955, and it was the only service capable of both psychologically influencing and inflicting considerable casualties on the Mau Mau fighters operating in the dense forests. Lack of timely and accurate intelligence meant bombing was rather haphazard, but almost 900 insurgents had been killed or wounded by air attacks by June 1954, and it did cause forest gangs to disband, lower their morale, and induce their pronounced relocation from the forests to the tribal reservations.. Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, Lancaster bombers were not used during the Emergency, though Lincolns were. The latter flew their first mission on 18 November 1953 and remained in Kenya until 28 July 1955, dropping nearly 6 million bombs..: \\"Before the Emergency ended, the R.A.F. dropped the amazing total of 50,000 tons of bombs on the forests and fired over 2 million rounds from machine guns during strafing runs. It is not known how many humans or animals were killed.\\" They and other aircraft, such as blimps, were also deployed for reconnaissance, as well as in the propaganda war, conducting large-scale leaflet-drops.. After the Lari massacre, for example, British planes dropped leaflets showing graphic pictures of the Kikuyu women and children who had been hacked to death. Unlike the rather indiscriminate activities of British ground forces, the use of air power was more restrained (though there is disagreement. on this point), and air attacks were initially permitted only in the forests. Operation Mushroom extended bombing beyond the forest limits in May 1954, and Churchill consented to its continuation in January 1955.

In September 1998 he was charged with a second murder, for which he was convicted and sentenced to eighteen years' imprisonment. His appeal against the second murder, in August 1999, was successful, but the Registrar of the High Court negligently failed to issue a warrant for the applicant's release. He remained in a maximum-security prison until December 2004, over five years later. Throughout the years of his detention, his first murder case had been repeatedly postponed. In addition, the record showed that, on October 11, 2001, a magistrate had ordered that his case be postponed, and that he be released on warning. The record did not show why this was not done. He sued the Ministers of Correctional Services and Justice, the respondents, for damages arising from unlawful detention. In their defence the respondents admitted negligence but contended that, if the applicant had been released from maximum-security prison he would immediately have been transferred to a medium-security prison as an awaiting-trial prisoner.  High Court  The High Court found that his entire detention had been unlawful.  Supreme Court of Appeal  When the Ministers appealed, the Supreme Court of Appeal found that only the detention since 11 October 2001 had been unlawful.  Constitutional Court = Leave to appeal  The court held that the question of whether the applicant's detention was consistent with the principle of legality and his right to freedom and security of the person in section 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, was a constitutional matter. \\"In light of the view I take of the matter,\\" wrote Langa CJ, \\"the application for leave to appeal should be granted.\\"Para 22.  Merits  The legal issue before the Constitutional Court in this application to appeal to it (to have the whole five years declared unlawful) was whether it is lawful to detain a person as if he were a convicted prisoner where * the ostensible basis for his detention is absent because a court of law has upheld his appeal; but * he is awaiting trial on other charges. The court held that section 12(1)(a) of the Constitution enshrines the right not to be deprived of freedom arbitrarily or without just cause. The respondents bore the burden of justifying the applicant's deprivation of liberty. The applicant had been \\"deprived of liberty\\" because, inter alia, * the difference between the two prison sections was of great significance; and * the one was for awaiting-trial prisoners who are presumed innocent while the other was for those who were being punished. Respect for human dignity demanded that this difference be recognised. This obligation, the court observed, is entrenched in article 10(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and in sections 82 and 83 of the Correctional Services Act 8 of 1959, as well as Correctional Services Act 111 of 1998. The court held that the deprivation had been \\"arbitrary and without just cause.\\" Detention in maximum security had not been for any considered reason; it was due to negligence, and was therefore unlawful. The fact that a series of magistrates had ordered it was not sufficient to negate this finding.  Damages  Having found that his detention for the entire period was unlawful, in the sense that section 12(1)(a) of the Constitution was unjustifiably and unreasonably violated, the question now arose: Was that sufficient, in this case, to justify a finding that the applicant's detention was also unlawful or wrongful in the sense required by the private law delictual action of unlawful or wrongful detention? In Rail Commuters Action Group and Others v Transnet Ltd t/a Metrorail and Others, the Constitutional Court had considered the relationship between violations of constitutional rights in public law and delictual claims against the State in private law, and had unanimously held, on the one hand, that \\"private law damages claims are not always the most appropriate method to enforce constitutional rights.\\" It had held, further, that \\"it should also be emphasised that a public law obligation does not automatically give rise to a legal duty for the purposes of the law of delict.\\" On the other hand, the court also held that it \\"should not be understood to suggest that delictual relief should not lie for the infringement of constitutional rights in appropriate circumstances. There will be circumstances where delictual relief is appropriate.\\" Accordingly, the court had held in Rail Commuters that, when determining whether an action lies in the private law of delict when a public-law duty has been breached, the constitutional norm of accountability should be considered. Furthermore, careful analysis of the relevant constitutional provisions, any relevant statutory duties and the relevant context would be required. It would be necessary, too, to take account of other constitutional norms, important and relevant ones being the principle of effectiveness and the need to be responsive to people's needs. Having considered Rail Commuters, Langa found that Zealand was > not an appropriate case to traverse fully the complex relationship between > public law duties and private law remedies. Suffice it to say the following. > I can think of no reason why an unjustifiable breach of s 12(1)(a) of the > Constitution should not be sufficient to establish unlawfulness for the > purposes of the applicant's delictual action of unlawful or wrongful > detention.Para 52. Moreover, he noted, South Africa also bears an international obligation in this regard, in terms of article 9(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that \\"anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to compensation.\\" The breach of section 12(1)(a) was therefore sufficient, in the circumstances of this case, to render the applicant's detention unlawful for the purposes of a delictual claim for damages. \\"That,\\" wrote Langa, \\"will be the most effective way to vindicate the applicant's constitutional right. I expect that to be the case in most instances of unlawful detention.\\"Para 53. The order made by the Supreme Court of Appeal was accordingly set aside.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History In the 1910s, construction began on what is now US-23, opening northern Michigan in general, and this area around Grand Lake specifically, to more tourism. One of the families to take advantage of this was that of Newell A. Eddy, Sr., and his wife, Marianna McRuer Field Eddy. Eddy was a lumberman from the Bay City area, and the couple purchased the land around where the Lodge sits for their personal recreational use. The land was purchased in several transactions over the period 1908‚Äì13. Their son Newell A. Eddy Jr. (born in 1880) also used the property. In about 1920 Eddy Jr. had this lodge constructed on the family's property. Eddy also built the knotty pine furniture within the Lodge, with the help of area craftsmen. After the opening of the Lodge, Eddy established the \\"Habitant Shops of Presque Isle Lodge,\\" which constructed similar furniture for guests. The shop first operated from the Presque Isle Lodge property, but by 1922 had moved to Bay City. Newell A. Eddy Jr. died in 1940. His family sold the Lodge in 1944. Milton A. Underwood and his wife, Bessie C. Underwood, purchased it in 1947. They operated the Lodge until Bessie Underwood's death in 1977. Robert G. and Laurie E. Spencer, acquired a partial interest in the Lodge in 1986, and reopened it as a bed and breakfast in 1989. They purchased the remaining interest in 1997. The Lodge continues to operate as a bed and breakfast. Description The Presque Isle Lodge is a two-story gable-roof rustic wood- frame structure measuring 150 feet bo 36 feet. The exterior is faced with half-log sidong on the first floor and board-and-batten siding on the second. The main entrance is sheltered under a low gable-roof porch supported by two log front posts. A screened porch is on one end of the building, surrounding a massive fieldstone chimney. The entryway opens into a lobby with wood flooring and a massive fireplace. Log posts support the second floor, and doors near the fireplace also access the exterior porch. The main floor also houses an office, a small gathering space, bathrooms, and large dining room. The staircase to the second floor is in the center of the lobby. On the second floor, the lodge's visitor rooms are arranged along both sides of a central hall that runs from end to end of the building.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1978 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History Merritt Chandler was born in 1843 near Adrian, Michigan. He made a fortune in lumbering and then in building roads; in 1886 he platted the village of Onaway. By 1903, Onaway had a population of 3000, making it the largest settlement in Presque Isle County. In 1908, Chandler constructed this building and donated it to the county in an effort to wrest the county seat away from Rogers City. He was unable to have the county seat moved, so in 1911 a drive started to carve out a new county for Onaway, to be called \\"Forest County.\\" The drive failed, but as a compromise, county court sessions were alternated between Rogers City and Onaway until the 1940s. The building served various functions over the years, but began to fall into disrepair. In the late 1990s, restoration efforts began, and over $1 million was spent to improve the heating and electrical system, replace the roof and windows, refinish the interior, and install a clock in the clocktower. As of 2009, the building houses the Onaway Branch of the Presque Isle District Library, the Onaway Historical Museum, the Chamber of Commerce, and offices of the City of Onaway.

Starring M. Arief, S Waldy, Elly Joenara, and Soetijem, it follows a villager named Mardiman over a period of several years, in which he loses everything owing to his infatuation with a \\"modern\\" woman. Plot Through diligence and hard work, a young villager named Mardiman, has developed a successful career as a scribe. His wife, Warsiah, and her family have been unable to help him advance his career, as none of them have any influence. Not long after Warsiah gives birth to a son, Mardiman is promoted and asked to work in the city. There he becomes infatuated with a sophisticated city woman, one who is more \\"modern\\" than Warsiah. Mardiman leaves his wife and sick son so that he can be with this new woman, but soon spends all of his money trying to please her and treat her to a high-class lifestyle. Unable to support himself, yet unwilling to abandon his infatuation and return to the village, Mardiman begins to embezzle money from his office. After he is caught, he is imprisoned and loses everything he has in the city. After being released from prison, Mardiman is unable to find honest employment. He finally begins working for an underground arak syndicate. When the police raid the facility, Mardiman is severely injured. He is sent to a hospital, where he is treated by Warsiah ‚Äì who has become a nurse ‚Äì and their son, now a doctor. Mardiman soon repents his sins. Production Ajah Berdosa was directed by Wu Tsun for Jo Eng Sek's Star Film, with cinematography by Chok Chin Hsien. The story was written by Saeroen, a native journalist who had joined the company in 1941 for Wu's directorial debut, Lintah Darat. The black-and-white film, set and filmed around Batavia (now Jakarta), starred M. Arief, S Waldy, Elly Joenara, and Soetijem. Reception Ajah Berdosa was released in 1941, and by early January 1942 was already being screened in Surabaya. Targeted at all ages, it was advertised as \\"an extremely simple and touching story\\". An anonymous reviewer for the Soerabaijasch Handelsblad recommended the film due to the quality of its acting and technical aspects, citing it as having the \\"momentum and dynamics\\" necessary for success. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

Mikl√≥s Bercs√©nyi soon brought mercenaries from Poland, Moldavia and the Ruthenian (Western Ukrainian) regions.

In the battle the Kuruc forces repulsed the Austrians and their allies. After the battle Austrians locked themselves in Zvolen. Bercs√©nyi tried to starve them. During the night, most of the army tried to break out of the castle. But Ocskay raided the Austrians and destroyed them; very small soldiers reached the camp of Schlick in Bystrica.  Aftermath  The wounded Botty√°n was the Zvolen castle for three weeks. On 7 December they surrendered in exchange for a free getaway. The Kurucs occupied the country between Levice and Zvolen, and in several battles defeated the Austrian, Danish and Serbian forces.

Since the seat's creation in 1885, it had been won by a Unionist candidate six times and by a Liberal three times. The Coalition Government 'Coupon' at the last General Election in 1918 was awarded to the sitting Unionist rather than the Liberal challenger. Despite this, the Liberal vote held up very well; Robert Peel Candidates *The Unionists selected 53-year-old tobacco manufacturer Sir Arthur Churchman as their candidate to defend the seat. *The Liberal candidate from the last election, Rowley Elliston did not stand this time, despite his good showing in 1918. In fact, no Liberal candidate came forward. *The Labour Party, who had not contested the seat before, selected 46-year-old H.D. Harben, a former Liberal candidate, as their candidate to challenge for the seat. He had contested the 1906 general election at Worcester coming second.

The unknowns are usually the flow velocity, the pressure and density and temperature. The analytical solution of this equation is impossible hence scientists resort to laboratory experiments in such situations. The answers delivered are, however, usually qualitatively different since dynamical and geometric similitude are difficult to enforce simultaneously between the lab experiment and the prototype. Furthermore, the design and construction of these experiments can be difficult (and costly), particularly for stratified rotating flows. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an additional tool in the arsenal of scientists. In its early days CFD was often controversial, as it involved additional approximation to the governing equations and raised additional (legitimate) issues. Nowadays CFD is an established discipline alongside theoretical and experimental methods. This position is in large part due to the exponential growth of computer power which has allowed us to tackle ever larger and more complex problems. Discretization The central process in CFD is the process of discretization, i.e. the process of taking differential equations with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, and reducing it to a system of finite degrees of freedom. Hence, instead of determining the solution everywhere and for all times, we will be satisfied with its calculation at a finite number of locations and at specified time intervals. The partial differential equations are then reduced to a system of algebraic equations that can be solved on a computer. Errors creep in during the discretization process. The nature and characteristics of the errors must be controlled in order to ensure that: * we are solving the correct equations (consistency property) * that the error can be decreased as we increase the number of degrees of freedom (stability and convergence). Once these two criteria are established, the power of computing machines can be leveraged to solve the problem in a numerically reliable fashion. Various discretization schemes have been developed to cope with a variety of issues. The most notable for our purposes are: finite difference methods, finite volume methods, finite element methods, and spectral methods. Finite difference method Finite difference replace the infinitesimal limiting process of derivative calculation: : \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta x \\\\to 0}f'(x) = \\\\frac {f(x+\\\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\\\Delta x} with a finite limiting process,i.e. : f'(x) =\\\\frac {f(x+\\\\Delta x) - f(x)}{\\\\Delta x} + O(\\\\Delta x) The term O(\\\\Delta x) gives an indication of the magnitude of the error as a function of the mesh spacing. In this instance, the error is halved if the grid spacing, _x is halved, and we say that this is a first order method. Most FDM used in practice are at least second order accurate except in very special circumstances. Finite Difference method is still the most popular numerical method for solution of PDEs because of their simplicity, efficiency and low computational cost. Their major drawback is in their geometric inflexibility which complicates their applications to general complex domains. These can be alleviated by the use of either mapping techniques and/or masking to fit the computational mesh to the computational domain. Finite element method The finite element method was designed to deal with problem with complicated computational regions. The PDE is first recast into a variational form which essentially forces the mean error to be small everywhere. The discretization step proceeds by dividing the computational domain into elements of triangular or rectangular shape. The solution within each element is interpolated with a polynomial of usually low order. Again, the unknowns are the solution at the collocation points. The CFD community adopted the FEM in the 1980s when reliable methods for dealing with advection dominated problems were devised. Spectral method Both finite element and finite difference methods are low order methods, usually of 2nd ‚àí 4th order, and have local approximation property. By local we mean that a particular collocation point is affected by a limited number of points around it. In contrast, spectral method have global approximation property. The interpolation functions, either polynomials or trigonomic functions are global in nature. Their main benefits is in the rate of convergence which depends on the smoothness of the solution (i.e. how many continuous derivatives does it admit). For infinitely smooth solution, the error decreases exponentially, i.e. faster than algebraic. Spectral methods are mostly used in the computations of homogeneous turbulence, and require relatively simple geometries. Atmospheric model have also adopted spectral methods because of their convergence properties and the regular spherical shape of their computational domain. Finite volume method Finite volume methods are primarily used in aerodynamics applications where strong shocks and discontinuities in the solution occur. Finite volume method solves an integral form of the governing equations so that local continuity property do not have to hold. Computational cost The CPU time to solve the system of equations differs substantially from method to method. Finite differences are usually the cheapest on a per grid point basis followed by the finite element method and spectral method. However, a per grid point basis comparison is a little like comparing apple and oranges. Spectral methods deliver more accuracy on a per grid point basis than either FEM or FDM. The comparison is more meaningful if the question is recast as ‚Äùwhat is the computational cost to achieve a given error tolerance?‚Äù. The problem becomes one of defining the error measure which is a complicated task in general situations. Forward Euler approximation : \\\\frac {u^{n+1} -u^n}{\\\\Delta t } \\\\approx \\\\kappa u^n Equation is an explicit approximation to the original differential equation since no information about the unknown function at the future time (n + 1)t has been used on the right hand side of the equation. In order to derive the error committed in the approximation we rely again on Taylor series. Backward difference This is an example of an implicit method since the unknown u(n + 1) has been used in evaluating the slope of the solution on the right hand side; this is not a problem to solve for u(n + 1) in this scalar and linear case. For more complicated situations like a nonlinear right hand side or a system of equations, a nonlinear system of equations may have to be inverted. References # Zalesak, S. T., 2005.

Dishes are made using pure compounds instead of using animal or plant tissues. Herv√© This said the cuisine is like \\"a painter using primary colours, or a musician composing electroacoustic music, wave by wave, using a computer\\". History Note by Note cuisine was created by Herv√© This According to Herv√© This, Note by Note cuisine began in 1994. In the French edition of Scientific American, This wrote that he dreamt of the day when recipes gave advice like \\"add to your bouillon two drops of a 0.001 percent solution of benzylmercaptan in pure alcohol\\". This said promoting the cuisine was a struggle, between 1994 and 1999 (he gave the name in 1997) and he got no remuneration out of it (and even today, he is not selling anything, nor products, or machine, or education). After 2006, he convinced his friend the French chef Pierre Gagnaire to develop Note by Note dishes, and after about one year of work, Pierre Gagnaire served the first Note by Note dish ever served in a restaurant. They presented the first Note by Note dish (\\"Note √† note N¬∞1\\") in Hong Kong the 26th of April 2008. Then, after more common work, Pierre Gagnaire named the second Note by Note dish called \\"Chick Corea\\", after the jazz pianist of the same name. In 2012, This published La cuisine note √† note, where the concept of Note by Note cuisine is discussed. Since the proposal of note by note cooking, This succeeded having many places in world to organize Note by Note dinners of events. For example: \\\\- 2010 : lecture at the meeting of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, in Strasbourg, in order to invite two Alsatian cooks, Hubert Maetz and Aline Kuntz, to make two note by note dishes, that they did in front of the audience. \\\\- 2010 : at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Gastronomy, note by note educational dinner at the Ecole du Corbon bleu, in Paris. The chefs were Patrick Terrien, Patrick Caals, Fr√©d√©ric Lesourd, Bruno Stril, Philippe Clergue, Marc Thivet, Franck Poupard, Patrick Lebouc, Jean-Fran√ßois Deguignet, Jean-Jacques Tranchant, Nicolas Bernard√© (MOF), and Xavier Cotte. And the menu was the following: Royale de sous bois, blanc-manger truff√© et bouillon l√©g√®rement mousseux Profondeur iod√©e de poulpe et Saint-Pierre, √©cume et transparence de spaghettis aux c√®pes Pigeonneau en deux cuissons, sa compot√©e de cuisses, potimarron fondant, gel√©e aux polyph√©nols, asperges virtuelles Mille-feuille de ch√®vre frais au siphon Guimauve en deux textures Ardoise ¬´ This ¬ª Sucrette glac√©e au parfum de Menton \\\\- 2011 : for the International Year of Chemistry, the official partner was the Dow Chemicals Company, who accepted to fund a note by note banquet, the day before the official opening at UNESCO, in Paris : the 26 th of January, the team of the catering company Potel & Chabot, under the direction of the chef Jean-Pierre Biffi, served a wonderful menu : Sur une id√©e d'huitres : huitres de tapioca, bavarois d'amylopectine, tapioca de citron vert, eau de mer gel√©e, cr√®me d'huitres, vapeur cristallis√©e Souffl√© au homard, sauce w√∂hler et gel√©e de framboises Fibres de b≈ìuf, capellini, cylindres orange Boule de cassis This menu was also served at the Michelin Star Ceremony organized by the journal L'H√¥tellerie-Restauration, the same year in Paris. \\\\- October 2011, another note by note dinner was served by the chefs-teachers of the Cordon bleu School, in Paris.

For the first press conference, the chef Ismael Osorio and the scientist Erik Ayala Bribiesca, along with chefs and students of ITHQ, served four bouch√©es note by note to about 150 journalists. The next day, a note by note meal that was less ¬´ art moderne ¬ª was served to international journalists, with comments. \\\\- 2012 was also the year in which the public and free Courses on molecular gastronomy discussed note by note cooking. During three podcasted days of lectures, chefs were invited : Philippe Clergue, from le Cordon bleu, and Jean Pierre Lepeltier, the president of the Toques blanches internationales. The courses are on line on the internet site of AgroParisTech http://www2.agroparistech.fr/podcast/-Cours-2012-La-cuisine-note-a-note-.html \\\\- July 2012 : at Euroscience Open Forum, Dublin, Ireland, a lecture by Herv√© This was followed by the production of note by note food samples by the chef David Desplanques. -August 2012 : note by note cooking was shown to the students of the Eramus Mundus Master Program Food Innovation and Product Design, at AgroParisTech, Paris. The chef Jean-Pierre Lepeltier (H√¥tel Renaissance La D√©fense, Paris) came to show new note by note dishes. Later, there are too many things, such as a new workshop of the Toques blanches internationales, in August 2012, a press conference with demonstrations when the book \\"La cuisine note √† note en 12 questions souriantes\\" was shown to the press, with dishes prepared by chefs Jean-Pierre Lepeltier, chef H√¥tel Renaissance Paris La D√©fense, Laurent Renouf, sous chef H√¥tel Renaissance Paris La D√©fense, Julien Lasry, chef de partie H√¥tel Renaissance Paris La D√©fense, Marie Soyer, chef de partie H√¥tel Renaissance Paris La D√©fense, Mickael Foubert, chef H√¥tel Renaissance Arc de Triomphe, Lucille Bouche, sous chef H√¥tel Renaissance Le parc Trocad√©ro, Yannick Jaouen (sous-chef H√¥tel Mariott Rive Gauche Paris) \\\\- In 2013, the first International Contest for Note by Note Cooking took place in Paris. Pierre Gagnaire came and showed the dish named ¬´ Chick Corea ¬ª, that was previously shown at the Book Fair of Paris, some weeks earlier. Now, the Contest is having its seventh event, after : \\\\- 2014 : using methional \\\\- 2015, playing with proteins, octenol \\\\- 2016, using cellulose and trigeminal compounds \\\\- 2017, fibrous consistencies and acidities \\\\- 2018 : crackling In July 2013 the Company Mane produced a box of about 20 compounds that was offered to some French chefs, allowing training chefs in the restaurant of Akrame, then at the Plaza Ath√©n√©e. Since, all went faster, with about 200 lectures per year, all over the world, showing note by note cooking. Some items only: \\\\- in Denmark, in 2014,the University of Aarhus and chefs produced a note by note meal served to the king family. \\\\- in Estoril, Portugal, in Boston and New York, in some French culinary schools, as well, note by note cooking is taught. \\\\- in Japan, 2015, a collaboration of the Corbon bleu and Ritsumekan University led to showing note by note sushis to the press, by the chef Guillaume Siegler. Then, in 2015, when a journalist of the New York Times came to Paris in order to make a piece on note by note cooking, the chef Pierre Gagnaire accepted to make a whole menu in which all dishes were based on one single odorant compound. The menu was : Amuses bouche 1-cis-hexen-3-ol ga√Øacol et 2,4,6-triisobutyl-5-dihydro-4H-1,3,5-dithiazine 2-ac√©tylthiazole ac√©tyl m√©thyl carbinol ac√©tyl propionyl pip√©rine Chick Corea benzald√©hyde'' Now, the most important : \\\\- in 2016, a lecture at the World Chefs Association, in Thessaloniki \\\\- in 2017, a company was created by a young French entrepreneur to sell note by note compounds. \\\\- in May 2017, the chef Andrea Camastra moved to full Note by Note, in his restaurant Senses, in Warsaw, Poland \\\\- in February 2018, a 100 % Note by Note Dinner served by the Alsatian chef Julien Binz (Michelin Star), in Ammerschwihr, Alsace (France) \\\\- in April 2018, a Note by Note Dinner at the Culinary School Le Monde, Athens, Greece \\\\- in July 2018, two Note by Note Dinners served by chefs of the At- Sunrice Global Chef Academy, in Singapore, to Ministers, Ambassadors and other distinguished guests Now, note by note is regularly taught in some universities, including AgroParisTech and the Dublin Institute of Technology, whereas the International contest goes on every year at AgroParisTech. Preparation Ingredients used in Note by Note cuisine are called compounds, which include water, ethanol, sucrose, protein, amino acids and lipids. For example, in the \\"w√∂lher sauce\\" made by Note by Note cuisine, the following might be added: water, anthocyanins (for colour), sugars, ethanol, amino acids (for flavour), glycerol, phenols, quinones, and organic acids.

This suspected tumbler and relatively slow rotator was discovered by LINEAR in 1999.  Discovery  The asteroid was discovered on 14 July 1999, by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) team at Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site, near Socorro, New Mexico, USA, at an apparent magnitude of 18, using a 1.0-meter reflector. Its first observation was made by the Catalina Sky Survey in June 1999, extending the asteroid's observation arc by one month prior to its official discovery observation.  Orbit and classification  has a well-determined orbit with an uncertainty of 0. The body orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.7‚Äì2.8 AU once every 2 years and 4 months (852 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.58 and an inclination of 7¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Its Earth minimum orbit intersection distance is , which corresponds to 9.5 lunar distances. Its most notable close approach to Earth will be on 14 February 2173 at a distance of . The asteroid also makes close approaches to Venus and Mars.  Physical characteristics  The rare Q-type asteroid is one of only 20 characterized bodies of this spectral type in the SMASS taxonomic scheme.  Rotation period  Several rotational lightcurves were obtained from photometric observations by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ond≈ôejov Observatory and American astronomer Brian Warner at his private Palmer Divide Observatory, Colorado. Best rated results gave a rotation period of hours with an exceptionally high brightness variation of 1.1 magnitude (). Pravec's alternative period of 122 hours was later not supported by Warner. However, there are still other periods possible due to sparse photometric data points. The asteroid is also suspected to be in a tumbling motion, which makes the determination of its period more complex. For an asteroid of its size, it is a relatively slow rotator.  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, the asteroid has a high albedo of 0.35 and a diameter of 1.43 kilometers. Observations by the Keck Observatory in the thermal infrared gave a refined albedo of 0.13‚Äì0.14 with a larger diameter of 2.22 kilometers.  Chelyabinsk meteor fragment  is suspected to be related to the 20-meter Chelyabinsk meteor, which exploded as a bright fireball over Russia on 15 February 2013. Analysis showed similar orbits for both bodies and suggested that they were once part of the same object.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 30 August 2004. As of 2018, it has not been named.

The present building opened in 1976. The company is a Centre dramatique national (National dramatic center), a national public theatre. Artistic directors included Patrice Ch√©reau and Catherine Tasca (1982), Jean-Pierre Vincent (1990) and Jean-Louis Martinelli (2002). The theatre runs a film studio and an acting school which is connected to theatre studies at the Paris West University Nanterre La D√©fense.  History  The theatre developed from the Festival de Nanterre, first staged in 1965 in a circus tent. In 1966 it was moved to the University of Nanterre. From 1971 it was made a Centre dramatique national, a national public theater, and received public funding. In 1976 the theatre moved to the Maison de la Culture. That event is considered the inauguration of the theater. The building, which seats 900 people, is at 7 avenue Pablo Picasso in Nanterre. In 1982 the theatre was named Th√©√¢tre des Amandiers and directed by Patrice Ch√©reau and Catherine Tasca. Ch√©reau established a theatre school and a film studio. His first staging was Combat de n√®gres et de chiens by Bernard-Marie Kolt√®s, followed by the author's Quai Ouest, Dans la solitude des champs de coton and Le retour au d√©sert.

The association is a full member of the International Federation of Journalists.

As a player she represented the Italian women's national team and various clubs in women's Serie A. Playing style During her playing career versatile Bavagnoli played in several different positions. Beginning as a right winger, she developed into a full back, then a lateral midfielder. She finished her playing days as a sweeper. Coaching style Bavagnoli sends her teams out in a traditional 4‚Äì4‚Äì2, but will sometimes depart from her favoured formation depending on the players at her disposal. She expects her players to pressure opponents high up the pitch. Playing career=Club Bavagnoli broke into the team of hometown club Piacenza as a youngster. She stayed for five seasons until the club was dissolved in 1983. She moved on to Modena, then Lazio, where she won her first of seven league titles in 1987‚Äì88. At Lazio she also formed a friendship with Carolina Morace which would result in a long professional collaboration. Together with Morace, Bavagnoli played at Reggiana and Milan, leaving the latter in 1993‚Äì94 due to the club's financial difficulties. She moved to Torres, then continued her partnership with Morace at Aircargo Agliana, G√ºnther Verona and back at Modena. Retiring in 1999 at age 36, Bavagnoli finished her career with two seasons back at Lazio. In the first campaign she was player-coach, then she became player-assistant-coach under Morace who managed Lazio in 1998‚Äì99, having completed her own playing career. The team collected the 1999 Coppa Italia, beating ACF Milan 4‚Äì0 in the final. International She debuted for the Italian women's national team in May 1986, in a 1‚Äì0 win over Hungary in Potenza. She subsequently played in four editions of the UEFA Women's Championship as well as at the inaugural 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. She was part of the team which finished second at UEFA Women's Euro 1993, the Azzurre's best achievement to date. Bavagnoli won 80 caps for Italy, scoring one goal.The Italian Football Federation's (FIGC) official website reports 72 appearances and one goal, taking into account only matches played against national teams, not games against the \\"Rest of Europe\\" or those played in China against regional select teams such as Liaoning and Guangxi. Her final appearance came in a 2‚Äì0 friendly win over England in April 1997. Coaching career Immediately after retirement, Bavagnoli joined the coaching staff of Carolina Morace, who had got a job as manager of men's third division club Viterbese. Defeat in the second league match of the 1999‚Äì00 season caused the team's unstable owner Luciano Gaucci to say he would replace Morace's staff. Morace resigned, followed by Bavagnoli a few days later. In July 2000 Morace began coaching the Italian women's national team, with Bavagnoli as her assistant. They had responsibility for the senior and under-18 teams. In 2003 Bavagnoli assumed control of the Italian women's under-19 team and guided them to the 2004 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship in Thailand. She then returned to Lazio, as a technical director, alongside Antonello Belli. She worked with the female youth teams at Lodigiani and Fiano Romano, whose senior team she also coached in the 2008‚Äì09 season. From February 2009 to July 2011 she assisted Morace in coaching the Canada women's national soccer team, where they won the Cyprus Cup in 2010 and 2011 and the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup in 2010. Both left following Canada's disappointing 2011 World Cup campaign. On 10 December 2012 Bavagnoli began attending Coverciano to study for her UEFA Pro Licence‚Äîthe highest coaching qualification available. She was awarded the licence on 5 July 2013, the only woman who passed. Meanwhile, she had continued to work with Morace, in various ventures related to youth football. As of the 2018 season, Bavagnoli coaches AS Roma's female Serie A side.

The benedictine abbey was built in 708 or 709 by a Count Wulfoalde and his wife Adalsinde, probably to house the relics that Wulfoalde had brought back from Italy. It was dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel, a popular saint at the time, as can be testified by the establishment of the abbeys of Mont St Michel in Normandy and the Abbey of Honau in Alsace in the same period. In 1734 the tombs of both Wulfoalde and Adalsinde were discovered in the abbey. The abbey was placed under the authority of Fulrad of St Denis, chaplain to Charlemagne. In 755 a mayor Wulfoald, probably a relative of the founder of the abbey, was accused of high treason and plotting against Pepin the Short, was condemned to death. When Fulrad intervened to save his life, Wulfoald expressed his gratitude by giving King Child√©ric II his possessions, including the Abbey. The Abbey is best known for its abbot Smaragdus, who moved there around the year 814 with his monks from the monastery on Mt. Castellion. Some time between 816 and 826 Smaragdus obtained royal protection for the abbey from Louis the Pious, ensuring that wagons, pack-horses and ships would be exempt from customs taxes on goods transported between the monastery and its lands. Smaragdus achieved fame as a writer of homilies, and for his writings on the Rule of St Benedict. Smaragdus, who died around 840, was succeeded as Abbott by Hadegaudus, who was probably elected by the monks themselves. Abbots in the tenth century included Odon I, followed by Sarovard, followed by Odon II, who died in 995. Over the years, the abbey proved very popular with royalty, emperors and kings and dukes. In the 11th century, for example, it came under the protection of G√©rard, Duke of Lorraine. During the Middle Ages, the Abbey was famous for its relics, not least of which concerned Saint Anatole, Bishop of Cahors, whose body was reputed to have been transferred to Mihiel in 779. The Abbey was dissolved during the French revolution. The Church of Saint Michel The Abbey Church is known as the Church of Saint Michel. Part of the 11th century porch still remains. The nave was rebuilt in the 16th century and modified in the 17th century. The Church contains a walnut sculpture of the swooning of Mary by Ligier Richier dated 1531 (or 1537). image:Eglise Saint-Michel Saint-Mihiel 271108 03.jpgAltar of the Abbey church of Saint Michel, Saint Mihiel. image:Saint-Mihiel_-_√©glise_abbatiale_(44).JPGChurch of Saint Michel with organ loft. image:Saint-Mihiel - √©glise abbatiale (26).JPGDetail of the organ. image:Saint-Mihiel_-_√©glise_abbatiale_(12).JPGApse. image:P√¢moison_de_la_Vierge_Ligier_Richier_301008_1.jpgSwoon of the virgin by Richier The library Today the Abbey is best known for its library. The library is still on the original site, which it now shares with a school and, since 1978, with the town hall. The collections include 8780 books including 86 incunabula, 74 manuscripts from the ninth to the sixteenth centuries. It is housed in a purpose-built building, constructed in 1775. It is managed as a special collection by the municipal library. A number of the more valuable works are available online in digital form. The most famous of these is a 9th- century manuscript on the Holy Trinity by Pseudo-Athanasius, which was stolen during World War one, but discovered in a Hamburg bookshop in 2007 and reintegrated into the collection.

Career Morris played four seasons (1981 ‚Äì 1984) of professional hockey, mostly with the New Haven Nighthawks of the American Hockey League (AHL), where he scored 9 goals and 33 assists for 42 points, with 146 penalty minutes, in 156 AHL games played. Following his playing career, Morris turned to coaching and found his way to Clarkson. He became the Golden Knights most successful coach winning more games, regular season titles, tournament titles and reaching more NCAA tournaments than anyone in school history. In November 2002, Morris was fired three games into the 2002-03 season following an on-ice incident with one of his own players. Clarkson president Denny Brown said that in light of both the incident and Morris' refusal to take part in an internal investigation that had taken place, Clarkson had no choice but to fire Morris immediately.http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/college-hockey-coach-mark- morris-one-of-a-kind/-->] In professional hockey, Morris began his professional coaching career under Marc Crawford, serving from February 2003 to April 2003 as the Special Assistant Coach/Interim Strength and Conditioning Coach for the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL. Then, after a two-year stint at a prep school in Lake Placid, Morris landed a job with the Manchester Monarchs of the American Hockey League in 2006. He spent eight years as head coach, compiling a record of 339-223-67, making him the only coach in history with over 300 wins in both the college and professional ranks.http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/college-hockey-coach-mark-morris-one- of-a-kind/-->] In 2016 Morris returned to the college game, taking over at St. Lawrence, which is less than 10 miles from Clarkson University, and attempted to try and continue the success he had in the 1990s.

The film features Dhanush, Amala Paul, while Vivek, Saranya Ponvannan, Samuthirakani and Surbhi play supporting roles. Dhanush, besides acting, producing and distributing the venture in association with Escape Artists Motion Pictures, also worked as the lyricist and album producer on the film's original soundtrack. The film's album and score were composed by Anirudh Ravichander.The stunt department of this movie handled by Hari Dinesh The film focuses on Raghuvaran, a graduate who is unemployed for four years, and how he gets a job, whilst successfully overcoming various obstacles before and after finding employment. Principal photography commenced in August 2013 and was completed by May 2014, with the film being shot primarily in Chennai. The film was released on 18 July 2014, and received positive critical reception. The film grossed 190.8 million on its opening weekend and earned a worldwide collection 530 million during its lifetime run. The film was dubbed into Telugu as Raghuvaran B.Tech, which was released on 1 January 2015. It was remade in Kannada as Brihaspathi (2018). A sequel to the film directed by Soundarya Rajinikanth was released on 11 August 2017.  Plot  Raghuvaran is a graduate in Civil Engineering, but has been unemployed for four years. He is adamant about working in a job related to his field only and is unwilling to accept any other profession. He often comes into conflict with his father, who considers him irresponsible. His younger brother, Karthik, works in an IT company, earning well and, evidently, his father's approval. Raghuvaran's mother, Bhuvana, however, supports him. Raghuvaran falls for his neighbour's daughter, Shalini who hates him initially, but warms up to him after hearing about the difficulties he is facing and eventually reciprocates his love. One day, while Raghuvaran's father and Karthik are absent, he is asked to look after his mother, who has a heart condition. However, he goes out on a date with Shalini. He gets continuous phone calls from his mother, which he ignores despite Shalini's insistence to pick them up. However, on returning home, he finds out that his mother had died of a heart attack. Raghuvaran feels guilty about not being there when his mother needed him and develops depression. Meanwhile, Bhuvana's lungs are transplanted into Anitha, a chain smoker who developed lung cancer. Anitha's father Ramkumar is the chairman of a civil engineering company in Chennai and offers Raghuvaran a job as a token of his gratitude for saving his daughter's life. Raghuvaran accepts the job while also requesting Anitha not to smoke, which she agrees. Six months later, Raghuvaran is offered an assignment on a government project to construct high- rise flats to re-house people living in a nearby slum. Azhagusundaram and Manickam are appointed as his assistants. He successfully wins the contract from the government and begins work on it immediately. Arun Subramaniam, a business novice who took over his father's company's Chennai branch, bids for the same contract, even by using illegal methods. Furious that he did not get the land, he tries to thwart Raghuvaran's progress in a number of ways. Raghuvaran overcomes each of these obstacles and continues his work, but Arun eventually hires rowdies to beat up Raghuvaran's workers at the construction site. The workers get injured and end up in hospital, which prompts Raghuvaran to go to Arun's office to put an end to this issue. He makes Arun confess that he sent the rowdies, which is recorded by a micro spy camera, and demands an apology from Arun, blackmailing him that otherwise the video would be made public. Fearing that the video could tarnish his reputation, Arun's father, Venkat, sends his son to the hospital to apologise. Raghuvaran accepts the apology and the project is completed within ten months. On the day of the flats' inauguration, Arun and a gang of rowdies ambush Raghuvaran en route. He outwits them but spares Arun, much to Arun's surprise. Raghuvaran says he has no intention to compete with or beat him and wishes to be his friend. Raghuvaran takes Arun to the site on his moped, where the state public works minister and Anitha inaugurate the flats.

During the production of those films, Dhanush suggested Velraj to make his debut as a director and promised to play the lead role. After Velraj showed Dhanush the film's script, Dhanush agreed to play the lead role as well as produce the film. In July 2013, Dhanush confirmed his collaboration with Velraj, whilst also confirming the inclusion of Amala Paul as the female lead and Anirudh Ravichander as the music director. The title of the film, Velaiilla Pattadhari was unveiled on 15 August 2013. After the title launch, Dhanush confirmed that filming would start on 20 August 2013. Regarding the film's development, Velraj said, \\"Dhanush must have liked something about me to help me grow. It was during our Aadukalam days that he promised to make me a director and said he would act in my first film. Several directors would have lined up for this opportunity. He chose me. It's just a bond we share.\\" Velraj shot the film alongside his commitments as cinematographer for Poriyaalan (2014) and Vai Raja Vai, while Anirudh Ravichander and Kola Bhaskar joined the team as music composer and editor respectively. However, Bhaskar was replaced with M. V. Rajesh Kumar after scheduling conflicts arose. The film was planned as a \\"message to the youth with some comedy on rising unemployment and the growing frustration for jobs with love\\".  Casting  When Velraj showed Dhanush the script for the film, he was impressed by it and immediately offered to act in it as well as bankroll the venture. Velraj said besides acting, Dhanush suggested additional inputs to the script. Rather than demand changes, the actor collaborated with the director to develop the best script for the film. Dhanush's well-toned body was remarked upon by the media, but Dhanush clarified the workout was mostly for promoting the film rather than having done it as an integral part of his character. Velraj later commented about the requirement of a muscular appearance for a fight scene in the film's climax, resulting in Dhanush toning his body for the sequence. Dhanush's character Raghuvaran was named after the deceased actor of the same name. Amala Paul was selected to play the role of a doctor named Shalini. She described her character as \\"very different\\" from those that she had done before, and that the characters in the film were drawn from real-life archetypes. Vivek, who was added to the cast in May 2014, stated during a press meet of the film that he initially rejected the role and as a result, Dhanush decided to make someone else play the role. Vivek then accepted the role for Dhanush's sake. Saranya Ponvannan was selected to play the role of Bhuvana, Raghuvaran's mother, while Samuthirakani was chosen to play Dhanush's father. Samuthirakani was suggested to Dhanush by Vetrimaaran. Actress Surbhi began filming her scenes in early March 2014. Hrishikesh, who plays Karthik, Raghuvaran's sibling, received an SMS from Dhanush's production office, which asked him to audition for the role. He was selected after his screen test ended successfully. Amitash Pradhan played the main antagonist, Arun Subramaniam. Amitash was recruited from the Anupam Kher Acting School. In an interview with Gulf News, Amitash described his character to be not the \\"stereotypical villain\\" often seen in Tamil cinema, and that his character was more cunning.  Filming  Principal photography formally began on 20 August 2013. An initial production poster was released to the media on 25 December 2013. On 31 December 2013, the team released a teaser trailer featuring Dhanush, Amala Paul and Saranya. The team began the final shoot on 2 May 2014, with comedian Vivek amongst other actors joining the cast. Filming was completed on 4 May 2014. During the film's shoot, Velraj would often forget to say \\"Action!\\", but despite this, there were hardly any retakes. Being a cinematographer, Velraj gave priority to visual presentations and costume designing in the film. Director Subramaniam Siva, who had earlier collaborated with Dhanush for Thiruda Thirudi (2003), helped with the post- production work involved in the film. According to Velraj, during the entire schedule of filming, the speaking parts were completed in 52 days. Prior to the release, there were concerns raised that the film was similar to the Kamal Haasan starrer, Sathya (1988). Dhanush clarified that there were no similarities between the films, nor was it similar to another Haasan film, Varumayin Niram Sivappu (1980), except for the fact that the protagonist was unemployed. A scene in the film where Dhanush speaks about the education that he got in Ramakrishna Vidyalaya was muted at the request of the Ramakrishna Mission School administration.  Themes and influences  Velaiilla Pattadhari raises the issue of unemployed graduates in society. Dhanush's character, Raghuvaran, represented the unemployed graduate who is waiting to move up the social ladder. One scene shows Raghuvaran delivering a speech about the difficulties in finishing an engineering degree only to remain jobless, with some of them having to take jobs not related to their fields to make a living. Dhanush's characterisation was similar to his characters from his previous films like Polladhavan (2007), Yaaradi Nee Mohini (2008) and Padikkadavan (2009). Both Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu and M. Suganth of The Times of India compare Dhanush's and Amitash's characters and their encounters with each other to those that took place between the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah, David and the Philistine warrior, Goliath. The film shifts from exploring self-pity to proving a point, where the protagonist overcomes all hurdles and outwits a rich adversary, as well as building a successful relationship. The father-figure in the film disapproves of his son's continued unemployment, while his mother defends him. Karthik, meanwhile, is a contrasting figure, being settled and prosperous. Amala Paul's character, Shalini, is shown as Raghuvaran's confidante though he feels jealous when she interacts with his brother. The film also portrays the relationship between a mother and her son as particularly important.  Music  The film's soundtrack and score were composed by Anirudh Ravichander. The album, containing eight tracks, was initially scheduled to be released on January 2014, but the release was brought forward to 14 February 2014, to add two additional songs. The team also recorded a track described as a \\"lilting melody\\" between Dhanush and singer S. Janaki in October 2013. Anirudh promoted the album on Sun Music a week before the film's release. The track list was released on 10 February 2014. The album was launched at the Suryan FM 93.5 radio station with Dhanush, Amala Paul and Anirudh Ravichander in attendance. The album received positive response from critics. The songs \\"Velaiilla Pattadhari\\", \\"Poo Indru Neeyaga\\", \\"What a Karuvad\\" and \\"Udhungada Sangu\\" topped the Radio Mirchi South charts for 31 weeks.  Release  The theatrical rights of the film in Tamil Nadu were sold to Madhan of Escape Artists Motion Pictures. ATMUS Entertainment distributed the film in the United States. On 1 July 2014, Madhan confirmed that the film would be released on 18 July 2014. The film was released in 350 screens in Tamil Nadu. The film released in 60 screens in Chengalpattu, 65 screens in Kovai, 30 screens in Madurai, 30 screens in Trichy and 55 screens in Salem. The film also released in 60 screens in Kerala and 65 screens in Karnataka. The film was dubbed into Telugu-language as Raghuvaran B.Tech, which was released on 1 January 2015. The dubbed version was also a commercially successful venture.  Marketing  The official first look poster of Velaiilla Pattadhari was released by Dhanush through his official Twitter account on 24 December 2013. The teaser of the film was uploaded on YouTube on 9 February 2014. The official trailer of the film was released on 18 June 2014 on YouTube, and trended on social networking sites following its release, reaching 2 million views in two weeks.  Controversies  Some of the posters depicting Dhanush smoking were removed, followed by the complaint raised by the authorities, as this did not conform to the Tobacco Control Board's guidelines. The administrators of the Ramakrishna Mission School opposed to a certain dialogue used in the film. Director Velraj explained that they never contemplated such a huge opposition and did not want to hurt the sentiments of anyone and hence decided to remove the dialogue from the film.  Home media  The film's satellite rights were sold to Sun TV. The television premiere took place on 15 January 2015, coinciding with Pongal. The dubbed Telugu version Raghuvaran B. Tech was aired on Star Maa, which bought the Telugu satellite rights on 22 February 2015.  Reception = Critical response  The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Writing for The Hindu, Baradwaj Rangan said \\"There are films that cater to the actor, and there are films that cater to the star ‚Äî in , Dhanush gets a film where he gets to showcase both sides ... [Velraj has] given actor-Dhanush fans half a movie to love, and he's handed over the rest to the star-Dhanush fans. Is there much use complaining when both actor and star are in such fine form?\\"Rangan, Baradwaj (19 July 2014). Sify wrote \\" is a rollicking fun ride. It's pure unadulterated masala laced with all essential ingredients that work with mass audiences. Writer, director and cinematographer R Velraj has made a dream debut with a perfect commercial mix\\". M. Suganth of The Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"[...] Velraj (the cinematographer making his directorial debut) superbly manages to strike a balance between the emotional and mass hero moments.[...] It is fantastic to see Dhanush take this boy-next-door to mass hero mode and he has quite a few punchy lines.\\"Suganth, M. (18 July 2014). Retrieved 18 July 2014. Anupama Subramanian of the Deccan Chronicle gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"Dhanush has chosen a befitting script for his 25th milestone film and in the company of his favourite cinematographer turned filmmaker Velraj, who has churned out a mass family entertainer with \\", calling it a \\"wholesome entertainer\\".Subramanian, Anupama (19 July 2014).

Haricharan Pudipeddi of IANS gave the film 3 stars out 5 and stated, \\"While VIP fortifies Dhanush's heroism in a tailor-made role which he comfortably pulls off, it also achieves so many things right as a commercial film and that's what works in its favour. Dhanush reinforces he's still cut out for commercial cinema with \\".Pudipeddi, Haricharan (18 July 2014). In contrast, Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express wrote, \\"With its racy first half and a predictable second half, VIP is an average entertainer\\".Mannath, Malini (21 July 2014). Gautaman Bhaskaran of the Hindustan Times gave the film 2 out of 5, saying \\"Although presents a grave social malaise ‚Äì that of joblessness among engineering graduates in Tamil Nadu with 3000-odd colleges turning out hundreds of thousands of degree holders year after year ‚Äì the script plays goodsport. Performances do not lift the movie either\\".Bhaskaran, Gautaman (19 July 2014).  Box office  The film was released in 30 screens in Chennai alone.

His father, Lee Ki-baek is a leading South Korean historian. Yi was raised by a family of academics and as a teenager embraced aestheticism and began to work on his own writing. Yi graduated from Seoul National University with a BA in French Literature and an MA in French Literature. While at Seoul National University, Yi established the literary magazine Linguistic Explorations. Yi In-Seong went on to become a professor at Hankook University of Foreign Studies. Work With a spirit of experimentation, Yi In-seong has consistently challenged the narrative grammar of realism and conventional assumptions regarding the relationship between the author, the text, and the reader. Into the Unfamiliar Time (Natseon sigan sogeuro, 1983), Yi In-seong's first novel, tells the familiar story of a young man's wanderings, but employs narrative techniques designed to defamiliarize the depicted reality, such as blending of tenses, fusion of fantasy and reality, and overlapping of time sequences. ‚ÄúThe Tomb of the Years Past‚Äù (Geu seworui mudeom, 1987) and ‚ÄúNow He is in Front of Me‚Äù (Jigeum geuga nae apeseo) also employ some of these techniques to give shape to the inner consciousness of his characters. What Yi In-seong seeks to problematize is the perceived stability of the dichotomy between the performer and the spectator, the writer and the reader of the text, and ultimately the self and the other. In ‚ÄúAbout You‚Äù (Dangsine daehaeseo) and ‚ÄúMy Statement for Your Interrogation‚Äù (Dangsinui simmune daehan naui jagi jinsul), the author plays with various personal pronouns in order to deconstruct the stability of separate identities. Through such experiments, Lee Inseong attempts to heighten readers‚Äô consciousness and engage them more actively in the act of reading. Recognizing the violence implicit in language, these works dismantle established ways of reading and the habits of thought associated with such conventions.\\"Lee In-Seong LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: Works in Translation * On You (2013) * Jahreszeiten Des Exils (ÎÇØÏÑ† ÏãúÍ∞Ñ ÏÜçÏúºÎ°ú) (1983) * SEPT MEANDRES POUR UNE ILE (Í∞ï Ïñ¥Í∑ÄÏóê ÏÑ¨ ÌïòÎÇò) (1999) Works in Korean (Partial) Collections * Endlessly Low Breath (Haneopsi najeun sumgyeol,ÌïúÏóÜÏù¥ ÎÇÆÏùÄ Ïà®Í≤∞ 1989) * Imagining the Last Courtship (Majimak yeonaeui sangsang, ÎßàÏßÄÎßâ Ïó∞Ïï†Ïùò ÏÉÅÏÉÅ) (1992) Critical Study * Study on Moli√®re entitled Comedy of Festival (Chukjee gwanhan huigeuk).

The current building was constructed in 1814, making it the fifth oldest church building in the city. First Scots was photographed here in 1892. The buildings design was inspired by Baltimore Basilica in Baltimore, Maryland and contains a number of Scottish symbols in the stained glass windows and a symbol of Scotland, the thistle, on the wrought iron grilles. The building was built by Scottish brothers John and James Gordon. Their building replaced an earlier, wooden church, whose location is marked in the churchyard with tartan flags. The church has two bell towers, but its bells were donated to the military during the Civil War. For years after, the story was told that the bells were never replaced to honor the Confederate dead. In 1999, a bell, built in 1814, was reinstalled in the northern tower. St. Johns Church in Preston, Lancashire, England, had had eight bells in its own historic church, but no longer needed them when a replacement set was acquired. One bell had been damaged, but seven were passed to a British bell company. First Scots made plans to bring the seven working bells to Charleston and hang them in their towers. The southern tower, however, was found to be too weakened from the 1886 Charleston earthquake to support the six smaller bells. Still, the largest of the bells from St. Johns was hung in the northern tower. The bell, which weighs 1,470 pounds and is 43 inches in diameter, was funded in large part by congregant Bonnie Workman; the bell is named \\"Bonnie\\" in her honor.

After the murder, Pierron regretted what he had done and implored the demon to give life back to his son; the succubus consented but in exchange, demanded the man worship it.
