It is one of two islands in the 11 Finger Lakes.The other is Frontenac Island, in Cayuga Lake near the town of Union Springs. Frequently it is described as New York's smallest state park; however, while it is one of the state's smallest protected areas, it is not formally designated as a state park, but rather it is a \\"unique area\\" managed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. It formed from the alluvial deposits of nearby Sucker Brook. Limestone from the brook's bedrock dissolved in its waters forms rare lime carbonate oncolites, known locally as \\"water biscuits\\", on its shores. Rises in the lake level following the damming of Canandaigua Outlet have reduced the island to a small portion of its former land. The state and local activists have worked together to shore it up against erosion and prevent it from disappearing. Geography The island is located roughly south of the mouth of Sucker Brook and southwest of the end of the docks at the north end of the lake in Canandaigua. Although both those locations are in the city, the island itself is outside its boundaries, in the town of Canandaigua. The surrounding waters, like much of the shallow north end of the lake, are no deeper than it is sometimes possible to wade to it from shore. It is roughly long by wide, for a total area just under . Several mature deciduous trees grow on the island; the shoreline is marked by large piles of flat stones. Its terrain is level, barely rising above the water level. A granite boulder is located in the middle. History Canandaigua Lake, like all the Finger Lakes, was formed at the end of the last Ice Age about 11,000 years ago, from the glacial meltwater flooding the deep glacial moraines that typify the terrain of western Central New York. Squaw Island began to form as a sandbar created by the interactions between the sediments carried in Sucker Brook and the counterclockwise currents along the lakeshore. Prior to European settlement, the island had two long gravel spits projecting to the north and southwest; the adjoining delta of the brook would have made the island easy to reach from land without boating to it, especially at times of year when the water was low. The first humans known to have settled in the region, the ancestors of the Iroquois Native American tribes, did not live on the island, even though it was larger than it is now. However, flint arrowheads and other artifacts found on the island suggest it was used for hunting waterfowl and perhaps deer. It may also have been used as a staging area for Iroquois warriors in the area mobilizing against the Sullivan Expedition of 1779, during the Revolutionary War. While it is widely believed that the island got its name from its purported use as a place of refuge for Iroquois women during that time, the island's easy accessibility from the shore (even today) makes that use unlikely, and thus casts doubt on that story as the origin of the name. It seems more likely that it emerged from the island's use as a hunting and fishing spot. There have been some efforts to change it in the 21st century, as with other places with \\"squaw\\" in the name, since the use of the term is seen as insensitive. In 1900, paleontologist John M. Clarke published a paper about the rare oncolites that had long accumulated on the island's north shore. The disc-shaped white rocks, known locally as \\"water biscuits\\", were light yet strong when wet but brittle enough to break by hand when dry. They were formed, Clarke wrote, when lime that had dissolved in the water from the limestone bedrock that Sucker Brook flowed over precipitated after algae that had grown on pebble or gravel substrates used up enough of the free carbon dioxide in the water, a process that repeated itself enough times to form the biscuits. He called it \\"a most interesting instance of the influence of plant growth upon lime deposits\\" and compared to similar phenomena recorded in European lakes that help explain the formation of similar structures found in fossil records elsewhere. Clarke's paper attracted the interest of Mary Clark Thompson, a Canandaigua native and daughter of former governor Myron H. Clark. After the 1899 death of her husband, New York City banker Frederick Ferris Thompson, she had returned to Sonnenberg Gardens, her estate in Canandaigua, and used the fortune she had inherited from him to finance civic improvements. She used her influence and connections to have the island, which had been state property since the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, declared a New York State Museum Reservation in 1918 in order to protect it.At the time New York had almost no state parks and no state-level parks agency, nor any system for classifying and managing protected areas. The following year she had the large granite boulder moved to the center of the island, with an explanatory plaque affixed to it. Throughout the rest of the 20th century, Squaw Island would face threats greater than those that could be held at bay by making it a protected area. Damming of Canandaigua Outlet drove up the lake's water level, leaving most of the two spits permanently underwater. The delta was dredged out of existence in the late 1950s to allow better lake access from a marina to the west. In 1975 it was made part of the state's newly created Natural and Historic Preservation Trust. Two years later the state's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), which by then managed the land, tried to sell it to the Town of Canandaigua, within whose boundaries the island sat, for $1. In the mid-1980s the state's Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation dredged Sucker Brook all the way to the Parrish Street bridge in the city of Canandaigua in order to expand facilities for a state marine park and boat launch. DEC sank cedar logs around the island and took other measures to protect its shores from erosion. The DEC currently designates the property as Squaw Island Unique Area. Further protection efforts have been undertaken by a group of local citizen activists.

The white, wooden church was built in a rectangular style in 1725. The church seats about 90 people. The church is notable for its interior decorations. The walls are covered in Rosemaling, a type of Norwegian folk-art. History The church (called H√•landsdal kyrkje) was founded sometime before 1306 and it has been used for several centuries, serving the H√•landsdal valley. The first building was a stave church. In 1726, the old church was torn down and replaced with a new timber-framed church which seated 90 people. In 1890 the new H√•landsdal Church was completed about to the southeast. When the new church was built, this church was no longer regularly-used as a parish church. Shortly thereafter, it was purchased by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. Since then it has been a museum called Holdhus kyrkje and it is still used by the parish for special occasions.

The first geologic investigation of the formation was performed by Th√©venin in 1903, and apart from a description by G√®ze in 1938, the paleontological richness was not studied until a team of researchers of the Universities of Montpellier and Paris visited the site in 1965.Legendre et al., 1997, p.332 The karstified phosphate deposits are found from the Lot and C√©l√© River valleys in the north to the left bank of the Aveyron River in the south and from the Villefranche Fault in the east to the lacustrine deposits of the Aquitaine Basin in the west. The formation is found in fissures (karst) incising Jurassic and Triassic rocks east of Cahors.Astruc & Pellissi√©, 1988, p.8 The age of the fossiliferous unit, in which almost 12,000 specimens were found ranges from the MP16 to MP28 zones of the European land mammal age classification.

He was a military brat whose father, Raja Muhammad Hayat Khan Bhatti, was an enlist in the Indian Army, retiring at rank of Havildar, a Sergeant. His family hailed from a Muslim-caste of the Punjabi Rajput tribe. He was educated in government-run schools in Rawalpindi District and secured his matriculation from a local school in Faisalabad in 1928. After graduation, he followed his father, Sgt. Muhammad Hyatt, path and enlisted in the Indian Army in 1929 as a Sepoy (Pvt), where he was posted with the 2nd Battalion of the 10th Baloch Regiment (2/10th Baloch Regiment) of the Baloch Regiment {present 7th Battalion The Baloch Regiment (Steadfast Battalion)}. From 1929 until 1939, he worked hard towards reaching the one of the highest enlisted ranks and was eventually promoted as the Naib Subedar (the Warrant officer-first class (WO-1) as present in the Pakistan Army) and posted in supply and ammunition with the Service Corps in 1939. In 1939, WO-1 Sarwar was invited to attend the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun and completed his military training before gaining commission in the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Punjab Regiment (2/1st Punjab Regiment) of the Indian Army in 1943. In 1944, 2nd-Lt. Sarwar briefly served in the Burma, serving with distinction in the military operations in 1944‚Äì45 that earned him the Burma Star by the British administrations in Delhi in India.

A march towards the Uri region of the Indian Kashmir was commenced under Capt. Sarwar, and led an attack on the organized Indian Army's troops, forcing them to retreat from the Gilgit-Baltistan to Ladakh in Indian Kashmir on 26 July 1948. Capt. Sarwar's company followed the retreated Indian Army's troops to the Uri region where his unit faced off the strongly fortified enemy position located in the Uri sector. His company was only 50 yards away from the fortified enemy position as the Indian Army's soldiers begin their mortar shelling at his positions, and received instructions on leading the attack on the left side of the bunker where the shelling was taking place. Moving towards the new position, his passage was blocked due to the barbed wires and decided to move to cut the wires with only taking six men alongside. During the firefight, Capt. Sarwar used the bolt cutter to cut their barbed wires and due to the downpour of shelling, taking a bullet with a machine gun fire. On 27 July 1948, Capt.

Today it hangs in the Beethoven Museum in Probusgasse, Vienna, part of the Vienna Museum. A copy of the painting, once owned by Beethoven's biographer Alexander Wheelock Thayer, is now owned by the New York Public Library. M√§hler's 1814 portrait of Beethoven exists in two versions, and is part of a series of portraits he made of Viennese composers at this time. The portrait of 1804‚Äì5 M√§hler's portrait of 1804‚Äì5 = Background = Joseph Willibrord M√§hler was introduced to Beethoven by the writer Stephan von Breuning (1774‚Äì1827). Though eventually a court secretary, M√§hler was interested in music, was a good singer and did some composing. Beethoven took him to one rehearsal of Leonore in 1805. What is known about the painting stems from Alexander Wheelock Thayer's biography. He first came across the original M√§hler painting during a research visit (for his Beethoven biography) to Caroline Barbara van Beethoven (born Naske), the widow of Karl van Beethoven, the composer's nephew. Because Thayer owned a copy (see below), he was particularly interested in learning about the circumstances under which it was painted. He considered this painting the most interesting and engaging of the portraits he had encountered. He later interviewed M√§hler on 24 May 1860. Thayer characterized the friendship between Beethoven and M√§hler as one where composer's kindness was returned by M√§hler with warm affection and admiration for composer's genius. In offering recollections of Beethoven, M√§hler spoke of his 1804 portrait and wondered where it was. To his question, Thayer responded that it belonged to Karl van Beethoven's widow. M√§hler then revealed that he had a copy of it. M√§hler painted four portraits of Beethoven. Only the first image, dated by Thayer at 1804‚Äì05, contains a nearly full view of the composer. Beethoven apparently liked this portrait very much and owned it until his death.\\"Willibrord Joseph M√§hler (1778‚Äì1860), Ludwig van Beethoven, 1804 ‚Äì Fotografie von Rudolf Stepanek nach dem Gem√§lde von Willibrord Joseph M√§hler\\", Digital Archives Beethoven House Bonn. There are only three references to this portrait in contemporary Beethoven sources: #In the papers left by Beethoven there was an undated note to M√§hler: \\"I beg of you to return my portrait to me as soon as you have made sufficient use of it‚Äîif you need it longer I beg of you at least to make haste‚ÄîI have promised the portrait to a stranger, a lady who saw it here, that she may hang it in her room during her stay of several weeks. Who can withstand such charming importunities, as a matter of course a portion of the lovely favors which I shall thus garner will also fall to you\\"; #A brief reference in Anton Schindler's biography, noting its \\"insignificance\\"; #In his , (son of Stephan), provided a description of Beethoven's apartment. The portrait of Beethoven‚Äôs grandfather was prominently displayed in the entry hall, while the M√§hler portrait was on the back wall of a storage room where visitors were never admitted. The portrait presently hangs in the Beethoven Museum in Probusgasse, Heiligenstadt, Vienna, a division of the Vienna Museum.\\"Beethoven Museum\\", website of the Vienna Museum, accessed 20 September 2020. = Symbolism = The historian Owen Jander discusses the symbolism embedded within Beethoven's fifth symphony and the portrait, hypothesizing that both works were a \\"ritualized confrontation\\" ‚Äì a public yet veiled declaration of the composer's growing deafness, as a means of learning to accept it. Jander proposes that much of 18th to 19th century portrait painting can be considered self-portraits, commissioned at significant times in a person's life in which the details of the portrait were laid out by the subject. Elements such as the subject's pose, facial expression, clothing, accompanying objects and gestures are all part of the conventions of portraiture. Similarly, if any of these elements is depicted in such a way that diverges from typical depictions, that strengthens the message they intend to communicate by drawing in the viewer's attention. Contrasting gestures between right and left arm are typical and serve to sensitize the viewer to summon interpretation, or in the words of critic Philip Conisbee, a \\"narrative portrait with a didactic purpose.\\" Jander theorizes that an inspiration for M√§hler's portrait is Leopold Radoux's 1773 portrait of Beethoven's grandfather, also named Ludwig van Beethoven (1712‚Äì1773), which the composer had prominently displayed in his apartment. Notably, one of the features of this portrait (painted the same year as the subject's death) was a cape falling off the back of the subject. To Jander, this represents the overcoming of grief that befell Beethoven's grandfather upon the death of his wife from alcoholism while maintaining a family life (his son Johann‚Äîthe younger Ludwig van Beethoven's father‚Äîalso suffered and eventually died from alcoholism). To understand the possible effect upon the composer, Jander cites 18th century mathematician and art theorist Johann Georg Sulzer who in his Allgemeine Theorie der sch√∂nen K√ºnste provided an understanding on how an ancestor's portrait can have a healing effect on descendants. \\"The bonds of admiration and love between us and our ancestors are maintained and thus have a healing influence on the spirit, as though occasionally the deceased were still sitting among us‚Ä¶.a portrait can make almost as powerful an impression upon us humans as can the person himself.\\"  The plant  Jander notes that plant studies were part of the curriculum of the Dresden Art Academy where M√§hler attended, so it is natural to expect plants in his graphic work. The plant at the bottom left of the portrait Jander identified as Polygonum bistorta, commonly known as knotweed. The nature of this plant is of inflorescence (a cluster of flowers on a branch). In the portrait there are groups of knotweed shown in various stages, from initial blossoming with pink to mature florets with the color receded. (Jander charactizes Beethoven as \\"nature-loving\\" and recalls the Heiligenstadt Testament where the composer wrote \\"as the leaves of autumn fall and are withered‚Ä¶,\\" an allusion very similar to the one depicted in the portrait.) Jander proposes that the fading color of the plant is a metaphor to the composer's loss of hearing.  The lyre-guitar  Though M√§hler described the instrument as a lyre, Jander identified it specifically as a lyre-guitar, an instrument popular in the early 19th century. The interpretation is that, with his hand holding the instrument, Beethoven draws forth music. But lyre- guitars normally have six strings, while the one Beethoven is holding has only five. With the pegs of the strings arranged in two rows, Jander identified the missing string as being one of the higher-pitched strings, suggesting a visual metaphor for Beethoven's inability to hear high frequencies.  The cape  Leopold Radoux, Lodewijk van Beethoven, 1773 ‚Äì Beethoven's grandfather. This portrait hung in the main room of the composer's apartment.M√§hler's 1814/5 portrait Jander quotes Sulzer who described the arrangement of clothing in graphic art could depict \\"a soul agitated through passion.\\" Below Beethoven's back there is a dark blue cape which has fallen from his shoulders. Most of the cape lies in a heap in the lower right hand corner of the picture, which \\"intensifies the message of divestment.\\" In part this is a reference to the painting of the composer's grandfather, whose falling cape represented the overcoming of grief.  The right hand  Sulzer (as quoted by Jander) said that gestures should never cause so much attention as to distract the viewer away from the face. The enigmatic nature of the depiction of Beethoven's right hand appears to have puzzled both Thayer and Jander. Thayer recalled M√§hler offering a description: \\"...the right hand is extended, as if, in a moment of musical enthusiasm, he was beating time...\\" Thayer provided his own thoughts: Like Thayer, Jander says the ambiguous meaning of the right hand is due to M√§hler's deficiency as an artist. Alessandra Comini observed that, in contradistinction to the portrait of his grandfather where his ancestor's hand is pointing at music already written, Beethoven's \\"hand rises, palm outward, in response to music heard and to be written down for the future.\\"  The action  In Jander's interpretation \\"the composer projects himself as turning his back (quite literally) to the darkness, turmoil, and half-dead tree that dominate the area to his left. Musical instrument in hand, he projects himself as beginning to move toward the calm, sun-drenched field [and temple to Apollo] to his right.\\" Just as music had rescued his grandfather from overwhelming grief, so too does music provide life's direction for Beethoven and solace from deafness. The portrait of 1814‚Äì1815 Around 1815, M√§hler produced a series of portraits showing contemporary Viennese composers, including, apart from Beethoven, Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Antonio Salieri, Ignaz von Seyfried and Michael Umlauf.Friedensbl√§tter. Eine Zeitschrift f√ºr Leben, Literatur und Kunst, Vienna, year 2, no. 63, 27. May 1815, p. 252 (digitised) Most of these portraits entered the collection of the Viennese music society, the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. As written in the music journal Allgemeine Musikzeitung in August 1815, \\"all of them distinguish themselves in a most creditable way through the effectual brush stroke, the descriptive resemblance and the distinctive expression of their soul\\".\\"Notizen\\" in Allgemeine Musikzeitung, 1815/34, 23 August 1815, p. 570 A half length portrait of Beethoven was part of the series. The painter created several versions of this portrait. Thayer's copy of the 1804-5 portrait Thayer's copy of the 1804‚Äì1805 portraitEstimated to have been painted around 1808, this painting is a copy by an unidentified painter of the portrait of Beethoven by M√§hler. This copy was owned for many years by Alexander Wheelock Thayer, author of the first scholarly biography of the composer, who considered it one of his most prized possessions. Today the painting belongs to the New York Public Library.Bob Kosovsky, \\"Happy 240th, Beethoven! And thank you, Beethoven Association!\\", New York Public Library blog, 16 December 2010, accessed 20 September 2020 Thayer estimated the copy of M√§hler's portrait to have been painted approximately in 1808 by an unidentified artist (it is known that M√§hler did not paint the copy himself). The date derives from a listing in an 1890 exhibition catalog for a Beethoven festival held in Bonn.' (Bonn: Verlag des Vereins Beethoven-Haus, 1890). Since Thayer was still living in 1890, musicologists Luigi Bellofatto and Owen Jander surmise that he must have personally lent the portrait for exhibition and most likely provided the date. The earliest known owner of the portrait was Ferdinand Luib, editor of the noted musical journal, the '. Bellofatto and Jander hypothesize that Luib, having unsuccessfully compiled materials for a biography of Franz Schubert, recognized the same research drive in Thayer and presented him with the portrait as a gift. When Thayer was appointed US Consul to Italy, the portrait hung the American Consulate in Trieste. (Thayer held the position from 1865 until 1882). Upon Thayer's death in 1897, it was inherited by his niece Susan Elizabeth Fox. She donated it to the Beethoven Association, a New York-based group that came into existence for the purpose of translating Thayer's biography into English by producing chamber music concerts. (The translation by Henry Edward Krehbiel was first published by the Beethoven Association for its members in 1921). In 1940, the Beethoven Association disbanded and donated its holdings (including the painting) to the New York Public Library. At its opening in 1965, the painting hung in the Music Division's Special Collections reading room of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Since the 2001 renovation, the painting has hung in the Special Collections Reading Room named for Katherine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic.

Gizmodo Brazil ranked Tawkers in their list of top iPhone Apps for that particular month. In 2016, Tawkers began work on a SaaS product, creating an enterprise solution for brands, agencies and publishers to create and manage public messaging content between influencers. The content is then embedded across the client's media. This new offering followed a partnership with NBCUniversal and 360i in which the companies utilized the technology to create content for their owned, earned and paid media channels, as well as within mobile applications. The first campaign was with the Bravo TV show Odd Mom Out. Background Blake Ian is the current CEO and co-founded the company in 2011 in New York City after having the idea of sharing text conversations while he was chatting with a friend about a film over instant messaging. In late 2011, after developing the idea, the company received $360,000 in seed funding. Following the development of a beta in 2013, Ian stated to TechCrunch that he believed that celebrities would use the Tawkers platform as a way to engage with fans and also engage conversation on given subjects. The app did just that in the early stages of the beta, with Lee Camp, Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal, Colin Quinn, singer Eleanor Goldfield, Deepak Chopra, and also Howard Rheingold using the app during the early parts of its existence. In 2016, the company announced that it had received $1.5 million in seed funding from angel investors. In March 2014, Gizmodo Brazil ranked Tawkers in their list of top Apps.

The SaaS platform works by allowing marketing professionals and content creators to create publicly accessible chats. These chats are then embedded across the internet within owned, earned and paid media channels as well as mobile applications. In 2014, Ian commented on the desire for people to share their own text conversations and read conversations by others, particularly celebrities.

In response to concerns over the partnership between the indie label and a major mainstream agency such as SM, Kang Byung-yong stated that while the goal of Baljunso was to \\"revive the nonmainstream genre\\", they would establish \\"a firm cooperative relationship [with SM Entertainment] for national and global distribution, marketing, and additional businesses.\\" Artists * HLIN * Wasted Johnny's * Sinchon Tigers Former artists *Play the Siren (2014-16) *Jang Hye-jin References External links * Category:South Korean independent record labels Category:Record labels established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in South Korea Category:SM Entertainment subsidiaries ","title":"Baljunso"},{"id":"43389011","text":"Poverty in Cyprus is not well documented, yet is still considered a major problem by the Cypriot government. Due to strong kinship bonds among extended families, poverty in Cyprus primarily affects those outside kinship networks, such as immigrants, divorcees and singles from small families. One study found a strong correlation between increased poverty and small family size. Poverty is also more likely to affect the elderly than the young, as a result of income to pensions raising the dependency levels. Statistical indicators and historical trend A report from the late 1990s (based on the Family Expenditure Survey of 1996-97) found that the Gini coefficient (which indicates income distribution) for Cyprus was about 0.36, and that the most vulnerable groups included the chronically ill, retirees, poorly educated people, and housewives (widows). Poverty and social exclusion in Cyprus have changed significantly following Cyprus' entry into the European Union in 2004. According to Eurostat, people \\"at risk of poverty\\" or social exclusion in Cyprus accounted for approximately 23-27%, roughly aligned with the EU average of about 23-26% in the measured period (2004-2012). In 2010, 16% of the population were part of households with income below ‚Ç¨10,189 per adult capita, corresponding to 60% of the median income per adult capita. People living in severe material deprivation compromised about 10% of the population. Living condition and deprivation indicators are set measurements of poverty. Objectively, basic commodities of material hardship, housing standards, and financial misfortune can hurt a family. Other symptoms of the economy, standards of living, or life satisfaction, play a role in how the household income is used. As a result of the toll that these specific indicators take on a family, that renders \\"social exclusion\\" relevant as well, by restricting the family's ability to develop. The EU formed the Social Protection Committee for this purpose for safeguarding inclusion, as shown in dataset Euro-25. A 2013 study by Koutsampelas and Polycarpou noted that \\"Poverty [in Cyprus], according to all indices, falls between 2009 and 2012. However, it increases considerably in 2013 (13.1%-32.9%) and thereafter it stabilizes at rather high levels\\". Following the 2012‚Äì13 Cypriot financial crisis, predictions were made that poverty in Cyprus will significantly worsen, but as of 2014 no conclusive evidence has supported this. The number of people living in severe material deprivation rose to 15%, though the at-risk rate actually dropped from 15.9% in 2008 to 14.7% in 2012. Unemployment in Cyprus rose from 3.7% in 2008 to 15.9% in 2013, and youth unemployment reached a record 32% that year. The long-term unemployment rate rose more than sevenfold from 0.5% in 2008 to 3.6% in 2012. Reasons for poverty One of the cited reasons for poverty in Cyprus is a lack of education, though educational attainment in Cyprus has been rising to surpass the EU average, and therefore the educational attainment issue should become less relevant. Another factor, affecting the elderly, were inadequate pensions for private sector retirees; a 1980 pension reform has produced an as-yet immature system, which is expected to generate higher pension payments in years to come. On the other hand, child poverty in Cyprus has been relatively low. Government attitude With a boost in the economy, following recession in 2003, Cyprus is applying time to lowering the public's debt in the GDP, from 70.3% in 2004 to under 60% by 2007. The level of poverty can be related to the topic of income and living conditions, for that can measure the standing of a household or an individual to point out the inequalities that underlie a society. Although there are no statistics showing how many people are below the poverty line, 42.3% of the population are dependent on someone, whether youth or elderly. There are also 28.9% ‚Äúat risk of poverty‚Äù as of 2015 that continues to be affected with the need for money grows. The highest at risk of poverty are the elderly, for the difference in income to pensions is greatly exaggerated, that they are forced to be dependent on their working family. Cyprus illustrates a growing need for welfare every year because unemployment rates continue to increase, i.e. 2013 with 14.8% to 16% in 2014. On 10 July 2014, the Cypriot government established the guaranteed minimum income through the approval of House of Representatives, which allows a monthly allowance as a helping hand. This changed the prior Public Assistance that spread resources too thin, and to those that were no longer in need of the resources provided. Although the GMI would be accessible \\"for all citizens\\", as said by President Nicos Anastasiades, it would be received through a means-test. These terms of a fixed minimum income aided in the issue of unemployment, and has created a downward trend from 15% to 13%, following suit across the EU.

In 2014, NASA announced that it would proceed with development of Block 1B with the EUS, and would use it on EM-2. In April 2016, it was reported that NASA has chosen to use a design based on four RL10-C3 engines for the EUS, and in October 2016 NASA confirmed they had ordered 10 of the engines.

The fish is omnivorous and lives in freshwater rivers and creeks in Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia. Description The fish has a long and slender body. It also has eight dorsal fin-rays, anywhere from nine to eleven anal fin-rays, thirteen to fourteen pectoral fin-rays and eight pelvic fin-rays. The fish has a dark spot of pigment at the base of its first few dorsal-fins, which distinguishes Lythrurus ardens from similar looking fish in its habitat. In addition, the fish has a stripe that fades as it approaches the dorsa fin and several bands of coloration across the back of the fish. Habitat The fish lives throughout Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia. The range of the fish is believed to have been accidentally increased when it was used as bait and escaped into the natural environment. For example, the fish is believed to have been introduced to the York River in Virginia this way. It lives in freshwater pools rivers and creeks. The fish prefers clear and turbid water. It is largely absent from streams with trout in them. In winter, the fish tends to live in deeper and less noisy waters. Behavior The fish is an omnivore. It consumes chironomids, mayflies, aquatic insects, dipterans, and plants. The fish reproduces through spawning in fast-moving waters. They tend to stay in these waters until winter. The fish lays eggs during the same time and often the same nest as the longear sunfish. The two fish species work together to defend the nest from predators. Conservation status The fish is believed to have a generally stable population. It has a large habitat range and population. In addition, there are no major threats to its survival. Due to these factors, the fish is not believed to be at risk of extinction.

The term of fƒõi to excoriate the adversary was first used during the Warlord Era, in the form feifei, or \\"bandit troops\\".  History  The term of \\"Communist bandits\\" to describe the Communist Party of China was first heralded in the tumultuous years of the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and the Communists. On July 15, 1947, the Document 0744 ordered the Communist Party and its forces to be called \\"Communist bandits\\" as a form of rectification of names, to the exclusion of all other terms, such as \\"Red bandits\\" (in Chinese Ëµ§Âå™). Along with the term fei, the term was used in official documents to describe the authorities established on Mainland China and their agencies, and in several slogans such as \\"Fight against Gongfei's Animalistic Life\\". In the 1980s, the term was replaced by \\"Chinese Communist Authorities\\". The term is used today as a slur against Beijing authorities and their sympathizers, particularly by Taiwanese independentists. In 1996, Microsoft halted sales of its Windows 95 operating system in mainland China due to discoveries that it contained the term in Chinese-language input method software bundled with the operating system following police raids on computer stores. In May 2020, it became known that YouTube had been deleting any use of the term since October 2019. Comments containing the phrase would disappear without a given reason shortly after being posted.

The film stars an ensemble cast including Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Omar Sy, Daniel Br√ºhl, Matthew Rhys, Riccardo Scamarcio, Alicia Vikander, Uma Thurman and Emma Thompson. The film was released on October 30, 2015, by The Weinstein Company. Plot Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) was the chef at a high-class Parisian restaurant owned by his mentor Jean-Luc, until his drug use and temperamental behavior destroyed his career and the restaurant. In the aftermath, Adam went into self-imposed exile in New Orleans by shucking a million oysters to sober up, planning to head to London to restart his career and attempt to earn a third Michelin star. In London, Adam searches for old colleagues, beginning with his mentor's former ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel, Tony Balerdi (Daniel Br√ºhl), now a hotel manager of The Langham Hotel in London, under the ownership of the Balerdi family. Adam checks into one of The Langham's rooms then visits an old friend, Conti (Henry Goodman) and notes the talent of his sous-chef Helene (Sienna Miller), but she dislikes his arrogance and dismisses him immediately. A Paris colleague, Michel (Omar Sy), whose restaurant Adam had sabotaged out of jealousy tracks him down. After a brief fistfight, they talk and Michel forgives Adam then asks to work for him. Adam also visits a cutting-edge eatery run by Reece (Matthew Rhys), with whom he has a long-standing rivalry, and the visit ends poorly. Adam's former drug dealer realizes he has returned to Europe and attempts to collect Adam's outstanding debt. Adam convinces famed restaurant critic Simone (Uma Thurman) to dine at Tony's hotel. Tony realizes that Adam set this up and is reluctant to let him cook, but his kitchen is in such poor condition it would result in Simone shutting his restaurant down. Seeing no other way, he allows Adam to cook. Simone's favorable review convinces Tony to renovate the hotel's kitchen and hire Adam as head chef permanently. He stipulates that Adam must submit to weekly drug tests with Tony's psychiatrist Dr. Rosshilde (Emma Thompson). Adam agrees to the tests, although he is disinterested in therapy and throws himself into preparations for the grand opening. Another old friend, Max (Riccardo Scamarcio), joins Adam's team after being released from prison. Helene rebuffs further job offers until her boss, Conti fires her and sends her to Adam's kitchen. Helene is irate about being fired, but Adam convinces her to work for him by tripling her salary. Opening night is a disaster, and Adam furiously closes early, blaming Helene. He publicly humiliates her, escalating from verbal to physical aggression, and she quits. Adam goes on a talk show that he previously turned down to drum up publicity for the restaurant. At his second opening, a restaurant critic gives a positive review, enraging Reece. Tony convinces Helene to return with a doubled salary and some insight about Adam's behavior. Adam improves his attitude, but refuses her request for time off for her daughter Lily's birthday. Later, he notices his kitchen acting in a strange manner. Helene reveals that her daughter is at the restaurant under Tony's supervision, since she did not want to spend her birthday at home. Adam is upset, but relents and bakes Lily a birthday cake, which impresses Helene. With the restaurant's reputation established, Adam sets his sights on a Michelin star, still avoiding his drug dealer, even after Tony offers to pay off his debt. Adam takes Helene to the reopening of Reece's restaurant. Adam and Reece are civil, but the night derails when Adam spots his ex-girlfriend Anne Marie (Alicia Vikander), the daughter of his mentor, Jean Luc. Adam finds Anne Marie surprisingly forgiving after he abandoned her in Paris and missed her father's funeral. The encounter leaves Adam shaken and introspective about his failure in Paris. Early the next morning, Helene finds him at the fish market where they kiss in the alley behind The Langham on the way back to the restaurant. They are interrupted by the drug dealer's thugs, who take Adam away. He returns that night during dinner service beaten and bruised. Kaitlin (Sarah Greene), the front of house host advises Tony that two Michelin reviewers have arrived, and he cooks for them rather than going to the hospital. They send their meals back as it's too spicy, and Michel reveals he sabotaged the sauce with cayenne pepper as revenge for Adam's past cruelty before walking out. On the verge of a breakdown, Adam leaves the restaurant. He wanders the city, eventually arriving at Reece's restaurant drunk. Once inside, he begins to break down emotionally. Reece soothes him, and they part on better terms the following morning. Adam attends a group therapy session, then returns to the hotel, where he learns that Anne Marie has paid off his debt. She gives him her father's knives and tells him that she approves of Helene. Tony and Helene find Adam and tell him that the two men they thought were Michelin reviewers were actually just businessmen on a trip. Adam rejoices at the opportunity of a second chance, and he and Helene kiss. Altered by his experiences, Adam changes the way he runs the kitchen. As a result of his improved attitude and teamwork, the restaurant receives its third Michelin star. At the end, he sits down to eat the family meal with the kitchen crew, who are his new family.

Although six sites were shortlisted for possible selection by 2015, the competition was ended without a selection in May 2016 and replaced by a statement from the UK government regulatory agency that they would support rules that would allow a commercial spaceport to be built at any suitable location.

In narrowing the field, the overriding imperative of the licensing authorities was to find a location that limits danger and inconvenience to the general public. This led to all five of the short-listed locations being situated in coastal areas. The government ruled out two airfields in its consultation process: RAF Lossiemouth and Kinloss Barracks, in Scotland, due to operational defence reasons. The shortlist locations selected were: * Campbeltown Airport * Glasgow Prestwick Airport * Stornoway Airport * Newquay Cornwall Airport * Llanbedr Airport * RAF Leuchars was confirmed as a potential temporary facility.UK ministers issue spaceport shortlist, BBC.

While some philosophers insist that access consciousness differs from \\"phenomenal consciousness\\" (e.g., the way qualia feel), Dehaene considers the access/phenomenal distinction \\"highly misleading\\" and feels it \\"leads down a slippery slope to dualism\\" (p. 10). =Ch. 1: Consciousness Enters the Lab= Dehaene distinguishes conscious access from related but not identical ideas: \\"attention, wakefulness, vigilance, self-consciousness, and metacognition\\" (p. 25). He introduces the project of measuring neural correlates of consciousness using paradigms like minimal contrasts of images, masking (subliminal stimuli), binocular rivalry, and attentional blink. The attentional blink relates to the psychological refractory period, inattentional blindness, and change blindness. Olaf Blanke's studies on out-of-body experiences explore an example where conscious experience changes while external stimuli stay the same. In Ch. 4, Dehaene notes that correlates of consciousness are actually insufficient, because many things can correlate with conscious perception, including even brain states prior to presentation of a stimulus. Dehaene is most interested in neural signatures of consciousness that represent the consciousness brain processing itself. (p. 142) =Ch. 2: Fathoming Unconscious Depths= Dehaene reviews unconscious brain processing of various forms: subliminal perception, √âdouard Clapar√®de's pinprick experiment, blindsight, hemispatial neglect, subliminal priming, unconscious binding (including across sensory modalities, as in the McGurk effect), etc. Dehaene discusses a debate over whether meaning can be processed unconsciously and concludes based on his own research that it can be. An N400 meaning-based wave occurs for unexpected words even when masked or not attended to. Unconscious processing is not just bottom-up but can be enhanced when top-down attention is directed toward a target, even if the target never becomes conscious. Brains can even do some mathematical operations unconsciously, and sitting on a problem to let the unconscious mind work out an answer has proved helpful in several experiments. =Ch. 3: What Is Consciousness Good For?= While some view consciousness as an epiphenomenon of brains, Dehaene sees it as playing functional roles, such as * Collapsing many lower-level probability assessments into one conscious perception sampled from the Bayesian posterior distribution, allowing us to make a single decision, in a similar way as the FBI summarizes much low-level data into a single brief for the president of the United States. Convergence on a single interpretation of local receptive- field data does not occur under anesthesia. * Creating lasting thoughts that can remain in working memory for use at a later time. Daniel Dennett compares this with an echo chamber. In contrast, unconscious information decays away exponentially within about a second. * Reasoning through multi-step strategies and performing serial computations, such as the steps in figuring out that 12 x 13 = 156 in your head. Consciousness seems \\"to collect the information from various processors, synthesize it, and then broadcast the result -- a conscious symbol -- to other, arbitrarily selected processors\\" (p. 105). This resembles a production system in artificial intelligence. * Sharing the contents of our minds with others, via language and non-verbal signals. Brains can make confidence assessments in their opinions, which helps with combining judgments optimally. =Ch. 4: The Signatures of a Conscious Thought= Neuroscientists have found four \\"signatures of consciousness\\": # Greatly amplified brain activity in many regions, including parietal and prefrontal circuits. Unconscious perception is like a wave that peters out upon reaching shore, while conscious perception is more like an avalanche that gains momentum as it progresses. # Ignition of a late P3 wave when a word is consciously seen but not when it remains unconscious. Dehaene compares conscious perception to breaking \\"through the dike of the frontal and parietal networks, suddenly flooding into a much larger expanse of cortex\\" (p. 124). There are actually two P3 waves, and they seem to occupy bandwidth that prevents comprehension of other stimuli at the same time, which explains the attentional blink and the serial nature of consciousness. # A marked increase in the power of gamma waves starting at about 300 milliseconds after a stimulus. Contrary to an initial hypothesis by Francis Crick and Christof Koch, gamma waves around 40 Hz do not appear only during consciousness. But when they show up in unconscious processing, they do have a much reduced intensity. # Brain-wide synchronization of information in what's called a \\"brain web\\". Granger causality analysis shows strong bidirectional causality, with signals traveling both bottom-up (to relay sensory information to higher areas) and top-down (perhaps as attention or confirmation signals). Consciousness seems to have a \\"tipping point\\" or \\"phase transition\\" of sorts, an all-or-nothing cutoff. Dehaene uses the phrase \\"global ignition\\" to describe the process of neurons bursting into widespread activation, similar to the way an audience begins with a few claps and then erupts into synchronous applause (p. 131). Consciousness is slower than events in the external world. The flash lag illusion illustrates this because we can predict future positions of moving objects but not those of objects that suddenly appear. Conscious percepts have properties of \\"stability over time, reproducibility across trials, and invariance over superficial changes that leave the content intact\\" (p. 149). To prove causation between brain states and conscious experiences, neuroscientists have used transcranial magnetic stimulation and intracranial electrodes for patients undergoing surgery to directly create perceptions. An example is phosphene. =Ch. 5: Theorizing Consciousness= Dehaene discusses his version of the Global Workspace Theory of consciousness. Dehaene proposes that \\"When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain\\" (p. 163). He adds: \\"The flexible dissemination of information, I argue, is a characteristic property of the conscious state\\" (p. 165). Dehaene and colleagues have developed computer simulations of neural dynamics that successfully replicate the way in which distributed processing at the brain's periphery gives way to a stable, serial \\"thought\\" at higher levels due to feedback amplification of one signal and inhibition of others. The simulation showed the four signatures of consciousness described in Ch. 4 (p. 184). Consciousness seemed to behave like a \\"phase transition\\" between one unconscious stable state of low-level activity and another conscious state consisting of snowballing self-amplification and reverberation (p. 184). Subliminal stimuli fail to become conscious because by the time the higher layers try to amplify the signal, the original input stimulation has vanished (p. 193). Dehaene suggests that noise fluctuations in neural activity can be amplified and give rise to randomness in our streams of thought (p. 190). =Ch. 6: The Ultimate Test= Dehaene discusses coma, vegetative states, minimally conscious states, and locked-in syndrome. Recent findings have shown that a few patients without any ability to move (not even to move their eyes) still show intact consciousness as seen by their ability to answer questions in an fMRI. The trick is to instruct the patients to think about their apartments if they want to say \\"no\\" and about playing tennis if they want to say \\"yes\\", and the corresponding differences in brain activity can be observed. Different tests can give different answers regarding whether a clinical patient is conscious, and responses may depend on time of day or other factors. Hence, Dehaene suggests \\"to develop a whole battery\\" of tests that can be applied in many contexts (pp. 214-215). fMRI tests are expensive and burdensome, so researchers are exploring easier EEG communication methods (p. 215) and other brain-computer interfaces (p. 216). Dehaene and colleagues also developed a simple test for consciousness based on novelty of patterns in sounds. =Ch. 7: The Future of Consciousness= Dehaene explores consciousness in human babies, non-human animals, and machines. Dehaene reviews evidence that young infants are indeed conscious, although their global workspaces may run 3-4 times slower than in adults, perhaps because their myelin is not well established. Monkeys can be trained to \\"report\\" on their conscious experiences via actions rather than speech, and monkeys show the same sorts of brain and behavioral patterns as humans in response to consciousness tests. Dehaene adds that some animals, like monkeys and dolphins, show evidence not just of consciousness but also of metacognition. He speculates that maybe what makes human cognition unique is \\"the peculiar way we explicitly formulate our ideas using nested or recursive structures of symbols\\" (p. 250). Dehaene suggests that computers could become more like animal brains if they had greater communication between processes, more learning plasticity, and more autonomy over decisions. Of these design changes, he suggests that \\"at least in principle, I see no reason why they would not lead to an artificial consciousness\\" (p. 261). Dehaene suggests that the hard problem of consciousness \\"just seems hard because it engages ill- defined intuitions\\", and it \\"will evaporate\\" as people better understand \\"cognitive neuroscience and computer simulations\\" (p. 262). Dehaene also defends a compatibilist notion of free will and suggests even that free will \\"can be implemented in a standard computer\\" (p. 264). Reactions James W. Kalat thinks \\"Consciousness and the Brain is beautifully written, erudite, thoughtful, and likely to provoke discussion for years to come.\\" Kalat explains how Dehaene believes that consciousness is important for performing certain calculations that can't be done unconsciously. However, Kalat suggests that this leaves us with a puzzle: \\"Unless we assume that computers are conscious, the question remains why we are conscious when we perform certain functions, whereas computers can perform virtually the same functions without consciousness.\\" Kalat also finds inadequate Dehaene's dismissal of the hard problem of consciousness \\"in barely over a page of text\\" without further exploration of the subject. Alun Anderson agrees with the critics of Dehaene who think that consciousness as \\"brain-wide information sharing\\" isn't enough to resolve the hard problem. That said, he appreciates Dehaene's book and recommends to \\"read a chapter at a time because it is jam-packed with intuition-altering experiments.\\" Matthew Hutson calls Dehaene's book \\"smart, thorough and lucid, though a terrible choice for beach reading.\\" Hutson admires Dehaene's success with neural correlates of consciousness but feels that the hard problem remains unresolved. Like Kalat, Hutson finds Dehaene's dismissal of the hard problem unjustified because consciousness is \\"unique\\" in being \\"inherently private, subjective\\", unlike other phenomena that can be reductively explained. Ned Block responds to Dehaene's criticism of pure qualia divorced from information processing by suggesting that phenomenal consciousness can indeed play a functional role when it \\"greases the wheels of cognitive access\\" but that phenomenal consciousness can also exist without access.

This theory was developed as part of studies of computer based text generation. Natural language researchers later began using RST in text summarization and other applications. RST addresses text organization by means of relations that hold between parts of text. It explains coherence by postulating a hierarchical, connected structure of texts. In 2000, Daniel Marcu, also of ISI, demonstrated that practical discourse parsing and text summarization also could be achieved using RST. Rhetorical relations Rhetorical relations or coherence relations or discourse relations are paratactic (coordinate) or hypotactic (subordinate) relations that hold across two or more text spans. It is widely accepted that notion of coherence is through text relations like this. RST using rhetorical relations provide a systematic way for an analyst to analyse the text. An analysis is usually built by reading the text and constructing a tree using the relations. The following example is a title and summary, appearing at the top of an article in Scientific American magazine (Ramachandran and Anstis, 1986). The original text, broken into numbered units, is: Diagram of RST analysis # [Title:] The Perception of Apparent Motion # [Abstract:] When the motion of an intermittently seen object is ambiguous # the visual system resolves confusion # by applying some tricks that reflect a built-in knowledge of properties of the physical world In the figure, numbers 1,2,3,4 show the corresponding units as explained above. The fourth unit and the third unit form a relation \\"Means\\". The fourth unit is the essential part of this relation, so it is called the nucleus of the relation and third unit is called the satellite of the relation. Similarly second unit to third and fourth unit is forming relation \\"Condition\\". All units are also spans and spans may be composed of more than one unit. Nuclearity in discourse RST establishes two different types of units. Nuclei are considered as the most important parts of text whereas satellites contribute to the nuclei and are secondary. Nucleus contains basic information and satellite contains additional information about nucleus. The satellite is often incomprehensible without nucleus, whereas a text where a satellites have been deleted can be understood to a certain extent. Hierarchy in the analysis RST relations are applied recursively in a text, until all units in that text are constituents in an RST relation. The result of such analyses is that RST structure are typically represented as trees, with one top level relation that encompasses other relations at lower levels. Why RST? # From linguistic point of view, RST proposes a different view of text organization than most linguistic theories. # RST points to a tight relation between relations and coherence in text # From a computational point of view, it provides a characterization of text relations that has been implemented in different systems and for applications as text generation and summarization. In design rationale Computer scientists Ana Cristina Bicharra Garcia and Clarisse Sieckenius de Souz have used RST as the basis of a design rationale system called ADD+. In ADD+, RST is used as the basis for the rhetorical organization of a knowledge base, in a way comparable to other knowledge representation systems such as issue-based information system (IBIS). Similarly, RST has been used in representation schemes for argumentation.

Film career  Scott is a Seattle-based independent filmmaker whose first feature film was \\"Seat of Empire\\" (2009), a 3-hour long documentary tour of the city of Seattle using archival footage. In 2010 he directed and wrote \\"Waste of Time\\", a historical mash-up of original footage, archival images, and contemporary music meant as a portrait of consumer capitalism. Scott's first narrative feature was \\"100% OFF: A Recession-Era Romance\\" (2012), a docudrama about a kleptomaniac and the immigrant wife with whom he enters a marriage of convenience. It was followed in 2014 by \\"Pacific Aggression\\", a straightforward narrative about a social media addict and the blogger she stalks. In 2014, Scott announced plans to direct the (as yet uncompleted) feature film \\"Their Eyes Were Watching The Light,\\" a period piece about a hostage situation set in 1932. Writing career  Scott began a career as a writer in late 2014, contributing pieces about American politics and race relations to The Monarch Review and The Seattle Weekly. In July 2015, Scott was hired by City Arts Magazine as a columnist, where he runs an ongoing thread called \\"Faded Signs\\" about popular culture under late capitalism. In September 2015, Thought Catalog Books published Scott's short-form essay \\"Something Better: Millennials and Late Capitalism at the Movies\\" on iTunes and Amazon. In 2018, Zero Books published Scott's book-length history of the Millennial generation titled \\"Millennials and the Moments that Made Us: A Cultural History of the U.S. from 1982-present.\\" Political career Scott was a field organizer for US Representative Pramila Jayapal. Scott helped unionize Jayapal's 2018 campaign staff through the Campaign Worker's Guild. In November 2018, Scott announced his bid for Seattle City Council District 4 to replace interim council member Abel Pacheco. Scott received enough votes in the 2019 Washington primary election to advance to the general election in November 2019. Scott has received endorsements from alternative weekly The Stranger and local chapters of the Sierra Club and Our Revolution. In 2020, Scott served as the Washington State Field Director for Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders. https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/bernie- sanders-announces-washington-campaign-hires-including-former-seattle-council- candidate-shaun-scott/ Scott is a member of the 43rd LD Democrats and the Seattle chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. =Political Positions= Housing Scott advocates a housing policy geared toward decommodification of housing to combat soaring rents and homelessness. He proposes investing in public housing and implementing policies that discourage real estate speculation. Green New Deal Scott has publicly called for a municipal Green New Deal for the city of Seattle. This is set of policy proposals meant to reduce Seattle's carbon footprint by increasing urban density and investing in mass transit in order to reduce dependency on private cars. Labor Scott is a supporter of labor unions. In addition, he has proposed a \\"Freelancer's Bill of Rights\\" to ensure worker protections for gig economy workers, including mandatory contracts for work over 30 days, an end to non-compete clauses, and a portable benefits program. Municipal Broadband Scott supports the creation of a Seattle municipal broadband public utility, similar to what exists in Chattanooga, TN. Public Health Scott supports a harm reduction strategy to combat drug addiction, including the establishment of safe injection sites. He has criticized sweeps of homeless encampments as both ineffective and unjust.

Before his stint as a college administrator, Sharp was a professor of History at the University of Minnesota, Iowa State University and the University of Wisconsin, Madison. In addition to his achievements as an educational administrator, Sharp also made a significant contribution to the international history of the Great Plains and the Canadian-American West. This line of work is anchored by two books. The first is The Agrarian Revolt in Western Canada: A Survey Showing American Parallels,1948. Although Agrarian Revolt later would be recognized as a pioneering work of scholarship crossing the Forty-Ninth Parallel, in its time it was little appreciated. American historians were indifferent to Canadian topics, while Canadian historians were preoccupied with their own, nationalistic interpretations. The second book is Whoop-Up Country: The Canadian-American West, 1865-1885, 1955. Whoop-Up Country was well received, but Sharp, in retrospect, never thought reviewers and readers fully appreciated its revisionist cast. He intended the work to be a critical test, in the borderlands of Montana and Alberta, of Walter Prescott Webb's thesis of environmental determinism. Sharp concluded that Canadian national will, particularly the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, was capable of overriding environment as a historical influence on the Canadian Prairies.

Violence & Destruction was recorded in early 2014 in studios in Southern California: Maple, in Orange County, and NRG Recording in North Hollywood, Los Angeles. Producer Cameron Webb had worked with such acts as Kelly Clarkson, Mot√∂rhead, Pennywise, Silverstein, Weezer and Alkaline Trio. The album was released on July 8, 2014, through label imprint Victory Records. To promote the album the band toured on the Mayhem Festival 2014, playing on the Victory Records Stage with label mates Emmure, Ill Ni√±o and Wretched. Musical style, writing, composition Critics compared the album to P.O.D. (The Fundamental Elements of Southtown) and the Deftones (Around the Fur) for its \\"different\\" sound. Singer Carvajal has been compared to Chino Moreno and Sonny Sandoval; while critic Rob Houston appreciated the vocals, some felt putt off because of his \\"shameless, and almost smarmy sounding\\" performance, especially the \\"'woos'\\". Big Cheese notes \\"this four-piece blends the atmospheric musicality of Deftones with the rap rock attitude of Fred Durst, with powerful results.\\" Rock Sound says \\"Despite sounding like the odds are stacked against them, Islander stand a good chance of survival with their 100 per cent accurate nu metal recreations.\\" They went onto write Islander \\"exhumed P.O.D.'s corpse (or did it rise from the dead itself?) with forensic precision and mated it with Chino Moreno's haunting croon.\\" Critical reception Violence & Destruction was welcomed with predominantly positive reviews. John Hill from Noisey exclaimed, > Their new track \\"Coconut Dracula\\" shows a lot of restraint with their > influences, allowing them to just fucking play. Islander's able to really > illustrate the potential of this genre. They sonically demonstrate that > fragile dichotomy between softness and weight in a riff, and juggle it > around over catchy hooks.

In a five-star review in HM Magazine, Rob Houston stated that Violence & Destruction will be able to hold its own for years.\\" Amy Sciarretto, writing for Outburn, praised the album for its \\"funked out riffs, throatily wrapped vocals, and rage drenched sentiments\\", giving it an eight out of ten. In an eight out of ten review from Big Cheese, Paula Frost described it as > Hollering through 12 tracks in a passionate mix of soft singing besides raw > intensity, frontman Mickey comes across as an urban realist. Next to the > influence of Rage Against The Machine and non-stop thrashing, 'Violence And > Destruction' is at times an intimate set of songs. Mixing rock, metal and > hip-hop, 'Violence And Destruction' simply doesn't let up. In New Noise Magazine, Nathaniel Lay gave it four and a half stars: \\"From start to finish, Violence & Destruction has a lot of greatness to share with its listeners\\". In a four-star review for Jesus Freak Hideout, Michael Weaver said the album was interesting because the band \\"put together a really solid collection of songs 13 years or so after the genre [nu-metal] died.\\" Chad Bowar, for About.com, thought the album \\"wide-ranging\\" for its content, and gave it three stars. In a three-star review in Alternative Press, Jason Schreurs wrote that the band \\"tries too hard to create a sound that can easily be compartmentalized by its influences\\". Tim Dodderidge, in Substream Magazine, said that \\"the biggest problem is that these guys still need to fully develop their style into their own\\", giving the album three and a half stars. Awarding the album a six out of ten, Sarah O'Connor at Rock Sound felt > The Downside? Their relative lack of fresh ideas means the songs need to be > on point, and they aren't quite there. Their Deftones influence is a little > too overbearing and there's a feeling that it needs to be stripped back > before Islander can make any progress of their own.

It is a popular explanation of the optical phenomenon of Alpenglow (Ladin: Enrosadira), by which the summit of the mountains change their color to shades of red and purple during and after sunset. King Laurin's legend is also considered to be the source of the German name of the Rosengarten group (Italian: Catinaccio) between South Tyrol and the Trentino.  The legend  =King Laurin= King Laurin was the ruler of a thriving race of dwarves who lived up here and mined the mountains for precious jewels and valuable ores. He possessed a subterranean palace made of sparkling quartz. But his special pride and joy was the great garden located in front of the entranceway to his underground crystal castle. Countless wonderful roses blossomed in this garden, whose scent was enchanting. But woe unto those who might attempt to pluck even only one of these roses! Laurin would order that his left hand and right foot be chopped off! He exacted the same punishment from anyone who tore the silken thread which surrounded his entire rose garden instead of a fence. =Similde= Similde was the beautiful daughter of the ‚ÄúKing on the River Etsch.‚Äù One day, he felt that the time had come to marry off the girl. So he invited all of the noblemen in the neighboring lands to join with him in a May Day ride ‚Äì but he did not invite Laurin, the King of the Dwarves. Because of this, Laurin decided to wear his magic Invisibility Cap and attend without being detected. But as he caught sight of Similde, he immediately fell in love with her. So he grabbed her, leaped onto his horse, and galloped away. The King on the River Etsch sent out his knights to find and rescue poor Similde. King Laurin, who believed that they would never discover him, pranced about in his Rose Garden. But the knights could see the roses swaying, and thus knew where Laurin was hiding. So they were able to trap him. Laurin was so angry at being discovered that he turned around and cursed the Rose Garden, which he believed had betrayed him: ‚ÄúNeither by day nor by night should anyone again glimpse this lovely sight.‚Äù But in saying that, Laurin had forgotten the time between day and night: The twilight. And so it is that the pink glow of the Rose Garden can still be seen at dawn and dusk. =Hartwig, Wittich, and Dietrich= For seven long days, the noblemen from the neighboring lands fought their contests to determine who should wed the beautiful Similde. Finally, there were only two champions left. It was decided that they should compete against each other in one final contest, with the victor winning the girl‚Äôs hand. One of the men was named Hartwig, and his shield bore the sign of the lily. The other was called Wittich, and the symbol of a snake could be seen on his shield. In order to rescue the king‚Äôs daughter, Similde, Hartwig and Wittich turned to the great and famous Prince Dietrich of Bern for help. The prince promised to aid them, although his wise old captain of the armory Hildebrand warned him of the strange magical powers of the Dwarf King Laurin. Hildebrand, old captain of the armory, cried: \\"Rip up his belt!\\" But this was easier said than done, for after all, Dietrich wasn‚Äôt able to see King Laurin, let alone grab him. But then, Hildebrand had an idea: \\"Pay heed to the motion of the grass ‚Äì then you will see where the dwarf is standing!\\" As Dietrich did this, he was able to see where Laurin was standing, so he ran to him, grabbed him around the middle, and broke his belt. Laurin thereupon fell to the ground, and Hildebrand was able to capture him. =M√®nega= M√®nega was a twelve-year-old maid who, together with her friends, herded the livestock on the Latemar. One day, an old man came by who had lost his knife. A short time later, the maid found the knife, and the man promised her and her friends a whole parade of dolls. On her way home, M√®nega met a woman who taught her a spell so that the man would give her his dolls with golden crowns. On the next day, the children waited for the old man until a doorway opened in the side of the mountain. Dolls wearing silk clothing appeared out of it. M√®nega recited the spell, and the dolls were transformed into stone. Today, one can still see the silk clothing of the dolls sparkling in the sun. =The Water Nymph of the Karersee= Once, there lived a beautiful water nymph in the Karersee. She often sat on the shores of the lake, singing, but as soon as anyone would approach, she would dive back into the lake and vanish. To do this, some friendly birds would stay on the look-out. These chirping birds loved listening to the water nymph, but as soon as they heard some strange noise, they would twitter nervously and fly around in fear. Thus, the nymph would have time to dive into the lake and disappear, and never came into danger. But her curiosity was her undoing. Thus it happened that an evil sorcerer who had fallen in love with the nymph and planned to steal her asked the advice of an evil witch. She advised him to stretch a rainbow from the Rose Garden to the Latemar, to disguise himself as a jewelry merchant, and so to entice the nymph away. But as he stretched out the rainbow and went to the lake, he forgot to disguise himself. The nymph recognized him and dived into the lake. The sorcerer was so furious that he threw the rainbow together with the jewels into the lake. And that is why the Karersee still glows in such lovely colors to this day. =The Dwarf of the Latemar= A poor farmer woman lived on a slope with her many children. They suffered great privations. The oldest child, a girl, had to leave home early to each day to work. One day, the girl discovered a dwarf in a crack in the mountain. The dwarf motioned for the girl to come closer. The girl did as she was ordered, and came to a large crack in the mountain in which there was a big pan. The dwarf posed the girl a question and then said that she could have the pan. The girl dragged the pan home, where her family was amazed to see it. But they always used the pan. This magic pan would always fill up when it was put on the fire, even if only a few ingredients were placed into it. Years later, as the girl ‚Äì who had now grown into a young farmer woman ‚Äì inherited the farmstead, she enlarged it and became seven children. A short time later, there was a knock at the window, and the farmer woman knew what she would have to do. Starting then, she cooked for the dwarf and placed the food into the attic. This continued for many years, until one day the woman‚Äôs daughter-in-law refused to cook for the dwarf. Thus, she placed the empty pan into the attic. On the next day, the pan had disappeared, and the family again suffered great privations. There, where their farmstead used to be, one can still see a red mass of loose rocks, and no one can live there. =Tschei= There was once a hermit named Tschei, who lived on a slope above Welschnofen. Tschei had been cruelly driven away by the villagers, and so he and his friend Jocher decided to climb up into the Rose Garden. Because no one in the village wanted to buy his cattle from him, they took them with them. One day, a farmer was desperately searching for his sheep, and he discovered a green meadow which was covered with neither snow nor ice. He became curious, and walked over to this meadow. When he got there, that‚Äôs where he found his sheep. There was also a hut, out of which an old, gray-haired man came. It was Tschei, and he said that the man should take his sheep and never come back. A short time later, a hunter found a hatchet, and everyone said that it must belong to Tschei, and that he had forgotten it when he moved up to the Rose Garden. But one day, an old man came and fetched the hatchet and disappeared into a crack in the mountain. Today, the Tscheiner Slope is still not completely covered with vegetation. One spot near a crack in the mountain lacks growth. =The Glacier Man= Giants, dwarves, and wild men once lived around the Karersee. One day, the wild men found a chest full of gold coins, to which they paid no particular attention. An old man then came and demanded that they give him back the chest. The wild men had taken a few coins out of the chest and refused to given them back, so the old man said that the time would come when the Glacier Man would come and look for them all. But the Glacier Man himself was never to be seen, and after nothing had happened for many years, they all continued to live in peace. A few years later, the Dirlingers came and settled in the mouths of the Locher Valley. Disputes were constantly breaking out between the Dirlingers and the wild men. But when the Dirlingers demanded the Grunschaft Meadow for themselves, this led to the last and greatest conflict. The wild men had many fearless warriors, but they nonetheless lost the battle. A few years later, the sole survivor among the wild men, the Glacier Man, searched for his allies, but in vain. But as fate would have it, the Dirlingers didn‚Äôt enjoy their victory for long. At first, the rich Dirlingers ones promised the poor ones the best land. But the rich broke their promise, and so one of the poor Dirlingers journeyed to the ‚ÄúWitch‚Äôs Cauldron‚Äù to call upon the Devil for help in spreading the Plague. As a result, everything was torn down and even the most-beautiful meadows soon disappeared into the forest. =The Stone Maiden= The story goes that this maiden was once a princess. She and all her followers wanted to hurry to the aid of the wild men for the last and greatest battle against the Dirlingers. But as she came to a mountain ridge and saw the terrible defeat of the wild men, she was so shocked that she turned into stone. =The Fellow from Marchegg= In Gummer, a fellow from Marchegg would traipse around, even in the light of day. He groaned under the burden of stones he was carrying. He asked everyone he met what he should do with this burden, until one day someone answered that he should put it back where he found it. On that day, the enchantment was lifted. =The Witch Langwerda= Langwerda, also known as ‚ÄúLomberda,‚Äù was a witch who lived in a valley below the Rose Garden. One day, she ordered her servant girl to sweep out the attic with a bundle of wheat stalks. But the servant girl used some pine twigs instead, and a short time later, a storm started brewing. When Lomberda went to see whether the servant girl had done a proper job, she found that the entire attic was full of pine needles. The witch punished the maid, because if she had used a bundle of wheat stalks, as she had been told to do, everything would have been full of grain, instead. =The Brothers= A king had two sons who traveled to the Rose Garden even in late autumn. The roses still bloomed here, regardless of the season of the year. One of the brothers said that he saw a pale stalk with a rose on it. The two brothers now raced to see who could get it first. The one who had seen it first was not as fast as the other brother. When he finally came to the rose, the slower brother said full of anger that the rose belonged to him, since he had seen it first. The other replied that he had come to it first, so that it was his. After a brief struggle, the brother who had seen the rose first stabbed and killed the other. Since then, no roses grow there anymore. =The Little Man= The Little Man had discovered the blue stone up in the mountains, near the Rose Garden. He marched back and forth from the place to the valley, taking as much of the blue stone with him on each trip as he could. But he didn't keep the stone for himself. Rather, he sold the pieces to a dyer in Bozen who said that it was the most-beautiful blue that he had ever seen. The dyer gave him as much money as the Little Man wanted. Thus, the Little Man could live well ‚Äì but no one ever found out where he had gotten the blue stone. =The Goat= A farmer had many goats which he always took to a particular clearing in the forest where they could graze. One day, one of the goats ran into the forest and then soon came out again with half a loaf of bread in its mouth. The farmer wanted to know where the goat had gotten the bread. But when he followed the goat into the forest the next time, the goat ran this way and that, all the way through the forest, and was thus able to fool the farmer. To this day, no one knows where the goat had gotten the half a loaf of bread. =The Tailor= Behind Welschnofen in the direction of the village of Kar, there was a deep hole in the earth. One day, a tailor came along and saw it. He thought it would be amusing to frighten the devil that lived in the hole. So he pointed his gun into the hole and began shooting until all of his ammunition was gone. In an instant, the devil climbed out of the hole and ran away. But not just one devil came out: A great many small and large devils clambered out of the hole. The tailor ran to the nearest farmhouse and sought refuge there until the devils had gone away.

The Mongondows are predominantly Muslim. They have traditionally been concentrated in the provinces of North Sulawesi and Gorontalo. This ethnic group used to be united by a single entity, the Kingdom of Bolaang Mongondow, which became the western regencies of North Sulawesi after the Indonesian independence. Etymology The name Bolaang originated from the word Bolango or Balangon which means Sea. Bolaang or Golaang could also means \\"Bright\\" or \\"Exposed and Undark\\", while Mongondow originated from Momondow which means \\"Cries of Victory\\".Sejarah Bolaang Mongondow History =The beginnings to the 8th and 9th century= The people of Mongondow believed that their ancestors originate from the offspring of Gumalangit and Tendeduata, as well as from Tumotoiboko and Tumotoibokat that were living on Mount Komasan, in today's Bintauna, North Bolaang Mongondow Regency. The descendants of both of their offspring later became the Mongondow people. The population of the Mongondows grew and spread beyond their native region such as Tudu in Lombagin, Buntalo, Pondoli‚Äô, Ginolantungan, Tudu in Passi, Tudu in Lolayan, Tudu in Sia‚Äô, Tudu in Bumbungon, Mahag, Siniow and so forth. The source of income for the Mongondows in those days include hunting, fishing, processing of sago, and harvesting of tuber in the jungle. In short, they have yet to learn farming in those days.http://manado.tribunnews.com/2013/06/25/kerajaan-bolaang-mongondow =Development= In the 13th century, the Bogani (leaders of the groups of Mongondow community that occupied a certain area) became united to form a government rule for the Mongondow people called Bolaang. Bolaang itself means \\"the sea\\" (balangon) which identifies this kingdom as a maritime kingdom. The results of the meeting (bakid) of the Bogani came to an agreement to appoint Mokodoludut, a Bogani Molantud man as the first king (Punu') of the Bolaang kingdom. In the 16th century, after King Mokodompit departed to Siau Island in the years of power vacuum in Bolaang Mongondow Kingdom; moreover Prince Dodi Mokoagow, the strongest candidate to succeed the throne from King Mokodompit was killed by the Alfur people in an incident in the interior of Manado. In that period, the governance of the kingdom was taken over by a Mulantud Bogani man named Dou'. After the prince of King Mokodompit in Siau Island reached adulthood, he was appointed as the 7th King of Bolaang Mongondow Kingdom. The Abo (meaning, \\"prince\\") is called Tadohe / Sadohe, while his mother is a princess from the Siau Kingdom. It was in his era that the governing system of the Bolaang Mongondow Kingdom was restored. During the era of King Salmon Manoppo (1735-1764), there was a fierce conflict with the Dutch which ended with the King Salmon being captured and exiled to Tanjung Harapan, South Africa. This incident triggered protests and a great riot that was carried out by the Mongondow people of which the Bolaang kingdom belonged to. Finally, the Dutch returned the King of Bolaang and ever since then the name of Bolaang Kingdom has been added with the name of the ethnic group, the native of the Bolaang Kingdom to become Bolaang Mongondow to this present day. In 1901, administratively the area of Bolaang Mongondow Kingdom is part of the Bolaang Mongondow Subdivision (\\"Onderafdeling\\" in Dutch) which includes the Administrative Area (\\"landschap\\" in Dutch) of Bintauna, Bolaang Uki and Kaudipang Besar from Manado Administrative Division (\\"Afdeling\\" in Dutch). The Bolaang Mongondow Kingdom officially ended on July 1, 1950 when the Majesty of King Tuang Henny Yusuf Cornelius Manoppo abdicated and made a declaration to join the Republic of Indonesia. Currently Mongondow is interpreted as a mountainous area and Bolaang as a coastal area. When Oemarudin Nini Mokoagow became regent of Bolaang Mongondow Regency (August 1966 to January 1976), a new village was created with the name Mongondow in Kotamobagu as a result of the redelineation from Motoboi Village. Sub-ethnics The Mongondow people are made up of several sub-ethnicity that resides in North Sulawesi and Gorontalo such as:- * Bolaang Mongondow people * Bolaang Uki people * Kaidipang Besar people * Bintauna people * Buhang people * Korompot people * Mokodompis people Language The everyday Mongondow people use the Mongondow language, Bolango language and Bintauna language on a daily basis. Linguistically, these languages belong to the Greater Central Philippine languages branch; alongside the Gorontalo language, Minahasan language and Sangir language of North Sulawesi, Indonesia. The Mongondow people also use Manado Malay as a form of communication with the other North Sulawesi people. Geographical redelineation The region of the Bolaang Mongondow covers 50.3% of the area of North Sulawesi so much so that the Bolaang Mongondow government together with the community leaders, customary leaders and religious leaders had agreed to divide the region with the full support of the Bolaang Mongondow regent, the then Marlina Moha Siahaan. With the full support of every community as well as the local Bolaang Mongondow government, the committee of the regional division managed to convince the central government and the Parliament that the Bolaang Mongondow region has officially divided into five regencies, namely: * Bolaang Mongondow Regency * Kotamobagu (city) * North Bolaang Mongondow Regency * East Bolaang Mongondow Regency * South Bolaang Mongondow Regency References Category:Ethnic groups in Indonesia Category:Gorontalo (province) Category:Muslim communities of Indonesia Category:North Sulawesi ","title":"Mongondow people"},{"id":"43390290","text":"Salem Tipitapa is a Nicaraguan football team playing in the second division of the Nicaragua football system.

The positive aspects of the investment according to EBRD include strengthening Georgia‚Äôs private energy sector, demonstrating new financing methods (the project will be the first power project in Georgia to rely on limited recourse financing) and setting standards for corporate governance and business conduct. It will also generate employment opportunities for local population. More than 700 Georgians were working in the project in 2016, most of them from the local communities. Almost 500 locals were trained in a school especially designed to build required technical skills. The project company has also funded an extensive CSR programme in the valley with significant infrastructure upgrades for the local communities, support for local businesses etc. The project has also enabled the construction of a new 220 kV transmission line from Akhalsikhe to Batumi, significantly strengthening the grid connection in the whole of South Western Georgia. Controversial issues =Project justification= The contract for the Shuakhevi HPP project is the only contract for a hydropower project in Georgia where articles related to obligations of the state and the company on electricity tariffs and economic profitability are kept confidential. It is hard to say how the project will benefit Georgia, since it is not clear how the money will end up in the state budget. The project has responsibility to deliver electricity for three winter months in Georgia for a fixed tariff, contributing to reducing the need to import electricity and reducing the carbon emissions from electricity production in Georgia. The project will pay 1% of invested amount in property taxes to the local municipality where the infrastructure is located, which is estimated to significantly increase the budgets in the municipalities hosting the infrastructure. =Environmental impact= The project is designed to divert water flows from the upper parts of the Adjaristskali, Skhalta and Chirukhistskali rivers towards the reservoirs and then the powerhouse and leave only 10 percent of the average annual flow of the rivers. That will have a negative impact on the river ecosystem, including red-listed species like trout. =Social impact= Since there are no villages within the project site, the project did not envisage resettlement of local population. However, the project site is characterised by landslides. The tunnel drilled under the village Ghurta, which is one of three diversion tunnels part of the project, did not trigger any landslide as feared by the local population. Detailed geological investigations were undertaken by Mott MacDonald, one of the leading underground geological engineers in the world before the construction started to ensure that it was safe to construct a dam in the Didachara area. The memory of the 1971 landslide which cost 22 people‚Äôs lives is still very much alive among local population. Adjaristsqali Georgia LLC is denying the risks, however they are reluctant to sign warranty contracts to offer compensation in case the constructions cause damages.Chipashvili, David.

About 500 villagers blocked the road to prevent the construction of a tunnel for the 187 MW Shuakhevi HPP in Didachara were dispersed by policemen and special forces. The main concern of the people is that the construction would trigger landslides.

As a state defense force, the NSG served on as a component of the organized militia of Nebraska, serving as reservists who trained periodically but could be called up during an emergency; however, unlike the Nebraska National Guard, the Nebraska State Guard could not be federalized or deployed outside the state. Rather, when the National Guard was deployed, the purpose of the State Guard was to assume the stateside duties of the National Guard. History of Predecessor Units Both the National Guard and the various state defense forces trace their roots to organized militia units which composed the majority of American military forces before the creation of the modern National Guard under the Militia Act of 1903. The first organized militia, the Nebraska Volunteers, was a division-sized unit of volunteers created by an act of the Nebraska Territorial Legislature in 1856. Nebraska later created several multiple units during the American Civil War. World War II Following the American entrance into World War II and federalization of all National Guard units, numerous states created state defense forces in order to protect their territory against invasion, unrest, insurrection, and sabotage while their National Guard units were deployed. Nebraska created the Nebraska State Guard in 1942. In April 1943, the Nebraska State Guard was deployed alongside federal Army soldiers and civilian volunteers to assist in protecting the Omaha Municipal Airport from floodwater during a flood of the Missouri River. The Nebraska State Guard was disbanded in 1947, though the statutes authorizing it remained in effect. Vietnam War Due to the heightened chance of deployment for several National Guard units chosen to be a part of the Selected Reserve Force during the Vietnam War, Governor Norbert T. Tiemann reactivated Nebraska‚Äôs state defense force in 1968 to replace the Nebraska National Guard. The Nebraska State Guard was organized at a cadre level, with plans to expand through four phases and ultimately reach a full strength of roughly 4,000 men; however, due to the repeal of the Selected Reserve Force program, the Vietnam-era State Guard never expanded beyond a cadre of approximately 220 officers and enlisted men, primarily veterans of World War II or the Vietnam War, organized across 35 units in 30 towns. The Nebraska State Guard was then disbanded in 1972. =Uniform= The Vietnam-era uniform for State Guardsmen, provided by the state, consisted of an army uniform with the federal patch replaced with a State Guard shoulder patch instead of the American flag, a pair of boots, and an ‚ÄúN.S.G.‚Äù brass insignia for the uniform‚Äôs collar for officers. Legal status State defense forces are given a legal basis by the federal government under Title 32, Section 109 of the United States Code. Currently, 23 states and the territory of Puerto Rico maintain active state defense forces. Nebraska law also recognizes the Nebraska State Guard as a military entity which can be reactivated by the Governor of Nebraska whenever any part of the National Guard of the State of Nebraska is in active federal service, whenever the President of the United States declares a national emergency, or whenever an emergency is declared by the governor. Therefore, the legal framework exists at both state and federal levels to reactivate the Nebraska State Guard in the future should these conditions be met.

Before that, he served as Metropolitan of Herzegovina from 1573 to 1585. He was a member of the notable Sokoloviƒá family, being a nephew of Serbian Patriarch Makarije Sokoloviƒá (1557‚Äì71). Savatije founded the Piva Monastery in 1573. Life Sokoloviƒá was born in Prijepolje, at the time part of the Sanjak of Herzegovina of the Ottoman Empire (now in Serbia).

He succeeded his relative Antonije as the Metropolitan of Herzegovina in 1573, who then became the Serbian Patriarch; the Sokoloviƒá bishops were obviously succeeding each other as metropolitan of Herzegovina, then as coadjutor to the Serbian Patriarch, and finally as Serbian Patriarch. That same year, Savatije founded (as ktitor) the Piva Monastery, dedicated to the Dormition of the Most Holy Mother of God, located by the Piva river in the historical Piva region (the former ≈æupa of Piva, in modern-day western Montenegro).

He died before Gerasim. Historian S. Novakoviƒá (1842‚Äì1915) concluded that his death place was in the Ubo≈æac- or Bo≈æac Monastery, although this has since been refuted. Savatije proved himself more energetic than his predecessors, and boldly and persistently, with the help of Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (Mehmed-pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá) and other Islamized Sokoloviƒá family members, and other Viziers of Serbian origin, to work for the strengthening of Church autonomy.

Distortions in the medium typically occur as a result, and the process either falls under a broader category of, or is frequently employed in glitch art. Process and techniques The term databending is derived from circuit bending, in which objects such as children's toys, effects pedals and electronic keyboards are deliberately short circuited by bending the circuit board to produce erratic and spontaneous sounds. Like circuit bending, databending involves the (often unpredictable) alteration of its target's behavior. Databending achieves this alteration by manipulating the information within a media file of a certain format, using software designed to edit files of a different format; distortions in the medium typically occur as a result. Many techniques exist, including the use of hex editors to manipulate certain components of a compression algorithm, to comparatively simple methods. Michael Betancourt has posed a short set of instructions, included in the Signal Culture Cookbook, that involves the direct manipulation of the digital file using a hexadecimal editing program. One such method involves the addition of audio effects through audio editing software to distort raw data interpretations of image files. Some effects produce optical analogues: adding an echo filter duplicated elements of a photo, and inversion contributed to the flipping over of an image. The similarities result from the waveforms corresponding with the layers of pixels in a linear fashion, ordered from top to bottom. Another method, dubbed \\"the WordPad effect\\", uses the program WordPad to manipulate images through converting the raw data to the Rich Text Format. =Categorization= According to the artist Benjamin Berg, different techniques of the process can be grouped into three categories: * Incorrect editing: Files of a certain format are manipulated using software designed to edit files of a different format. * Reinterpretation: Files are simply converted from one medium to another. * Forced errors: Known software bugs are exploited to force the program to terminate, usually while writing a file. The \\"WordPad effect\\" would fall under incorrect editing, while reinterpretation contains a subcategory called sonification, in which data other than audio is introduced simultaneously with musical audio data. The last technique is the hardest of the three to accomplish, often yielding highly unpredictable results. Usage and reception Alva Noto uses sonification in his music. Databending is frequently employed in glitch art, and is considered a sub- category of the genre. The sonification technique is commonly used by glitch musicians such as Alva Noto. Ahuja and Lu summarized the process through a quote by Adam Clark Estes of Gizmodo as \\"the internet's code-heavy version of graffiti.\\" Various groups on Flickr explore the effects of databending on imagery; an Internet bot named \\"GlitchBot\\" was created to scrape Creative Commons-licensed imagery and apply the process and upload the results. Users on Vimeo who deal explicitly with databending and glitch art in general exist, and a Chicago-based digital art project named GLI.TC/H was funded using Kickstarter in 2011.

It was described in 2005 based on a fossil discovered in the Escuminac Formation of Quebec, Canada two years prior. It was approximately long and 10 mm wide with 27 body segments, and had kidney shaped patches of ocelli (simple eyes). Each trunk segment had long, sickle-shaped extensions (paranota) projecting laterally, and was decorated on the dorsal surface with low rectangular bosses (\\"bumps\\") bordered by crescent-shaped bosses. The genus name Zanclodesmus derives from Greek Zanklon, meaning \\"sickle\\", in reference to the long, curved paranota, and desmus, a common root word in millipedes.

When they receive news that their father is finally returning home the Fa family is overjoyed. Muk Lan's father tells her that while he was in the army he had made a marriage arrangement for her to marry a man named Tsui Sam Gong (Lau Wing-Kin), Muk Lan did not mind the arranged marriage since she has secretly admired Sam Gong for a long time. However Sam Gong rejected on the idea of the arranged marriage because he was already in love with Long Siu Siu (Gigi Fu), the daughter of the local government official. To avoid marry Muk Lan, Sam Gong decides to join the army. During this time the Fa family meets Ho Go Sing (Wong Hei), who rents half of the Fa family house with his forgetful mother (Mimi Chu).

He was appointed Governor of the Cape Colony in 1772 to succeed the deceased Governor Ryk Tulbagh but died at sea on his way to the Cape Colony to take up his post. See online extract in Afrikaans. The Western Cape town of Oudtshoorn is named after him. He is the progenitor of the van R(h)eede van Oudtshoorn family in South Africa. Career and death Born the son of a nobleman in Utrecht, van Reede van Oudtshoorn first arrived in the Cape Colony aboard de Duijff as an employee of the Dutch East India Company in 1741. First published 1910. Reference code: C. 119, pp. 51‚Äì53. In 1743 then Cape Governor Hendrik Swellengrebel granted him land in the Table Mountain valley named Garden Oudtshoorn, bounded by Hof Street and Kloof Street in the present-day suburb of Gardens. After van Reede van Oudtshoorn's death the developed estate was subdivided into three separate properties named La Belle Alliance, Trafalgar and Mount Nelson where the Mount Nelson Hotel stands today. He was fiscal independent from September 1741 to September 1762, and Secunde (deputy Governor) of the Cape Colony from December 1760 to April 1766 after Ryk Tulbagh had succeeded Swellengrebel as Governor. He returned to the Netherlands in 1766, but left his children in the Cape,Heraldry of South African Families / Coats of arms, crests, ancestry by C.PAMA/ A. A. Balkema, 1972, page 58 and bought the Drakensteyn castle. He was later re-appointed to the vacant Secunde position in the Cape Colony and in 1772, following the arrival of news of Tulbagh's death before he had departed for the Cape Colony, appointed as Tulbagh's successor. However, he became ill and died at sea aboard Asia on his voyage to take up his post as Governor. His body was transported to Cape Town in a coffin he had carried aboard on the same voyage. On 17 April 1773 he was given a state funeral in Cape Town and buried at the Groote Kerk. After the church building was enlarged in 1841, the stone that had covered his grave was attached to the church's eastern wall. Includes a transcription of Pieter van Reede van Oudtshoorn's memorial stone on the wall of the Groote Kerk in Cape Town. A print depicting his funeral procession is preserved in the Atlas van Stolk museum in Rotterdam. Baron Joachim van Plettenberg, who had been acting Governor since Tulbagh's death on 11 August 1771, was appointed Governor on 18 May 1774. Family Origins \\"The van Rheedes are one of the old families of Europe, descending from Bitter Van Reede, mentioned between 1344 and 1372, who himself was probably descendent of Wernerus de Rethe, knight, mentioned between 1223 and 1236. Godard VAN Reede (10th generation) accompanied William III of Orange to England and became Earl of Athlone on 14th March 1691 (branch extinct 7 Jan 1897). Another branch, Van Reede de Parkeren en Aa, became extinct in 1879. The Van R(h)eede van Oudsthoorns are, therefore, the only surviving branch of the family, both in the Netherlands and in South Africa. Van Ooudsthoorn was added to the original surname of Van Reede because for a period they were squires of that village in Holland. After the Napoleonic wars and the establishment of a monarchy in the Netherlands, the old nobility of the family, and the title of Baron, was confirmed by Royal Decrees of 2nd April and 14th June 1822.\\"Heraldry of South African Families / Coats of arms, crests, ancestry by C.PAMA/ A. A. Balkema, 1972. Page 57 - 58. Family Saasveld House, originally built in Kloof Street on the Garden Oudtshoorn estate by Pieter's son William Ferdinand, was demolished and rebuilt in Franschhoek where it houses the Huguenot Memorial Museum. Pieter was Lord of Oudshoorn, Ridderbuurt and Gnephoek, the only son of Barend Cornelis van Reede van Oudtshoorn (1690‚Äì1750) and his wife Catharina Cornelia van Eys. DBNL source: P.C. Molhuysen en P.J. Blok (ed.), Nieuw Nederlandsch biografisch woordenboek. Deel 3. A.W. Sijthoff, Leiden 1914. He was baptised in St Catherine's Cathedral, Utrecht on 10 July 1714. His father was the first to bear the surname van Reede van Oudtshoorn. Barend Cornelis was the only child of Pieter van Reede tot Nederhorst (1645‚Äì1692), Lord of Oudshoorn, Ridderbuurt and Gnephoek, and his wife Maria de Vlamingh van Outshoorn (1646‚Äì1732). Maria was the only child of Cornelis de Vlamingh van Outshoorn (1613‚Äì1688), Lord of Outshoorn and Gnephoek, and his wife Claesgen Hooft. Archiefinventaris 3.19.41, J.A. Eekhof jr., Nationaal Archief, Den Haag, 1929, CC0. The King of the Netherlands recognised the family's title of baron in 1822. Pieter was also the heir of William Ferdinand Carey, the 8th Baron Hunsdon, son of William Carey and Maria de Vlamingh van Outshoorn's sister Geertruida. On 18 January 1741 in Den Bosch Pieter married Sophia Catharina Boesses, who was born to a military officer in 1720 in Bergen op Zoom, after living together since 1736. They departed for the Cape Colony on 7 May 1741. Some of their children settled in the Cape Colony, including their son William Ferdinand (1755‚Äì1822) who also worked for the Dutch East India Company. Following the British occupation the independently wealthy William Ferdinand, who had been a senior official of the Cape Colony before the occupation, refused to swear allegiance to the British Crown. In 1782, Pieter's then 61-year-old widow was the subject of a scandal in the Cape Colony when she attempted unsuccessfully to withdraw her inheritance and elope with a 20-year-old soldier. She died in Cape Town in 1791. Oudtshoorn In 1858, Ernestina Johanna Geesje, William Ferdinand's daughter and Pieter's granddaughter, married Egbertus Bergh, a magistrate of the Western Cape town of George. Bergh was one of the founding fathers of the Western Cape town of Oudtshoorn, which was named in honour of his wife's distinguished grandfather. The coat of arms of the local municipality is based on the Dutch family's coat of arms. Oudtshoorn is a twin town of Alphen aan den Rijn in the Netherlands which incorporates the historic Dutch villages of Oudshoorn, Ridderbuurt and Gnephoek.

Career M√ºhling graduated from Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel with a Dr. theol. in Systematic Theology, and received his venia legendi in Systematic Theology from Ruprecht-Karls University, Heidelberg, and has since been visiting Professor at King's College, Aberdeen and Member of the Center of Theological Inquiry, Princeton. From 2011 to 2018 he has been professor for Systematic Theology and International-Interdisciplinary Dialogue at the Leuphana University of L√ºneburg, Germany. In 2014, Leuphana University awarded him the research prize for the best monograph. http://www.leuphana.de/news/publikationen/leuphana- magazin/dies-academicus/forschungspreise.html He's currently Professor for Systematic Theology at the Theological University of Wuppertal/Bethel. Work One of Prof M√ºhling's major impacts on the field of the doctrine of God has been his work on love as a model for the trinitarian understanding of GodCf. M. M√ºhling (2005c), 296‚Äì332. and its soteriological impacts.Cf. M. M√ºhling (2005a), 292‚Äì356. He has worked extensively on non-empirical presuppositions in the work of physicist Albert Einstein as well as on theological discussions of the neurosciences and new trends in evolutionary theory. He has also written textbooks in the areas of eschatology and ethics. Prof. M√ºhling's approach can be characterized as work towards establishing and widening an ontology of narrative relationality that focuses on constitutive processual relations.Cf. M. M√ºhling (2013), 17‚Äì20. He believes that increased inter- and transdisciplinary engagement is necessary for our understanding of the great questions as well as for the well-being of society.Cf. M. M√ºhling (2014), 13‚Äì35. God can be understood as a trinitarian related, dramatic and open event in God's own eternity, which creates, sustains, atones and perfects creation in resonance with God's own relational being as becoming.Cf. M√ºhling (2014), 165‚Äì196. In faith, God's presence can be perceived in accordance with phenomenological approaches to the neurosciences.Cf. M. M√ºhling (2014), 86‚Äì136. Prof. M√ºhling regards recent developments in evolutionary theory (e.g. niche construction), as fruitful resources for modelling theological anthropology.Cf. M. M√ºhling (2014), 205‚Äì221.

It claims to be the number one English media outlet in Egypt by reach. In February 2015, more than 800,000 visited the website. The website tries to bring attention to environmental and social issues in Egypt, such as sexual harassment and the campaigns aimed at stopping it, through collaborations with a number of non- governmental organizations and movements. Its readers mostly consist of both bilingual Egyptians and non-Egyptians who either live in Egypt or abroad. Content The stated goal of Egyptian Streets is to provide its readers with \\"an alternate depiction of events that occur on Egyptian and Middle Eastern streets\\" and particularly aims to cover a wide range of topics and stories related to Egypt in a neutral manner. It also managed to establish a social platform to discuss the various articles it publishes. Some of the issues it brought up are considered controversial and sensitive topics in Egypt and garnered significant attention from the readers, such as the debate of whether women in hijab should be banned from entering bars or not. Egyptian Streets works to tackle even more challenging problems in Egyptian society such as sexual harassment and mass sexual assault and has a special coverage of protest movements, most notably the 2012‚Äì13 protests against the Muslim Brotherhood. In June 2014, Egyptian Streets published an article about a video that appeared on YouTube depicting a naked and injured woman who was sexually assaulted in Cairo's Tahrir Square when thousands took to there to celebrate President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's inauguration. Various media organizations and news networks such as The Huffington Post, La Stampa, Spiegel Online and Daily Mirror among others have cited this article, along with several other publications about sexual harassment and issues related to women in Egypt, including an article about an iPhone video called \\"Creepers on the Bridge\\" that portrays the challenges a woman faces while walking the streets of Egypt. In March 2017, Egyptian Streets secured an investment round from and partnered with Speakol, a smart ads platform with more than 600 clients that employs artificial intelligence to provide users with tailored ads. Collaborations Egyptian Streets has collaborated with or supported a number of non- governmental organizations and grassroots movements in order to raise awareness and to promote social change and actions on a variety of issues, including the environment (Earth Hour being an example), sexual harassment, animal rights, education, poverty and more. It managed to engage in a media partnership with Egypt's first Corporate Travel Market exhibition and participated with a number of local and international organizations operating in Egypt in order to promote them, including AIESEC, the United Nations Development Programme, which launched Get Online Week in Egypt, as well as Cairo's Goethe-Institut to promote their program for Egypt's educational system. It has also promoted campaigns aimed at stopping sexual violence against women, such as those of Dignity Without Borders and Heya, an initiative that is mainly aimed at empowering the role of Egypt's women in society. Audience Its audience primarily consists of English-speaking Egyptians, some of whom live abroad, as well as non-Egyptians from countries such as the United States and Australia among others, who are either interested in the cultural and touristic aspects of Egypt or reside in the country. 41% of the readers are aged between 18 and 34 and they also consist of both genders, with 51% of them being male and 49% female.

It is a bulbous perennial from southern Europe, found in Spain and Morocco. Description Iris serotina grows to a maximum height of tall and the narrow leaves are 2‚Äì6 mm wide and grow between tall. They appear in the autumn, but then fade before flowering. It normally has 2 - 3 flowers per stem, and generally blooms in late July, or August. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. It has blue- violet flowers, the petals are veined with a deeper violet colour, and the falls are marked with a yellow patch. Its seeds are small, yellow and semi- circular. Taxonomy The specific epithet serotina, refers to the Latin word, 'serotina' meaning late in flowering.James Armitage (Editor) In 1861, Heinrich Moritz Willkomm described Iris serotina after seeing plants from Province of Ja√©n (Spain). Originally, he called it Iris filifolia, but this was later corrected to Iris serotina. Then published in 'Prodromus Florae Hispanicae' Vol.1 in 1861.Gonzalo Mateo Sanz and Jos√© Luis Benito Alonso (Editors) It was later illustrated in Curtis's Botanical Magazine No.733 in 1977.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) Iris serotina is an accepted name by the RHS, and it was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 3 December 2004. Distribution and habitat Iris serotina is native to temperate areas of Europe. =Range= Originally found in South eastern Spain. It has been found in Cuenca, Jaen and in the Province of Granada. It also has been found in Rif in Morocco. =Habitat= It grows on rocks, on the shadow side of the mountains. Conservation It is classed as 'Endangered', and was on the 1997 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants in Spain.Kerry Scott Walter, Harriet J. Gillett (Editors) Cultivation It is best grown in a bulb frame or a very sheltered dry border, in the UK. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Other sources * Fennane, M. & M. I. Tattou. 1998.

Thomas Benjamin Frederick Davis was a wealthy businessman, yachtsman and philanthropist. In 1920 Davis bought the Thames from the British Admiralty and sent her to South Africa. He donated the ship to the South African government and stipulated that it had to be used for the full-time training of boys for careers at sea. It was renamed TS (training ship) General Botha in honour of the South African prime minister. She was moored in Simon's Bay, outside the naval dockyard.S.A.T.S. General Botha Old Boys Association TS General Botha in 1925 On 15 March 1922 the first intake of seventy five boys joined ship in Simon's Bay. General Botha's wife was supposed to conduct the official christening, but she was feeling poorly, with the result that Mrs Isie Smuts had to officiate on 1 April 1922. The TS General Botha remained in Simon's Bay for the next twenty years, during which 1,276 cadets received their training. The presence of German submarines in the southern oceans in 1942 caused the naval authorities to become concerned for the safety of the cadets living on board the TS General Botha. They were therefore moved up to Red Hill, but still went down to the ship for their daily training. At the end of the year the TS General Botha was commandeered by the navy and berthed in the dockyard for the rest of the war. After the war it was found that the TS General Botha was beyond economical repair. On 13 May 1947 she was towed into False Bay to a position nine nautical miles ESE of the Roman Rock lighthouse and sunk by gunfire from Scala battery. =The South African Nautical College General Botha= At the end of April 1948 the cadets were moved to the former SAAF crash boat station at Gordons Bay. The name of the establishment was changed to The South African Nautical College General Botha and the new Captain- Superintendent was Captain G V Legassick RNR. For the next 10 years General Botha prospered. A new engineering course was introduced as well. Then in 1958 the government decided to place the establishment under the control of the South African Navy. =South African Naval College= Captain Legassick was replaced with Commander SC Biermann, on whom rested the unenviable job of combining the courses for the Merchant Marine and the Navy, while remaining the commanding officer of the Naval Gymnasium in Saldanha. This difficult relationship between the two services continued until 1966, when the new South African Merchant Navy Academy was established at Granger Bay.

Biography  Evernden received his BA in History at the Lancaster University in 1975, and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Education at the Goldsmiths' College of the University of London in 1977. Evernden started his career as history teacher in London in 1977. In 1980 he started working in IT as analyst and programmer, and worked his way up from consultant and application developer to enterprise architect working for companies as Legal & General, IBM, Westpac Banking Corporation, and smaller companies. From 2007 to 2011 he was Enterprise Domain Architect and later Enterprise Architect at Lloyds Bank. Since 2011 he is Senior Consultant with Cutter Consortium's Business & Enterprise Architecture practice,  Work  = Information FrameWork (IFW) = In the late 1980s Evernden developed Information FrameWork (IFW) to describe an enterprise architect initiative at Westpac. This was later described in an IBM Systems Journal article, published in 1996. The Westpac project ‚Äì known internally as CS90, or Core Systems for the 1990s ‚Äì was a prototype for using enterprise architecture to create adaptive organizations or adaptive systems. The Westpac experience was described by Stephan H. Haeckel ‚Äì an American management theorist and former director of Strategic Studies at IBM‚Äôs Advanced Business Institute ‚Äì who developed the idea of the sense-and-respond organization as an adaptive enterprise. The Information FrameWork (IFW) was presented in 1996 as framework for Information management, and more generic alternative to the Zachman Framework. Evernden (1996) explained: :the objectives and scope of IFW are broader than that of the original Zachman framework. IFW is described and compared with the original Zachman structure, showing the evolution, changes, and the rationale behind the changes based on experiences from within the financial services industry.Evernden (1996, p. 37) In his 1996 paper Evernden also showed \\"how the structure of IFW has been populated by industry-wide models and supported by a distinctive methodology. A detailed discussion of each of the six dimensions of the IFW architecture is presented.\\" = Contributions to Enterprise Architecture = Evernden has promoted the need for Architectural Thinking, the use of a meta-framework in Enterprise Architecture , and for explaining the Levels of Architectural Understanding . = Other works = Evernden is co-author, with Elaine Evernden, of Information First: Integrating Knowledge and Information Architecture for Business Advantage, which was first published in 2003, expanding the concepts of Information FrameWork (IFW). Information First outlines an approach to enterprise architecture that uses eight factors common to all enterprise architecture frameworks that can be combined to create architectural tools for managing enterprise and business transformation. A second edition was published in 2015 with the title: Enterprise Architecture ‚Äì the Eight Fundamental Factors. This book deals with two important topics for enterprise management: the architecture of an enterprise and the challenge of dealing with information. \\"Roger and Elaine Evernden argue that in order to address that challenge, organizations must treat information as a business resource, much like capital or labor. They require expertise and strategic thinking to use that resource as part of a business strategy, and to leverage its potential. More than just data to be used in operative processes, information must be seen as the essence of all decision-making and knowledge-building efforts in the enterprise, something that must be adapted to the people using it and interacting with it.\\" Research at the Cranfield School of Management also suggested that there are multiple dimensions to all architecture frameworks. Working with more than two or three dimensions at a time is challenging, and potentially confusing. Analysis is therefore most constructive when any two of these dimensions are viewed together in a matrix.

In a keynote presentation for the National Conference on Advances in Enterprise Architecture (NCAEA 2017) he described changes required by architecture frameworks in response to an increasingly connected, digital world. He said: \\"Although our discipline will probably continue to be known as ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù architecture, increasingly it will cover the architecture of any human-designed system ‚Äì which includes all social, political, economic, environmental, and cultural organisms ‚Äì in addition to the domains we currently expect to find in ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù architecture.

It was produced by the British Film Institute. The electronic score is from Mike Ratledge of Soft Machine. Background A feminist experimental film, Riddles of the Sphinx was partly inspired by Mulvey's work on feminist film theory of scopophilia and the male gaze, particularly her influential 1975 essay Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema. As she wrote that classical Hollywood cinema favoured the male spectator and his desire to gaze at women, Mulvey and Wollen's film is \\"an attempt to merge modernist forms with a narrative exploring feminism and psychoanalytical theory\\". At the time, much of British experimental and avant-garde film was anti-narrative, and so the film is part of a movement that set out to explore and create a feminist language for cinema outside of traditional narrative norms. In her writing on feminist film theory, Mulvey has argued that, if the dominant cinema produces pleasure through scopophilia which favours the male gaze and festishization of woman as object, then alternative versions of cinema need to construct different forms of pleasure based on psychic relations that adopt a feminist perspective. As such, the lack of exposition, concentration on the gender politics of domestic life, and the 360-degree pans which move slowly and without focus on the women characters in Riddles of the Sphinx, represent the antithesis of the cinematic pleasure seen in the dominant cinematic styles of the time. Frequently, a woman's voice is heard but not identifiable as particular character, further emphasizing \\"the lost discourse of woman's unconscious\\". Rather than using a conventional voice-over, a multitude of voices are heard, Louise and her various friends and co-workers, which according to Mulvey is intended to as \\"a constant return to woman, not indeed as a visual image, but as a subject of inquiry, a content which cannot be considered within the aesthetic lines laid down by traditional cinematic practice.\\" Plot The film consists of 13 scenes, the majority of which are shot in long, continuous 360-degree pans of middle-class spaces occupied and encountered by the main character, Louise. Louise is dealing with a change in her lifestyle in which she must learn to negotiate domestic life and motherhood. This is occasionally interrupted by sequences of Mulvey talking to the camera, recounting the myth of Oedipus encountering the Sphinx.

According to Maggie Humm in Feminism and Film, \\"Althusser's theory (the Ideological State Apparatus (ISA)) helped Mulvey clarify the systematic mechanisms by which cinematic desires might function, mechanisms which she tried to deconstruct with Brechtian techniques in her own films, particularly Riddles of the Sphinx.\\" Patricia Erens in Issues in Feminist Film Criticism notes that Riddles of the Sphinx attempts to exhume a female voice that has been repressed by patriarchy, but which has nevertheless remained intact for thousands of years at some unconscious level.\\" References Further reading *Laura Mulvey (1975).

The property operates as a sheep station; the name and boundaries of the formal locality were created on 26 April 2013 for the long established local name. It is situated approximately north of Kimba and west of Iron Knob. The property is at the eastern end of the Gawler Range and is bounded to the north by Beacon Hill Station, to the west by Kolendo and Mount Ive, to the south by Uno and to the east by Siam Station. The traditional owners of the Gawler Ranges are the Gugada peoples. A lease in the area was taken up by Charles Ryan in 1864. Nonning was established by C. H. Leycester in 1864. The lease changed hands many times in the 1860s. In 1868 the property occupied an area of and was equipped with wells and dams and stocked with over 7,000 sheep. Later on Nonning was combined with Kolendo and Coralbignie in the late 1860s with Nonning as the head station. At one stage some 90,000 head of sheep were shorn at Nonning. The lease expired in 1888. Rentals increased in the 1890s and many pastoralists walked deserted their runs. Eventually rentals were decreased again and McTaggart, Smith and Gooch acquired the lease for Nonning in 1906, and by 1915 McTaggart was the sole owner. Dorper sheep had been introduced to a merino base in 2003. In 2010 the property was awarded organic status. The McTaggart family completed their last shearing in early 2009 and had started running sheep for the production of meat instead of wool. Nonning was supporting about a flock of 30,000 sheep. Nonning Post Office opened in 1867; its closure date is unknown. A primary school also formerly existed at Nonning. Nonning also hosts the annual Nonning Gymkhana, organised by the Gawler Ranges Progress Association, to raise money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

She has collaborated on live multi-media projects with musicians like John Zorn and J. G. Thirlwell. She and Ela Troyano co-founded the New York Film Festival Downtown in 1984 and served as its co-directors until 1990. Hughes-Freeland later served as President of the Board of Directors of the Film-Makers Co-Operative in New York City from 1998-2001. She has published articles in numerous books, including ‚ÄúNaked Lens: Beat Cinema‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo Focus: Punk Film,‚Äù and in periodicals including PAPER Magazine, Filmmaker magazine, GQ, the East Village Eye, and Film Threat.http://tessahughesfreeland.com Hughes-Freeland works in a variety of formats and mediums, and her films have been shown in diverse venues, ranging from internationally prominent museums to seedy bars in gritty neighborhoods. Her work frequently confronts conventional perceptions of reality in daring and sometimes provocative ways. Hughes-Freeland's website describes her work as \\"confrontational, transgressive, provocative and poetic\\". The critic Jack Sargeant wrote that Hughes-Freeland \\"approaches filmmaking in a multiplicity of styles, ranging from classic narrative to experimental 'performances' and even a documentary.\\" Hughes-Freeland was part of the No Wave Cinema movement that began in the mid-1970s on New York City's Lower East Side, which included Scott B and Beth B, Richard Kern, Nick Zedd, Jim Jarmusch, Tom DiCillo, Steve Buscemi, and Vincent Gallo. In the 1980s, this morphed into the Cinema of Transgression, in which she and other Lower East Side artists and filmmakers created no-budget films and art that contravened prevailing conventions of American society and challenged established, \\"correct\\" cultural norms. Among the earliest admirers of her work were the controversial, celebrated late artist and activist David Wojnarowicz, who bought her a super 8 camera for her filmmaking, and the writer, critic and curator Carlo McCormick, whom she later married. Career After earning a BA in Art History from University College London and an MA in Cinema Studies from New York University, Hughes-Freeland wrote a stream of articles on the burgeoning avant-garde underground film scene in the East Village, Manhattan in the early to mid-1980s in publications like PAPER Magazine, the East Village Eye and the Underground Film Bulletin. She also organized numerous film nights at local clubs and bars in lower Manhattan like Danceteria and the Reel Club at Club 57, showings that culminated in the creation of the annual New York Film Festival Downtown in 1984. Together with Ela Troyano, Hughes- Freeland founded and ran the annual Festival from 1984 to 1990. A prolific filmmaker, Hughes-Freeland often screened her own films in the 1980s at nightlife venues and in emerging East Village art galleries, such as her 1982 film, \\"Baby Doll,\\" which documented the seedy urban demi-monde of strippers working at the Baby Doll Lounge in Tribeca in lower Manhattan. The Cin√©ma v√©rit√© soundtrack consists of real-life conversations between the go-go dancers, and the film devotes considerable footage to the dancers' feet. The Village Voice noted that Hughes-Freeland was one of about a dozen leading figures in New York's underground film movement, and described Baby Doll as depicting the \\"systemic misogyny destroying the go-go club scene in New York\\" in the 1980s. Hughes-Freeland's 1985 film, \\"Rhonda Goes to Hollywood,\\" a docufiction featuring the artist Rhonda Zwillinger, was exhibited as part of an installation in the Gracie Mansion Gallery in New York. In 1985 Hughes- Freeland's husband Carlo McCormick, who had just written a eulogy entitled \\"East Village R.I.P.\\" that punctuated the decline of the early 1980s lower Manhattan cultural scene, was invited to curate a gallery exhibition in Richmond, Virginia. The show evolved into what became a weekend-long installation art show in which artists competed to create shocking murals on the gallery walls. Hughes-Freeland filmed the installation, which featured artists including Marilyn Minter, Luis Frangella, James Romberger, Marguerite Van Cook and Wojnarowicz. The management of the gallery, whose interior decoration included polished floors and stained glass windows, supplied the artists with beer and overnight accommodations, but was apparently unaware of the installation's transgressive nature. Some of the artists were allegedly using LSD and applying garish colours and shocking images straight onto the gallery walls. The separate scenes were joined together by profanities applied over the results and decorative additions by Frangella. Gallery management was later said to have been pleased to see the artists go. In 1992 Hughes-Freeland worked in collaboration with Annabelle Davies to create a film called \\"Dirty\\" based on Georges Bataille's erotic novella Blue of Noon, whose plot touches upon controversial topics like incest and necrophilia.Underground Film Timeline: 1990-1999, undergroundfilmjournal, retrieved 27 August 2014 Primarily a filmmaker and writer, Hughes-Freeland has occasionally worked as an actor, appearing in the 1993 film \\"Red Spirit Lake,\\" whose opening scene depicts sexual imagery and graphic horror, a scene in which Hughes-Freeland does not appear. The director of the movie, Charles Pinion, cast a number of people associated with the Cinema of Transgression movement like Richard Kern and Hughes-Freeland.Charles Pinion Interview: Part Four: Red Spirit Lake, Mike Everleth, undergroundfilmjournal.com, 2014, retrieved 27 August 2014 In the following year, she made Nymphomania, a film whose mythology-inspired plot depicts a wood nymph disrobing whilst a voyeuristic satyr pleasures himself, then forces himself upon the nymph, impaling her upon his barbed phallus. According to Variant.org, \\"It is all carried off with an understandably ironic humour. The film is an interesting development, focusing more on mythology than the contemporary. The return to unreconstructed Romanticism has been influential - Nymphomania is a precursor to the use of such imagery by art world favourite Matthew Barney.\\" Hughes-Freeland has worked collaboratively with musicians like John Zorn and J. G. Thirlwell on live multiple projections. One project with Zorn and Troyano, ‚ÄúPlayboy Voodoo,‚Äù was performed at the Whitney Museum of American Art as part of the 1996 ‚ÄúNo Wave Cinema‚Äù exhibition. The following year, Hughes-Freeland presented an expanded cinema performance with Troyano for Zorn's composition ‚ÄúElegy‚Äù as part of Zorn's Tzadik record label European tour. She and Troyano presented an expanded cinema performance with Zorn's ‚ÄúGodard‚Äù for Roulette TV in 2002. In 2001, Hughes-Freeland was named a Fellow of the New York Foundation for the Arts. She was one of a handful of filmmakers along with David Wojnarowicz, Richard Kern and others whose work was featured in ‚ÄúYou Killed Me First: The Cinema of Transgression,‚Äù a significant show in 2012 at the KW Institute of Contemporary Art in Berlin. In the spring of 2018, several of Hughes- Freeland's films were shown at the [Museum of Modern Art] as ‚ÄúTransgressive Shorts, 1979-1994‚Äù, part of its exhibition, ‚ÄúClub 57: Film, Performance, and Art in the East Village, 1978‚Äì1983.‚Äù Hughes-Freeland works shown at the MOMA exhibition included ‚ÄúBaby Doll,‚Äù ‚ÄúPlay Boy,‚Äù ‚ÄúRat Trap‚Äù (co-directed with Tommy Turner), ‚ÄúNymphomania‚Äù (co-directed with Holly Adams), ‚ÄúJane Gone,‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayboy Voodoo‚Äù (co-directed with Troyano).

She has been active in the UK since the early 1970s. Early life and education Rhodes was brought up in West England, was educated at North East London Polytechnic, and studied Film and Television at the Royal College of Art.Kuhn, Annette. The Women's Companion to International Film. University of California Press, 1990, p. 340. Career Since the early 1970s, Rhodes has created radical and controversial art that challenges her viewers to question perspective of film through her work. She wanted her audience to \\"reconsider film as a medium of communication and presentation of image, language and sound.\\" She was cinema curator at the London Film-Makers' Co-op from 1975‚Äì76. In 1979, Rhodes co-founded the feminist film distribution network, Circles. She was a member of the exhibition committee for the 1979 Arts Council Film on Film event, and international retrospective of Avante-Garde cinema. Rhodes was Arts Advisor to the Greater London Council from 1982 to 1985, and since 1978 has lectured part-time at the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London. One key innovative piece Rhodes created is Light Music (1975), which was exhibited at the Tate Modern from July 2012 ‚Äì January 2013. Tate deemed it, \\"An iconic work of expanded cinema that created a more central and participatory role for the viewer within a dynamic, immersive environment\\". Her work was also included in the 2007 exhibition WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution. In 2012, Rhodes' solo exhibition, Dissonance and Disturbance was held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. The ICA noted that Rhodes \\"examines the relationships in her work - from film, composition and writing - to the notation of sound and image, and the language of political dissent.\\" According to Rhodes, \\"The view through the lens may be blurred or defined ‚Äì focused or unfocusfocused or unfocused ‚Äì depending on what you think you know; what you imagine you see; what you learn to look for: what you are told is visible\\". Rhodes does not view her art as an isolated practice, but rather as a social function. She lives and works in London.

In 2018, Tsang received a MacArthur \\"genius\\" grant. Tsang re-imagines racialized, gendered representations beyond the visible frame to encompass the multiple and shifting perspectives through which we experience the social realm. Tsang is equally interested in how movement can articulate emotional experiences that exist outside of language. According to Tsang, her films, videos, and performances look to explore the \\"in-betweeness\\" in which people and ideas cannot be discussed in binary terms. Generally, her films form a hybrid of narrative and documentary; they do not conform fully to one form or the other. Work = Film = Tsang's feature documentary, Wildness, documents the Los Angeles trans bar \\"Silver Platter\\". Wu Tsang directed and produced the film. It was co-written with Roya Rastegar. The film was premiered at the MoMA Documentary Fortnight in New York and has been screened at festivals in Canada, the US, and Chile. Since 1963, \\"Silver Platter\\" has been a historic bar that patronised by a predominantly Latin LGBT community. Wildness documents what happens when a group of young artists host a weekly performance night at the bar. Documenting the collision between the two LGBT communities, the film poses questions about community, space, and ownership. In an interview, Tsang describes how this film represents a number of people who are often stereotyped, such as trans people, people of color, and queer communities, and she experiments with how to be accountable to the communities that she documents. Her collaborators include poet and scholar Fred Moten as well as performance artist boychild. Short films Wu Tsang's short films include: * Duilian (2015): The film explores the life and writings of Qiu Jin, a Chinese feminist revolutionary who was executed at the age of 31 for attempting to foment revolution against the Qing dynasty. Lesser known, and highlighted in the film, is her long-term queer relationship with calligrapher Wu Zhuying. Wu Tsang plays Wu Zhuying, and long-time Wu Tsang collaborator, Boychild, plays Qiu Jin. * You're Dead to Me (2013): In suburban California, a Chicana mother is mourning the death of her teenage daughter two years earlier. On the eve of Dia de los Muertos, everything changes when Death offers her a choice she could not make in life. The cast includes Laura Patalano and Harmony Santana. The film was widely shown in LGBT and other film festivals, and won various awards, including best short and best actress. * Tied and True (2012): Co-written with Nana Oforiatta-Ayim, the film takes place in a fictional post-colonial African city, inspired by √éle Saint-Louis, Senegal. It tells the story of two star-crossed lovers while exploring the themes of assimilation, alterity and racism. * Mishima in Mexico (2012): Starring Alex Segade and Wu Tsang, the film is inspired by the 1950 novel by Yukio Mishima, Thirst for Love. It takes place in Mexico City, where a writer and director check into a hotel together to work through their creative process, while integrating Mishima's work into their own, and into their lives. * Wildness (2012): This film tells the story of the weekly party and clinic Tsang hosted at the Silver Platter bar in the MacArthur Park area of Los Angeles, CA. The film is a \\"whimsically fictional account\\" of the events that transpired at the Silver Platter, and is narrated by both Tsang and (in Spanish) the Silver Platter. As Tsang stated in a 2016 interview, \\"The more subjective I could be in telling my own experience of the situation, the more ethical I could be to my subjects and collaborators.\\"https://frieze.com/article/focus-wu-tsang = Performance, video, and installations = In a 2014 interview, Tsang states, \\"For me performance is like research; lived experience is fundamental. I have to do these things to understand or have any critical analysis. I've never been someone who's going to stay behind the camera and observe. I don't perform onstage that often, but when I do it's often part of a process‚Äîit's a way of thinking through things.\\" * Shape of a Right Statement (video, 2008) * The Fist is Still Up (neon sign in the Silver Platter, Los Angeles, 2008) * P.I.G.

Description and history The Isaac Reed House is located opposite Newport's row of 19th-century commercial blocks, on the east side of Main Street a short way south of the Newport Opera House. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a clapboarded exterior. The house is Second Empire in style, with a mansard roof punctured by dormers with central segmented-arch roofs. The main facade is nominally three bays wide, although the first floor is divided in two, with a porticoed entry to the left and an ornately bracketed bay window to the right. The house was built about 1869 by Dr. Isaac Reed, a local dentist, and is an important visual element of the municipal/county cluster of buildings which stand immediately adjacent. There were originally unsympathetic additions to the rear, which were built to make the building a multi-unit residence; these additions were removed in the 1970s, when the town decided not to raze the property. Its destruction had been contemplated as part of an urban renewal project, but was abandoned when the town decided instead to preserve and revitalize the area's historic buildings.

Carvajal worked actively in the resolution of the kidnapping of Boulton in Colombia National Assembly Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios, nicknamed El Pollo (\\"The Chicken\\") (born 1960), is a Venezuelan diplomat and retired general. He was the head of the military intelligence in Venezuela during Hugo Ch√°vez's government, from July 2004 to December 2011. Carvajal was arrested in Spain on 12 April 2019 based on an arrest warrant from the United States for 2011 drug trafficking charges; the U.S. asked Spain to extradite Carvajal. On 26 March 2020, the U.S. Department of State offered $10 million for information to bring him to justice in relation to drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. Biography =Early life= Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios was born on April 1, 1960 in Viento Fresco, a village close to Caicara de Matur√≠n, in the state of Monagas (Eastern Llanos), or in Anzo√°tegui state. He finished his studies at the military academy in 1981. His sister, Wilma Carvajal, was the Mayor of the Cede√±o Municipality. =Career= Carvajal met Hugo Ch√°vez in 1980 at the military academy of Caracas, where Ch√°vez was his instructor. Carvajal took part in the 1992 coup attempt organised by Ch√°vez against the government of Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez. He was detained together with Ch√°vez and he was set free with a general amnesty that president Rafael Caldera introduced in 1994. In September 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) accused Carvajal of helping Colombian guerrilla FARC in its drug trafficking activities by protecting them from drugs seizures, supplying arms and providing with Venezuelan official documents. He was placed on the list together with Henry Rangel Silva, Director of Venezuela's Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services, who later became Minister of Defense and Governor of Trujillo and with Ram√≥n Rodr√≠guez Chac√≠n, former Minister of the Interior & Security. Carvajal was appointed head of the National Official against Organized Crime and Financing of Terrorism in October 2012. In April 2013 he was appointed as the replacement for Wilfredo Figueroa Chac√≠n as head of the Military Counterintelligence. =Arrest= Venezuela appointed Carvajal as its consul in Aruba in January 2014, however he had not been officially accepted by the Dutch government. He was arrested in Aruba on 22 July 2014 on a U.S. arrest warrant. Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro protested saying Carvajal had diplomatic immunity. As a protest Venezuela closed its airspace to planes coming from Aruba and Cura√ßao for several hours, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. Maduro also threatened to slow down business at the Isla oil refinery on Cura√ßao. On July 28, he was released and flown back to Venezuela by private plane. Aruba officials declared that Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans had decided to recognize Carvajal's immunity. The Netherlands declared Carvajal persona non grata. In a public appearance Maduro stated: \\"We had a plan to escalate tension in Latin America\\". One day after his release information was released that Venezuela had sent four military ships close to the shores of Aruba while Carvajal was detained. The United States Department of State said that it had evidence for severe threats by Venezuela against both Aruba and the Netherlands. The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had contact with Venezuela about the military ships, with Venezuela stating that they were returning from an exercise. The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affair also stated that Carvajal was released after strictly judicial considerations based on international law. Carvajal is also wanted by Colombia for the torture and murder of two agents. = Support for Guaid√≥ = On 21 February 2019, during the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, Carvajal made a video in support of Juan Guaid√≥ as interim president of Venezuela and criticized Nicol√°s Maduro's presidency. Carvajal calls for Venezuelan military forces to break ranks and to allow the shipping of humanitarian aid to Venezuela. Maduro expelled Carvajal from the Armed Forces on 4 April, degraded his Major General status, and accused him of treason.

History On 15 November 1946 the Linggadjati Agreement was signed between the Netherlands and the soon-to-be independent Dutch East Indies, which stated that the Dutch colonies would become an independent nation called 'the United States of Indonesia'. A Netherlands-Indonesian Union was established \\"to promote their common interests.\\" Due to a military dispute, the execution of the agreement did not take place. After the Netherlands had signed a truce with the Republic of Indonesia, the transfer of sovereignty took place on 27 December 1949, and the Netherlands-Indonesian Union was founded. The Union was abolished when Indonesia left in 1956. Structure The Netherlands-Indonesian Union would be a Dutch equivalent of the British Commonwealth. The Union would consist of two independent and sovereign partners: #the Kingdom of the Netherlands, consisting of ##the Netherlands ##Suriname ##the Netherlands Antilles ##Netherlands New Guinea #the United States of Indonesia, comprising seven states. The status of Netherlands New Guinea should be discussed further. Preliminary New Guinea remained under Dutch rule. And, where Suriname and the Antilles would be equal partners (federated states) in the Kingdom, New Guinea would remain a colony. The Head of the Union (Hoofd der Unie) would be Queen Juliana. The collaboration would take place in the following areas: *defense *foreign relations *finance *economic relations *cultural relations To accomplish this, various organs would be called in life. Firstly, a conference of ministers had to be held every six months. Secondly, a permanent secretariat was established in The Hague. Each partner would choose a Secretary-General, who would each year take the leadership of the Secretariat. (From 1950 this was P.J.A. Idenburg for the Netherlands, who would remain it until 1956.) Finally, there was a Union-Court of Arbitration set up to judge disputes between the Netherlands and Indonesia.

It is a stochastic jump process with arbitrary distributions of jump lengths and waiting times. More generally it can be seen to be a special case of a Markov renewal process.  Motivation  CTRW was introduced by Montroll and Weiss as a generalization of physical diffusion process to effectively describe anomalous diffusion, i.e., the super- and sub-diffusive cases. An equivalent formulation of the CTRW is given by generalized master equations. A connection between CTRWs and diffusion equations with fractional time derivatives has been established. Similarly, time-space fractional diffusion equations can be considered as CTRWs with continuously distributed jumps or continuum approximations of CTRWs on lattices.  Formulation  A simple formulation of a CTRW is to consider the stochastic process X(t) defined by : X(t) = X_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} \\\\Delta X_i, whose increments \\\\Delta X_i are iid random variables taking values in a domain \\\\Omega and N(t) is the number of jumps in the interval (0,t). The probability for the process taking the value X at time t is then given by : P(X,t) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty P(n,t) P_n(X). Here P_n(X) is the probability for the process taking the value X after n jumps, and P(n,t) is the probability of having n jumps after time t.  Montroll-Weiss formula  We denote by \\\\tau the waiting time in between two jumps of N(t) and by \\\\psi(\\\\tau) its distribution. The Laplace transform of \\\\psi(\\\\tau) is defined by : \\\\tilde{\\\\psi}(s)=\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} d\\\\tau \\\\, e^{-\\\\tau s} \\\\psi(\\\\tau). Similarly, the characteristic function of the jump distribution f(\\\\Delta X) is given by its Fourier transform: : \\\\hat{f}(k)=\\\\int_\\\\Omega d(\\\\Delta X) \\\\, e^{i k\\\\Delta X} f(\\\\Delta X). One can show that the Laplace-Fourier transform of the probability P(X,t) is given by : \\\\hat{\\\\tilde{P}}(k,s) = \\\\frac{1-\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}(s)}{s} \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\tilde{\\\\psi}(s)\\\\hat{f}(k)}. The above is called Montroll-Weiss formula.  Examples  The homogeneous Poisson point process is a continuous time random walk with exponential holding times and with each increment deterministically equal to 1.

While prevalent world- wide, hot-spots of current witch-hunting are India, Papua New Guinea, Amazonia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. While an unknown problem in vast parts of the Western population, body-counts of modern witch-hunts by far exceed those of early-modern witch-hunting.Behringer, Wolfgang 2004: Witches and Witch- hunts. A global History. Cambridge: Polity Press.  Terminology  Of main terminological interest in ethnographic literature were the emic perspectives and differentiations between witchcraft (spiritual) and sorcery (possible empiric actions like creating amulets, charms, chanting spells and curses) and the classification and translation of native terminology concerning spiritual offenses and powers. Ethnographic literature has used the term \\"sorcerer- hunt\\", which is used equivalent to witch-hunt. Also \\"sorcery\\" and \\"sorcellerie\\" is sometimes used as equivalent to \\"witchcraft\\". A confusion of the terms \\"witch-hunt\\", \\"witchcraft\\" and \\"witchcraft notions\\" permeates scientific literature. In this article, only those cases are referred to as witch-hunts, that involve the notion of a spiritual crime. Closely related and sometimes included are accusations of sorcery, where a potentially observable act is suggested, but rarely proven. Acts of lynching involving fabricated rumors of ritual murders occur frequently in Sub-Saharan Africa. They can be classified as very closely related to witch-hunts. Not included is the different phenomenon ritual murder or any ritual abuse, which is sometimes referred to as witchcraft or witch-hunting (meaning the man-hunt for body- parts for ritual purposes). A common parlance refers to witch-hunts as \\"witchcraft\\", a confusion of topics. Another common parlance refers to political persecution in general as \\"witch-hunt\\", an example were the trials of McCarthyism in the USA.  Africa  Most witch-hunts today take place in modern sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of ethnographic literature on the subject remains on a local level. Summarizing studies and meta-analysis remain scarce due to the amount of data involved. Max Marwick, John Middleton, Mary Douglas and Lucy Mair were among the first to cover a wider range of witch- hunts. In recent times, Wolfgang Behringer has provided an overview about witch-hunts throughout history and continents.Behringer, Wolfgang 2006: Witches and Witch-hunts. A particularly high prevalence of recent witch- hunting has been noted for the DRC, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Nigeria. Other states showing ongoing and repeated witch-hunts are Malawi, Ghana, Gambia, Benin, Angola, CAR. While some societies suffer at most sporadic and low-level witch-hunts (Senegal, Namibia, Rwanda), the entire Sub-Saharan Africa shows a high prevalence of beliefs in the existence of witchcraft and a considerable prevalence of violent witch-hunts. Nonetheless, many if not most ethnic groups belief in the existence of witchcraft but do not or not normally accuse people of witchcraft. Where accusations occur, accusations do not in all places lead to violence and can be even used for benefits by the accused person. = Cameroon = Several African states, including Cameroon, have reestablished witchcraft-accusations in courts after their independence. From Cameroon, Robert Brain and Peter Geschiere delivered ethnographic accounts on a child-witchcraft scare that tended to remain largely peacefully. After confessions, the accused or self-accused children were rewarded with large amounts of meat to induce a purifying vomiting.Geschiere, Peter 1983: Child Witches against the Authority of their Elders.

In: Douglas, Mary (ed.) 1970: Witchcraft Confessions and Accusations. In addition, witch doctors have been used as expert witnesses in trials, according to a 1998 study. In 2017, it was reported that the Cameroonian President Paul Biya had urged citizens to use witchcraft as a means of combatting Boko Haram. = Gambia = In March 2009, Amnesty International reported that up to 1,000 people in the Gambia had been abducted by government-sponsored \\"witch doctors\\" on charges of witchcraft, and taken to detention centers where they were forced to a drink poisonous concoction at gunpoint, known as kubejaro. On 21 May 2009, the New York Times reported that the alleged witch-hunting campaign had been sparked by the Gambian President, Yahya Jammeh. The president continued a series of \\"witch hunts\\" over the next seven years, in which rural villagers experienced beatings, kidnappings, and forced confessions (after the ingestion of kubejaro, which often made the victims extremely weak or unconscious). Deaths that occurred during the time were due to the side effects of drinking kubejaro, such as kidney failure, or beatings. Later, the Gambian government launched an investigation of these crimes and opened a center to support the victims. However, a Washington Post report found that many of the victims had received no support or outreach from such initiatives. Many of the victims also still suffer from health problems, such as pains, weakness, and anxiety. Jammeh fled the country in 2017 after losing an election. In January 2019, investigators began interviewing people about their experiences of the atrocities, as either torturers or victims. The hearings may last two years. Meanwhile, the truth and reconciliation commission publicizes the interviews through social media. = Ghana = Research on witch-hunting in Ghana dates back into the early 20th century. Arthur W. Cardinall may be the first anthropologist to mention the Ghetto for victims of witch-hunts at an earth-shrine in Gnani (Tindang, Gnaani). A later research of Susan Drucker-Brown observed and discussed the renowned Ghetto in Gambaga. In 2004, the documentary Witches in Exile by Allison Berg followed the structure of accusations in Kukuo, the biggest Ghetto near Bimbilla. Another documentary, The Witches of Gambaga, follows over 10 years the inmates of Gambaga. The Bradt Travel Guides mentions the ghetto in Gambaga as a tourist attraction. A total of eight sanctuaries for witch-hunt victims were listed by the Ethnologist Felix Riedel. The list of sanctuaries includes so far (locations with inmates): * Kukuo (Bimbilla, Nanumba South): 450. * Tindang (Gnani, Gnaani): 350. * Gushiegu: 120. * Gambaga: 80. * Nabule (Chereponi): 55. * Kpatinga: 40. * Duabone: 10. * Banyasi (Bonyanse): 3-8 While all are sanctuaries that offer protection for outcasts, at least five of the eight ghettoes are dominated by an earth-priest. They then serve as sites for traditional exorcisms, that involve a chicken-ordeal to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused person and a concoction to cleanse the supposed witchcraft-power. The local earth is believed to neutralize the witchcraft powers. Ethnographic research and journalistic interest in the comparably safe and well-researched Northern Ghana sometimes lead to an overrepresentation of Ghana what witch-hunting concerns. Neighbouring regions and countries appear underrepresented in current research in comparison. In the southern parts of Ghana as in its urban areas witch-hunting as mass-violence occurs, but far less frequent than in the Northern Regions. Deadly mass-panics in Accra and Kumasi involved media-induced penis-theft-hysterias common throughout Western and Central Africa. In general, witchcraft accusations in Southern Ghana today tend to stay rather peaceful or at least quiet, leading to social isolation of a person. A study of Van der Geest also showed, that almost every person in a Southern Ghanaian town has both experienced an accusation and accused another person.Bleek, Wolf (Sjaak van der Geest) 1976: Witchcraft, Gossip and Death: A social Drama. In: Man 11/4. Hg. von Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. 526‚Äì541. In the early 20th century, several Witch-hunting movements spread from Northern Ghana's shrine Tongnaab into Southern Ghana and into Nigeria. Those movements tended to stay rather peaceful, while harassment, beating and fining of accused persons occurred on a regular base. = Kenya = Kenya has a long-covered history of witch-hunts. In the past years, lynchings were a frequent feature of public violence. For example, it was reported on 21 May 2008 that in Kenya a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft. The Western region of Kenya is particularly known for witch hunts, and the district of Kisii has been labeled a \\"sorcery belt\\". In this region, elders are often targeted and labeled as witches. = Nigeria = People accused of being witches in Nigeria include a seventy year old widow from Irrua named Auntie B. As of 2019, she had avoided being made to drink a magical potion of toxic substances. In the nearby Ozalla community, at least twenty accused people since 2004 have died under similar circumstances. \\"Killing an alleged witch is considered a form of community service, a way to avenge and neutralize the source of danger to the community.\\" = Sierra Leone = In Sierra Leone, the witch-hunt is an occasion for a sermon by the k…õmam…îi (native Mende witch-finder) on social ethics : \\"Witchcraft ... takes hold in people's lives when people are less than fully open-hearted. All wickedness is ultimately because people hate each other or are jealous or suspicious or afraid. These emotions and motivations cause people to act antisocially\\". The response by the populace to the k…õmam…îi is that \\"they valued his work and would learn the lessons he came to teach them, about social responsibility and cooperation.\\" = Tanzania = Tanzania has seen some of the most intense witch-hunts in Africa, with an estimated 20,000 people brought to death throughout the past 20 years. Mostly elderly women were affected by the violence. As a main factor, economic strains and exploitation are named by documentaries, state-reports and independent observers. As much as 93% of the population believe in magic and witchcraft, and witchdoctors play an important role in society as healers, and everyday helpers, with as much as 100,000 registered in the county's healthcare system protocols.Vigilante killings in Tanzania spur a hunt for witch-huntersWitchcraft in Tanzania: the good, bad and the persecution Black magic and witchcraft, however, is feared and not just for superstitious reasons. Incidents of abductions, maimings and even bestial killings by witchdoctors and their helpers, are regularly experienced in Tanzania, where human body parts are used in some witchcraft rituals or as magical charms. In particular the country's albino population is targeted for this, but not exclusively.Witchcraft horror: Tanzania children have genitals and tongues cut off in ritual killing = Zambia = Audrey I. Richards, in the journal Africa, relates in 1935 an instance when a new wave of witchfinders, the Bamucapi, appeared in the villages of the Bemba people of Zambia. They dressed in European clothing, and would summon the headman to prepare a ritual meal for the village. When the villagers arrived they would view them all in a mirror, and claimed they could identify witches with this method. These accused persons would then have to \\"yield up his horns\\"; i.e. give over the horn containers for curses and evil potions to the witch- finders. The bamucapi then made all drink a potion called kucapa which would cause a witch to die and swell up if he ever tried such things again. The villagers related that the witch-finders were always right because the witches they found were always the people whom the village had feared all along. The bamucapi utilised a mixture of Christian and native religious traditions to account for their powers and said that God (not specifying which God) helped them to prepare their medicine. In addition, all witches who did not attend the meal to be identified would be called to account later on by their master, who had risen from the dead, and who would force the witches by means of drums to go to the graveyard, where they would die. Richards noted that the bamucapi created the sense of danger in the villages by rounding up all the horns in the village, whether they were used for anti-witchcraft charms, potions, snuff or were indeed receptacles of black magic.  Asia  = India = Some people in India, mostly in villages, have the belief that witchcraft and black magic are effective. On one hand, people may seek advice from witch doctors for health, financial or marital problems. On the other hand, people, especially women, are accused of witchcraft and attacked, occasionally killed. It has been reported that mostly widows or divorcees are targeted to rob them of their property. Reportedly, revered village witch-doctors are paid to brand specific persons as witches, so that they can be killed without repercussions. The existing laws have been considered ineffective in curbing the murders. In June 2013, National Commission for Women (NCW) reported that according to National Crime Records Bureau statistics, 768 women had been murdered for allegedly practising witchcraft since 2008 and announced plans for newer laws. Recent cases Between 2001 and 2006, an estimated 300 people were killed in the state of Assam. Between 2005 and 2010, about 35 witchcraft related murders reportedly took place in Odisha's Sundergarh district. In October 2003, three women were branded as witch and humiliated, afterwards they all committed suicide in Kamalpura village in Muzaffarpur district in Bihar. In August 2013, a couple were hacked to death by a group of people in Kokrajhar district in Assam. In September 2013, in the Jashpur district of Chhattisgarh, a woman was murdered and her daughter was raped on the allegation that they were practising black magic. A 2010 estimate places the number of women killed as witches in India at between 150 and 200 per year, or a total of 2,500 in the period of 1995 to 2009.The Hindu, Nearly 200 women killed every year after being branded witches, 26 July 2010. Herald Sun, 200 'witches' killed in India each year ‚Äì report, 26 July 2010. The lynchings are particularly common in the poor northern states of Jharkhand,A Jharkhand case publicized in international media in 2009 concerned five Muslim women. BBC News, 30 October 2009. Bihar and the central state of Chhattisgarh. Witch hunts are also taking place among the tea garden workers in Jalpaiguri, West Bengal India. The witch hunts in Jalpaiguri are less known, but are motivated by the stress in the tea industry on the lives of the adivasi workers. In India, labeling a woman as a witch is a common ploy to grab land, settle scores or even to punish her for turning down sexual advances. In a majority of the cases, it is difficult for the accused woman to reach out for help and she is forced to either abandon her home and family or driven to commit suicide. Most cases are not documented because it is difficult for poor and illiterate women to travel from isolated regions to file police reports. Less than 2 percent of those accused of witch-hunting are actually convicted, according to a study by the Free Legal Aid Committee, a group that works with victims in the state of Jharkhand.Womensnews.org.Bailey, Frederick George 1994: The Witch-Hunt, or the Triumph of Morality. New York: Cornell University Press. = Indonesia = Superstition and belief in magic is most common in Indonesia, where services from dukun, as Indonesian male and female witch- doctors are called, help with healings, blessings, fortune telling, and other magical tasks in everyday life on a regular basis. Belief in, and fear of, black magic and sorcery from dukun is also prevalent and a source of conflict and sometimes even witch-hunts and killings. The collapse of the violent Suharto-era in 1998, was accompanied by vigilante witch-hunts with about 400 killings in the following years.Siegel, James 2006: Naming the Witch. Stanford: Stanford University Press. The large scale persecutions has diminished since then, but accusations, witch-hunts and sometimes killings still occur regularly on a smaller scale in Indonesia.East Java's villagers hunt witches to put an end to nightmares and sickness However, it is unclear if superstition and genuine fear of sorcery is the motivating factor in these incidents, or the prospect of grabbing victims possessions and property is more important.Witch Hunts in Java Called a Cover for Murders The law and penal code of Indonesia does not encompass magic or the supernatural, but there has been public pressure and debate about including it since at least 1981, hoping to outlaw witches and witchcraft.Legislating against the supernatural = Nepal = Witch-hunts in Nepal are common, and are targeted especially against low-caste women.http://www.whrin.org/wp- content/uploads/2013/07/Witchcraft-report-INSEC.pdf The main causes of witchcraft related violence include widespread belief in superstition, lack of education, lack of public awareness, illiteracy, caste system, male domination, and economic dependency of women on men. The victims of this form of violence are often beaten, tortured, publicly humiliated, and murdered. Sometimes, the family members of the accused are also assaulted. In 2010, Sarwa Dev Prasad Ojha, minister for women and social welfare, said, \\"Superstitions are deeply rooted in our society, and the belief in witchcraft is one of the worst forms of this.\\" = Papua New Guinea = Though the practice of \\"white\\" magic (such as faith healing) is legal in Papua New Guinea, the 1976 Sorcery Act imposes a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of \\"black\\" magic. In 2009, the government reports that extrajudicial torture and murder of alleged witches ‚Äì usually lone women ‚Äì are spreading from the highland areas to cities as villagers migrate to urban areas.Channel4.com. For example, in June 2013, four women were accused of witchcraft because the family \\"had a 'permanent house' made of wood, and the family had tertiary educations and high social standing\\". All of the women were tortured and Helen Rumbali was beheaded. Helen Hakena, chairwoman of the North Bougainville Human Rights Committee, said that the accusations started because of economic jealousy born of a mining boom. Reports by UN agencies, Amnesty International, Oxfam and anthropologists show that \\"attacks on accused sorcerers and witches ‚Äî sometimes men, but most commonly women ‚Äî are frequent, ferocious and often fatal.\\"It's 2013, And They're Burning 'Witches.' By Jo Chandler, The Global Mail. February 15, 2013 It's estimated about 150 cases of violence and killings are occurring each year in just the province of Simbu in Papua New Guinea alone. Reports indicate this practice of witch hunting has in some places evolved into \\"something more malignant, sadistic and voyeuristic.\\" One woman who was attacked by young men from a nearby village \\"had her genitals burned and fused beyond functional repair by the repeated intrusions of red-hot irons.\\" Few incidents are ever reported, according to the 2012 Law Reform Commission, which concluded that they have increased since the 1980s.  Other regions  = Amazonia = Neil L. Whitehead and Robin Wright presented a collection of essays on witch-hunts among native tribes in the amazon high- and lowlands. While prevalent in many tribes, especially child-witch-hunts among Ashaninka have attracted interest and raised questions about methodological strategies in reporting abusive practices in an already biased environment.

Durham & London: Duke University Press. = Saudi Arabia = Witchcraft or sorcery remains a criminal offense in Saudi Arabia, although the precise nature of the crime is undefined. The frequency of prosecutions for this in the country as whole is unknown. However, in November 2009, it was reported that 118 persons had been arrested in the province of Makkah that year for practising magic and \\"using the Book of Allah in a derogatory manner\\", 74% of them being female. According to Human Rights Watch in 2009, prosecutions for witchcraft and sorcery are proliferating and \\"Saudi courts are sanctioning a literal witch hunt by the religious police.\\" In 2006, an illiterate Saudi woman, Fawza Falih, was convicted of practising witchcraft, including casting an impotence spell, and sentenced to death by beheading, after allegedly being beaten and forced to fingerprint a false confession that had not been read to her. After an appeal court had cast doubt on the validity of the death sentence because the confession had been retracted, the lower court reaffirmed the same sentence on a different basis. In 2007, Mustafa Ibrahim, an Egyptian national, was executed, having been convicted of using sorcery in an attempt to separate a married couple, as well as of adultery and of desecrating the Quran. Also in 2007, Abdul Hamid Bin Hussain Bin Moustafa al-Fakki, a Sudanese national, was sentenced to death after being convicted of producing a spell that would lead to the reconciliation of a divorced couple. In 2009, Ali Sibat, a Lebanese television presenter who had been arrested whilst on a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, was sentenced to death for witchcraft arising out of his fortune-telling on an Arab satellite channel. His appeal was accepted by one court, but a second in Medina upheld his death sentence again in March 2010, stating that he deserved it as he had publicly practised sorcery in front of millions of viewers for several years. In November 2010, the Supreme Court refused to ratify the death sentence, stating that there was insufficient evidence that his actions had harmed others. On 12 December 2011, Amina bint Abdulhalim Nassar was beheaded in Al Jawf Province after being convicted of practicing witchcraft and sorcery. Another very similar situation occurred to Muree bin Ali bin Issa al-Asiri and he was beheaded on 19 June 2012 in the Najran Province.Saudi man executed for 'witchcraft and sorcery'  Children and witch-hunting  Witch-hunts against children appear in the early ethnographic literature and in many modern circumstances. In Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, but also in Brazil sporadic child-witch-hunts have a tradition of at least 100 years. In the past 20 years and especially in the past 10 years an unprecedented increases in child-witch-hunting has been noted in Southern Nigeria, DRC, Angola, Ghana and other sub-Saharan regions. Several sources estimate 40,000 children in Kinshasa alone as witch-hunt-related orphans.  Public awareness and scientific debate  Public awareness of witch-hunting outside Africa is low compared to other conflicts. In early social/cultural anthropology, ethnology and other cultural sciences, witchcraft beliefs and witch-hunts ranked as paradigmatic problems especially from the late 19th century into the first half of the 20th century, the time of the creative career of James George Frazer. With the loss of interest in overarching theories and development-problems bound to the late colonial era, witch-hunts and witchcraft-beliefs were treated as an issue of specialists. Ethnographies divide sharply in critical reports of violence and in rationalizations of witchcraft-beliefs as useful functions according to paradigms of structural functionalism with its main proponents Bronislaw Malinowski and his student E.E. Evans-Pritchard. In this tradition, the focus of research was shifted on supposed social functions of witchcraft-beliefs and less frequent, violent witch-hunts. Both were considered as ensuring the survival and identity of an ingroup. One of the last competing generalizing theorists was Lucien L√©vy- Bruhl. He collected material of societies that were first contacted by the source writing about its behaviour. He then provides evidence of counterproductive witch-hunting that serves no real social function, but arises from an entirely different worldview, the \\"prelogic\\" mindset opposed to logic.

He is the inventor-in-chief of Sloan Water Technology Ltd., a company founded around his inventions. He is an academician of three national academies. Trained in physics and theoretical physics, he works across physical, medical, biological, social and ocean sciences, fluid dynamics and engineering. He joined the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) at the University of Southampton in 1992 as a lecturer in underwater acoustics, and completed the monograph The Acoustic Bubble in the same year. He was awarded a personal chair at the age of 35 and has authored over 400 publications. Education He was educated at Heversham Grammar School, Cumbria and Magdalene College, Cambridge where he studied the Natural Sciences Tripos and awarded a double first class Bachelor of Arts degree with honours in physics and theoretical Physics in 1985, obtaining a PhD in 1988 at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. Following his PhD, he was awarded senior and advanced research fellowships at Magdalene College, Cambridge funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Early career He joined the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) at the University of Southampton in 1992 as a lecturer in underwater acoustics, and completed the monograph The Acoustic Bubble in the same year. He was awarded a personal chair at the age of 35. Research He founded and leads two research organisations he founded (Global-NAMRIP and HEFUA), is a director and inventor-in-chief of Sloan Water Technology Ltd., and talks extensively to schoolchildren, the public, and on radio and video. His research covers medical, humanitarian and environmental sciences, beginning with the fundamental mathematics and ending with engineering applications. His research interests cover acoustical oceanography, antimicrobial resistance, biomedical ultrasound, carbon capture and storage, climate change, decontamination, hospital acquired infections, marine zoology, fluid dynamics, ultrasound and underwater acoustics. Such fields as cold water cleaning, sound in space, ultrasound in air, BiaPSS, TWIPR, and passive acoustic lithortripsy monitoring, pushed pioneering research into game- changing technology. as opposed to incremental research that is published but falls short of societal benefit: He worked as part of the team investigating whether man-made sounds can adversely affect benthic species (marine life that inhabits the seabed). Such species have been overlooked in studies on how man- made sounds affect whales, dolphins and fish: benthic species find it far harder to relocate away from adverse sounds than do these other more mobile species. Furthermore, benthic species play a key role in the health of the marine sediment, turning it over and preventing it stagnating, and are key to the health of coastal marine environments. With other teams he developed methods to assess which fish species are most at-risk from man-made noise in the oceans, and quantified such noise from shipping. Turning the problem on its head, he worked with other teams on how to use sound as 'underwater acoustic scarecrows' to guide fish away from regions of man-made danger. These might occurs, for example, where industry exacts cooling water from rivers used as migration paths of endangered species (the young of European eel are slim enough for the flow to pull them through grills placed over such extraction points). (key collaborator: Paul White) =NAMRIP and Global- NAMRIP= The Global Network for AntiMicrobial Resistance and Infection Prevention (Global-NAMRIP), is a multidisciplinary research team of hundreds researchers and end users, across four continents, including engineers, chemists, microbiologists, environmental scientists, veterinary and human medics, clinicians who contribute to international and national antibiotic guidelines for specified conditions, experts in food, ethics and law, crucially networked with economists, geographers, health scientists and experts from other social science disciplines to provide a truly joined up approach to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and infection prevention (offsetting the loss of diversity in pharmaceutical industry research teams). As Leighton said at NAMRIP's 2016 conference: Global-NAMRIP was set up to search for such solutions and mitigations, with particular emphasis to finding alternatives to the oft-cited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics. According to the New Scientist,: Global-NAMRIP creates new research teams, commissions new research, engaging with industry to roll out solutions to society, and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach, education and dialogue. The award-winning Public Engagement and Policymaker Engagement programmes that Leighton devised and leads have been mentioned in Parliament by the Under-Secretary of State for Health on 16 November 2017. and Leighton has addressed the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee on his approach to addressing the threat of AMR. Global-NAMRIP particularly supports Low/Middle Income Countries with not-for- profit interventions, for example with initiatives in urban and rural Ghana (infection being the primary cause of death in rural Ghana). In Uganda in 2019, Global-NAMRIP members from Uganda, Liberia, Malawi, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia and the UK met to compare, for the first time, the national AMR strategies of their respective countries, to share best practice. The meeting also produced significant impact in education, support for young innovators, and responded to a request from the Ugandan Minister for Health to write for him the 'Kampala Declaration on AMR'. =Health Effects of Ultrasound in Air= Health Effects of Ultrasound in Air (HEFUA) was founded to map the increasing use of ultrasound in public places, and to investigate whether or not this increase is having adverse effects on some humans (following an investigation which revealed that the use of ultrasound in public places is increasing, and that guidelines were inadequate prior to the 2016 report). The 2016 report that first raised the issues was, in the first 2 years, downloaded over 20,000 times from the Royal Society website, leading to requests for a follow-up, a journal special issue, and numerous conference sessions worldwide as the importance of this topic was realised. Scientists, engineers and the public around the world are now logging the location and type of device that emits ultrasound. Leighton became an acknowledged world expert on such public exposures, and on the claims of 'sonic attacks' on US Embassy staff in Cuba and China. His expertise on the effect on humans of ultrasound in air provided the scientific basis that was cited by Giles Watling MP (Clacton, Conservative) in the Motion for leave to bring in a Bill (Standing Order No. 23) on \\"Anti-loitering Devices (Regulation)\\" (17 July 2018 Volume 645, 2.06 pm). =Extraterrestrial acoustics= * Predicting the soundscapes of other worlds and how these could best be exploited using acoustic devices, led to devices for planetaria to use when teaching about other worlds, and showed how careful calculation was needed to avoid mistakes when using acoustic sensors on other worlds. =Marine mammal acoustics= Leighton's explanation of how humpback whales use sound when feeding in bubble nets is now a staple explanation on whale tour boats. He explained how dolphins can echolocate while producing bubble nets to hunt, a process that should blind their sonar. Inventions =Medical and healthcare= Leighton invented systems for: * detecting bone disease (including osteoporosis). * monitoring the efficiency of kidney stone therapy (an invention that won the 2008 ‚ÄòMedical & Healthcare‚Äô award from ‚ÄòThe Engineer‚Äô with key collaborator: Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust). * solutions for needle-free injectors for migraine sufferers (over 1 million sold). and assisted the Institute of Cancer Research with technology for tumour therapy monitoring (2010). Two billion people have been scanned in the womb under the guidelines he helped co-author for the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology guidelines for foetal ultrasonic scanning. He served on the Government of the United Kingdom's Working Group of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies Sub Group and advised the Health Protection Agency and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection Term over service completed on the safety of ultrasound. Other medical and healthcare inventions and breakthroughs are listed below under Sloan Water Technology Ltd., Global-NAMRIP and HEFUA. Comparison of standard sonar and TWIPS in finding a target in bubbly water. Adapted from =Humanitarian= Leighton invented: * radar for the detection of buried explosives, hidden bugging devices, and for the location of buried catastrophe victims (in avalanches, mudslides, collapsed buildings etc.) * the world's only sonar system capable of detecting objects in bubbly water (key, for example, to protecting services, cargo and aid shipping in conflict zones). \\\\- mine detection is often an ongoing problem long after conflict has reduced and civilians return to former conflict zones (key collaborator: Paul White) * a number of systems for detecting objects buried in the seabed and, in collaboration with the National Oceanography Centre, one sold by Kongsberg for archaeological and civil engineering purposes. Various collaborations are looking at ways of providing clean water from waste in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, including mentorships of young entrepreneurs in Africa. Methodology by which active (red) and passive (yellow) sonar can be used to detect and quantify leaks from natural seeps or carbon capture and storage Facilities, taken from ref. =Environmental and Safety= Leighton: * devised and conducted the experiment that revealed that the amount of carbon dioxide dissolving into the oceans was much greater than the values previously used in predicting climate change and ocean acidification; * invented technology used by environmental agencies and oil and gas companies to monitor for undersea gas leaks from pipelines, and from methane seeps, by their acoustic emissions. * devised the theory and methodology by which sonar could be used to monitor and quantify gas leaks from carbon capture and storage facilities in the seabed. This was later included as part of large-scale multinational trials on the North Sea seabed and elsewhere to assess leakage * systems assess the amount of methane in the seabed. This is important to assess the potential for leaks from these reserves into the sea and (eventually) the atmosphere (in the seabed, there is probably more carbon trapped in methane than there is in all other forms of conventional fossil fuel, yet as a greenhouse gas methane is 20 times more potent per molecule than carbon dioxide, so assessing how much is in the seabed, and how much leaks into the atmosphere, is a key task). * devised theory and methodology for measuring key parameters in the transfer of atmospheric gas between atmosphere and ocean, that was later included in large-scale multi-national trials This is important for climate change modelling, because over 1000 million tonnes of atmospheric carbon transfers each year between atmosphere and ocean. * Inventions assist safety in the world's most powerful pulsed spallation neutron source ($1.3 billion) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States. =Sloan Water Technology Ltd.= In the late 1980s, Leighton discovered a new ultrasonic signal that he identified as due to surface waves on the walls of gas bubbles in liquids. Multidisciplinary research in the following ten parallel streams of work turned this discovery into Sloan Water Technology Ltd: # Theory of how to stimulate these surface waves; # measurement of the liquid convection and shear they generate; theory on how sound causes the bubbles to generate cracks; # theory for acoustics in porous materials (leading to the first theory to show why passing ultrasound through different directions in the human ankle could monitor osteoporosis); # the world's first measurements of the bubble size distribution for industry and in the ocean surf zone, leading to ocean measurements necessary to predict the climatological significance of the transfer of carbon dioxide between atmosphere and ocean. It also provided techniques for measurement in industrial pipelines which led to sensors for the oil and gas, carbon capture and storage, ceramics and nuclear industries. # measurement of the liquid convection and shear from these surface waves; theory on how sound causes the bubbles to generate cracks; # acoustic losses in water surrounded on all sides by air and containing microscopic natural particles; # acoustic propagation down curved columns of fluid, and how horns could facilitate this; # use of acoustic pulses to enhance bubble activity; # controlled bubble generation; # how these bubbles affect living cells and surfaces. These 10 streams of fundamental research represented the knowledge on which Sloan Water Technology Ltd. was founded. It is currently producing technology for cleaning and changing surfaces using only cold water, air bubbles and sound (without chemicals or drugs). This reduces the use of water and electricity, reduces pollution and has run-off that is easier to convert back to drinking water, and reduces the threat of ‚Äòsuperbugs‚Äô.

He is a Visiting Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Studies of Loughborough University. In 2018 the International Institute of Acoustics and Vibration (IIAV), of which he had not been a member, undertook a change to its Bylaws, and vote of all IIAV members, to create new rank of Distinguished Fellow. It is the highest rank for individual IIAV members of this international body, and Professor Leighton was the recipient in its inaugural year. Outreach, TV and radio work Leighton has developed and conducted multiply-award-winning outreach activities to the public, and to encourage of young men and women to engage, and possibly follow careers in, science and engineering, with school visits, science fairs, exhibits, games, and appearances on TV and radio. His public engagement work regarding his invention, ‚ÄúThe most dangerous game in the world‚Äù, which he designed to communicate with the public on the issue of superbugs and how they can protect themselves and society, was mentioned by Steve Brine MP, the Under-Secretary of State for Health on 16 November 2017.

It was founded in 1979 by feminist filmmakers Lis Rhodes, Jo Davis, Felicity Sparrow and Annabel Nicolson, publishing a 1980 catalogue including about 30 films, and it closed in 1991, largely due to funding issues that also prompted the merger of Circles and Cinema of Women, which led to the formation of Cinenova. A previous funding crisis in 1987, when funding by Tower Hamlets council had been withdrawn, had been resolved with replacement funding from the British Film Institute. Origins According to Jenny Holland and Jane Harris, \\"Circles started in 1979, partly as a response to an Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition on experimental film. Feeling that their work on women's involvement in this field was being marginalised, the women on the exhibition committee withdrew their painstakingly researched work and issued an explanatory statement. In many ways, this research was the cornerstone of Circles, which went on to distribute the films by Alice Guy, Germaine Dulac, Maya Deren, and Lois Weber which were to have been discussed in the exhibition.\\" The statement, \\"Women and the Formal Film,\\" was published in the \\"Film as Film\\" exhibition catalogue and acted as a manifesto for the distribution collective that emerged. Film Catalogue By the time of its closure, Circles' catalogue comprised over 200 titles, predominantly short and medium-length films, encompasses 90 years of women's film production and including a range of original formats, \\"offering tape recording, video tapes, slide/tape and performance works for hire alongside film.\\" The catalogue editors described the films and their significance as: > representing the visions, truths and ideas of women from a diverse range of > cultural and political backgrounds. Each film/video breaks the monopoly of > the male-defined culture, placing women at the centre of the images, the > stories and the language; replacing male subjectivity with women's > experiences as female eyes look through the camera.‚Ä¶ These films and videos > represent the voices of women who have been systematically silenced and > abused, by a mainstream media and cinema, whose interest in ideas and people > are based on commercial concerns of profit and the desire to maintain women > as spectators.

Circles was a membership organisation. \\"All women whose films Circles distribute automatically become members, which means they have the right to become involved in creating policy.\\" The selection of titles was carried out by a regular Viewing Committee, composed of an open panel with wide representation from women's groups involved in production and exhibition. Pratibha Parmar notes that, in 1987, this led to the foregrounding of films by women of colour, quoting Circles member June Givanni on the creation of the short films programme 'Black Women and Invisibility': \\"invisibility here is about the lack of recognition by the wider community, and to some extent the black community that there are black women film-makers working in Britain. The range of films and videos made by black women available in this country is growing.\\" Distribution According to the catalogue, Circles organised women-only screenings at the Four Corners 50 seater cinema in Bethnal Green, London, and also in association with other women's organisations across Britain. At these events, film/video producers were invited to talk about their work. Describing Circles' business model, Caroline Merz writes that \\"Circles [had a] commitment to returning the highest possible revenue to film- makers, many of whom are not waged for their work, and a refusal to undercut their rental prices by providing what would, in effect, be subsidised programming.\\" Legacy Many Circles titles continue to circulate in the UK via Cinenova, and Circles' content and history were prominent in the 2011 Cinenova exhibition \\"Reproductive Labour\\" at London's The Showroom gallery.

Her 1991 film Meeting Two Queens was shown at Montreal Women's Film and Video Festival and New York International Festival of Gay and Lesbian Film. She directed her first feature film Time's Up! in New York City. It premiered at the Donostia- San Sebasti√°n Film Festival in 2000 as part of Zabaltegi. Education She left home at 19 to study sound and image at the Complutense University of Madrid. In 1983 she began her career in cinema, and in 1984 completed her university degree. In 1994, she moved to New York to further her studies in screenwriting and video art at Columbia University. Meeting Two Queens (1991) Meeting Two Queens or Encuentro entre dos Reinas is Barriga's attempt at re-editing and cutting various scenes from films featuring Hollywood stars Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich in order to create a space for lesbian identity politics and identity formation. It offers an alternative viewing of these famous Hollywood stars which effectively re-envisions them as icons of the burgeoning gay and lesbian movement of the early 1990s. Meeting Two Queens engages feminist politics due to it being a fan-made film for fans of Garbo and Dietrich - stars who are significant in film history, lesbian subculture, and feminist criticism. Barriga's film also assists in validating one's sexual identity with Hollywood role models, which is both empowering and liberating for the formation of gay identity and solidarity. Mary Desjardins writes in Film Quarterly that, \\"Film scholars have placed these works within the avant- garde because their construction through appropriation and juxtaposition of fragments from a variety of films supposedly offers a commentary on the meaning process of all films.\\" The critic B. Ruby Rich in New Queer Cinema: The Director‚Äôs Cut comments that Barriga's Meeting Two Queens, \\"re-edits Dietrich and Garbo movies to construct a dream narrative: get the girls together, help them meet, let them get it on\\".(Encuentro entre dos Reinas, 1991) In The Girls in the Back Room: Looking at the Lesbian Bar, Kelly Hankin notes that Meeting Two Queens, \\"skillfully juxtaposes spare parts from a range of classical Hollywood films to depict a romance between Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich\\".

Pica8 is a vendor of open-standards-based operating systems on white box network switches delivering software-defined networking (SDN) solutions for datacenter and cloud computing environments and traditional L2/L3 solutions for large enterprise customers. The company's products include a Linux-based L2/L3 and OpenFlow-supporting network operating system, PICOS, which is shipped as standalone software that can be loaded onto a range of 1/10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet switches based on commoditized (\\"white box\\") switches purchased from original design manufacturers (ODMs). The company's approach is to combine commodity network hardware (from manufacturers like Accton, Foxconn, Quanta) with Debian Linux, L2/L3 protocol stacks, a full enterprise feature set, OpenFlow controller and Open vSwitch (OVS) to create both a more \\"democratic\\" SDN solutions with competitive price compared to conventional embedded switches as well as more flexible and scalable disaggregated enterprise white box networking solutions.  History  The company was founded in 2009. It launched a family of OpenFlow-enabled Ethernet switches in August 2009 and has been selling products ever since. In 2010, Pica8 was selling 48-port gigabit Ethernet and 10-gigabit Ethernet switches at half the price of comparable products of Force10 and Arista Networks. It achieved such result through combining open source software with merchant ASICs (from companies like Broadcom, Marvell, and Intel/Fulcrum) on switches from \\"white-box vendors\\". In July 2011, Pica8 added support for the open source \\"Indigo\\" OpenFlow stack from Big Switch Networks to its switches as an alternative stack. In November 2011 it embedded Open vSwitch (OVS), developed by Nicira, into its operation system PicOS to enable more sophisticated network management from inside the switch. In October 2012 Pica8 raised $6.6m in Series A funding from VantagePoint Capital Partners to support its sales and product development. On 10 December 2012 the company exited stealth mode with introduction of SDN reference architecture aimed at cloud providers. By 2013, among about 100 Pica8's customers, including large service providers and hosting companies, were such companies as Baidu, Yahoo! Japan and NTT Communications. In December 2013, the company launched the Pica8 SDN Starter Kit, an \\"out-of-the-box\\" kit that includes an open-source network controller, a programmable network tap, an open-source network intrusion detection system, and other components meant to give customers a complete SDN solution, which would be quick to implement. In April 2014 Pica8 claimed to be the first vendor to support the latest version 1.4 of OpenFlow and to have over 300 customers globally. By 2018, Pica8 grew to over 1,000 customers in over 40 countries, announcing a broad push into the enterprise campus and branch office markets in January.  Products  = PICOS = PICOS (formerly known as XorPlus) is a network operating system (NOS) that Pica8 has developed based on XORP, an eXtensible Open Router Platform. The operation system works on an unmodified Linux kernel and is extended with a range of network and switching services. PICOS includes a traditional Layer-2 / Layer-3 switching mode (L2/L3 Mode) and has support for OpenFlow protocol, standardized by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF), through Open vSwitch (OVS). OVS runs as a process on the Debian Linux distribution. Additionally, PICOS has a hardware abstraction layer that lets it run atop networking ASICs from various switch silicon manufacturers. Therefore, the PICOS operating system can be unaware (\\"agnostic\\") about the underlying hardware and not tied to it. = PicaPilot = In addition to PICOS, Pica8 offers a second core technology solution called PicaPilot, which was announced in May 2018. PicaPilot is an automated white box switch configuration and management application that runs on Pica8-enabled switches alongside PICOS. Designed as a replacement for legacy Ethernet switch stacks and chassis switches, PicaPilot compresses dozens of access- and aggregation-layer leaf-spine topology switches into a single layer and allows them to be managed as a single logical switch with a single consolidated IP address. =CrossFlow= On 10 November 2014 Pica8 announced CrossFlow, a new feature in the PICOS NOS that enables network managers to integrate OpenFlow applications and business policies with existing layer 2/layer 3 networks. Users can run layer 2/layer 3 protocols and OpenFlow protocols on all the switch ports in a network at the same time. OpenFlow can be used for policy-driven applications to bring business logic to the network. The traditional network can optimize packet transport and performance with protocols, such as OSPF, Spanning Tree, and BGP.

Construction of the brick building in 1825-26 was instrumental in securing Newport's status as the shire town of the county when it was established in 1827. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (as \\"Sullivan County Courthouse\\") in 1985. The building is now in commercial use. Description and history The Old Sullivan County Courthouse is located in downtown Newport, on a rise east of Main Street, behind later civic buildings and across Main Street from a cluster of later 19th-century commercial blocks. Its main block is a -story brick structure, with a gabled roof and end chimneys. It has a five-bay front facade, with the center bay taken up by an entry topped by a tower. The entry is two stories, with the main entrance framed by sidelight windows and a half-round transom window. The tower is a wood-frame structure with a blank square stage at its base, followed by an open belfry with arched openings, and topped by a cupola. A brick two-story wing extends to the northeast of the main block. The courthouse was built in 1825-26 (prior to the establishment of Sullivan County, which occurred in 1827) with funding from the town, and was instrumental in the choice of Newport as the new county's seat. The building served as a county court and town hall until 1873, when it was turned over to the town. It was used by the town as a school until 1896, when it was leased to the local Grange chapter.

Morine Krissd√≥ttir, Descents of Memory: The Life of John Cowper Powys. New York: Overlook Duckworth, 2007, p. 208 It was published by Simon and Schuster in May 1929 in New York. The British edition, published by Jonathan Cape, appeared in July 1929. This, Powys's fourth novel, was his first literary success. It is a bildungsroman in which the eponymous protagonist, a thirty-five-year-old history teacher, returns to his birthplace, where he discovers the inadequacy of his dualistic philosophy. Wolf resembles John Cowper Powys in that an elemental philosophy is at the centre of his life and, because, like Powys, he hates science and modern inventions like cars and planes, and is attracted to slender, androgynous women. Wolf Solent is the first of Powys's four Wessex novels. Powys wrote both about the same region as Thomas Hardy and was a twentieth-century successor to the great nineteenth-century novelist. The novel is set in the fictional towns of Ramsgard, Dorset, based on Sherborne, Dorset, where Powys attended school from May 1883, and Blacksod, modelled on Yeovil, Somerset, as well as other places in Dorset like Dorchester and Weymouth that were also full of memories for Powys.Krissdottir, p. 37 re school. Background Wolf Solent was Powys's first successful novel. There were six impressions of the first edition (American) between 1929 and 1930, three of the British. A German translation appeared in 1930 and French in 1931.New York: Simon and Schuster and London: Jonathan Cape. Derek Langridge, John Cowper Powys: A Record of Achievement. London: The Library Association, 1966, pp. 115-6, 121. However, Powys had to cut some 350 pages from his manuscript before Wolf Solent was published by Simon and Schuster.Krissd√≥ttir, p. 227. Following the success of Wolf Solent three of Powys's works of popular philosophy were also best- sellers: The Meaning of Culture (1929), In Defence of Sensuality (1930), A Philosophy of Solitude (1933).Derek Langridge, John Cowper Powys: A Record of Achievement, pp. 11, 115, 121, 123, 127, 131. Prior to this Powys had published three apprentice novels: Wood and Stone (1915), Rodmoor (1916), Ducdame (1925), and had also written After My Fashion in 1920, though it was not published until 1980.Richard Perceval Graves, The Powys Brothers. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 184. He had begun work on Wolf Solent in February 1925, It is \\"the first of the four Wessex novels which established John Cowper Powys's reputation\\",Herbert Williams, John Cowper Powys. Bridgend,: Seren, 1997, p. 94, an allusion not only to the place but to the influence of Thomas Hardy on him: his first novel, Wood and Stone was dedicated to Hardy.Wood and Stone: A Romance. New York: G. Arnold Shaw, 1915. In the Preface he wrote for the 1961 Macdonald edition of the novel Powys states: \\"Wolf Solent is a book of Nostalgia, written in a foreign country with the pen of a traveller and the ink-blood of his home.1964 Penguin edition, p.11. Wolf Solent is set in Ramsgard, based on Sherborne, Dorset, where Powys attended school from May 1883, as well as Blacksod, modelled on Yeovil, Somerset, and Dorchester, Dorset and Weymouth, Dorset, both in Dorset, all places full of memories for him.Krissdottir, p. 37 re school. While Powys had been born in Shirley, Derbyshire and lived there for this first seven years of his life, his father then returned to his home county of Dorset, and, after a brief stay in Weymouth, the family resided in Dorchester from May 1880 until the Christmas of 1885.Krissdottir, pp. 26, 29, 39-40. Powys's paternal grandmother lived in nearby Weymouth. For the rest of his youth Powys lived in Montacute, just over the Dorset border in Somerset. Also in the 1961 Preface Powys records the fact that he and his brother Littleton would often \\"scamper home\\" on a Sunday from school in Sherborne via Yeovil: \\"Sherborne was five miles from Montacute; and Yeovil was five miles from Montacute\\".Wolf Solent (Penguin edition, 1964), p. 11. The seaside resort of Weymouth is the main setting of his novel Weymouth Sands (1934, published as Jobber Skald in England) while Maiden Castle (1935), which alludes to Thomas Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge, is set in Dorchester (Hardy's Casterbridge). Powys had first settled in Dorchester, after returning from America in 1934. These two works, along with Wolf Solent and A Glastonbury Romance (1932) make up Powys's four main Wessex novels.The earlier Wood and Stone and Ducdame are also set in Wessex. A Further indication of the importance of familiar places in Powys's fiction is that Glastonbury is just a few miles north of Montacute. Sherborne station 2009. The novel opens with Wolf Solent travelling to Ramsgard station, based on Sherborne station, from London in 1921. Plot summary The novel begins with its eponymous, thirty-five-year-old hero on a train returning to his native Dorset to Ramsgard (Sherborne).Krissdottir, pp. 215, 216, 217. This follows the loss of his job as a history teacher in London, following an outburst in class in which ‚Äúhe found himself pouring forth a torrent of wild, indecent invective upon every aspect of modern civilization‚Äù.Wolf Solent, p. 14. This nervous collapse had been triggered by a look of ‚Äúinert despair‚Äù that he had seen on the face of a man on the steps of Waterloo station in London.Wolf Solent, p. 15. He is journeying back to his childhood hometown because he has been hired as a ‚Äúliterary assistant‚Äù by the squire of nearby King‚Äôs Barton. Wolf in ‚Äúescaping from an insensitive, brutal world and trivial world‚Äù of London, is moving to a place ‚Äúwhere he will have a greater freedom to know and be himself‚Äù.Gwyneth F. Miles, \\"The Pattern of Homecoming\\", in Essays of John Cowper Powys, ed. Belinda Humfrey. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1972, p. 221. This is also a homecoming for him, as he left Ramsgard with his mother when he was ten and it is the place where his father died. In Ramsgard he feels ‚Äúfree of his mother‚Äù with whom he has always lived and whom he left in London and ‚ÄúBound up in some strange affiliation with that skeleton [his father] in the [Ramsgard] cemetery‚Äù.Gwyneth F. Miles, p. 222. In due course Wolf discovers that his father had sunk from being a respected history teacher and had died in the Ramsgard workhouse ‚Äúin obscure circumstances after some ‚Äòdepravity‚Äô‚Äù, which involved the pornographic bookseller Malakite,Krissdottir, p. 217. Wolf also finds out that his father had had several affairs, and that Wolf has a half-sister,Krissdottir, p. 217 and that Malakite had an incestuous relationship with his elder daughter.Krissdottir, p. 217. Peter Easingwood suggests, that ‚Äú[u]nderlying ‚Äò‚ÄôWolf Solent‚Äô‚Äô is a sensuous-mystical feeling for the natural world that goes with an attempted rejection of human society‚Äù.Peter Easingwood, \\"The Face on the Waterloo Steps\\", in John Cowper Powys's Wolf Solent: Critical Studies, ed. Belinda Humfrey. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1990, p. 58. However, Wolf cannot escape human involvement. He has to work, and this involves him in a moral dilemma, because he comes to believe that Squire Urquart is ‚Äúthe embodiment of evil‚Äù and his planned book dangerously immoral.Williams, p. 94. Furthermore, he cannot escape the influence of his mother who arrives unexpectedly in Dorset. But, more seriously he cannot, through his sensuous pleasure in nature, escape from his body and in particular sex, and Wolf soon becomes involved with two women: \\"Gerda, the child of nature, whom he marries, and the more intellectual and complex Christie\\", the younger daughter of Malakite.Williams, p. 94. It therefore appears that Wolf Solent is \\"designed to show how Solent has chosen Dorset as his best retreat, only to find himself cornered\\".Easingwood, p. 58. Or, as another writer suggests: \\"The landscape and the emotional intimacies of his relationships in Dorset manage to attack [Wolf‚Äôs] inner life as no physical or personal contact in London had done\\".Miles, p. 223 Wolf Solent is a novel that focuses on the inner psychic tensions in its protagonist's life,Easingwood, p. 58. central to this is what Wolf calls his \\"mythology\\": \\"Wolf has taken refuge in a mythological world of his own invention; and at the heart of his 'mythology' there is a struggle between good and evil, seen in the black and white terms of conventional morality\\".Krissdottir, p. 216; Graves, p. 190. By the end of the novel Wolf realizes that he and his wife Gerda have little in common and \\"that he has confused love with 'a mixture of lust and romance'\\", and that he should have married Christie Malakite.Graves, p. 191. However, he had believed \\"that any closer involvement with Christie [‚Ä¶] would destroy his 'mythology\\" and his stubborn clinging to this idea ruins their relationship.Graves, p. 191. Wolf at the end faces the loss of his \\"mythology\\" and questions how human beings can \\"go on living, when their live-illusion was destroyed\\".Wolf Solent, pp. 527-8. Suicide seems a possibility, but the novel ends with Wolf having \\"a kind of vision\\" involving a field of golden buttercups, and realizing \\"that traditional morality\\" the kind his \\"mythology\\" operated under \\"is too simple\\".Graves, p.192. \\"Powys's vision is not tragic but essentially comic- grotesque\\".Easingwood, p. 60. The final words of Wolf Solent ‚Äî \\"Well, I shall have a cup of tea\\" ‚Äî have been described by Peter Easingwood as \\"notoriously bathetic\\".Easingwood, p. 59. According to Robert Timlin however, \\"Once its significance in the context of the book as a whole is understood, for Powys to end with Wolf planning to have a cup of tea can be regarded as neither an example of bathos nor an arbitrary decision but an entirely appropriate finish. A light touch, yes, but hardly without resonance.\\" Robert Timlin, ‚ÄúJimmy Plays Hopscotch: The Role of Redfern in ‚ÄòWolf Solent.‚Äô‚Äù The Powys Journal, vol. 11, 2001, pp. 165‚Äì190, p.189.

In a letter in 1925 Powys refers to the setting of Wolf Solent: \\"It won't really be Bradford Abbas nor will Yeovil be Yeovil or Sherborne Sherborne, but it will be my idea of those places\\". The River Yeo (Lunt in the novel) runs through all these places.Letter date18 February1925 in Letters of John Cowper Powys to his Brother Llewelyn, Vol.II, ed. Malcolm Elwin. London: Village press, 1975, p. 6. *Wolf Solent: A thirty- five year old history teacher, who starts a new life near his birthplace, Ramsgard (Sherborne), Dorset. He resembles John Cowper Powys and has been described as \\"Powys's mouthpiece for most of the time\\".Cavaliero, p. 44. Wolf is a follower of Powys's elemental philosophy: he hates science and modern inventions, such as cars and planes, and like Powys is attracted to slender, androgynous women.Krissdottir, p. 226, and Williams, pp. 92-4. *Ann Solent: Wolf's mother. She and Wolf have lived in London since Wolf was ten. She eventually follows Wolf to Dorset. Krisdottir suggests that her character is based on that of Powys sister Marian, who followed him to New York, became an expert in lace and started her own business there.Krissdottir, pp. 219-20. *William Solent: Wolf's father, a former history teacher in Ramsgard, he died in the town's workhouse after some scandal. His wife left him and went to live in London when Wolf was ten. *Mattie Smith: Wolf's half sister who marries Darnley Otter at the end of the novel and arranges to adopt Olwen. *Squire John Urquhart of Kings Barton who hires Wolf to help him write his Rabelasian \\"History of Dorset\\", a work that concentrates \\"on scandal and crime.\\"Rabelaisian\\" Wolf Solent, p. 46. Williams, p. 94. Kings Barton is based on the village of Bradford Abbas between Yeovil and Sherborne.Denis Lane, \\"The Elemental Image in Wolf Solent\\", in In the Spirit of Powys: New Essays, ed. Denis Lane. London and Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1990, p. 57. *Gerda Torp: The eighteen-year-old daughter of Blacksod gravedigger and tombstone maker, who is making Redfern's tombstone for Squire Urquart. Wolf is attracted by Gerda's beauty and her affinity with the natural world, symbolized by her ability to whistle like a blackbird. He seduces Gerda within a week of meeting her and then marries her. She is both \\"a kind of earth spirit\\" and \\"at the same time an ordinary country girl\\"Glen Cavaliero, John Cowper Powys: Novelist. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973, p. 46. It has been suggested that Gerda is based, in part, on Powys' wife Margaret Lyon.Krissdottir, pp. 217-8. *Christie Malakite: Younger daughter of Malakite. She has read widely and has much more in common with Wolf than Gerda. She also \\"belongs to the boy-girl type\\" that Powys himself was deeply attracted to. Morine Krissdottir in Descents of Memory suggests that she is based upon Powys's lover Phyllis Playter, whom he met in March 1921, and eventually lived with for the rest of his life.Krissdottir, pp. 170, 218. *Selena Gault: is an \\"eccentric ugly woman who is spiritual mother to Wolf\\", and who had probably been his father's lover.Lane, p. 66, but Cavaliero sees the relationship as platonic, p. 45. *Jason Otter: A poet. Cambridge scholar Glen Cavaliero suggests that \\"Wolf's interior dialogue with the man on the Waterloo steps is paralleled by his actual dialogue with Jason\\", who \\"acts as a kind of malevolent chorus\\".Cavaliero, p. 48. The novel has \\"three haunting poems by [Jason]\\", and Belinda Humfrey suggests that perhaps these are among the best poems Powys wrote.Cavaliero, p48, and \\"Introduction\\" to Essays on John Cowper Powys, ed. Belinda Humfrey. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1972, p. 24. Jason is apparently based on Powys's brother Theodore Powys the novelist and writer of short stories.Krissdottir, p, 218. *Darnley Otter: His brother. At the end of the novel he marries Mattie Smith. *Lord Carfax: A cousin and former lover of Wolf's mother. He found Wolf his job with Urquart, and at the end of the novel intervenes to help various people, including restoring Gerda's ability to whistle, which she lost during her marriage to Wolf. *James Redfern: He was Urquhart's secretary before Wolf and he drowned in Lenty Pond \\"in mysterious circumstances\\". It appears that Urquart was in love with this \\"beautiful young man\\".Krissdottir, p. 221. The local people refer to Wolf as Redfern Two, \\"and wait for him to drown in Lenty Pond\\".Krissdottir, p. 223. *Roger Monk: Urquhart's manservant. *Bob Weevil: A shop assistant, Wolf's main rival for Gerda'a affections, who cuckolds him. *Lobbie Torp: Gerda's young brother. *Malakite: A pornographic bookseller in Blacksod. At the end of the novel, dying after falling down the stairs, he tells Wolf that Christie pushed him.Krissdottir, p. 221. *Olwen: She is the child of an incestuous union between Malakite and his elder daughter. *Stalbridge: A waiter who Wolf \\"has identified as the incarnation of that suffering face\\" on the steps of Waterloo Station. He is one of those Lord Carfax helps at the end of Wolf Solent.Krissdottir, p. 226. *T. E. Valley: A clergyman and one of several homosexual characters in the novel.Cavaliero, p. 48. =The face on the Waterloo steps= Waterloo station's main entrance, where Wolf Solent had seen the look of \\"inert despair\\" on a man's face. The arch was a memorial to the dead of World War I.Krissdottir, p. 215. An important recurring image in the novel is that of the face on the steps of Waterloo Station in London, which precipitates Wolf's emotion collapse in front of his history class, and loss of his job. The face of \\"a man regarded by Wolf as an epitome of the kind of suffering which challenges belief in a benevolent creator\\".Glen Cavaliero, p. 48. In a letter to his brother Llewelyn, written from Chicago on 18 February 1925, in which Powys mentions working on Wolf Solent, he refers to a beggar that he had seen with \\"a 'shocking' face\\".\\"Letters of John Cowper Powys to his Brother Llwelyn\\", Vol.II, pp. 5-6. Professor Peter Easingwood suggests that from this encounter came the idea for the face which forms such a \\"dominant pattern of symbolic imagery\\" in the novel.Easingwood, p. 55. This face \\"of inert despair\\" is seen by Wolf as linked to \\"the appalling misery of so many of his fellow Londoners\\".Wolf Solent, p. 15. Morine Krissdottir in her biography of Powys, Descents of Memory, dates the action of the novel as taking place between March 1921 and May 1922, just three years after the end of World War I and notes that a \\"triumphal Victory Arch\\" was formally opened as the main entrance to Waterloo Station in London on 21 March 1922, to be a memorial to the dead. She also records that \\"in an ironic twist, the steps [of the Victory Arch] soon became a place where beggars, many of them mentally and physically crippled ex-sevicemen gathered\\".Krissd√≥ttir, p. 215. Furthermore, she also suggests that while there is no direct reference to the war in Wolf Solent \\"the metaphors and imagery\\" do in fact allude to it, and that \\"[t]he novel is in fact about a world after the great war--a world in which everything is irrevocably changed\\".Krissdottir, pp. 215-6. Critical reception In his review of the British first edition, in The Spectator, 10 August 1929, writer and critic V. S. Pritchett wrote: Wolf Solent is a stupendous and rather glorious book [‚Ä¶] The book is as beautiful and strange as an electric storm, and like the thunder on the Sinai, it is somewhat of a sermon.\\" More recently, also in The Spectator, A. N. Wilson wrote: \\"The Wessex novels of John Cowper Powys ‚Äî Wolf Solent (1929), A Glastonbury Romance (1933), Jobber Skald (also published as Weymouth Sands, 1935) and Maiden Castle (1937) ‚Äî must rank as four of the greatest ever to be written in our language.\\"\\"The strange experience of England\\", A.

History The ATUC was founded in 1956 during serious labour unrest in the area. Its organ was Al-'Amal (1957). The Secretary General of the trade union was Abdullah Asnag, a pro- independence Arab nationalist and admirer of Nasser who also advocated union with Yemen. Supported by the UAR the ATUC rose in importance when the political disturbances and the violence reached a head and political parties ceased to function. By 1959 it was the only entity representing nationalist aspirations in Aden and it used its leverage to boycott elections as the main grouping of the People's Union. In November 1960 the ATUC boycotted the Aden municipal elections.Yitzhak Oron, Ed., Middle East Record Volume 1, 1960, pg. 385 When Aden Colony became part of the Federation of South Arabia as the State of Aden the unrest continued. In the federation the ATUC had a large influence in the new assembly and to prevent it seizing control of the federation in 1962 the former Colony of Aden had joined the Federation of South Arabia so that Aden's pro-British assembly members could counter the ATUC's influence.Kitchen, Martin (1994). Empire and after: a short history of the British Empire and Commonwealth (1994 ed.) Centre for Distance Education, Simon Fraser University. p. 126-27 On 30 November 1967 the State of Aden became part of the independent People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, also known as South Yemen, and the ATUC became the main trade union of that state. When South Yemen united with the Yemen Arab Republic, also known as North Yemen, on 22 May 1990, the Aden Trade Union Congress merged with the General Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions in order to form the Yemeni Confederation of Labor Unions.

Chheoki is at a distance of 10 km from Allahabad junction on the Howrah‚ÄìDelhi main line. Trains that bypass Allahabad Junction and which come from Jabalpur and go towards Mughalsarai usually stop at Chheoki.To reduce the load on the main junction, trains were shifted to Chheoki. Chheoki has three platforms that are high- level platforms and one UTS. Some popular trains that stop at Chheoki are Bhagmati Express, Khwaja Garib Nawaz Madar-Kolkata Express, Bhagalpur-Khwaja Garib Nawaz Madar Express, Chambal Express, Mahanagari express, Shipra Express, Sanghamithra Superfast Express Tapti Ganga Express, Howrah Mumbai Mail and Sanghamitra Superfast Express, Patliputra - Pune Superfast Express, Bhagalpur Antyodaya Express, Humsafar Express, and Mahamana Express. The station was constructed to decongest Allahabad junction and provide a separate route for trains to Southern India and Jabalpur which originate from eastern India and Mughalsarai. A delay of more than 30 minutes for an engine change at Allahabad is thus avoided. This allows trains on the New Delhi-Howrah route to run punctually since scarce platform space at Allahabad junction is freed up. The station is a B-class station and part of North Central Railways under the Allahabad railway division. Trains plying between Manikpur-Jabalpur-Itarsi, Manikpur-Jhansi-Gwalior, Manikpur-Katni-Bhopal-Indore and Manikpur-Nagpur- Gondia-Secunderabad-Yesvantpur transit through Cheoki. The station currently lacks facilities like porters, however efforts are being made to convert the station to a satellite hub with better passenger amenities since several trains to southern India transit through this station.

It is one of the first poetic examples of Icelanders regarding their medieval past as a golden age. Origin The poem was almost certainly composed in 1663, inspired by the Icelanders officially accepting the King of Denmark as their absolute monarch in 1662.Margr√©t Eggertsd√≥ttir, 'From Reformation to Enlightenment', trans. by Joe Allard, in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, Histories of Scandinavian Literature, 5 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2006), pp. 174-250 (at p. 211). Form The poem is hexametrical, written in leonine metre. It is the first example of the adaptation of this metre to Icelandic poetry, showing the influence of early modern humanism in Iceland. However, it also draws on the language of medieval Icelandic skaldic verse. Thus the poem combines Classical and indigenous traditions in a striking way. Content The poem is a polemic which compares the Iceland of Hallgr√≠mur's own time with the Icelandic commonwealth (c. 930-1262, before Iceland came under foreign rule). :: In those days people were valiant, appreciated their freedom more than gold, and did not subit to oppression by threat. Here, Iceland's medieval past is for the first time glamorized in Icelandic poetry. The poet criticizes his own era for laziness, lack of solidarity, cowardice, and an unjust legal system.

S. Ayres and Company, a regional department store chain whose flagship store and headquarters were located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The L. S. Ayres and Company name remained in use for 132 years. Early life Ayres was born on September 4, 1824, on a farm near Oswego, New York. He was one of six children born to Thomas Floyd and Marian Jones Ayres. (Thomas and his second wife had one child.) Lyman disliked farming and left home as a teenager to work as a peddler. He spent four to five years in Ashtabula, Lake, and Geauga counties in Ohio, and established a general store in Chardon, Ohio, with a business partner named John Murray.Turchi, p. 6. Ayres met his first wife in Chardon, Ohio, but she died of consumption (tuberculosis) within a few months of their marriage. In 1862 Ayres married Maria Helen Murray, his business partner's sister. Ayres and his wife had three children: Frederick, Katherine, and Robert (died in infancy). The couple adopted Emma Murray, their niece, as an infant. She became known as Emma Murray Ayres.Turchi, pp. 6‚Äì7. L. S. Ayres and Company Ayres sold his interest in the general store at Chardon in 1864 and moved to Geneva, New York, where he and his New York business partner, James G. Thomas, managed a dry goods business named Ayres and Thomas. In 1872 Ayres sold his interest in the firm and purchased controlling interest in the Trade Palace, an established dry goods store operated by N. R. Smith at 26‚Äì28 W. Washington Street in Indianapolis, Indiana.Turchi, p. 7. The store was renamed N. R. Smith and Ayres. James Thomas, Ayres's business partner in New York, acquired a 25 percent interest in the Indianapolis store.Turchi, pp. 7, 8, and 10. Ayres remained in New York for two years as the Indianapolis store's senior partner and its resident buyer. He took over active management of the Indianapolis store in 1874, when the store's name first appeared as L. S. Ayres and Company. Ayres and his family relocated to Indianapolis in 1875. The family lived at 656 N. Delaware Street and later moved to 1204 N. Delaware Street. Their second home was demolished in 1962 as part of the city's urban renewal efforts and highway construction projects. In 1875, the Ayres department store was moved across the street to a larger three-story building at 33‚Äì37 W. Washington Street. Ayres became the sole proprietor of L. S. Ayres and Company in 1895, when Thomas retired from the business. Ayres was known for his generosity and friendliness to employees and customers. Under his management from 1874 to 1896, the store expanded its operations and the staff increased to 175 employees. Death and legacy Ayres died of chronic nephritis on May 7, 1896, in Indianapolis. The value of his estate at the time of his death was estimated at $600,000 to $700,000. He is buried at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.Turchi, p. 10. Before his death Ayres had begun to acquire property at the intersection of Washington and Meridian streets, where he intended to build a new store. Frederic M. Ayres took over the business following his father's death and completed construction of an eight-story building that opened in 1905.Turchi, p. 13. The Ayres family retained ownership of the department store after Frederic's death in 1940. Several family members served the business in executive positions. Theodore B. Griffith succeeded Frederic Ayres, his father-in law, as head of the company. Lyman S. Ayres II, Fredric's son and grandson of the store's founder, followed Griffith as president and later became chairman of the board. L. S. Ayres and Company was acquired by Associated Dry Goods in 1972. Lyman S. Ayres II retired the following year and the company was dissolved. Associated Dry Goods was acquired by The May Company in 1986, which merged with Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.) in 2005. Notes References  External links * L. S.

Design The aircraft was a shoulder-wing monoplane powered by a 52 kW (70 hp) Gnome Gamma 7-cylinder rotary engine driving a two-bladed propeller. The pilot and passenger were seated in side-by-side configuration: the control column was centrally mounted and there were two sets of rudder pedals, so that it could be flown from either seat. The shallow section rectangular fuselage tapered to a horizontal knife-edge at the tail, with the elongated triangular horizontal stabiliser mounted in the middle, its covering blending into that of the upper and lower fuselage surface. A semi-elliptical elevator was mounted on the trailing edge, and a triangular balanced rudder was mounted above the rear fuselage. Lateral control was effected by wing- warping, the wires leading to a single inverted V-strut cabane above the fuselage and a similar V strut beneath. Petrol was stored in three tanks: a pair of gravity tanks were located under the top decking in front of the cockpit, pressure-fed from a larger tank under the seats. The undercarriage was a variant of the well-proved pattern used on the Bl√©riot XI, with the wheels mounted on a trailing arm free to slide up and down and sprung by bungee cords.

His experience with the virus was mild and included symptoms of mild aching in muscles and joints, moderate headache, slight photophobia. The Bhanja virus is a member of the Bhanja virus serocomplex and is a member of the Bunyavirales order. Transmission The Bhanja virus is transmitted from ticks and has furthermore mainly been isolated from the ticks of the genera Dermacentor and Haemaphysalis, although it can be transmitted by any Ixodidae ticks. Bhanja virus is not known to be transmitted between humans. Hosts The Bhanja virus has been found in vertebrate animals, most commonly in sheep, goats, cattle, African hedgehogs (Atelerix albiventris), and African ground squirrels (Xerus erythropus). It has been known to be pathogenic in small animals and children and can also affect adult humans.Mehlhorn, Heinz, ed. Arthropods as Vectors of Emerging Disease. N.p.: Springer, n.d. (Viral Disease Link). Heinrich Hein University. Web. 24 July 2014. Symptoms The Bhanja virus produces febrile illness in humans with symptoms including photophobia, vomiting, meningoencephalitis, and slight or partial paralysis. Treatment Treatment is dependent upon the severity of the symptoms. Due to viral infections not responding to antibiotics, treatment is mainly to reduce the signs and symptoms; for which acetaminophen is suggested. Prevention Prevention is that of any tick bite, avoid excessive foliage and bushy areas. If you do come in contact with these areas, wear long sleeves and pants to cover as much skin as possible. Be specifically careful in areas used to graze or feed goats or sheep.\\"N. Bhanja Virus.\\" Regional Disease Vector Ecology Profile: Central Europe. Washington, D.C.: DIANE, 2001. N. pag. Web.

It begins at State Route 97 in Friendship on the Atlantic coast and runs for north to Palmyra, where it ends at State Route 11 and State Route 100. SR 220 runs through a series of small towns, with connecting routes leading to larger population centers such as Augusta, Waterville, and Bangor to the east and west.  Route description  SR 220 begins in Friendship at SR 97 (Shipyard Road) and Harbor Road, near the southern tip of the mainland at Friendship Harbor. This intersection is also the southern terminus of SR 97. SR 220 proceeds north along the western coast until reaching the town of Waldoboro in Lincoln County, where it enters the town center before turning northeast and crossing US 1. Continuing north, SR 220 enters the town of Washington (re- entering Knox County) and intersects with SR 126 and SR 17 before reaching the center of town. In downtown Washington, SR 105 joins SR 220 and the two routes head north out of town. The highways cross into the town of Liberty in Waldo County, where SR 105 splits off to the southeast after a concurrency. SR 220 continues northeast until meeting SR 173 near Saint George Lake, then turns northwest to cross SR 3 at Clark's Corner. The highway continues north through the town of Montville, crosses SR 137 in western Knox, and intersects with SR 139 in western Thorndike. SR 139 and SR 220 are cosigned for into the town of Unity, where SR 139 splits off just east of the town center. SR 220 intersects with US 202 / SR 9 at Unity Pond and turns north onto Bangor Road forming a three-route concurrency for .

SR 220 continues northwest, crosses into the town of Palmyra and immediately terminates at SR 11 / SR 100 (Hurd's Corner).  History  As originally designated in 1929, SR 220 ran from US 1 in Warren southwest to Friendship, then turned north and followed its modern routing as far as SR 139 in Thorndike. In the 1930s, the route was extended to SR 9 in Unity, then again through Troy and Detroit to its modern terminus at Hurd's Corner in Palmyra, to a total length of . The southernmost portion of the route between Warren and Waldoboro formed a \\"V\\" shape, and was potentially confusing in that a motorist traveling north on SR 220 from Warren to Friendship was actually driving southwest, and vice versa. This was remedied in 1949 when SR 220 was truncated to Friendship at the southern tip of the \\"V,\\" cutting from its length. The eastern leg of the \\"V\\" was redesignated as SR 97 and directional banners changed to reflect the actual direction of travel. The alignment of SR 220 has not changed since.

He moved to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in 1926, where became a self-taught commercial artist. He was soon recognized locally and then nationally. He was active in several artistic organizations. He is known for his meticulous watercolors of natural woodlands depicting the cycle of decay and regeneration. Early years Ernst Friedrich Lindner was born on 1 May 1897 in Vienna, Austria. He was the thirteenth child of a German family. His father Karl Oswald Lindner (1844-1919) ran a business that made stylish canes and parasol handles, and employed almost 300 craftsmen. Ernst caught diphtheria as a child of seven, and drew and painted during his long convalescence. During World War I (1914‚Äì1918) Lindner volunteered in 1915 to join a mountaineer regiment of the Austrian army. He was wounded, but recovered and was back in service before the end of the war. After the war he worked as a bank clerk in Innsbruck, Austria. He also helped in the family firm and engaged in a mineral water and sugar confectionery company with his brother Paul that failed. 1921 he married Hertha Liebenberger. Onen year later, their only son Herbert (1922-1995) was born. In order to collect money for his trip to Canada, he obtained expensive cameras per delivery note and cashed them in a pawn shop. His siblings had to buy the cameras back and return them to the camera shop. From the train window of a train departing to London, he informed his wife Hertha that he would not return. He boarded onto the ship \\"Melitta\\" from Antwerp to Canada where he arrived with only 5 $ in his pockets. Artistic career Technical Collegiate Staff 1938‚Äì39 ‚Äì Lindner to the center right In 1926 Lindner immigrated to Canada and settled in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. At first Lindner found work as a farm laborer. He attended night classes at the University of Saskatchewan under Augustus Kenderdine. He became a freelance commercial artist and illustrator, largely self-taught. He had become recognized as an artist in Saskatchewan by 1931, and by 1933 was starting to exhibit in eastern Canada. Lindner started to teach at the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate in 1931, first giving a night course and then becoming a full-time instructor. He headed the Art Department at the Collegiate from 1936 until 1962. Lindner was very active in the arts community. He started a weekly discussion group called \\"Saturday Nights\\" that met in the private homes of local artists, often in his own home. He was a member of the Prospectors, the first society of professional artists in the province. He became president of the Saskatoon Art Association. When the Federation of Canadian Artists was formed in 1941 Lindner was made responsible for the Saskatchewan region. He was one of the first members of the Saskatchewan Arts Board. It was through the influence of Lindner and Kenderdine that the University of Saskatchewan began to run its annual Emma Lake Artist's Workshops. Lindner participated in these workshops in 1955‚Äì57, 1960‚Äì64 and 1966. Some of the prominent Modernist painters of New York were guests at the Emma Lake Workshops in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and influenced Lindner's style. The formalist Jules Olitski, known for his color- field abstractions, was a significant influence. In 1959 Lindner returned to Vienna and attended the Akademie der Angewandten Kunst, where he took a master's course in etching and stone lithography. In 1962 Lindner left the Technical Collegiate and devoted himself to art for the remainder of his life. Ernest Lindner died in Saskatoon on 4 November 1988, aged 91. The Ernest Lindner Park is the Erindale suburb of Saskatoon in named in his honor. Work William Perehudoff, Eva Mendel Miller and Lindner in Langham, Sask, January 1947 Lindner is known for his many watercolors inspired by the natural beauty of the wooded country around his summer home at Emma Lake. He also made etchings, lithographs, linocuts and wood block prints. Lindner has been called a Late Modernist and also a Magic Realist. Lindner depicted the forest floor from close quarters, with highly textured patterns of surface detail from the fallen branches, tree stumps, moss and lichen. His work reveals a fascination with the natural cycle of decay and regeneration. His watercolors of the tangled forest interior were sharply focused, highly keyed and executed with great skill. In his later work human and plant forms often overlap and blend into each other. Clement Greenberg conducted an Emma Lake Artists' Workshop in 1962 in which Lindner participated. Greenberg wrote in an introduction to an exhibition of Linder's work in Regina in 1962‚Äì63, Lindner's work was widely exhibited in Canada and was also shown at the Canada House Gallery in London, England, and the Canadian Cultural centers in Paris and Brussels. His work is held in many important public or private collections. Examples are held in the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Glenbow Museum in Calgary and the Winnipeg Art Gallery. The University of Saskatchewan gave him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1972. He was elected a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1977. In 1979 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Studio Ernest Ernest and Bodil Lindner at their cottage on Fairy Isle (August 1943) Lindner visited Emma Lake in the summer of 1935 and stayed at Murray point, the site of the University art school camp and later the location of the Emma Lake Artists‚Äô Workshops. Just across the lake Lindner and his wife Bodil found a densely wooded uninhabited island that they called Fairy Island. Lindner built a studio and summer cottage on the northeast shore of the island on what is now called Lindner Point. The studio was a spruce log cabin. A large corner window facing northwest gave natural light. Lindner often sat there to paint views of the landscape. Lindner sold the property to the University of Saskatchewan in 1961. It has since been used as a base of researchers into the local botany, zoology and limnology. From April 2007 the studio, surrounded by a mixed wood forest, has been recognized as a Provincial Heritage Property.  Personal life  His first marriage in Austria with Hertha Liebenberger lasted from 1921 to 1936. Neither she nor their son Herbert (1922-1995) wanted to come to Canada on Lindners several invitations. 1937 he married his student Bodil Brostrom von Degen (born 1911 in Denmark) and had a daughter Degen, born in 1943. They divorced in 1952. During his stay in Vienna 1959 he was accompanied by his daughter Degen. He was not interested in his two grandsons Michael and Andreas (from his son Herbert) and declined their wish to visit him in Saskatoon in the 1970s. From his daughter Degen he has two grandchildren.

Some accounts state the specific construction date as 1770 and others as 1776. When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War ended in 1898, United States took control of the island. From that time until the 1930s, the Polvor√≠n de Miraflores was used as a quarantine station under the administration of the United States Public Health Service. Ship passengers and immigrants were inspected here and, if necessary, were isolated from the population. Since the 1940s, the building was repurposed as a chapel for the Isla Grande Naval Base. As a result, some changes were made to the structure, like the replacement of the chimney with a bell tower. The structure was then renamed Santa B√°rbara Chapel. When the Naval Base closed in 1971, the structure was handed to the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. During this time, it was used as the setting for the San Juan Ballets and the San Juan Choir. Since 1984, it became part of the National Register of Historic Places. Eventually, the building was taken by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works and the property was used for the storage of vehicles. With time, the property became abandoned and deteriorated. Recently, the structure was handed to the Convention Center District which prompted the removal of the abandoned vehicles from the property.

The book was written by Brenda Krekeler and published by Daring Books in 1989. Covered Bridges Today is a frequently cited source on the topic of covered bridges and serves as a record of numerous covered bridges that have since been dismantled or demolished since the book's publication. Krekeler's text includes 412 covered bridges in fourteen states with a complete record of all 142 covered bridges in Ohio during its writing in 1986 and 1987. The work has been utilized in numerous citations by later publications including Historic American Engineering Record surveys and New England's Covered Bridges: A Complete Guide, Indiana Covered Bridges and Covered Bridges in Virginia.  Background  Covered bridges are timber-truss bridges with a roof and siding which, in most covered bridges, create an almost complete enclosure. The purpose of the covering is to keep snow from accumulatingwinter snow accumulation could easily collapse a bridge, and the steep roof would tend to shed snow to either side. As of 2014, the United States has more than 800 extant covered bridges with more than 10,000 lost and historical bridges recorded by the National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges. Krekeler became interested in studying covered bridges, their lore and their history, while in college. Krekeler obtained her master's degree in Historical Geography from the University of Cincinnati.  Contents  Covered Bridges Today provides information on 412 bridges in the states of Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. The book is geographically focused on Krekeler's home state of Ohio and includes all 142 remaining covered bridges in the state at the time of writing. However, the book is not a complete inventory of each state's extant bridges. When it was written, 76 of an estimated 228 Pennsylvania's bridges were included, 68 of Indiana's 98 covered bridges, and 43 of Vermont's estimated 100 bridges were also featured. Krekeler's use of estimations stems from the facts that covered bridges are lost periodically and that the bridges detailed include those restored or in immediate danger of collapse. Within a year of the publication of the book, 30 bridges were lost. Known bridges in states that are not in the listing are not named or cited. For example, West Virginia had 17 remaining bridges at time of publication, but the book only covers 10 of them. The book includes detailed information on each state's historic bridges before providing an individual listing of surveyed bridges. Each entry includes a description of the bridge, its history, a black and white photograph, and a local street map with directions. Interspersed throughout the book is a collection of color photographs ranging from a full page to a quarter page in size. Krekeler states that construction dates prior to 1850 are often questionable because of an absence of records and that these early sources would often contradict one another. Krekeler's bibliography cites an extensive collection of state maps, numerous local newspaper sources and works like World Guide to Covered Bridges by Richard Donovan. The information and sources used are cited at the end of each entry listing in the book, directly following the directions to the bridge. The book does not contain a typical index and instead favors a listing of bridges after the introduction of the state. The book was published in 1989 by Daring Books.  Impact  Larry Hart's review of the work focused on Krekeler's basic explanation of the various types of covered bridges from the early 1800s to the 1920s and the historical facts and trivia contained within about the distribution and surviving covered bridges. Hart recounts the claim that it is the \\"only complete pictorial study of covered bridges in the United States\\". Though Hart's review incorporates much of the book's text, Hart shares an affinity for covered bridges and relates to the destroyed Batchellerville Bridge. Krekeler writes that she wished the Batchellerville Bridge had been preserved instead of being torched. Dr. Roger A. McCain notes that Krekeler's book \\"includes a number of states with pictorial coverage, including some really exquisite color photographs. It is not comprehensive in most cases[,] but is especially strong for Ohio and Indiana. Pennsylvania bridges are pretty extensively documented in[.]\\" Paul Grondahl refers to the book as an \\"encyclopedic, definitive work\\" in an article in the Times Union. Historic American Engineering Record surveys have cited Krekeler's work numerous times, ranging from the estimations of the surviving truss types of covered bridges to more general and unspecific references. Covered Bridges Today has been cited by later books on the subject of covered bridges including New England's Covered Bridges: A Complete Guide, Indiana Covered Bridges and Covered Bridges in Virginia.

The orphanage continued to serve the community providing both orphan care and facilities for senior activities until its closing in 1968. Continuing legacy Soon after the orphanage closed, in order to meet new and changing needs of the neighborhood, the Ella Austin Community Center was opened November 1, 1968, at the same location on Burnet Street. Although now in a different location, today the community center continues to honor the legacy of Ella Austin and her orphanage by serving San Antonio. In recent years Ella Austin Community Center has been the site of numerous activities and programs that offer resources to the surrounding neighborhood and the entire city.

Similarly, Justin Jacobs of Relix magazine stated ‚ÄúRoadkill Ghost Choir hit the sweet spot between Mumford & Sons‚Äô power-folk and My Morning Jacket‚Äôs passionate post-Southern rock.‚Äù  Touring  The band toured with Band of Horses performing opening slots in 2013, and were featured at Austin City Limits, New York's Governors Ball and Shaky Knees. 2014 saw festival inclusions at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Electric Forest and SXSW, among others.

It was the film debut of both Lois Weaver and Peggy Shaw. It was controversial when first released. Plot Catalina de Erauso. Portrait attributed to Juan van der Hamen. The film focuses on the relationship between filmmaker Jo (Lois Weaver) and her girlfriend, lawyer Agatha (Sheila Dabney). While tidying the books and papers in Jo's flat, Agatha finds suggestive photos of Jo and her former (male) lovers. She also finds a diary, with more photos and pages about men that Jo has known in the past. Agatha becomes suspicious that Jo is seeing a man as well as her, and even appears to follow her. The film is ambiguous about whether Agatha is imagining events, or whether there really are things going on that she must be seeing. Despite the strains of an arduous filming schedule for Jo's low-budget film, they are happily reconciled by the end, although the issue of whether Agatha was imagining things is apparently left unresolved. Jo's film-within-a-film involves the life of Catalina de Erauso (c. 1592‚Äì1650), a semi-legendary personality from 17th century Spain. Catalina was given a special dispensation by Pope Urban VII to live, work and dress as a man. The Catalina story to some extent mirrors the butch-femme aspect of Jo and Agatha's relationship. Cast * Lois Weaver as Jo * Sheila Dabney as Agatha * Kyle deCamp as Catalina * John Erdman as Eric * Ed Bowes as Richard * Peggy Shaw as Jewelry Saleswoman Critical reception The film has elicited a wide range or responses, from delight to revulsion and outrage. Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, notes that \\"sexual jealousy is the main force at work ... but you'd never know it from the film's amiable, even dispassionate mood\\", and called it \\"a modest, agreeable and doubtless very personal film\\". Teresa de Lauretis considers the film to be about \\"lesbian sexuality and its relations to fantasy\\". De Lauretis also notes the ambiguity inherent in the title: is she imagining things, or is it that she must be seeing things - are there things that she ought to be seeing? Alison Darren's Lesbian Film Guide notes that it was a \\"deeply controversial film on release ... upset a wide section of the lesbian community by being a lesbian film largely concerned with heterosexuality ... dismissed outright by some as pornography\\".

It is from Europe, mainly Spain and Portugal. It has blue-purple (or deep purple) flowers with a yellow beard. Description It flowers in June.Lynch, Richard It normally has only one flower per stem.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) The flower is blue-purple (or deep purple), with a yellow or orange beard. It grows between 30 and 40 cm tall. The leaves appear in spring. It is the only bearded iris in the 'Xiphion' section.  Taxonomy It is also known as the 'yellowbeard iris'. Named after Edmond Boissier (a Swiss botanist 1810-1885). In 1877, Mr A.W. Tait (from Porto, Portugal) sent the bulbs to Sir Michael Foster who grew them in the UK. It was first described in 1885 by Portuguese botanist Julio Augusto Henriques in Boletim da Sociedade Broteriana Vols. 1-28. It was also described by Mr Foster in 'The Gardeners' Chronicles' of 1887, vol. ii. page38. It was then described in Curtis's Botanical Magazine 7097 in 1890 again by Mr Foster. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003 and then updated on 2 December 2004. Distribution and habitat Iris boissieri is native to Europe. =Range= It was originally found in the Serra do Ger√™s (a mountain range in Portugal), Northwest Spain, within (Galicia). =Habitat= It likes to grows in rocky shallow soils, at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation It was on the 1997 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants.Kerry Scott Walter, Harriet J. Gillett (Editors) It was listed on the European Red List of Vascular Plants in 2011 as Data Deficient (DD). Very few plants (less than a 1000) were found in Spain in 2004 and less than a 10,000 plants were found in Portugal. Also these numbers were gradually going down as well. Iris boissieri was listed on Annex IV of the Habitats Directive (of the European Union). It was therefore assessed as 'Critically Endangered'. Cultivation It is best grown in a bulb frame. There is a specimen in the Kew herbarium, collected by Winkler in 1876. There is also a specimen in the 'Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques' in Gen√®ve, collected in 1899. =Hybrids and cultivars= Emily Jean Stevens (1900‚Äì1967) was a hybridiser of Iris boissieri and Iris juncea in the 1950s.
