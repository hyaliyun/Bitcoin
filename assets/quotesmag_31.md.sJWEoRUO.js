It began operations in 1977 under the name Catskill Center for Photography. The center offers various programs from exhibitions and workshops to artist residencies and access to professional workspace.  History  The Center for Photography at Woodstock, originally called the Catskill Center for Photography, was founded in 1977 as a non-for-profit organization to provide support to artists working in the photographic arts. Howard Greenberg and Michael Feinberg, the original founders, created the photo center due to the lack of support for photographers in the area. Since the start of CPW, the center has offered workshops, exhibitions, and a black and white darkroom. Today, CPW offers direct support to artists through a variety of programs, such as artist residencies, fellowships, workshops, exhibitions, and state-of-the-art digital and darkroom facilities. Through these various programs and a rapidly changing art world, CPW constantly raises awareness as well as challenges and questions the current movement of contemporary photography. CPW inhabits its own permanent print collection and a library containing over 1,500 artist books.  Exhibitions  = Program history = Since 1977 CPW has presented over 500 exhibitions. CPW currently presents 6 - 8 exhibitions annually including curated group and solo exhibitions and the annual Photography Now juried show. The exhibitions are free and open to the public, reaching out to anyone in the community who has a passion and interest in the photographic arts. There are several ways for artists to get their work exhibited. There are general submission reviews, portfolio reviews, and an annual juried show, Photography Now. CPW participates in NYC portfolio reviews as well as in the national SPE conference. Members have access to a free portfolio review with CPW's staff.

She is a supporter of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.

In her academic work, she compared victim blaming in rape cases to public attitudes about Palestinians.'Public' Information: Open-records requests involving a SUNY Plattsburgh professor who backs the Israel boycott follow pattern of challenges to faculty members with controversial views on a range of issues.

Interview with Aviva Stahl. The Establishment. Apr 13, 2016 ‚ÄúThis is the assumption that Palestinians basically bring the violence on themselves. It‚Äôs similar to telling the survivor that it‚Äôs what she was wearing, that she gave mixed messages,‚Äù Sharoni said. ‚ÄúFor example, ‚ÄòThey didn‚Äôt agree to the partition, they‚Äôve rejected attempts to make peace, they elected for Hamas ‚Ä¶‚Äô There‚Äôs no responsibility and no accountability for the perpetrator of violence, even though that perpetrator is breaking international law.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn addition to blaming the victim, Palestinians are not believed, which is the same with survivors. ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre exaggerating, it‚Äôs not that bad, because Israel is a democracy.‚Äô It‚Äôs actually very similar to saying, ‚ÄòNo, he‚Äôs actually a nice guy,‚Äô about a man accused of rape.‚Äù  Works  Sharoni has written two books: Gender and The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: The Politics of Women's Resistance. New York: Syracuse University Press, 1995. and La Logica Della Pace (The Logic of Peace). Torino, Italy: Edizioni Gruppo Abele, 1997 (in Italian). Sharoni is also co-editor (with Julia Welland, Linda Steiner, and Jennifer Pedersen) of ' 'The Handbook on Gender and War' '. London: Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc, 2016. Sharoni has also written many journal articles book chapters, and other publications, presenting the results of her research. These have been widely discussed by other sociologists, historians, political analysts and feminist writers. Lingerie joke incident On April 5, 2018, while attending the annual conference of the International Studies Association (ISA), Professor Richard Ned Lebow, a Professor at King's College London, and Professor Simona Sharoni were on a crowded elevator when someone in the elevator offered to press their floor buttons; in response, Lebow jokingly answered, ‚Äúladies‚Äô lingerie.‚Äù Following that, Sharoni filed a complaint against him, arguing that his use of sexual innuendo in a public space at an academic conference was a violation of ISA's Code of Conduct. An ISA committee found him in violation of its Code of Conduct and asked him to apologize to Sharoni. Following the complaint Lebow sent an e-mail to Sharoni explaining the context of his remark. In his e-mail he explained that in large department stores in the 1940s and 1950s there were lift operators that would request which department the customers wanted and it had become a standard gag line to reply \\"ladies' lingerie\\" when someone asked which floor you wanted. Lebow indicated that he will not apologize. Initial media coverage reported Sharoni's action as an example of political correctness. Columnist Ruth Marcus of The Washington Post sided with Lebow. \\"Let‚Äôs maintain some sense of proportion and civility,\\" she said. Not every offensive comment was intended that way, and Sharoni should have checked with Lebow before bringing a disciplinary procedure, said Marcus. Marcus also quoted an email from Sharoni saying that ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù was nothing more than a ‚Äúblanket excuse by those who refuse to rethink and change their racist, sexist and homophobic beliefs and practices. From inappropriate jokes in public spaces to unwanted sexual advances and assault, men in positions of power are outraged when they are being held accountable, even if the sanction is as minor as a request for an apology.‚Äù Of more than 2,300 comments on Marcus's story about the incident, the vast majority condemned Sharoni The incident went public. Sharoni said that in response, she had received hate mail, and that this was an example of ‚Äúthe impact on women and other marginalized groups‚Äù who witness abuse, and would discourage them from speaking up, even if they follow written policy and even if they are right. Lebow said that Sharoni and ISA should have tried to resolve the matter informally, since ‚Äúinternational relations scholars know that dialogue is the first step in addressing conflict and coercion the last. Yet, ISA went right to coercion at the outset.‚Äù  References   External links  *Plattsburgh *Progressive Voices *School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli sociologists Category:University of Haifa alumni Category:George Mason University alumni Category:State University of New York at Plattsburgh faculty Category:Merrimack College faculty Category:Romanian emigrants to Israel ","title":"Simona Sharoni"},{"id":"43648684","text":"The is a pilgrimage circuit that is composed of the following three independent pilgrimage circuits:http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/graphicversion/dbase/reikenki/index.html Êó•Êú¨ÁôæË¶≥Èü≥, International Research Center for Japanese Studies * , in the Kansai region. * , in the Kant≈ç region. * , in Chichibu, Saitama.

The spur diverged off of the Main Line south of Pleasant Plains.  Description  The Mount Loretto Spur diverged off of the Main Line south of Pleasant Plains. The branch was a little over a mile long and had a 2% grade. The right-of-way from the Amboy Road grade crossing to Mount Loretto was owned by the Archdiocese of New York, and was not open to the public. Mount Loretto paid for any necessary track maintenance, which was provided by the SIRT. The stop was called the Mission station and was located near Cunningham Road.  History  The spur was built in 1891 to serve the Mount Loretto Children's Home, and was used to transport excursionists and to provide freight. The line was originally built to bring construction materials for large buildings at Mount Loretto and its powerhouse in the 1890s. Every third Sunday, the SIRT operated a special train from St. George to Mount Loretto for relatives and visitors. The Archdiocese paid for the trips. This direct service ended in 1939 and chartered buses were used afterwards. The trains consisted of three steel cars and a steam locomotive as the line was never electrified. = Abandonment = The spur received regular freight shipments until the late 1950s, and was abandoned in the early 1960, with the tracks removed soon after. Some ties were still visible until the 1980s. While the spur's junction was removed, the pilings that carried the tracks still exist. Parts of the right-of-way are now a hiking trail. At Mount Loretto, which was destroyed by a fire in December 1973, all that remains is a coal dump trestle.

Education  She earned her B.A. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (1962) and her M.A. (1964) and Ph.D. (1969) from Harvard University, where she wrote her dissertation under the direction of John Rawls.  Career  Card joined the faculty in the philosophy department at Wisconsin straight from her Harvard studies. She has held visiting professorships at The Goethe Institute (Frankfurt, Germany), Dartmouth College (Hanover NH), and the University of Pittsburgh. She has written four treatises, edited or co-edited six books, and published nearly 150 articles and reviews. She has delivered nearly 250 papers at conferences, colleges, and universities and has been featured in 29 radio broadcasts. She delivered the John Dewey Lecture to the Central Division of the American Philosophical Association (APA) in 2008. In April 2011 Card became the President of the APA's Central Division. Her Presidential Address was \\"Surviving Long-Term Mass Atrocities: U-Boats, Catchers, and Ravens\\". In 2013, she was invited to deliver the Paul Carus Lectures, a series of three lectures delivered to the APA; these will be delivered at the Central Division in 2016. In 2011, Card was awarded the University of Wisconsin's Hilldale Award for excellence in teaching, research and service. In nominating her for this award, her department chair, Russ Shafer-Landau, said, \\"Her books and articles have become as essential to feminist thinking as Das Kapital is to labor theory. You simply can't do feminism without reading Card, and even if you don't read Card, today's feminism bears her mark so deeply that you may not even realize that you have in some other way digested her theoretical perspectives.\\"  Research  Card's research primarily focused on ethics and social philosophy, including normative ethical theory; feminist ethics; environmental ethics; and theories of justice, punishment, and evil. She paid special attention to the ethical theories of Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, and had read widely in history, sociology, and survivor testimony. In the 1970s, Card was an active early member of the Midwest Society for Women in Philosophy, and was a pioneer in articulating lesbian feminist philosophy. She supported a variety of LGBT research and activism throughout her career. In 1996, the Society for Women in Philosophy (SWIP) elected her Distinguished Philosopher of the Year. Card had previously taken some controversial stances, such as arguing against marriage, on the grounds that it gives each party rights over the person of the other that no one should have, and as being especially dangerous to women within patriarchy. While others were painting rosy pictures of equality in lesbian relationships, Card's realism came through in her articulation of the dangers of lesbian battering. Standing up for the oppressed and for persons at risk had marked her work from the start, in her classic and still oft-cited \\"On Mercy.\\" More recently, her work turned to understanding the nature of evil. She tackled issues of racism, sexism, oppression, developed a theory of genocide as social death, developed theories of militarism, punishment, and as early as 1996 was urging us to see rape as a weapon of war. Prior to her death, Card's work developed a secular conception of evil, which appears in two volumes of an intended trilogy, The Atrocity Paradigm: A Theory of Evil. An issue of Hypatia is dedicated to the book. These two volumes bring together 20 philosophers commenting on Card's work. The second book in the trilogy is Confronting Evils: Terrorism, Torture, Genocide. In it, Card examined her account of atrocity as a paradigm of evil, refining and expanding the views developed in the first book, with attention to structural evil, the role of harm, and the significance of culpability. She argued that evils are inexcusably wrong and that they need not be extraordinary. She also indicated we must pay attention to evils that occur so commonly that we tend to overlook them. She applied, tested, and extended this revised account in examining the moral wrongs of terrorism, torture, and genocide. While she was writing this second book in the trilogy, Card also co- edited a collection of philosophical papers on Genocide's Aftermath. Prior to her death on September 12, 2015, Card was working extensively on the third book in the trilogy, on Surviving Atrocity. This book built upon her 2010 APA presidential address, and maintained a focus on mass atrocities that have become all-too-familiar. The book also included attention to surviving long- term mass atrocities, poverty, and global and local misogyny.  Illness and death  Card was diagnosed with lung cancer in summer 2014, underwent treatment, and seemed to be doing fairly well. However, in early 2015, while attending the Ohio Philosophical Association annual meeting, where she was the invited keynote speaker, at Baldwin Wallace University outside of Cleveland, Ohio, Card collapsed in her hotel room. She was treated at the Cleveland Clinic, where she learned that her cancer had metastasized. After radiation treatment, months of rehabilitation and therapy, Card died, surrounded by her family, on September 12, 2015, at the age of 74.http://philosophy.wisc.edu/  Selected bibliography  = Books =  * Trilogy: :: :: :: (forthcoming) = Chapters in books = * References  External links  * Profile: Claudia Card (a) Department of Philosophy, The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison * Profile: Claudia Card (b) Department of Philosophy, The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison academia.edu (downloadable copies of some of Card's work) * Carus Lectures American Philosophical Association * Category:1940 births Category:2015 deaths Category:20th-century American philosophers Category:21st-century American philosophers Category:American women philosophers Category:Feminist philosophers Category:Harvard University alumni Category:People from Pardeeville, Wisconsin Category:University of Wisconsin- Madison alumni Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty Category:Women's studies academics Category:Writers from Wisconsin Category:Deaths from cancer in Wisconsin Category:Presidents of the American Philosophical Association ","title":"Claudia Card"},{"id":"43649035","text":"Mark Carne CBE is a British businessman who served as executive vice-president for Royal Dutch Shell in the Middle East and North Africa and was chief executive of Network Rail, the government company responsible for Britain's railway infrastructure. Early life and education Carne was born in Helensburgh in Scotland. He holds a BSc in Engineering Science from the University of Exeter and a Chartered Diploma in Accounting and Finance from the Cambridge College of Arts and Technology. Career Carne began his career at Royal Dutch Shell. Early in his career he oversaw the company's response to the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster, which was a formative experience and which made safety a theme of his leadership style. After rising to oversee the company's operation in the North Sea he became managing director of Brunei Shell Petroleum (a Shell subsidiary). After 21 years, he moved to BG Group, where he became BG's managing director for Europe and Central Asia. Moving back to Shell, he became executive vice-president for the Middle East and North Africa, right through the Arab Spring years. In 2013 he was appointed Chief Executive of Network Rail, which owns and operates the rail infrastructure in Great Britain. Network Rail Carne was appointed chief executive of Network Rail in September 2013, and joined the company in January 2014. He succeeded Sir David Higgins‚Äîwho moved to High Speed 2 as Chairman‚Äîin February 2014, having taken control earlier than planned to oversee the repairs in the aftermath of severe winter storms. Carne's salary on appointment was ¬£675,000‚Äîan increase on Higgins', though the overall remuneration package was smaller‚Äîwhich prompted criticism from unions, including the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (one of the main unions for Network Rail staff), ASLEF (the train drivers' union) and the RMT. Network Rail stated that the salary \\"was determined following an exhaustive and independent process which compared the salaries of chief executives in both the public and private sectors given Network Rail's unique position as a not- for-dividend, independent company\\". In an interview, Carne stated that his immediate focus would be on \\"safety, reliability, capacity, and cost\\", while also attempting to reduce spending.RAIL, issue 746, 16 April 2014, p. 10. Shortly after his appointment, Network Rail was reclassified as a public body in September 2014, which put the Company's debt of ¬£34 billion on the Government balance sheet. This fundamental change meant that Network Rail could no longer borrow additional money to pay for cost increases as the scope of infrastructure projects matured, which had been the process assumed in the Regulatory structure. As a result, cost increases in one project, led to others being controversially postponed or cancelled. This led to National Audit Office (NAO) reports and Carne being questioned by the Public Accounts Committee who concluded that \\"The 2014‚Äì2019 rail investment programme could not have been delivered within the budget which the Department, Network Rail and the Office of Rail and Road agreed\\" The investment programme was then replanned on the basis of available funds and realistic cost estimates. To also partially resolve the funding crisis, Carne proposed selling Network Rail's commercial estate, which was completed in September 2018 for ¬£1.46 billion. Carne reformed many aspects of Network Rail, devolving power to geographic route businesses, aligning incentives with Train Operating Companies (TOCs) and creating a System Operator to enhance strategic planning of the railway and to maximise use of available capacity. Improving safety was a constant theme - workforce injuries reduced by 50% over 2014-2019 . During this time Network Rail were also delivering the \\"biggest upgrade since Victorian times\\" with ¬£15 billion of new projects. Carne oversaw the opening of Reading station, Birmingham New Street Station and the new Borders Railway in Scotland, all by Her Majesty the Queen. He also accompanied the Duke of Cambridge on the opening of the new London Bridge Station Carne and the Transport secretary, Chris Grayling, gave back to back speeches to launch the Digital Railway strategy in May 2018. Carne had consistently advocated that moving from analogue signalling to digital signalling using the European Train Control System (ETCS) would reduce cost, increase capacity and reliability and improve safety. Carne was presented with an award by 'Women in Rail' in 2018 in recognition of his industry leadership in diversity and inclusion. The number of women employed by Network Rail increased by 30% during CP5 (2014-2019) In October 2017 the statement of funds for the next five year Control Period (CP6) of ¬£47.9 Bln (for England and Wales) was announced. This represented an increase in funding of 25% in the operations, maintenance and renewal of the railway, which came as a welcome surprise to some in the industry who had expected funding would be frozen or reduced. In February 2018, Carne announced that he would step down as the chief executive in the summer of 2018; this would allow his successor to take control of the company for the next control period covering 2019-2024. Carne was awarded a CBE for services to the Rail industry in the Queens Birthday honours 2018. Personal life Carne is married with three children and lives in Hampshire. He is an independent governor of Falmouth University and an Advisory Board member of Hypertunnel. He is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and a Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers.

The film had a limited theatrical release on September 5, 2014 and centers upon a group of friends that are forced to examine their lives after the Apocalypse strikes. Plot The film opens with a montage of videos depicting Skylar \\"Sky\\" (Alexa Vega) and Dan's (Bryan Dechart) happy moments together. In the present, Skylar and Dan are celebrating their wedding. Tommy (Johnny Pacar) is shooting a documentary as a favor for Dan. During the wedding, Tommy is in an elevator with Skylar's parents, who are Christian. However, before answering a question, the air turns cold and Skylar's parents suddenly drop dead, with their pupils shrinking to a pin-prick size. When Tommy exits the elevator, he finds the main floor has descended into high chaos, as others have dropped dead with the same pin-prick pupils. As Tommy and Jack (Shaun Sipos) exit the building to investigate a tremor, they find the city up in flames as planes fall from the sky and explode upon impact. When racing back to the building to find a safer way out, an ear-splitting sound, similar to a trumpet, echoes across the building. After this, loud claps of thunder and intense lightning are present. When Tommy, Dan, Skylar and Jack exit the building safely, Skylar theorizes that they are experiencing the Rapture, as the believers are raptured and the non-believers are left behind. Tommy dismisses this, as what he believes what is happening right now is related to science. Skylar then declares that they need to get to a place of safety, as the events will grow worse and worse as time goes on. Afterward, monstrous-sized hail rains down on the town. The four proceed to seek shelter in a library. Tommy encounters Sam (Liz E. Morgan) in the library. Skylar finds a bible and tells Sam, Dan, Jack, and Tommy a verse related to the Rapture, the First Trumpet. The five proceed to go to a nearby church for safety. Nearing the church, a demonic being snatches Skylar out of Dan's grip and they find her on the road but heavily injured by the entity. Upon reaching the church, the group is let in and led to the sanctuary for safety by Pastor Shay (John Pyper-Ferguson). When walking in the church, Jack reunites with Allison (Italia Ricci) while Dan tries to comfort Skylar while she is being healed. When Tommy asks what's going on, Shay explains that they are living in the Rapture. More survivors are let inside the church, but one of them is pregnant. The pregnant woman does give birth, but her baby doesn't show signs of crying or breathing, indicating that the baby is stillborn. When Tommy asks why God kills these people, Shay explains that God raptures the believers' souls while leaving their mortal bodies behind. Shay explains that the reason why he wasn't raptured was that he didn't display real faith in Christianity. A survivor tries to get into the church, only for a demonic being to kill him, while cracking a church window in the process. Sam records Tommy say a message to Allison just in case Tommy doesn't make it. A news article reveals that the Rapture has occurred worldwide, with children, infants and Christians getting raptured, with scientists labeling it as \\"Instant Death Syndrome\\" and that unusual weather has been occurring worldwide. Tommy shows Shay, Jack, and Allison a video of Skylar getting snatched by the unknown force, with Shay explaining that the Fifth Trumpet was played. Frame by frame, they see the face of a Fallen.

He decided to \\"[follow] the rules of Revelation\\" and tried to make the film Biblically accurate. Release The film opened in the United States on September 5, 2014. In its opening week, the movie grossed $159,143 from a total of 67 screens. In its second week, the screen count increased to 85 and brought in $242,095, a 52% increase (while retaining the film's per-screen average of opening week). The movie dropped for the next two weeks. Even though the movie dropped by 38% in its fourth week, the movie almost doubled its per-screen average compared to opening week. So far, the film has made $1,109,157.

On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".

The camp housed between 4,000 and 5,000 Muslim prisoners of war who had fought for the Allied side. The intended purpose of the camp was to convince detainees to wage jihad against the United Kingdom and France. To that end, \\"detainees lived in relative luxury and were given everything they needed to practise their faith\\". It was the site of the first mosque to be built in Germany, a large and ornate wooden structure finished in July 1915. The mosque, modelled on the Dome of the Rock, was demolished in 1925‚Äì26 owing to disrepair. There were also about 80 Sikh prisoners and some Hindus from British India held in the camp, two Australian aborigine soldiers Roland Carter and Douglas Grant, and around 50 Irishmen.http://www.irishbrigade.eu/camps/zossen.html A subcamp, known as (Camp of Indians), was established to house prisoners from India who were not openly pro-British; those who were pro-British had been sent to other camps instead. The leader of the \\"jihad experiment\\" was Max von Oppenheim, a German diplomat and aristocrat. He established an office nearby to lead a propaganda campaign with the \\"show camp\\", \\"self-consciously styled as a theatre for the wider world\\", at its centre. Oppenheim was assisted by Shaykh S√¢lih al-Shar√Æf, a Tunisian who had served in the Ottoman Empire's intelligence agency. He served as a spiritual leader for the detainees. Furthermore, Oppenheim cooperated with the Berlin Committee (later: Indian Independence Committee) in order to publish a propagandist Urdu- and Hindi-language newspaper, which was distributed in the camp. Anthropologists and Linguists used the 'favourable conditions' within the camp to conduct research. The Royal Prussian Phonographic Commission, under the auspices of the linguist Wilhelm Doegen, set out to record voice and language samples in the shape of stories, poems and songs of over 250 languages. The remaining recordings are held at the \\"Lautarchiv der Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin\\". Up to 3,000 of the detainees from the camp were recruited into the German Army to fight in North Africa and the Middle East. However, low morale and troop revolt plagued the resulting divisions, and few believed in the jihadist cause. In 1917 the remaining prisoners were put to agricultural labour in Romania. Cemetery The story of the camp was largely omitted from English-language texts until nearly a century after the war. It was discussed extensively in German history works.

British citizens have fought as members of the group, and there has been political debate on how to punish them. On 26 September 2014, Parliament voted to begin Royal Air Force airstrikes against ISIL in northern Iraq at the request of the Iraqi government, which began four days later, using Tornado GR4 jets. On 2 December 2015, the UK Parliament authorised an extension to the Royal Air Force airstrike campaign, joining the US-led international coalition against ISIL in Syria. Hours after the vote, Royal Air Force Tornado jets began bombing ISIL-controlled oilfields. British citizens in ISIL William Hague, then Foreign Secretary, estimated in June 2014 that 400 British citizens were fighting in Syria, some for ISIL. Khalid Mahmood, a Labour MP, estimated that there were at least 1,500 Britons in ISIL. A more accurate source from the BBC estimates around 850 people from the UK had traveled to Iraq and Syria to support or fight for jihadist groups. Former MI6 counter-terrorism head Richard Barrett raised concerns about the potentially large number of radicalised fighters that had returned to Britain from Syria and Iraq. Journalist James Foley was executed around 19 August 2014, on video by an ISIL member whose accent sounded English. The killer, Mohammed Emwazi, was described in the media as \\"Jihadi John\\". In August 2014, activists in London handed out leaflets in support of ISIL outside the busy Oxford Circus branch of Topshop. On 7 September 2015, a Royal Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone conducted an airstrike in Syria which killed two British-born ISIL fighters. On 24 October 2017, it was announced that a British man who had been fighting against Isil with the Kurdish YPG in Raqqa had been killed whilst trying to clear land mines. This took the total number of British volunteers fighting Isis in Syria to six. Reactions The British government proscribed ISIL as a terrorist organisation in June 2014. Previously, it had been proscribed as a part of Al-Qaeda. The government describes the group as follows: In August 2014, British Prime Minister David Cameron suggested that anybody displaying the black standard in the United Kingdom should be arrested. Home Secretary Theresa May suggested new measures against radical preachers, stripping citizenship from naturalised Britons who fought for ISIL, and trying British-born ISIL members for engaging in terrorism abroad. Other figures, such as Mayor of London Boris Johnson, Conservative backbench MP David Davis, former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey and UKIP leader Nigel Farage have stated that all British citizens in ISIS should lose their citizenship. On 29 August 2014, the UK terror threat was raised from \\"substantial\\" to \\"severe\\". Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a senior MP, advocated an alliance with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to defeat ISIL. This was ruled out by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who stated \\"We may very well find that we are aligned against a common enemy. But that does not make us able to trust them, it does not make us able to work with them and it would poison what we are trying to achieve in separating moderate Sunni opinion from the poisonous ideology of [ISIS] if we were to align ourselves with President Assad.\\" Royal Air Force Tornado jets and Chinook helicopters based in Cyprus have provided humanitarian aid to Yazidi refugees fleeing ISIL, as well as airlifts.

In 1987, HRO built the 36-floor building that stands today, naming the 23-43 Old Slip property One Financial Square. The Paramount Group purchased the property for $135 million in 1995, financing the purchase with a $96 million loan from now-defunct Japanese bank Sanwa. Paramount signed American International Group to a 10-year, lease in 2006, which was one of the largest leases in Manhattan that year. AIG occupied seven floors of the building next door to their headquarters at 180 Maiden Lane. In August 2007, Paramount sold the building to Beacon Capital Partners for $751 million, which is one of the largest sales on record of an office building in Lower Manhattan. Beacon financed the acquisition with a $350 million loan from MetLife. Like many buildings in Lower Manhattan, 32 Old Slip was battered with storm waters during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In contrast to most in the region, the building was designed to resist a powerful earthquake, which in part made the structure less prone to flooding. Within a year the building's market value declined by 21.6% ($65.7 million). In 2013 a renovation effort began to add improved flood barriers, pumps and piping systems to better ward against future storms. In January 2013, construction firm Hunter Roberts left Brookfield Place for the building, signing a lease for the tenth floor. Later the same month, the United States Census Bureau leased in the building, covering the 8th and 9th floors. RXR Realty agreed to purchase the building from Beacon Capital Partners in December 2014 for $675 million, over $75 million less than the building was purchased for in 2007. RXR financed the purchase with a $325 million loan from GE Capital. Shortly after RXR's purchase, health care advertising firm Cement Bloc signed a lease for the 15th and 16th floors of the building. The American Arbitration Association subleased on the 33rd and 36th floors in September 2017 from insurance company Axa XL. In October 2018, law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel signed a lease to move their headquarters from nearby 80 Pine Street. Under the terms of the lease, the law firm will occupy AIG's old space on floors 17 to 22 for 20 years starting in 2020. The same month, commercial insurance brokerage Alliant Insurance Services signed a lease and creative agency Decoded Advertising signed for a space in the building. The building's construction was documented in the 1990 short film \\"Going Up\\" by Gary Pollard, which was featured in Season 3 of the PBS television program POV. Architecture The building is considered to be postmodern. Four sides of granite and silver-tinted glass make up the base, which give way to stepped transitions, eventually resulting in an octagonal, entirely glass curtain wall. The floor sizes range from 23,404 to 38,750 rentable square feet, totaling 1,161,435 rentable square feet. It consists of columnless interior on each floor and a lobby. There are 26 elevators in service and a parking garage beneath the structure. The ground level side and rear of the building feature a privately owned arcade and urban plaza.  In Popular Culture  The building was used for both interior and exterior shots in the 1999 film The Thomas Crown Affair.

Design and development The Skyship 500 was developed from the Aerospace Developments AD500, the sole example of which was effectively the prototype / technology demonstrator for the production Skyship 500. =AD500= Aerospace Developments began the design of a new non-rigid airship in the 1970s, intended to carry out civil and paramilitary roles, such as aerial advertising, promotional and pleasure flying, surveillance and maritime patrol duties. The AD500 introduced new materials and technology to airship manufacture and operations. Materials used in the ship included thin single-ply polyester, coated with titanium dioxide-doped polyurethane, for the envelope;Kevlar for the cables suspending the gondola from the top of the envelope; a Kevlar nose-cone moulded in the same manner as glass-reinforced plastic; and a gondola moulded by Vickers‚ÄìSlingsby from Kevlar-reinforced plastic. Other innovations featured in the AD500 included simplified controls and thrust vectoring ducted fans driven by inboard-mounted Porsche engines. Assembly of the prototype AD500 began at No.1 Hangar Cardington in March 1978 but it was not flown until 3 February 1979, due to various problems with certification and the power-plant. On 8 March 1979, whilst moored outside the hangar, a storm blew up unexpectedly, preventing the airship from being moved into the hangar. The nose cone was damaged and the envelope was deflated using the emergency rip cord. Although regarded as a success, Aerovision, the major investor in Aerospace Developments, pulled the plug and the company went into liquidation on 8 June 1979. Development of the AD500 continued with a new company, Airship Developments, until it was acquired by Thermo-Skyships Ltd to form Airship Industries to bring the concept to production as the Skyship 500. =Skyship 500= With the formation of Airship Industries production of the Skyship 500 could commence and five further airships were produced.\\\\- The Skyship 500 consists of a polyester fabric envelope, retaining helium gas, and carrying a gondola for the control cabin, passenger cabin, propulsion systems and ballast (fixed and jettison-able). The envelope is of a traditional streamlined shape with cruciform tail surfaces which carry rudder and elevator control surfaces for yaw and pitch. The undercarriage consists of a castoring twin-wheeled oleo-pneumatic strut at the rear of the gondola, with ground handling ropes for ground crew to manoeuvre the airship on the ground. The nose-cone of the envelope also carries the mooring point which can connect to a mobile mooring mast. The polyester fabric envelope is coated on the outside with Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) loaded Polyurethane to reduce Ultra-Violet degradation and lined with a Polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) film bonded to the fabric to minimise Helium (He) losses. Most other structural components are produced from fibre-reinforced composite materials, to reduce weight, including Fibre-lam board used to build up the fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) tail surfaces and control surfaces. The moulded FRP gondola houses the control cabin, passenger cabin, power-plant systems and ballast (both fixed and jettison-able). Large windows to the front and sides provide excellent visibility for crew and passengers seated on five individual seats and a three abreast bench seat at the rear. Support for the gondola comes from Kevlar cables inside the envelope. Power for the Skyship 500 comes from two converted Porsche 930/10 engines inside the rear of the gondola driving the vectoring Hoffmann ducted reversible-pitch propellers through lateral drive-shafts and converted Westland Lynx tail-rotor gearboxes. The pilot and co-pilot seated at the front of the cabin have a full set of instruments and avionics and control the airship through yokes which operate the control surfaces though cables. One of the five production airships was modified into a heavy payload version, designated Skyship 500 (HL), using a larger Skyship 600 envelope but carrying a Skyship 500 gondola.FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet for Skycruiser Skyship 500HL Operational history In the years 1980-1990 the 6 Skyship 500 airships were used worldwide, not only for advertising but also for security and passenger sky-cruises over major cities. Fujifilm arranged the first overseas charter, using JA-1003, which was delivered in March 1984. A Skyship 500 was used as a camera and surveillance platform at the Games of the XXIII Olympiad in 1984 at Los Angeles, California. Later in 1984 the aircraft was shown to full effect in the James Bond film A View to a Kill. Skyship 500s also carried out Sky-cruises and were used as advertising billboards using light arrays. The 1987 Sky-cruise programme offered a schedule of 700 flights in a season (from March to October). Demand for the programme was so high that all flights were sold out within 72 hours. At least one Skyship 500 was trialed by the United States Navy, at the Naval Air Development Center (NADC), NAS Patuxent River, Maryland.

He was the most eminent gemstone engraver of his time, the official engraver of the king, and produced many cameo and intaglio engravings in semi-precious stones such as onyx, jasper and carnelian. Subjects included classical figures, events in the reign of the king and portraits of members of the court. Early years Jacques Guay was born in Marseille in 1711. Little is known about his family or early life. He came to Paris at an early age and studied drawing with Fran√ßois Boucher. He met the rich financier and collector Pierre Crozat and studied his collection of 1,400 classical engraved gemstones. He decided to study the art of fine stone engraving. His first efforts were successful, but he needed formal training. He went to Florence in 1742, where he studied the antique stones in the grand duke's collection. He went on to Rome, where King Louis XV of France let him stay in the French Academy's building, and saw the best collections of classical antiques in Rome. He made several engraved stones while in Rome. Career Boucher (1758). She is wearing Guay's cameo of Louis XV on her wrist. After Guay returned to France the king's mistress Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, Madame de Pompadour, an artist in her own right, installed him in her apartment in the Palace of Versailles and charged him with making engravings in gemstones of the main events and characters of the reign. Guay made an engraving on a small carnelian of the Triumph of Fontenoy after a design provided by Edm√© Bouchardon. This was the first of a series of engravings on historical subjects. Guay was named graveur du roi (king's engraver) in 1745, and was granted lodgings in the Louvre. He succeeded Fran√ßois-Julien Barier (1680‚Äì1746) in this position. Barier, who had a minutely detailed style, was much inferior as an artist. Guay was agr√©e for admission to the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1747, the first gemstone engraver to receive this honor. He was formally admitted on 30 March 1748. He exhibited his work at almost all the Salons from 1747 to 1759. He taught Madame de Pompadour how to engrave stones, and she acquired proficiency as shown in surviving samples of her work in onyx, jasper and other precious stones. One of her works was of Victory, a self-portrait in sardonyx, which she had made up into a bracelet. In 1753 Guay made a splendid cameo portrait of Louis XV in sardonyx. In a portrait of Madame de Pompadour by Boucher, exhibited in a Salon of 1755, papers at her feet include one of her print engravings after a cameo by Guay. A portrait of Madame de Pompadour at Her Toilette shows her wearing Guay's cameo of Louis XV on her wrist. Guay's miniature of Louis XV, cut from three-color sardonyx, was the basis for an etching of the king as a Roman emperor by Pompadour. One of the last of Guay's historical works was Wishes for the recovery of the health of Madame de Pompadour. There were two variants, one an intaglio in rock crystal dated 1764, the year of Madame de Pompadour's death. The work is incomplete since it could not be offered to its intended recipient. Guay lost much of his importance after the death of the marquise. No more historical works by him are known, other than an allegory on the accession of Louis XVI dated 1774. Guay made some portraits for the new court. Jacques Guay died in Paris in 1793. A review of gem engraving published in 1819 said that \\"France, which at no time excelled in the number of good gem engravers has, ever since Guay's time, been particularly deficient in this class of artists, so that Millin (in 1797) considered the glyptic art as absolutely extinct in his country. There is however, at the present day, a skilful engraver in Paris of the name of Jeoffroy, whom the national institute has thought worthy to receive among its members.\\" Work Cameo of Minerva and France protecting a newborn child (1751) Guay's style is closer to the work of contemporary medalists and Rococo artists such as Boucher and Bouchardon than to the Roman masters of gem engraving. A record of Guay's work has been preserved in a collection of ink engravings by the marquise de Pompadour, reproducing Guay's stone engravings, and in drawings made as guides for his work by Guay himself, Boucher and Joseph-Marie Vien (1716‚Äì1809). The Pompadour collection includes fifty-two plates plus a frontispiece. Each plate is accompanied by a description of the subject represented. The prints were bound into a handsome volume that was given to favored members of the court. The collection includes eight intaglio copies of classical works made in Rome, mostly unsigned: *Head of Octavius *Le Lantin (Belvedere Antinous) *Two fantasy heads *Marcus Aurelius *Plato *Satyr *Egyptian priest Guay's engravings of historical subjects include: *Triumph of Fontenoy (carnelian) *Triumph of Fontenoy (jasper, ) *Victory of Lawfeldt (intaglio, carnelian, after Bouchardon) *Preliminaries of the Peace of 1748 (carnelian) *Birth of the Duke of Burgundy (sardonyx) *Wishes of France for the recovery of the Dauphin's health (cornelian) *Thanks for the recovery of the Dauphin's health (intaglio) *Death of the Duke of Aquitaine (intaglio) *Alliance of France and Austria (cameo) *Battle of Lutzelberg (intaglio, cornelian) *Genius of France (intaglio, cornelian) *Erection in Paris of an equestrian statue of Louis XV (cameo) In addition Guay made various portraits of members of the court, notably his famous cameo of Louis XV.

Montesano was handled on the Willapa Bay route by two members of a prominent steamboating family, Capt. James P. Whitcomb as master and his brother George A. Whitcomb (1854‚Äì1937), as mate. Lower Columbia River service Montesano service on the Chehalis River was brief. The boat was then transferred to the lower Columbia River, where it was in service from 1886 to 1889, according to one historian. A contemporary source states however that Montesano was transferred to Yaquina Bay, in the central Oregon coast, in June 1887. Prior to the departure for Yaquina Bay, Montesano is reported to have been once more in service in Grays Harbor, but dates for this second period of operations in the Chehalis River area are not furnished in the source. Yaquina Bay service Tressa May leading Montesano in a race, probably in June 1887. On the evening of June 8, 1887, Montesano departed Astoria bound for Yaquina Bay which was to be the boat's new base of operations.Item, Daily Astorian, June 8, 1887, page 3, col. 1. On August 19, 1887, it was reported that the Shoalwater Bay Transportation Company was about to disincorporate.Item, Daily Astorian, August 19, 1887, page 3, col. 1. Montesano was reported in a contemporary source owned by D.H. Welch when in service at Yaquina Bay in 1887.Item, Daily Morning Astorian, June 21, 1887, page 3, col. 1. In June, 1887, D.H. Welch raced Montesano against the propeller-driven steamer Tressa May. The race went from Yaquina City to Newport, Oregon. Both vessels arrived at almost the same time, with Montesano just a little ahead. H.W. Dunham (b. 1845) is also reported to have been master of Montesano while the boat was in Yaquina Bay, which may have been subsequent to D.H. Welch. Difficult transfer to Coos Bay Montesano was transferred to Coos Bay by H.W. Dunham. There were difficulties in carrying out the transfer. Montesano may have been taken in Astoria from Yaquina Bay before transfer to Coos Bay. Montesano was reported to have departed Astoria a few days prior to June 13, 1888.Item, Daily Morning Astorian, June 13, 1888, page 3, col. 1. It was later reported that Montesano had gone ashore on the south spit at the mouth of the Nehalem River. Further details were not then available. On July 2, 1888, Montesano was still at Yaquina.Item, Daily Morning Astorian, July 6, 1888, page 3, item 1. It was reported that the boat would leave for Coos Bay \\"at the first favorable opportunity.\\" On July 4, 1888, the tug Columbia, under Captain Magee, was dispatched from Coos Bay to Yaquina Bay to bring down Montesano, which then belonged to the Southern Oregon Company.\\"From Coos Bay\\", Daily Morning Astorian, July 8, 1888, page 2 col. 2. Arriving at Yaquina Bay, Columbia found the bar so rough that two coastal steamers at the bay were unable to depart. Columbia did enter the bay, but the next day sea conditions were still too extreme for Montesano, so Columbia had to depart without the sternwheeler. Coos Bay service The transfer to Coos Bay appears to have occurred by 1889, when Montesano home port was listed as Coos Bay.U.S. Dept. of the Treasury, Statistics Bureau, Annual List of Merchant Vessels (for year ending June 30, 1889)., at page 315. Dunham ran Montesano on Coos Bay for nearly a year.Wright, E.W., ed., Lewis & Dryden's Marine history of the Pacific Northwest, Lewis & Dryden Printing Co., Portland, OR (1895), at page 253, n.17. While on Coos Bay, Montesano towed logs for the mill of the Southern Oregon Company at Empire. On September 18, 1890, Montesano was reported to be undergoing repairs at the shipyard of Christenson & Johnson.Item, Coast Mail, September 18, 1890, page 3, col. 1. On September 25, 1890, the repairs to the Montesano were reported to be complete and the steamer was back in service.Item, Coast Mail, page 3, col. 2. Prior to 1898, James T. Hall (b. 1859) was a master of Montesano while the boat was in Coos Bay.Dodge, Orvil, Pioneer History of Coos and Curry Counties or Heroic Deeds and Thrilling Adventures of the Early Settlers (Biographical Appendix) (1898) at page 42. Disposition Montesano out of service. Upper cabin is roofed over, smokestack absent, indicating lack of boiler, windows are boarded up and hull appears to be resting on a platform over the water. Montesano is reported to have been laid up and stripped prior to 1900.

He was a son of Romanos with his unnamed first wife, a daughter of Alusian, and hence excluded from the line of succession when his father married the empress-dowager Eudokia Makrembolitissa in 1068. He was named after his grandfather, general Constantine Diogenes (died 1032). The then kouropalatissa Anna Dalassene (later, regent of the empire), wife of the brother of the late Emperor Isaac I Komnenos, despised the Doukas imperial family. According to perceptions of Anna Dalassene, the Doukas men had usurped the imperial dignity by tricking emperor Isaac into resigning and her husband, the kouropalates John Komnenos, into refusing the throne. Anna Dalassene expected the Doukas men to lead the country to military problems. Consequently, Anna Dalassene plotted with Romanos Diogenes and others to push the underage Michael VII Doukas aside. Romanos Diogenes was raised to the imperial throne, having to marry the Doukas dowager empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa. As a signal of strength of the allied supporters and Romanos IV, the marriage of Constantine Diogenes was arranged. Emperor Romanos' son received the daughter of kouropalates John Komnenos and kouropalatissa Anna Dalassene as his bride. The marriage was one of signals of the anti-Doukas camp. He was married to Theodora Komnene, sister of the later emperor Alexios I Komnenos (reigned 1081‚Äì1118), some time during his father's reign. Their daughter Anna Diogenissa became the consort of Serbia after her marriage to Uro≈° I of Serbia. Constantine fell in battle in 1073.

In 2010, there were 15,000 baptized. Its current Bishop is Cesar Essayan. Its cathedral episcopal see is the St. Louis Cathedral, Beirut in the national capital city Beirut, while the former crusader cathedral in Tyre is in ruins.  Antecedents  The Catholic presence in Lebanon of the Latin Rite begins with the Crusades in the late of eleventh century and ends with the final defeat of the Crusaders and the disappearance of the Crusader principalities in the Levant after the middle of the thirteenth century. In this period, in the lands corresponding to the current Lebanon were established several Latin ecclesiasticals, which most of the time they were supplanting ancient bishoprics of the early days of Christianity: the Archdiocese of Tyre from which depended the suffragan dioceses of Latin Catholic Bishop of Acre, Caesarea Philippi, Sidon and Berytus (modern Beirut), while from the Latin Patriarch of Antioch depended the suffragan dioceses of Byblos, Tripoli and Antarado. These dioceses disappeared with the end of the Crusader period and remain today mostly as the venue owners. The Latin continued presence in the country with the Friars Minor, who arrived as early as the thirteenth century, and then with missionaries of other religious orders, such as the Capuchin Friars, the Carmelites, the Vincentians and the Jesuits, who arrived in the seventeenth century. For the faithful of the Latin Rite of Lebanon was not instituted any ecclesiastical district until the end of the French mandate at the end of World War II: the Apostolic Delegate (papal diplomatic envoy) of Syria held the functions of the bishop of the Latin Catholics of Lebanon.  History  The apostolic vicariate was erected on 4 June 1953 with the Papal bull Solent caeli of Pope Pius XII, with territory that was taken from the Syrian Apostolic Vicariate of Aleppo. The apostolic vicar is a member of the Conference of the Latin Bishops of the Arab Regions. It enjoyed a papal visit from Benedict XVI in September 2012.  Organisation  The apostolic vicariate extends its jurisdiction over all Catholic faithful of the Latin Rite in Lebanon. It is exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See, not part if any ecclesiastical province. Its territory is divided into only eighth Latin parishes.

Imperial beer, produced by Florida Ice & Farm Co. is known and associated with Costa Rica all around the world. Due to its geographic location, Costa Rica is not able to grow the raw materials for beer, which hinders the growth of a completely local food product, and depends heavily on imported raw materials. History In February 1852, a brewery patent was established at a price of fifty pesos. By April 1856 there were advertisements in the newspaper about the (Torres Beer), a barley and hops beer, by the Joy & von Schr√∂ter commercial house, at a price of two pesos, or fourteen reales if returning the bottle. Later a dark beer was produced by the same brewery, but this business closed by 1861. In 1867, James Hasland, British, and Arthur Kopper, German, opened a beer brewery in Cartago. Next year, 1868, the President of Costa Rica, Jos√© Mar√≠a Castro Madriz, requested Karl Johanning to build a brewery in San Jos√©, which was managed by the state as an enterprise to pursue funds due to a coffee production crisis. By the last two decades of 19th century, at least six breweries were producing beer in San Jos√© and Cartago, where in 1885 was able to produce up to 7,500 bottles each day. was another brewery of the Cartago province at the time. Jos√© Traube Tichy, born and raised in Saaz, Bohemia, founded (Globe Brewery) in 1888 century in Cartago, which was later moved to Cuesta de Moras in San Jos√© and was known as (Traube Brewery and Bottled Drinks), and later moved again to the Torres river margin, to use its waters, where it was renamed , for many years the slope where it was located was known as (Traube Slope) and the mules to transport the beer were widely recognized. This brewery produced the Pilsen Traube, Selecta and P√°jaro Azul beers.http://www.carpechepe.com/traube-pionero-de-la- cerveza/ On September 16, 1908, the brothers Rupert, Cecilio and Stanley Lindo Morales from Jamaica started in Siquirres, Lim√≥n Province a company located in a farm called La Florida, which until then was a major producer of ice and other agricultural produce. This company was called Florida Ice & Farm Co., inscribed in English due to their native language, which was the most common in the Costa Rican Caribbean by then. Florida Ice & Farm Co. acquired in 1912 with which the company started to brew its own beers, the beer now known as Pilsen is the legacy of Pilsen Traube. In 1966 was closed. In 1914 an immigrant family from Spain, headed by Mr. Manuel Ortega, and his sons, Antonio, Eloy and Manuel, were the owners of a bottled drink factory which used mineral spring waters from Salitral, Santa Ana, San Jos√©, and decided to start to brew the beers Imperial and Bavaria using such source of water. In 1957 Florida Ice & Farm Co. acquired the Ortega beer brewery, and continues the production of the Imperial and Bavaria beers to the date. In the 1930s, Cervecer√≠a Gambrinus was established, created by European immigrants.As√≠ surgieron las primeras cervecer√≠as en Costa Rica Cervecer√≠a Tropical, founded and owned by Cuban immigrants brewed Cerveza Tropical, in 1977 Florida Ice & Farm Co. acquired part of the company, and finally bought it completely in 1988, thus consolidating the beer production in the country in a single company.Historia de la Cerveza - Costa Rica =Craft beer in Costa Rica= Until the beginning of the 21st Century, there was no easy way to acquire or taste other kind of beer brewed in Costa Rica other than those produced by Florida Ice & Farm Co., which reduced the available styles to industrial-scale lagers. The lack of local ingredients and not very clear laws restricting the volume of beer brewed by individuals or small companies, were also factors on the lack of variety. The now defunct restaurant K&S; in Curridabat, which opened in 1997, started the production of craft beer for general consumption in its premises.http://www.ticotimes.net/2008/11/07/cartago-microbrewery-sets- sail-on-sudsy-sea Cartago Microbrewery Sets Sail on Sudsy Sea. After closing the restaurant, they continued the production of their beers \\"Chivo Blanco\\" and \\"K&S; Lager\\" until 2009. The first microbrew pub in Costa Rica was established in 1998 in San Jose under the name Cabeza Grande. Cabeza Grande later closed the San Jose location and re-opened on the shores of Lake Arenal in 2010 as Lake Arenal Brewery, an eco-brewery. The claim for 'eco-brewery' is supported by the brewery's use of solar power for 100% of their brew operations, the use of gravity fed spring water, and the recycle of spent grain for their organic farm. Later, in 2010, Costa Rica Craft Beer Co. jumpstarted the trend by producing its own brands, \\"Segua\\" and \\"Libertas\\", and several microbreweries started to appear in the next years, many of them guided by the experience of expatriate residents coming from the United States. Around 2012 a few companies such as TicoBirra and La Bodega de Chema started to import and sell to particulars the required ingredients (such as malt, hops or yeast), the equipment and tools, and also started to teach in workshops how to brew beer. This accelerated the creation of new breweries. Since 2012, the Festival de Cerveza Artesanal (Craft Beer Festival) showcases the current brews in the craft beer scene of Costa Rica,Festival Cerveza Artesanal its growth from 400 attendees in the first appearance to around 3000 in the 2014 edition shows the significant growth of the industry and the newly acquired taste for different kind of beers for the local Costa Ricans.3rd annual Craft Beer Fest offers a taste of the future in Costa Rica By 2014 the impact of the microbreweries on the local market prompted Florida Ice & Farm Co. to start its own craft beer division, called La Micro Brewing Company.http://www.revistasumma.com/negocios/50730-fifco-incursiona-en-el- mercado-de-cerveza-artesanal-en-costa-rica.html Fifco incursiona en el mercado de cerveza artesanal en Costa Rica Trademark disputes In 2013, the microbrewery El B√∫ho Cervecer√≠a Artesanal, started to sell their beer, B√∫ho, an imperial stout style of beer, however the trademark was not registered. In 2014, the microbrewery offshoot of Florida Ice & Farm Co., La Micro Brewing Company, started to produce and sell B√∫ho, a bock style beer, and registered the trademark name. A legal dispute was ensued, and the trademark office of Costa Rica, finally issued the trademarked name \\"B√∫ho\\" to Florida Ice & Farm Co. El B√∫ho Cervecer√≠a Artesanal changed its name to Bora Brewing Company.Proteja su marca y evite disputas legales See also * Beer in Central America References Category:Companies of Costa Rica by industry Category:Costa Rican cuisine Category:Costa Rican alcoholic drinks Cos Category:Beer brands ","title":"Beer in Costa Rica"},{"id":"43650306","text":"The reported epicenter of the 2014 South Napa earthquake was located beneath the Napa Valley Marina The West Napa Fault is a long geologic fault in Napa County, in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area in northern California.

It lays down the framework defining fundamental political principles of governance, and establishes the powers of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of state. It outlines the roles and duties of the Monarch, the Governor-General, ministers and judges. The Act repealed and replaced the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 and the Statute of Westminster, and removed the ability of the British Parliament to pass laws for New Zealand with the consent of the New Zealand Parliament. Background =1984 constitutional crisis= After the 1984 election there was an awkward transfer of power from the outgoing Third National government to the new Fourth Labour government in the midst of a financial crisis. Outgoing Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon was unwilling initially to accept instructions from incoming Prime Minister David Lange to devalue the currency. Ministers hurriedly constructed an argument to convince Muldoon to comply, drawing on the ethos of past transitions, as there was no convention. Eventually he relented, but only after his own party caucus had threatened to replace him. A press statement was made on 17 June outlining the behaviour of outgoing governments, which was dubbed the \\"caretaker convention\\".https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/our-business-units/cabinet- office/supporting-work-cabinet/cabinet-manual/6-elections-transitions-3 An Officials Committee on Constitutional Reform was established by the Labour Government to review New Zealand's constitutional law, and the Constitution Act resulted from two reports by this Committee. The issue of the transfer of power from outgoing to incoming governments (and hence prime ministers) was not resolved by this Act, however, and the transfer of executive powers remains a matter of unwritten constitutional conventions. =Committee's report= The Officials Committee on Constitutional Reform reported back to Parliament during February 1986. The Committee recommended that New Zealand adopt an Act to restate various constitutional provisions in a single enactment that would replace the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, thus \\"patriating\\" the Constitution Act to New Zealand. The recommendation followed events in Canada and Australia, which had recently patriated their own constitutions. The Canadian Parliament began the process by passing the Constitution Act, 1982, and the British Parliament had renounced its right to pass legislation on behalf of Canada in the Canada Act 1982. The Australian Parliament passed the Australia Act 1986 in 1985, and the British Parliament would pass its own Act in February 1986. This left New Zealand as the only original Dominion from 1931 that still had residual constitutional links to the United Kingdom. =Parliamentary process= A Bill was introduced into Parliament during mid-1986, and was passed unanimously with the support of both the Labour and National parties on 13 December 1986. The act came into force on 1 January 1987. Amendments were passed during 1987 and 1999. Effect The Act repealed the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, renamed the General Assembly as the \\"Parliament of New Zealand\\" and ended the right of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to make laws for New Zealand. Key provisions The Act consists of four main parts: =Part I: The sovereign= * The head of state of New Zealand is the \\"Sovereign in Right of New Zealand\\", titled as the King or Queen of New Zealand, and the sovereign's representative in New Zealand is the Governor-General. The succession of the sovereign is determined by the Act of Settlement 1701, which is part of New Zealand law under the Imperial Laws Application Act 1988, meaning that the sovereign is the same person as the monarch of the United Kingdom (section 5). =Part II: The Executive= * Ministers of the Crown and members of the Executive Council of New Zealand must be, with some timing limitations, Members of Parliament (section 6). =Part III: The Legislature= The House of Representatives * The House of Representatives is stated to be the same entity established by the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 (section 10). * The Oath of Allegiance is to be taken by Members of Parliament (section 11). * The rules relating to the election of the Speaker and the Speaker's role upon dissolution or expiration of Parliament are set out (section 12, section 13). Parliament * Parliament consists of the Sovereign in right of New Zealand (currently the Queen) and the House of Representatives; Parliament is stated to be the same body as the General Assembly established by the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 (section 14). * Parliament has full power to make laws (section 15). * The term of Parliament is to be three years unless it is dissolved sooner (section 17). * Parliament meets not later than six weeks after the day fixed for the return of the writs for the general election (section 19). Parliament and public finance * Bills providing for the appropriation of public money or for the imposition of any charge upon public money are not to be passed unless they have been recommended to the House of Representatives by the Crown (section 21). * It is not lawful for Crown, except by or under an Act of Parliament, to levy a tax, to raise a loan from any person or to spend any public money (section 22). =Part IV: The Judiciary= * The rules relating to the protection of judges against arbitrary removal from office are set out (section 23). * The salary of a judge of the High Court is not to be reduced during the judge's term. * Section 21, covering bills appropriating public money, is repealed. Entrenchment Only section 17 of the Act, which says that the term of Parliament is \\"three years from the day fixed for the return of the writs issued for the last preceding general election of members of the House of Representatives, and no longer\\", is entrenched, by section 268 of the Electoral Act 1993. This provision requires that any amendment to section 17 can be made only by a majority of three-quarters of all votes cast in Parliament, or by a referendum. However, section 268 of the Electoral Act 1993 itself is not entrenched, which means that Parliament could repeal the section and then amend section 17 of the Act. Thus, the provision is said to only be \\"singly entrenched\\". Some academics, including Sir Geoffrey Palmer,Bridled Power by Sir Geoffrey and Matthew Palmer, Oxford University Press, 2001, page 22 argue that the whole of the Constitution Act should be entrenched. United Kingdom The Act replaced the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, repealed the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947 and removed the ability of the United Kingdom to pass laws for New Zealand with the consent of New Zealand's Parliament. Unlike Canada and Australia, New Zealand was able to patriate its constitution without British approval. The British Parliament had already passed the New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1947, as requested by the New Zealand Parliament in the New Zealand Constitution Amendment (Request and Consent) Act 1947. The British Act allowed the Parliament of New Zealand to amend any part of the 1852 Act, including the abolition of the Legislative Council in 1951. However, a number of sections of that Act had remained unamendable by the Parliament of New Zealand, including provisions establishing the Parliament itself.)

It holds that the legislative body has absolute sovereignty and is supreme over all other government institutions, including executive or judicial bodies. It also holds that the legislative body may change or repeal any previous legislation and so it is not bound by written law (in some cases, even a constitution) or by precedent. In some countries, parliamentary sovereignty may be contrasted with separation of powers, which limits the legislature's scope often to general law-making, and judicial review, where laws passed by the legislature may be declared invalid in certain circumstances. Many states have sovereign legislatures, including the United Kingdom, Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Barbados, Jamaica, Papua New Guinea, Israel, and the Solomon Islands. In political philosophy, the concept is also called parliamentarianism or parliamentarism.  Australia  Under the federal system, neither the states nor the federal parliament in Australia have true parliamentary sovereignty. The Commonwealth Parliament is created by the constitution, and only has enumerated powers. Each state's legislative power is inherent but restrained by the federal constitution, the relevant state constitution, and Commonwealth powers. In this context, parliamentary supremacy has two meanings: one is that parliament (the legislature) can make and unmake any law; another meaning is that as long as parliament (legislature) has the power to make laws regarding a subject matter, the exercise of that power cannot be challenged or reviewed by judiciary. The second meaning is more consistent with the federal system and the practice of judicial review, as judiciary cannot review on the merits of the parliament (legislature)'s exercise of power. Blackshield and Williams explain that \\"[i]n Australia, the idea of Parliamentary Sovereignty must be understood in the context of the rigid limits and boundaries imposed by the federal Constitution, and to some extent by the State Constitutions as well.\\"Blackshield and Williams Australian Constitutional Law and Theory, 5th ed, 2010 The constitution confers the power to make laws in the Commonwealth Parliament, however, this limited to particular subjects. Section 128 of the federal constitution prescribes the mode to alter the constitution, which further restricts the power of the Commonwealth Parliament. The supremacy clause (section 109 of the constitution) gives Commonwealth laws precedence over state laws. The state law-making power is therefore constrained where the Commonwealth has concurrent law-making power. Furthermore, regarding the subject matters which Commonwealth has concurrent legislative power, the Commonwealth Parliament can 'cover the field', which means the Commonwealth can, by express words or by implication, exclude the operations of state laws.New South Wales v Commonwealth (WorkChoices Case)(2006) 231 ALR 1 The Commonwealth Parliament has exclusive legislative power over the subject matters listed in sections 52 and 92 of the constitution, which means that the states cannot make laws in these areas. Also under section 96 of the constitution, the Commonwealth can use financial assistance to entice states to refrain from exercising their legislative powers, such as refraining from collecting income tax.South Australia v Commonwealth (1942) 65 CLR 373 (\\"the First Uniform Tax case\\") Each state parliament power is subject to procedural limitation, which is the entrenchment of restrictive legislative procedure. Section 6 of the Australia Act states that laws concerning the \\"constitution, power or procedure of the parliament\\" are invalid unless passed in the manner and form prescribed by the legislation made by the parliament.Attorney-General (NSW) v Trethowan [1931] HCA 3; (1931) 44 CLR 394 Belgium Over the last forty years or so, a change has been observed in Belgium in the relationships between the Judiciary and Parliament. \\"The dogma of absolute inviolability of the parliamentary assemblies has been breached. The parliamentary assemblies are now accountable not just to the electors but also to the courts. A first breach in the dogma of the inviolability of the assemblies was opened up by the Le Ski judgement of 27 May 1971, in which the Court of Cassation upheld the supremacy of the norm of self-executing international law. In 1980, Article 142 of the Constitution (former Article 107ter) established a Court of Arbitration in Belgium, nowadays the Constitutional Court, charged with hearing actions for annulment of laws. It would hand down its first judgement on 5 April 1985. (...) A second breach was opened in the dogma of inviolability of the assemblies in Belgium by the Constitutional Court, in its judgement no. 31/96 of 15 May 1996. The Council of State, the highest administrative Court in Belgium, had till then always declared that it had no jurisdiction to hear annulment applications against the administrative acts by the Houses of Parliament. The Constitutional Court, declaring that the absence of any possibility to apply for the annulment of such acts was contrary to the constitutional principles of equality and non-discrimination, opened up a new avenue for judicial review of Parliament‚Äôs acts: the laws of 25 May 1999 and of 15 May 2007, adopted in the wake of the Court‚Äôs judgement, extended the jurisdiction of the Supreme Administrative Court to the acts and Rules of Procedure of the legislative assemblies or their organs with regard to public procurement and personnel (...) Finally, concerning the decisions taken by the assemblies with regard to MPs or political groups, the civil courts have not hesitated to sanction them when subjective rights were at stake. MPs \\"enjoy the protection of their subjective rights by the law courts. This principle applies both for rights deriving from the law in the broad sense and for rights which have a regulatory basis\\" (Civ. Brussels, 21 April 1997).\\"N. IGOT, A. REZS√ñHAZY, M. VAN DER HULST, Parliament & Judiciary, ECPRD Seminar - Brussels, 8-9 Novembre 2007, p. 12-14. Canada Legislatures of Canadian provinces are sovereign within matters enumerated to them. British North America Act, 1867, Section 91 Provincial legislatures can make and modify their own codified constitutions by simple majority, as British Columbia did. Similarly, the federal Parliament is sovereign in all matters delegated to it, but most amendments to the federal Constitution may only be made with the consent of both Parliament and two-thirds of provinces containing 50% of the population (the 7/50 rule), or in some cases, unanimous consent of the provinces. In addition, although a law can be challenged and struck down by a court when found to be in violation of certain sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Parliament or provincial legislatures may invoke Section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the \\"notwithstanding clause\\") to allow the law to operate for up to five years, at which time it may either lapse or be renewed. Finland According to the constitution of Finland sovereign power lies with the people, represented by the parliament.http://web.eduskunta.fi/Resource.phx/parliament/relatedinformation/constitution.htx Constitution of England. Retrieved on 27 January 2009. As the highest organ of government the parliament holds supreme legislative power and can override a presidential veto and alter the constitution. There is no constitutional court and the supreme court does not have an explicit right to declare a law unconstitutional. By principle, the constitutionality of laws in Finland is verified by a simple vote in the parliament. However, the Constitutional Law Committee of the parliament reviews any doubtful bills and recommends changes, if needed. In practice, the Constitutional Law Committee fulfills the duties of a constitutional court. In addition to preview by the Constitutional Law Committee, all Finnish courts of law have the obligation to give precedence to the constitution when there is an obvious conflict between the Constitution and a regular law. The power to alter and amend the constitution is vested with the parliament, requiring approval either by a two-thirds vote in a single parliament if the proposed alteration is first declared to be urgent by a five-sixths vote of the same parliament, or by a slower procedure of first passing the amendment by a majority in the then current parliament and then passing the amendment by a two-thirds vote in the following parliament that convenes after a general election. A Finnish peculiarity is that the parliament can make exceptions to the constitution in ordinary laws that are enacted in the same procedure as constitutional amendments. An example of such a law is the State of Preparedness Act which gives the Council of State certain exceptional powers in cases of national emergency. As these powers, which correspond to U.S. executive orders, affect constitutional basic rights, the law was enacted in the same manner as a constitutional amendment. However, it can be repealed in the same manner as an ordinary law. Executive power is shared by the President of the Republic and the cabinet. The latter must rely on the confidence of parliament. From the independence of Finland in 1917 up to the constitutional reform of 1999, the president held considerable executive powers, and in particular was able to call a re-election of the parliament at will. In order to strengthen the role of the parliament as the highest organ of government, the constitutional reform constrained most of the presidential powers to be exercised only on the advice of the cabinet. India In India, parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the Constitution of India, which includes judicial review. In effect, this means that while the parliament has rights to amend the constitution, the modifications are subject to be valid under the framework of the constitution itself. For example, any amendments which pertain to the federal nature of the Constitution must be ratified by a majority of state legislatures also and the parliament alone cannot enact the change on its own. Further, all amendments to the constitution are also open to a Judicial Review. Thus, in spite of parliamentary privilege to amend the constitution, the constitution itself remains supreme.  Israel  The Knesset, the legislative branch of the Israeli government, has the power to enact and repeal all laws. It enjoys de jure parliamentary supremacy, and can pass any law by a simple majority, even one that might arguably conflict with a Basic Law of Israel, unless it has specific conditions for its modification. The Knesset can adopt and amend Basic Laws acting through its capacity as a Constituent Assembly. The Knesset also supervises government activities through its committees, elects the Prime Minister of Israel and approves the Cabinet of Israel, elects the President of Israel, and recommends the Comptroller of Israel. It also has the power to remove the President and State Comptroller from office, revoke the immunity of its members, and to dissolve itself and call new elections.  Italy  The sovereignty of Parliament in Italy is born from parliamentary privilege, but, in one of the most comprehensive and compelling \\"systemic\\" judgments, the Constitutional Court (rapporteur Carlo Mezzanotte) had opened the justiciability of ‚Äò'interna corporis'‚Äô. By the way, remnants of the old theories are expressed in autodichia, which involves subtracting the ordinary courts of all acts performed within the Chambers.I soldi di tutti e l‚Äôautodichia, 30 settembre 2012 It is also expressed by other constitutional organs and Regional Councils: professor Giuliano Amato complained \\"right of all meetings of constitutional status (Chambers and regional councils, therefore ) to self-manage everything related to their organization. And then, among other things, do their budget, allocate between the various items the money available, check how they are spent\\". The choice to set off some acts to the Presidents of the Parliament has been criticized as an attempt to exclude them from judicial review,Giampiero Buomomo, . even when pertaining to individual rights:Giampiero Buomomo, . this has given rise to some conflicts between the judiciary and Parliament,Giampiero Buonomo, Lo scudo di cartone, 2015, Rubbettino Editore, p 224 , . brought to the Constitutional Court,Giampiero Buomomo, . who gave useful elements to restrict the legal definition,Giampiero Buomomo, . compelling the legal doctrine through the modern evolution of the sovereignty of Parliament.Judgment no. 120/2014 \\"looks at Europe by addressing the legal doctrine to the modern evolution of the sovereignty of Parliament, in the era of rationalized parliamentarianism\\": New Zealand The concept of parliamentary sovereignty in New Zealand is derived from that in the United Kingdom: Some legal experts such as Robin Cooke in Taylor v New Zealand Poultry Board, [1984] have questioned how far parliamentary sovereignty goes.Taylor v. New Zealand Poultry Board [1984] 1 NZLR 394 at 398 per Cooke J; Sir Robin Cooke \\"Fundamentals\\" [1988] New Zealand Law Journal 158; Dame Sian Elias \\"Sovereignty in the 21st Century: Another Spin on the Merry-go-round\\" (2003) 14 Public Law Review 148; Sir Edmund Thomas \\"The Relationship of Parliament and the Courts\\" (2000) 5 Victoria University of Wellington Law Review 9; Philip Joseph \\"Parliament, the Courts, and the Collaborative Enterprise\\" (2004) 15 King's College Law Journal 321. There are several laws and conventions that limit the exercise of parliamentary sovereignty. For example, the maximum term of Parliament and some other matters relating to the electoral system may only be altered by a parliamentary supermajority or by a majority in a popular referendum. Norway The principle of separation of powers laid out by the constitution of 1814, was challenged i 1884 when a parliamentary majority led by the ( Liberal party (Venstre)) impeached the government appointed by the king. United Kingdom =History= Originally, legislative power was exercised by the Sovereign acting on the advice of the Curia regis, or Royal Council, in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament. In 1265, the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation. Membership of the so-called Model Parliament, established in 1295 under Edward I, eventually came to be divided into two branches: bishops, abbots, earls, and barons formed the House of Lords, while the two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough led the House of Commons. The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law. During Henry VI's reign, it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills, which would not become law unless the Sovereign's assent was obtained, as the Sovereign was, and still remains, the enactor of laws. Hence, all Acts include the clause \\"Be it enacted by the Queen's (King's) most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows...\\". The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the House of Lords were to be excluded from the process. During the 17th century in England, a notion developed that Parliament (made up of the House of Lords and House of Commons) shared in sovereignty with the King, based on an entirely erroneous notion of the history of Parliament.Pocock, J.G.A The Ancient Constitution and the Feudal Law Cambridge University Press (1987) pp234-235 It was not until the changing of the Coronation Oath in the Coronation Oath Act 1688 as part of the Glorious Revolution that Parliament was recognised as part of the constitutional structure, with laws being considered to emanate from Parliament and not just the King.Harris, Tim Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685‚Äì1720 Allen Lane (2006) p349 The Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689 were passed the following year which asserted certain rights of the parliaments of England (which at the time included Wales) and Scotland and limited the powers of the monarch. Furthermore, in 1698 Parliament created the Civil List, a financial arrangement that left the monarch reliant on Parliament for income. After 1689 English parliamentary supremacy became evident in the relation of the English parliament to those of Scotland and Ireland. The Act of Settlement 1701 made a presumption upon Scotland: the Scots retaliated with the Act of Security 1704, which was countered by the Alien Act 1705: the issue was settled by the Union of the parliaments of England and Scotland in 1707 which created a new British parliament, though \\"in essence it was just an extension of the English parliament\\".Harris, Tim Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685‚Äì1720 Allen Lane (2006) p498 However the truth of that comment historically, legally under the Treaty of Union as implemented by the Acts of Union of 1706/7, the English and Scottish Parliaments had given up their rights and sovereignty to the new, Union Parliament. Perhaps it is more correct to say that they had ‚Äúpooled‚Äù their sovereignty. It is arguable whether the concept of parliamentary supremacy arose from the Acts of Union 1707 or was a doctrine that evolved thereafter.Alder, John Constitutional and Administrative Law 7th edition Palgrave Macmillan (2009) p167 The autonomy of the Parliament of Ireland also came under attack and the Declaratory Act 1720 made the Irish parliament a dependency. The so-called Constitution of 1782 removed British parliamentary supremacy over Ireland for a short period but then the Irish parliament was merged with Britain's in the Acts of Union 1800. The doctrine of parliamentary supremacy may be summarized in three points: *Parliament can make laws concerning anything. *No Parliament can bind a future parliament (that is, it cannot pass a law that cannot be changed or reversed by a future Parliament). *A valid Act of Parliament cannot be questioned by the court. Parliament is the supreme lawmaker. Some scholars and judges have questioned the traditional view that Parliament cannot bind itself, arguing that it can impose procedural (or \\"manner and form\\") restrictions on itself, since the legislature must be constituted and regulated by legal rules.W. Ivor Jennings The Law and the Constitution (London: University of London Press, 1st ed., 1933); R.T.E. Latham The Law and the Commonwealth (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1949); Geoffrey Marshall, Constitutional Theory (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1971); Jackson v. Attorney General [2005] UKHL 56 at [81] per Lord Steyn; Harris v. Minister of the Interior 1952 (2) SA 428(A). The notion of parliamentary sovereignty began to be challenged with the Parliament Act 1911 which changed the nature of what was meant by parliament, as Dicey regretfully noted in the Introduction to the 8th edition of his Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution (1915), but that while the reality was now Cabinet and political party were supreme (pp lxxii‚Äìlxxiv), in law Parliament was still sovereign albeit that \\"the share of sovereignty\\" of the Commons had increased (p xlii). European law does not recognize the British concept of parliamentary supremacy.Alder, John Constitutional and Administrative Law 7th edition Palgrave Macmillan (2009) p173 The UK courts currently recognize the supremacy of EU law on those subjects where the EU can legislate.Berry, Elspeth and Hargreaves, Sylvia European Union law Oxford University Press 2nd edition (2007) p39 \\"The national courts are therefore obliged to give effect to those Treaty obligations, even if this means disapplying national law.\\"Turpin, Colin & Tomkins, Adam British government and the constitution: text and materials Cambridge University Press (2007) p 335 However, this supremacy derives from the European Communities Act 1972 and its successors. The European Union Act 2011 declared that EU law is directly applicable only through the European Communities Act or another act fulfilling the same role. Parliament legislated in 2018 to repeal the 1972 Act,European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 section 1 and in 2020 the United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU, demonstrating that the previous Parliament (of 1972) had not bound its successor. =England and the UK generally= Parliamentary supremacy is cited by contemporary American legal historians as the reason English law did not develop due process in the American sense.John V. Orth, Due Process of Law: A Brief History (Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas, 2003), 28‚Äì31. It is also argued to be integral to the way in which England's approach to rights and liberties evolved. The doctrine of parliamentary supremacy was demonstrated in, for example, the War Damage Act 1965. In English Law,Gordon, Michael. Parliamentary Sovereignty in the UK Constitution : Process, Politics and Democracy. Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2015. Discovery eBooks, EBSCOhost (accessed 27 November 2015). it was upheld in 2005 by Lord Bingham in the case of R (Jackson) v Attorney General: However, there is a distinction to be made between legal sovereignty and political sovereignty. Parliament is not politically sovereign, which means that if Parliament passes unpopular or oppressive legislation, then it may not be applied in practice; for example, the various civil servants who administer laws within government departments may be relied upon to use any loopholes and vague language which exists in a Bill to get around unwanted areas, and the judiciaryAllan, T.R.S. \\"The Rule of Law, Parliamentary Sovereignty, And A Ministerial Veto Over Judicial Decisions.\\" Cambridge Law Journal 74.3 (2015): 385-388. Index to Legal Periodicals and Books (H.W. Wilson). Web. 27 November 2015. is likely to purposefully interpret and create precedent for said laws in a similar manner. However this does not necessarily mean that Parliament is not legally sovereign. It is argued that nonetheless Parliament can legally pass any legislation it wishes. This point is made clearly by Lord Reid in Madzimbamuto v Lardner-Burke [1969] 1 AC 645: =Scotland and the Acts of Union= It is not necessarily the case that parliamentary sovereignty extends to changing the Act of Union at will.\\"I prefer to preserve my opinion on what the position would be if the United Kingdom Parliament passed an Act purporting to abolish the Court of Session or the Church of Scotland or to substitute English Law for the whole body of Scots Law.\\" It is self evidently logical that, given the Acts of Union of 1706/7 implemented an international treaty, which via those Acts, abolished the Parliaments of the constituent states of England and Scotland the new, Union, Parliament does not necessarily draw its fundamental rules from only one of the constituent states rather than the other. Equally, at least on a formal legal basis it is bound to abide by the rules under which it was created. That is not to say that it has always obeyed that rule. =Recent developments= In recent years some judges and scholars in Britain and New Zealand have questioned the traditional view that parliament is sovereign.Taylor v. New Zealand Poultry Board [1984] 1 NZLR 394 at 398 per Cooke J; Sir Robin Cooke \\"Fundamentals\\" [1988] New Zealand Law Journal 158; Lord Woolf \\"Droit Public ‚Äì English Style\\" [1995] Public Law 72; Sir John Laws \\"Law and Democracy\\" [1995] Public Law 72; Sir Stephen Sedley \\"The Constitution in the Twenty-First Century\\" in Lord Nolan and Sir Stephen Sedley (eds.)

Attorney General [2005] UKHL 56 at [102] per Lord Steyn, at [104] per Lord Hope of Craighead, at [159] per Baroness Hale of Richmond. Others, however, have rejected these arguments.Lord Bingham of Cornhill The Rule of Law (London, Allen Lane, 2010); Jeffrey Goldsworthy The Sovereignty of Parliament: History and Philosophy (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1999). Various constitutional changes in the United Kingdom have influenced the renewed debate about parliamentary sovereignty: # The devolution of power to devolved legislatures in Scotland (Scottish Parliament), Wales (Welsh Parliament) and Northern Ireland (Northern Ireland Assembly): All three bodies can pass primary legislation within the areas that have been devolved to them, but their powers nevertheless all stem from the UK Parliament and can be withdrawn unilaterally. The Northern Ireland Assembly, in particular, has been suspended multiple times due to political deadlocks. # The UK's membership of the European Communities, later the European Union, from 1973: The EU represents, as the European Court of Justice ruled in 1963 in the case Van Gend en Loos, a \\"new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the [Member] States have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields\\". The UK became part of that legal order, though as UK membership of the EU has been brought about through Acts of Parliament ‚Äì principally the European Communities Act 1972 ‚Äì Parliament could, as a matter of UK law, pass further legislation unilaterally withdrawing the UK from the Union, or selectively barring the application of European law within the UK. The European Union Act 2011 reaffirmed that sovereignty lay with the British Parliament, with section 18 stating: \\"Directly applicable or directly effective EU law (that is, the rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies and procedures referred to in section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972) falls to be recognized and available in law in the United Kingdom only by virtue of that Act or where it is required to be recognised and available in law by virtue of any other Act.\\"European Union Act 2011 The Act also requires that a referendum be held when more powers are transferred to the European Union (though this can be repealed with another Act of Parliament). Alternatively, as prescribed by the 2016 Brexit referendum, an Act to withdraw from the European Union could be passed in parallel with the withdrawal procedure laid down in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, whereby a Member State would notify the European Council of its intention to secede from the Union and a withdrawal agreement would be negotiated between the Union and the State. The Treaties would cease to be applicable to that State from the date of the agreement or, failing that, within two years of the notification. # Following the case of Thoburn v Sunderland City Council certain statutes are perceived to be protected as constitutional statutes. The case involved amendments to the Weights and Measures Act 1985 by the Weights and Measures Act 1985 (Metrication) (Amendment) Order 1994 pursuant to Directive 80/181/EEC. This stated that Imperial measurements could be displayed so long as the metric measurements were displayed in larger type beside them. Thoburn was convicted for only displaying Imperial measurements. In his defence he argued that allowing even limited use of Imperial measurements was inconsistent with the European directive and therefore in contravention of Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, and that the relevant section of the 1972 Act had therefore been implicitly repealed. However, the judgement by Lord Justice Laws held that certain statutes of constitutional importance, including Magna Carta and the European Communities Act 1972, could not be repealed by implied repeal. The case also introduces the concept of a 'hierarchy of acts', which is used in other European countries,European Commission website to English constitutional law. However, if Parliament did make its intention to overrule any statute express then any statute can be repealed, and so sovereignty is preserved. # The enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998 which incorporates part of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law. The Act gives UK courts the power to issue a declaration of incompatibility where they believe that the terms of an Act of Parliament are in contravention of the rights guaranteed by the Human Rights Act. The effect of the declaration is not to annul the contravening Act but to send a signal to Parliament which may then choose to amend the offending provision. This does not endanger Parliamentary sovereignty because Parliament may choose not to amend the offending provisions. As with the UK's membership of the European Union, the principle of parliamentary supremacy means that Parliament can at any time vote to repeal the Human Rights Act, and indeed the UK's ratification of the Convention itself. However, Parliament may theoretically withdraw from commitments it has made or repeal any of the constraints it has imposed on its ability to legislate.

The fort, which consists of a large stone rampart, occupies the promontory, which separates the Niwala Ganga (River) lagoon and the ocean. History 1735 Map of Fort Matara The Portuguese constructed the first fortifications in 1595, with the assistance of Don Juan Dharmapala, the ruler of the Kingdom of Kotte. In 1640 the Dutch captured Matara from the Portuguese, and in 1645 they were responsible for the construction of the current fortifications. The fort consists of a long, thick, high rampart and the gateway constructed from local limestone, granite and coral. The rampart originally had a ditch in front of it, two half bastion projections at each end and a larger projection in the centre close to the gate with a bridge across the ditch. It was built to protect the administrative buildings of VOC (Dutch East India Company), who were attracted by the deep and sheltered estuary of the Nilwala Ganga, making Matara an important centre for cinnamon and elephant trading. During the 'Matara Rebellion' of 1761, the fort was captured by Kirti Sri Rajasinha's Kandyan army that bombarded the town with cannonballs that went over the wall. After spiking their own cannon and destroying their ammunition and provisions, the garrison was evacuated by two ships that were waiting at sea. The Dutch recaptured the fort on 2 February 1762, finding eight cannon on the walls, including an English one. During the Dutch rule the District Secretary's house, the cinnamon, areca nut, gunpowder storage and an elephant kraal (containing four elephant stables, which could house up to 80 elephants and a tank where the elephants were washed) were constructed within the fort. The oldest building within the fort is the Dutch Reformatory Church, which is situated near the entrance. It was built by the Dutch in 1706 the date however etched above the entrance, 1767, refers to the reconstruction of the church by the Dutch following the Matara Rebellion. The door and window panels are made of heavy wood while the walls now show signs of crumbling as the proper mixture to rebuild them could not be found within Sri Lanka. Inside are gravestones on the floor dating back to 1686, of significant community members and beneficiaries of their time. On 24 February 1796 the Fort was handed over to the British by the Dutch. The southern bastion facing the sea was subsequently removed by the British, in order to grant access to the town along the ocean foreshore. During the British occupation, the Courts Complex (including the Magistrate Court and the High Court), Rest House and the Matara Police Station were constructed within the fort area. The majority of walawwas or mansions that belonged to Sri Lankan aristocratic families within the fort area are now utilised for other purposes, such as commercial offices, guesthouses and temples, while others have been let to fall into ruin.. In 1817 the British established a mission school, today the President's College. In 1883 the British built a high clock tower atop the remaining rampart. The rampart was declared a protected monument under the Antiquities Ordinance No 9 of 1940 section 33. The gate and walls of the main fort were restored in 1985-86 by a Dutch firm, Ballast Nedam. Matara fort is currently the administration centre for the entire Matara District, with the offices of the District Secretariat, Divisional Secretariat, Courts of Law and numerous other state offices.

C. (2006) New Comparative Government, Lotus Press, New Delhi, p. 167‚Äì169 An understanding of the constitution is obtained through reading commentary by the judiciary, government committees or legal experts. In such a constitutional system, all these elements may be (or may not be) recognized by courts, legislators and the bureaucracy as binding upon government and limiting its powers. Such a framework is sometimes imprecisely called an \\"unwritten constitution\\"; however, all the elements of an uncodified constitution are typically written down in a variety of official documents, though not codified in a single document. An uncodified constitution has the advantages of elasticity, adaptability and resilience. A significant disadvantage, however, is that controversies may arise due to different understandings of the usages and customs that form the fundamental provisions of the constitution. A new condition or situation of government may be resolved by precedent or passing legislation. Unlike a codified constitution, there are no special procedures for making a constitutional law and it will not be inherently superior to other legislation. A country with an uncodified constitution lacks a specific moment where the principles of its government were deliberately decided. Instead, these are allowed to evolve according to the political and social forces arising throughout its history.Prabir Kumar De (2011) Comparative Politics, Dorling Kindersley, p. 59 When viewed as a whole system, the difference between a codified and uncodified constitution is one of degree. Any codified constitution will be overlaid with supplementary legislation and customary practice after a period of time. Current states  The following states can be considered to have an uncodified constitution: *Canada: Although there are Constitution Acts,Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982, being The Constitution Act, 1867 (UK), 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3, and The Constitution Act, 1982, Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c. 11. important aspects of the constitutional system are uncodified. The preamble to the Constitution of Canada declares it to be \\"similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom\\" (which is uncodified.) This applies at the federal level and to the provinces,Ontario (Attorney General) v. OPSEU, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 2, 1987 CanLII 71 (SCC), Retrieved 2019-11-07. although each does have the power to modify or enact their own within their exclusive areas of responsibility. To date only British Columbia has enacted a codified provincial constitution (see Constitution of British Columbia), though the other provinces' roles and powers are spelled out in section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and through amendments to it dealing with particular provinces such as the Manitoba Act and the Newfoundland Act. See Constitution of Canada. *China: Some Chinese academics including legal theorist Jiang Shigong have argued that China has both a written constitution and an unwritten constitution based on the comprehensive leadership of the Communist Party. *Israel: the declaration of independence promised a constitution by 2 October 1948, but due to irreconcilable differences in the Knesset, no complete codified constitution has been written yet. There are several Basic Laws, however. See Constitution of Israel. *New Zealand: see Constitution of New Zealand. *San Marino: San Marino has several documents that make its constitution, including some lasting centuries. See Constitution of San Marino *Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia has no legally binding written constitution. In 1960, King Faisal declared the Quran to be the constitution. Although the Quran is the \\"Official Constitution of Saudi Arabia\\", the Qu'ran is in fact the religious text of Islam and not a bespoke constitution for a certain sovereign state. See Constitution of Saudi Arabia. However, in 1992, the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia was adopted by royal decree. *Sweden: there is no defining document that can be termed \\"the constitution\\". The Basic Laws of Sweden are the four fundamental laws of the Sweden that regulate the Swedish political system, acting in a similar manner to the constitutions of most countries. These are the Instrument of Government, the Freedom of the Press Act, the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and the Act of Succession. *United Kingdom: there is no defining document that can be termed \\"the constitution\\". Because the political system evolved over time, rather than being changed suddenly in an event such as a revolution, collapse of government or overthrow of monarchy, it is continuously being defined by acts of Parliament and decisions of the Law Courts (see Constitution of the United Kingdom). The closest the UK has come to a constitutional code has been the Treaty of Union 1707. Due to the United Kingdom having an uncodified constitution it has meant that many acts have been added to the collection of constitutional statutes, e.g. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Human Rights Act 1998. Former examples *The Constitution of the Roman Republic, made up of the Twelve Tables and other statutes. * Hungary had an uncodified constitution prior to 1949. * The Constitution of the Grand Principality of Finland was never codified. The Emperor of Russia, who also served from 1809 to 1917 as Grand Prince of Finland, never specifically recognized the Constitution as that of a separate and autonomous Finland, in spite of the fact that that Constitution largely dictated the relationship between Finland and the Russian Empire throughout the Russian era in Finland. By the late 19th century leading Finnish intellectuals‚Äîliberals and nationalists, and later, socialists as well‚Äîhad come to consider Finland as a constitutional state in its own right in a mere real union with Russia. This notion clashed with emerging Russian nationalism and with Russian calls for a unitary state for Slavs only, which eventually came into conflict with Finnish separatism and constitutionalism in the form of \\"russification policies\\", which restricted Finland's extensive autonomy from 1899 onwards, excluding a brief interruption between 1905 and 1908, all the way to the February Revolution in 1917. The Russian Provisional Government of 1917 eventually recognized the Finnish constitution, and after the October Revolution the Bolshevik government of the RSFSR recognized Finland's declaration of independence on New Year's Eve 1917. * The French Third Republic had an uncodified constitution. Several constitutional texts were adopted in the few years after the proclamation of the Republic in 1870 but in practice the institutions did not follow them, and the true organization of powers was made through custom. It remains as of 2020 the longest lasting French constitution since the Revolution of 1789. * The Constitution of Queensland before 2001 * Oman prior to 1996 * Libya between 1969 and 1975 * Thailand prior to 1932 had Dharma≈õƒÅstra of Manu as an uncodified constitution.

He is a Full Professor in the Department of Ecology at the Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, S√£o Paulo. Galetti's work has centered on the analysis of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of defaunation. He was awarded by WWF in 1998 and was a Tinker Fellow at Stanford University and a visiting professor at Aarhus Universitet, Denmark in 2017. Early life and education Galetti was born in Campinas, S√£o Paulo during the Military regime in Brazil. Grandson of a Portuguese immigrant from Madeira Island and son of Physics teacher, Galetti was always influenced by his brother Marcos Rodrigues and his uncle Pedro Manoel Galetti Jr. who are both biologists. He grew up in Campinas, S√£o Paulo until the age of 25 when he moved to University of Cambridge for earning the Doctor of Philosophy. Galetti is alumni member of Robinson College. During his childhood he studied in a suburban school until his parents moved him to Imaculada Cora√ß√£o de Maria a prestigious private school. He enrolled in the Biology course at Universidade Estadual de Campinas in 1986. Since his early days in the university he notice that most classes were uninteresting to him so he decided to spend most of his mornings in the forest fragment nearby Mata de Santa Genebra, Campinas, S√£o Paulo. There he start observing and studying howler monkeys, squirrels, and other fruit-eating animals. His first project was to follow a group of howler monkeys from dusk to dawn, but because howlers spend most of their time sleeping, he decided to also study other frugivores in the forest. In the University, he was inspired by his former professors and naturalists Ivan Sazima, Keith Brown, Wesley R. Silva and his former Master supervisor Leonor Patricia Cerdeira Morellato to study deep the interactions between fruits and frugivores in this forest. The small forest fragment near the university was his major laboratory where he spent most of his mornings watching birds and mammals eating fruits. In 1988, Galetti attended a talk by the Mexican ecologist Rodolfo Dirzo, who present for the first time his ideas about the impact of defaunation on plant communities. This talk influence him for the rest of his career. Galetti's enrolled in the Master program at Universidade Estadual de Campinas in 1990 and by August 1992 (after 18 months) he received a Master in Science diploma and move to Cambridge in September 1992. Career Galetti got his PhD at University of Cambridge in 1996. In Cambridge, Galetti's was supervised by the primatologist David J. Chivers. At this time Galetti met a young primatologist Carlos A. Peres who influence him to study keystone species instead of primates. He decide to test the concept of keystone species in tropical forests for the first time, comparing the abundance of fruit-eating birds and mammals in areas with dense population of palms Euterpe edulis with neighbor sites without palms. During the last year in Cambridge he spend a week in Seville with Pedro Jordano that changed his life. Jordano was a young scientist expert in frugivory and seed dispersal who took Galetti to Sierra de Cazorla and teach him about the Mediterranean ecosystems. Before coming back to Brazil, Galetti's moved to Barito Ulu project in Kalimantan, Indonesia. He was decided to spend a year studying for the first time seed dispersal by hornbills and sunbears, but after 3 months, a civil war irrupted in Indonesia and he decided to return to Brazil. He was one of the first ecologists to study toucans and hornbills in the wild. After four months in Borneo he move back to Brazil and became a Professor at Universidade Estadual Paulista in 1998.He was a Visiting Scientists at Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas in Seville in 2007 and Thinker Professor at Stanford University from 2008-2009 at Center for Latin American Studies. During his period in Stanford, he was associated with Professor Rodolfo Dirzo, the father of defaunation ideas. Galetti was the pioneer in publishing about rewilding, particularly after visiting Kruger National Park in South Africa. The realized that most of the Brazilian cerrado is a Pleistocene megafauna defaunated ecosystem. Galetti has written on ecology for a number of journals including Science, PLOS ONE and Biological Conservation and his contribution has been much debated by public media. Galetti has published more than 220 papers in was the Editor of Biological Conservation for Latin America In 2013, his paper was Highly Recommended by the Faculty of 1000. In 2019 he was considered one of the most influential scientists in the world Clarivate Analytics. Selected publications  Dirzo, R., H. S. Young, M. Galetti, G. Ceballos, N. J. B. Isaac, and B.

From 1892 to 1905, it was the most important game of the season for the two schools, which were the first major football powers in what was then considered the western United States. The rivalry ended after the 1939 season when the University of Chicago dropped out of the Big Ten Conference. The roots of the rivalry date back to 1879 when Michigan played its first intercollegiate football game in Chicago and to a series of matches played between Michigan and the \\"Chicago University Club\\" between 1888 and 1891. Background =1879: First football game in Chicago= 1879 team played the school's first intercollegiate game in Chicago. The University of Chicago was founded in 1890, but the roots of the Chicago‚ÄìMichigan football rivalry pre-date that university's founding. The University of Michigan was founded in 1817 and began its football program in the 1870s. Michigan's first intecollegiate game was played in Chicago on May 30, 1879. That first game, a 1‚Äì0 victory over the \\"Purple Stockings\\" from Racine College, was played at the Union Base-Ball Grounds in Lakefront Park (now part of Grant Park). The Chicago Daily Tribune called it \\"the first rugby-football game to be played west of the Alleghenies.\\" =1887: Thanksgiving Day game in Chicago= The Michigan football team next returned to Chicago in November 1887. On the way to Chicago, the Michigan team stopped in Indiana where they participated in the first match ever played by a Notre Dame football team. Michigan had planned on a Thanksgiving Day game against Northwestern, but the game could not be arranged. Instead, a match against the Harvard school team was played on a wet and muddy field at the grounds of the Wanderer Cricket Club (referred to in some reports as Wanderers' park) at 37th Street and Indiana Avenue. The game was called with Michigan leading 26 to 0. =1888: Chicago University Club 26, Michigan 4= Michigan's Horace Greely Prettyman was ejected for \\"slugging\\" in the 1888 and 1889 games at Chicago. In 1888, Michigan returned to Chicago for a Thanksgiving Day game against the Chicago University Club. The Chicago University Club team was a \\"picked team\\" selected from the best athletes in the West, many of whom had played college football for Yale, Princeton, Harvard, or Columbia. The New York Times wrote that \\"the preparatory schools and the universities had been drained for the best talent in sight.\\" Michigan lost by a 26 to 4 score in a game played at the Chicago Baseball Park and attended by 3,000 persons. The New York Times and Outing magazine both called it \\"undoubtedly the greatest football event that ever took place in the West.\\" Football was new to Chicago in 1888, and the Chicago Daily Tribune therefore published a lengthy summary of the game's rules, jargon, and methods on the day before the game. The Tribune described prize- fighting as \\"a mild sport\\" in comparison to football: \\"In a football game a player who gets possession of the ball may be attacked by anywhere from one to eleven men. . . . Slugging is not allowed, but 'tackling' is. A tackle, as described below, is a delightful and exciting point of play. . . . The man who is tackled, if game, will endeavor to hold the ball while the members of both teams will try to form a mountain on top of him.\\" The game attracted many representatives of Chicago's high society. The Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: \\"The finest turnouts of the city with the leaders of Chicago beauty decked in furs and favorite college colors swept into the grounds. Four-in-hands, tally- hos, tandem drags, English carts, mail phaetons, carriages and all sorts of fashionable vehicles were in the stream. Their occupants did not know much about football and did not entirely approve of the rough and gory sport, but came out in force to applaud for 'our boys.'\\" A bugle on a tally-ho belonging to Chicago quarterback Harry Hamlin announced the arrival of the Chicago team at the playing field. Early in the contest, Michigan's starting center Horace Greely Prettyman was ejected for \\"slugging\\" Chicago's center, Peters. The New York Times wrote: \\"Prettyman lost his temper and struck Peters in the mouth twice with his fist.\\" The Times called Prettyman \\"the backbone of the Michigan rush line\\" and noted that the team was disheartened after his ejection. The Chicago Daily Tribune emphasized the physical nature of the battle: \\"Not a man on either team had escaped blood. Noses were bleeding profusely, every man's lips were cut and swollen faces were plastered with mud, and lame joints and twitching backs were many.\\" The game drew extensive press coverage, and The Chronicle from Ann Arbor opined with respect to the game of football that \\"the fever may now be said to be upon us.\\" =1889: Chicago University Club 20, Michigan 0= Michigan returned to Chicago on Thanksgiving Day in 1889 and lost for the second consecutive year against the Chicago University Club, this time by a score of 20 to 0. The game was played in \\"a swirling snow storm\\" on \\"as treacherous a field as ever athletes worked upon.\\" For the second consecutive year, Michigan's Prettyman was ejected from the game, this time for slugging Chicago's quarterback, Gamble Rogers. =1891: Chicago University Club 20, Michigan 0= Michigan returned to Chicago on November 14, 1891, for its third game in four years against the Chicago University Club. The Chicago University Club was again a \\"picked team\\" made up of former stars from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and other schools. The Chicago team included W.J. Crawford, who led the undefeated national champion 1884 Yale team and was \\"the most famous halfback of his time, \\"Snake\\" Ames, who had set the college scoring record with 730 points and was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, Ben \\"Sport\\" Donnelly, the second professional player in football history, and William C. Malley, who had played for Michigan in his student years. The game was played at the South Side Baseball Grounds in Chicago. Although University of Michigan records reflect the score as a 10-0 loss for the Wolverines, contemporaneous press accounts report the score as 20 to 0. The Detroit Free Press reported: \\"After a hard fight, during which neither side scored until the second innings, the Chicago University team won the great foot ball match against the University of Michigan by 20 points to nothing. It was a gallant battle, the Michigan men contesting every inch gained by their opponents.\\" With a growing fan-base in Chicago, Michigan played a second game in that city at the end of the 1891 season. That game, a 10-0 loss to Cornell, was also played at the South Side Baseball Grounds. The New York Times called it \\"one of the prettiest foot-ball games ever played in the West\\" and described the wintry conditions of the game: \\"The field was covered with a six-inch blanket of snow, the air was icy, and frosted feet and hands were among the thousands of spectators ... Three minutes after the game began the ball was covered with ice, but the dazzling white ground soon began to look as though a herd of elephants had been tramping on it.\\" The rivalry at its peak: 1892 to 1905 =1892: Michigan 18, Chicago 10= In the fall of 1892, the University of Chicago fielded its first football team with Amos Alonzo Stagg serving as both head coach and starting right halfback. On November 13, 1892, the Chicago Maroons football team played its first game against Michigan. The game was played on a wet and muddy field in front of a crowd estimated by various accounts at between 700 and 1,500 spectators at Olympic Park in Toledo, Ohio. Michigan won the inaugural match by a score of 18 to 10. Right halfback George Jewett, the first African-American to play football for a Big Ten school, was the star for Michigan. Game accounts are imprecise, but Jewett was responsible for two Michigan touchdowns (one on a toss to Frank Decke) and possibly a third and also kicked for goals after touchdown. In January 1893, Ralph Stone (1868-1956), who later served as a Regent of the University of Michigan, expressed hope that a rivalry with Chicago might help overcome the \\"woeful\\" lack of loyalty to alma mater. He wrote: > \\"The apparent lack of patriotism among our alumni is largely due to the fact > that while in college there was little or no incentive to college spirit, > so-called, growing out of contests with other colleges. Michigan has always > been without a near-at-hand rival. Therefore, her alumni were born, brought > up, and graduated into the world without much of an opportunity to yell, > fight and bet upon her college base-ball team, foot-ball team, or crew. > Perhaps the University of Chicago, under the leadership of Stagg, may alter > matters in this respect in the near future. . . . The athletic competition > which is now awakening will rouse a more active display of their latent > enthusiasm, and it will do it without sacrificing the real and more serious > purpose of the University. While we deplore the excessive attention now paid > at times to athletics, we cannot deny that athletic prestige does much to > help a university in more substantial ways.\\" =1893: Chicago and Michigan each win a game= In 1893, Michigan and Chicago played twice. Stagg's Chicago Maroons won the first meeting on October 21, 1893, by a 10 to 6 score at the University of Chicago Athletic Grounds. Each team scored a touchdown and goal after touchdown to tie the score at 6-6 at halftime. Chicago scored a touchdown in the second half, but missed the goal from touchdown. As time was running out, Michigan moved the ball to the edge of the chalk line when the referee called time. Michigan returned to Chicago for a rematch on Thanksgiving Day. The Thanksgiving game was played at the University of Chicago's new Ellis Avenue grounds with a crowd of 3,500 in attendance, and Michigan won by a 28 to 10 score. Michigan took a 24-0 lead at halftime, and Chicago played better in the second half as snow blanketed the field, making it difficult for the \\"fat, chunky, little fellows\\" from Michigan to keep their footing. The Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: \\"The Ann Arbor men are mainly short and fat, weighing an average of 185 pounds, and their attack is like the rush of a battering ram. Several of the local men on the contrary are lightweights and their line looked feeble before the grim lads from Ann Arbor.\\" =1894: Michigan 6, Chicago 4= On November 29, 1894, the two teams again met on Thanksgiving Day, this time at Marshall Field in Chicago. Two hours before kickoff a \\"driving sleet storm\\" hit the city, and when the players lined up \\"the grounds were better fitted for skating rink purposes rather than a gridiron.\\" Despite the weather, a large crowd turned out to watch the game. According to a newspaper account, \\"the grand stand and outfield were packed with yelling collegians, and the boxes and carriage rooms were well filled with society people.\\" An account published in the Detroit Free Press described the atmosphere surrounding the game: > \\"Notwithstanding the threatening weather, fully 6,000 of Chicago's best and > fairest witnessed the hardest fought battle ever seen in Chicago. . . . The > east and south sides of the field were lined with tally-hos, landaus, etc. > Everyone wore the colors of one of the colleges. The yellow and blue of > Michigan was as prominently displayed as was the maroon of Chicago. Everyone > was out to yell for his respective team and from the noise it seemed as if > pandemonium had been turned loose.\\" Some accounts indicate that Michigan had been expected to \\"bury the Chicagos under a big score,\\" while others indicated that \\"the betting was even on the two teams.\\" Chicago scored the game's first touchdown on an end run by Nichols less than ten minutes into the game. However, Chicago missed the try for goal after touchdown. The first half ended with the score 4 to 0 in favor of Chicago. Michigan's Gustave Ferbert scored a touchdown late in the second half, and John A. Bloomingston kicked the goal after touchdown. Michigan won by a final score of 6 to 4. One newspaper account of the game stated that Chicago had outplayed Michigan for 67 minutes, \\"but in three minutes victory was wrested from Capt. Stagg's men and perched on the yellow and blue banner of the college from across the lake.\\" A controversy arose after the game as Michigan supporters charged that \\"Stagg had secured [Michigan]'s signals and made use of the knowledge, hoping to win by any means, however questionable.\\"The Michigan Alumnus, Vol. 1, December 1894, \\"Three Football Victories,\\" p. 47. In another account, the Detroit Free Press complained of biased officiating by the umpire, Phil Allen, who was a cousin of Chicago's captain. The large attendance solidified Chicago's status as Michigan's \\"natural rival,\\" and The Michigan Alumnus reported that \\"all parties hope to make this game the leading athletic event of the west, but above all to have the contest manly and free from criticism.\\"The Michigan Alumnus, Vol. 1, \\"The Chicago Alumni Association of the University of Michigan,\\" p. 58. =1895: Michigan 12, Chicago 0= In 1895, Michigan and Chicago again ended their football seasons with a Thanksgiving Day game, this one played in front of more than 6,000 spectators at Marshall Field in Chicago. Due to inclement weather, the field had to be \\"carefully scraped and sawdust scattered over the thin layer of ice\\" before the game began. Michigan's first scoring drive came in the first half when the right halfback, John Hollister, took the ball on Chicago's 45-yard line and ran around the right end for a 35-yard gain, a play the press called \\"a prettily-executed criss cross.\\" Later in the drive, Michigan's star Frederick W. Henninger fumbled the ball which rolled beyond the goal line where it was recovered by J. De Forest Richards for a Michigan touchdown. The running of Michigan's fullback John A. Bloomingston, a Chicago native, was reportedly the high point of the game. A Chicago newspaper described one run by Bloomingston as follows: > \\"Chicago could not gain, and Neel was forced to punt again. Bloomingston > received the ball, and, dodging the tacklers, who sought to bring him to the > ground, ran back the entire length of the kick. It was a splendid > performance, and no small part of the applause the hero received came from > Chicago throats.\\" The final score was 12‚Äì0. Michigan's dominance over Stagg's team led one Chicago newspaper to write the following: > \\"The Michigan team is the finest set of football players Ann Arbor has ever > sent out and completely out-classes any team in the West. ... The Michigan > play both individually and in team work was magnificent. Even the worried > Chicago substitutes and coaches on the side line could not refrain from an > occasional word of admiration at the perfect defense of the visitors. The > very appearance of the team was enough to bring applause from the most > prejudiced Chicago supporter. ... [T]he local team appeared like school-boys > before them. It seemed almost wonderful that these giants could be kept from > sweeping down the field and scoring as they willed.\\" Following the game The World of New York wrote that the Michigan players had \\"clinched their claim to the Western championship.\\" =1896: Indoor football= Amos Alonzo Stagg in 1899 In 1896, Michigan and Chicago met on Thanksgiving Day with the Western Conference championship on the line. Stagg's Chicago Maroons won the game, 7‚Äì6, in what was described as \\"one of the most desperately contested games ever played in Chicago.\\" The game featured \\"few trick plays,\\" as both teams relied on \\"straight, hard football.\\" Hazen Pingree, Jr. (whose father, Hazen S. Pingree, had been elected Governor of Michigan three weeks earlier) was the star of the game for Michigan. Chicago's scoring came on a blocked punt resulting in a safety and a drop kick (worth five points under the rules at the time) by Clarence Herschberger from the 45‚Äìyard line. The most unusual feature of the 1896 Michigan-Chicago game was that it was played indoors at the Chicago Coliseum and was \\"the first collegiate game of football played under a roof.\\" Adding to the novelty, as daylight turned to darkness, the field inside the Coliseum was lit with electric lighting. According to a newspaper account, the field grew dark in the second half, and play was halted for ten minutes to discuss whether play should continue. Play was resumed, and the lights were finally turned on after Michigan scored a touchdown. The crowd was stated in varying press accounts to be either 15,000, or 20,000. Noting that the game was played in the same building \\"in which five months ago W. J. Bryan was nominated for the presidency,\\" the press proclaimed the experiment in indoor football to be a success: > \\"One thing at least was settled by the game, and that is, that indoor > football is literally and figuratively speaking a howling success. The men > had no trouble in catching punts, and football was played on its merits, > without the handicaps of a wet field or a strong wind. Toward the end of the > second half it got very dark, and the spectators were treated to a novelty > in the shape of football by electric light.\\" Another newspaper described the novelty of indoor football as follows: > \\"Indoor football is an innovation, but it promises to become a permanency > for late games. While the other fields about Chicago were sloppy and the > players were floundering about in the seas of mud, the athletes in the > Coliseum played on dry surface and secure from the elements. A two-inch > layer of tan bark was placed over the hard earth, and there was no > inconvenience from dust. None of the punts touched the beams overhead and > spectators and players were captivated with the comfortable conditions under > which the game was played. Darkness came on at 4:00 and the players were > scarcely distinguishable for a time, but electric lights soon rendered each > play distinct.\\" =1897: Chicago 21, Michigan 12= 1897 souvenir program In 1897, the teams closed their season for the fifth straight year with a Thanksgiving Day game in Chicago. The game was played in front of a crowd of 12,000 spectators at the Chicago Coliseum. Chicago scored first on a 35-yard run by Gardner. Chicago's fullback, Clarence Herschberger, kicked the goal after touchdown to give the Maroons a 6 to 0 lead. Herschberger next added a drop kick field goal from the 17-yard line to increase Chicago's lead to 11 to 0 at the end of the first half. In the second half, Clayton Teetzel, playing at left end, scored a touchdown for Michigan on a 15-yard run through Chicago's left tackle and end. Teetzel added the goal after touchdown to make the score 11 to 6. Herschberger added two more field goals to increase Chicago's lead to 22 to 6. Michigan's scored a second touchdown when Michigan's fullback, Frederick Hannan, kicked the ball for Michigan from its own 25-yard line. The ball touched a Chicago player, and Michigan tackle, William F. Baker, grabbed the ball and ran 55 yards for a touchdown. Teetzel kicked the goal from touchdown resulting in a final score of 21 to 12. Although Michigan scored two touchdowns to Chicago's one touchdown, field goals were worth five points in 1897, and Herschberger's three field goals were worth 15 points. =1898: Birth of \\"The Victors\\"= Louis Elbel composed Michigan's fight song \\"The Victors\\" (original sheet music pictured) as a tribute to Michigan's 1898 victory over Chicago. Illustration of Widman's run The 1898 Michigan-Chicago game proved to be one of the most significant in the history of the rivalry. Michigan concluded its undefeated season on Thanksgiving Day with a 12‚Äì11 victory over the Maroons at Marshall Field. The game was played for the championship of the Western Conference. In order to accommodate the crowd of Michigan fans traveling to Chicago for the game, the Michigan Central Railroad arranged for two special trains to run from Ann Arbor to Chicago at a round trip price of five dollars. The special excursion tickets allowed fans to spend the weekend in Chicago and return on Monday. A crowd of 12,000 spectators attended the game. The New York Times wrote: \\"The day and the grounds were ideal for football. The thermometer was lingering around the freezing mark, but the sky was cloudless, and the northwest wind was too light to interfere with the placing of punts.\\" The Chicago team was favored and was reported to be \\"the heaviest that ever represented a college, the average weight of the men being over 190 pounds.\\" Michigan's first score came after 25 minutes of play on a run by Charles Widman from the five-yard line. Widman was shoved over the goal line for a touchdown, and Neil Snow kicked the extra point to give Michigan a 6 to 0 lead. Later in the half, Chicago drove the ball to Michigan's 30-yard-line, and the Maroons' All-American Clarence Herschberger kicked a field goal from placement to cut Michigan's lead to 6 to 5. (Field goals were counted as five points.) Early in the second half, Michigan scored its second touchdown and converted the extra point to take a 12‚Äì5 lead. Widman ran 65 yards for the touchdown on a \\"delayed pass\\" on the most exciting play of the game. The Chicago Daily Tribune described Widman's run: > \\"Widman scurried out of the back of the mass of players with the ball under > his arm and down the field with nothing in sight ahead of him except the > goal posts. All the fast men of the Chicago team went in fast pursuit. It > was a beautiful race down the field. Three Chicago men were close behind. > But the blue-legged runner gained almost imperceptibly at times, and then > barely held his own. He could run as fast as his pursuers, and with his > start was safe. If one or two of those Chicago players had made a dive for > him perhaps he might have been stopped. One of them did try up near the > goal, but missed him, tripping him slightly, but he rolled over the line. > Michigan had another touchdown and the game, and the Western championship in > its pocket.\\" Widman described the run after the game as follows: > \\"The play was a revolving wedge on Chicago's left tackle. Their end and > tackle had been drawn in by our men, and when the ball was given to me on a > delayed pass I had a clear field, except for Chicago's backs. I ran as fast > as I could diagonally across the field, realizing that I was hotly pursued. > At last I was tackled on what I afterwards learned was about the six-yard > line. I was slightly dazed by the fall, but saw a goal post ahead of me and > managed to crawl over the line. I did not know I had made a touchdown, > however, until Captain Bennett told me.\\" Snow added his second extra point kick to give Michigan a 12‚Äì5 lead. Chicago responded with a touchdown run by its left guard, Burnett, and the extra point reduced Michigan's lead to a single point. Michigan forced Chicago to punt on its final possession, and the Wolverines became champions of the Western Conference for the first time in the school's history. One newspaper noted: \\"Michigan, with the exception of one or two double passes, relied almost altogether on straight football, line bucking and runs around the end. Chicago, on the contrary, used trick plays throughout but the team work was of a high order, as shown by both teams.\\" After the game, Michigan's team captain, J.W.F. Bennett, told reporters: \\"Widman's sensational run was the feature of the game, but every player deserves the victory. We must thank Keene Fitzpatrick for our splendid condition.\\" Chicago coach Amos Alonzo Stagg said: \\"It was perhaps the finest game of football ever played in the West. It certainly was spectacular and full of features.\\" During the 1898 game, 1,000 students gathered at the Athens Theater in Ann Arbor where they listened to a play-by-play account of the game as it was transmitted by telegraph from Chicago. Michigan gains were met with cheering. When Widman's touchdown run was announced, \\"It seemed as if the whole assembly was thrown into the air by a volcanic eruption. Men threw their hats and coats at one another and hugged and danced in the aisles for fully ten minutes.\\" After the game, the crowd marched through the streets to President James B. Angell's home. President Angell greeted the crowd with a broad smile and said, \\"I congratulate you on the success of the Michigan team in Chicago this afternoon. It is a great victory, and we owe much to the men who have won the laurels of our victory from the brow of our sister institution of learning. It has been said that I am opposed to the game, but I wish to say that I, too, used to play in college. In those days, however, we played the Herschberger game, and used to kick the ball instead of the man. It is a great termination of the fall campaign, and we are greatly indebted to those who have so actively participated in it.\\" In Chicago, more than 1,000 Michigan fans paraded in a line through the University of Chicago campus behind the Michigan band singing Michigan songs and cheers. The parade ended at the Hotel Del Prado, where several Michigan players and alumni delivered speeches. On the Monday evening following the victory in Chicago, the team was welcomed back to Ann Arbor with a \\"rousing celebration.\\" More than 2,000 students gathered around a huge bonfire, singing and cheering \\"until nearly midnight.\\" It was reported that the Michigan students turned out with more enthusiasm than had been shown in Ann Arbor since the 1895 football team returned from a game against Harvard.The 1895 football team lost to Harvard, but the close score, 4 to 0, was viewed as proof that Michigan could play with the eastern powers that dominated college football in its early years. After watching Michigan's 12‚Äì11 victory over Chicago in 1898, Louis Elbel, who was at the time a student in the University of Michigan School of Music, was inspired to write \\"The Victors,\\" which was later adopted as Michigan's fight song. He reportedly began composing the song at his sister's house in the Englewood section of Chicago and continued the effort on the return train ride from Chicago to Ann Arbor. Elbel's lyric, \\"Champions of the West,\\" refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship for the first time in the school's history. Elbel later recalled: > \\"We were crazed with joy. We paraded in the dark. We yelled and followed our > U-M Band, singing to the tune of 'Hot Time in the Old Town.' It struck me > quite suddenly that such an epic should be dignified by something more > elevating, for this was not ordinary victory. My spirits were so uplifted > that I was clear off the earth, and that is when 'The Victors' was inspired. > I put in a lot of 'hails' and I knew the fellows would get them in with the > proper emphasis. Through them, the title suggested itself, and I dedicated > it to the Michigan team of 1898.\\" =1900: Chicago 15, Michigan 6= 1900 game program After a one-year break in the rivalry, Michigan and Chicago played their traditional Thanksgiving Day game at Stagg Field in Chicago on November 29, 1900. Michigan scored first, recovering a fumble well into Chicago's territory and scoring on a run by tackle Hugh White. Chicago fullback Ernest Perkins responded with three touchdowns, and the Maroons won by a score of 15 to 6. With Michigan leading 6 to 5 at the half, the most unusual moment of the 1900 game came during the intermission when 30 candidates for Chicago's \\"Three-Quarter\\" club gathered on the field to sacrifice a yearling rooster named Iphigenia. A Michigan player tried unsuccessfully to rescue the rooster. The rooster was killed, and its blood was spread on the field as the candidates danced. Chicago scored two touchdowns after the ceremony, and the Chicago Daily Tribune speculated that \\"the chicken's ghost was playing with the maroons.\\" =1901: Michigan 22, Chicago 0= Fielding H. Yost compiled a 22‚Äì0 record in his first two years as Michigan's coach. In 1901, Fielding H. Yost took over as Michigan's head coach. The Wolverines finished the season undefeated with an 11‚Äì0 record, outscored their opponents by the unprecedented total of 550 to 0, and became known as the first of Yost's famed \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams. Stagg's Chicago Maroons were able to slow, but not stop, Michigan's point-a-minute offense. Michigan won by a 22 to 0 score as the game was played for the first time on Michigan's home field in Ann Arbor. Yost noted, \\"I knew long before I came to Michigan of the great rivalry existing between this University and the University of Chicago. It was my desire to win this game above all others.\\" The game was played at Regents Field in front of one of the largest crowds that ever attended a game up to that time in Ann Arbor. Michigan left tackle Hugh White scored two touchdowns, and fullback Neil Snow and right tackle Bruce Shorts each scored one touchdown. Michigan's defense held the Chicago offense to two first downs, and Chicago only once had possession of the ball in Michigan territory. Despite the win, Coach Yost was disappointed with the low point total accumulated by his team and publicly stated that \\"we would have scored many more points on Chicago if the field had been dry.\\" Yost described the impact of the weather on his team as follows: \\"Much to our disappointment the game was played on a muddy field in a snowstorm, and the work of our backs was seriously handicapped. The Chicago team was not to the same extent handicapped by reason of the fact that it did not rely upon speed to advance the ball. ... End-running was impossible, and we were compelled to make our gains by line-bucking which is a slow process ...\\" =1902: Michigan 21, Chicago 0= In 1902, Yost's second \\"Point-a-Minute\\" team finished the season undefeated with an 11-0 record and outscored their opponents by a combined score of 644 to 12. In the second meeting between the two legendary coaches, Stagg and Yost, Michigan won, 21‚Äì0 in front of a crowd of 14,000 at Chicago's Marshall Field. The game began at 2:15 p.m. Before the game started, the Michigan fans in attendance released toy red balloons marked \\"Chicago\\" into the \\"somewhat murky and frosty atmosphere.\\" One Michigan fan, described as \\"a long-haired collegian wearing a yellow and blue streamer, told a reporter, \\"That is the way we will toss Chicago up in the air.\\" Everett Sweeley gave Michigan a 5‚Äì0 lead with a field goal from a difficult angle at the 25-yard line. Later in the first half, Heston took the ball on a delayed pass and ran 71 yards for a touchdown. Michigan led 10‚Äì0 at halftime. In the second half, Sweeley extended Michigan's lead to 15-0 with a field goal from the 17-yard line. With approximately 10 minutes remaining in the game, left tackle William Palmer ran for a touchdown, and Sweeley converted the goal from touchdown to give Michigan its final total of 21 points. Despite the successive defeats, Stagg was credited with developing a \\"magnificent defense to hold Yost's 'hurry up' offense to 21 points in 70 minutes of play.\\" =1903: Michigan 28, Chicago 0= The 1903 Chicago-Michigan game was another of the most historic games in the series. Yost's third \\"Point-a-Minute\\" team compiled an 11‚Äì0-1 record and outscored opponents 565 to 6. In the third meeting between Yost and Stagg, Yost won again by a 28 to 0 score. The New York Times reported that the game was attended by a record-setting crowd: \\"All records for attendance were broken, fully 20,000 enthusiastic spectators braving a heavy snowfall to see the game.\\" Another account placed the attendance at 15,000. The Michigan Alumnus noted that Michigan men regarded Chicago as \\"their dearest rival,\\" and the Thanksgiving Day game at Marshall Field marked the culmination of the season. A blizzard threatened cancellation of the game, but the snow stopped suddenly and the wind died down in the early afternoon. The game was commenced at 2:00 pm after seven or eight inches of snow were cleared from the field. Stagg's 1903 team featured three future College Football Hall of Fame inductees: Walter Eckersall at quarterback, Hugo Bezdek at right halfback, and Tiny Maxwell at right tackle. All-American Frederick A. Speik also played at left end for the 1903 Maroons. The two teams were expected to be evenly matched, but the game, played on a snowy and slippery field, proved to be one-sided. Chicago was handicapped by the illness of Coach Stagg who directed the game from a closed carriage where he lay \\"bundled up in blankets.\\" Michigan scored on every drive in the first half, save one, and Chicago made only one first down in the first half. Eckersall's defensive play was praised in accounts of the game, though, on one play, Willie Heston eluded Eckersall \\"by a well-timed hurdle\\" for a 20-yard gain. Heston scored two touchdowns, but Tom Hammond was the leading scorer with 13 points on two field goals (five points each) and three point after touchdown kicks. The game was played in halves of 35 and 20 minutes, with the second half being cut short to avoid playing after darkness had fallen. Walter Camp attended the game, watching from the sidelines. Camp offered the following comments: > \\"The helping of the men on the Michigan team was high-grade football. Their > work at helping the man with the ball was as good as that displayed in any > game I have seen this season. This is the first western game I have > witnessed this year. I was particularly impressed with the work of Heston as > a halfback.\\" The Chicago Daily Tribune opened its game coverage, \\"The premature blizzard which descended on Chicago yesterday made it anything but an ideal football day, but that driving snow storm was gentleness itself compared to what was in store for Chicago's two football elevens.\\" The Detroit Free Press called it \\"the most severe drubbing ever administered to the Maroons in the history of football of that institution.\\" Noted sports writer Joe S. Jackson wrote: \\"Chicago was not beaten ‚Äì it was run over, buffeted about, almost made the sport of its opponents at times . . .\\" The Michigan team was the guest of the Studebaker Theatre the evening after the game. At a post-season dinner, Fielding Yost said that he regarded Michigan's play in the Chicago game to be \\"the best he had ever seen by a Michigan team during his three years here.\\" Michigan's captain, Curtis Redden, opined that the spectators saw \\"the finest exhibition of speed and team work ever seen in the West.\\"1904 Michiganensian, p. 139. =1904: Michigan 22, Chicago 12= In 1904, Yost led his fourth \\"Point-a-Minute\\" team to a perfect 10‚Äì0 record, outscoring opponents 567 to 22. Michigan concluded its undefeated season with a 22‚Äì12 win over Chicago on November 12. The game, played in 35-minute halves, featured several College Football Hall of Fame inductees, including Walter Eckersall and Hugo Bezdek for Chicago and Willie Heston and Germany Schulz for Michigan. Heston, Eckersall and Bezdek each scored single touchdowns, but the lead scorer was Michigan's Tom Hammond with 17 points on three touchdowns and two extra points. =1905: Chicago 2, Michigan 0= 1905 College Football Western Championship match between Michigan and Chicago Chicago won the 1905 meeting of the rivals by a score of 2 to 0. The game, dubbed \\"The First Greatest Game of the Century,\\" broke Michigan's 56-game unbeaten streak and marked the end of the \\"Point-a-Minute\\" years. The 1905 Michigan team had outscored opponents 495 to 0 in its first 12 games. The game was lost in the final ten minutes of play when Denny Clark was tackled for a safety as he attempted to return a punt from behind the goal line. Newspapers described Clark's play as \\"the wretched blunder\\" and a \\"lapse of brain work.\\" Clark transferred to M.I.T. the following year and was haunted by the play for the rest of his life. In 1932, he shot himself, leaving a suicide note that reportedly expressed hope that his \\"final play\\" would atone for his error at Marshall Field in 1905. After the 1905 game, the teams did not meet again until 1918. The rivalry renewed: 1918 to 1920 =1918: Michigan 13, Chicago 0= After a 12-year hiatus resulting from Michigan's withdrawal from the Western Conference, the rivalry resumed on November 9, 1918, at Stagg Field in Chicago. The Michigan team was reported to be determined to avenge the 1905 team's 2‚Äì0 loss to the Maroons. The game was played as negotiations were underway to end World War I, and the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: \\"While the nations of the world are hoping for an armistice, the resumption of hostilities between forces guided by Gens. Yost and Stagg brought joy to thousands of football fans, and the opening battle attracted approximately 7,000 of them.\\" Michigan won the 1918 game by a 13-0 score. =1919: Chicago 13, Michigan 0= The rivalry returned again to Stagg Field in November 1919. Noting that the 1918 game had matched Student Army Training Corps (S.A.T.C.) squads, the Chicago Daily Tribune billed the 1919 game as \\"the first renewal of [the] traditional gridiron rivalry\\" between the two universities. Every seat at Stagg Field was sold out as 25,000 spectators crammed into the stadium. Chicago won the 1919 game by a 13 to 0 score. After the game, Michigan coach Yost congratulated his old rival Stagg and said: \\"Your team played perfect football, making no mistakes, and the score represents the relative merits of the two teams.\\" =1920: Michigan 14, Chicago 0= On November 13, 1920, Michigan and Chicago played at Ferry Field in Ann Arbor, with Michigan winning by a 14 to 0 score. A crowd of 32,000 was present, \\"jamming every inch of space.\\" Halfback Eddie Usher scored both of Michigan's touchdowns. The punting of Frank Steketee was another feature of the game. One of his long punts was mishandled by Chicago's Fritz Crisler, who would later become Michigan's head coach. A \\"freak hop\\" caused the ball to bounce off Crisler, who was Chicago's quarterback in the game, and Michigan linemen piled on the ball at Chicago's nine-yard line. Crisler also made a \\"leaping interception\\" to prevent a Michigan touchdown on an earlier drive. In his first game at the quarterback position, the Chicago Daily Tribune credited Crisler with running the team well. Later years:1927 to 1939 =1927: Michigan 14, Chicago 0= After a six-year hiatus, Michigan and Chicago resumed their rivalry in 1927. Although the game was only the fourth meeting between the old rivals since 1905, the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote that past matches between Stagg's Maroons and Yost's Wolverines \\"have been high points in football history,\\" and noted that the renewal of \\"the ancient rivalry\\" meant \\"everything\\" to the \\"old-timers\\" in Ann Arbor and Chicago. The game was played at Stagg Field in Chicago, before a record-breaking crowd of 60,000 spectators, and ended in a 14-0 victory for Michigan. New bleachers were built at the east end of Stagg Field to accommodate interest in the game, which drew many distinguished spectators. The Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: \\"Probably no game in Chicago has drawn a more distinguished crowd.\\" =1930: Michigan 16, Chicago 0= After another two-year hiatus in 1928 and 1929, Michigan and Chicago renewed their rivalry in the final game of the 1930 season at Michigan Stadium. Stagg remained as the head coach at Chicago, and Harry Kipke was in his second year as Michigan's head coach. Michigan won the game by a score of 16 to 0. Michigan's fullback Roy Hudson scored two touchdowns in the game, and Stanley Hozer added an extra point and a field goal. In the third quarter, the Michigan captain, James Simrall, threw a touchdown pass to Hudson from mid- field. =1931: Michigan 13, Chicago 7= By 1931, Amos Alonzo Stagg was 69 years old and had been the head coach at Chicago since 1892. In October 1931, the Maroons lost to the Wolverines by a 13-7 score in Ann Arbor, but the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote that Stagg \\"can go back to the Midway feeling right proud of his boys.\\" Having been an underdog by a much larger margin, the Tribune called it a \\"moral victory\\" that Chicago scored a touchdown, something the team had failed to do in four meetings with Michigan since 1920. =1932: Michigan 12, Chicago 0= Michigan played its final home game of the 1932 season against the University of Chicago. Michigan won, 12‚Äì0. The game was played in the snow and with a cold wind blowing at Michigan Stadium. Michigan's first touchdown came in the second quarter on a 70-yard punt return down the middle of the field by Harry Newman. The second touchdown was also scored by Newman, this time in the last minute of the game on a 28-yard run off a fake pass play. The game was the last by Chicago head coach Amos Alonzo Stagg against Michigan. In a pre-game ceremony, members of the 1905 Michigan Wolverines football team presented Stagg with a silver pitcher and ten silver glasses.1933 Michiganensian, Chicago game summary, p. 118. =1933: Michigan 28, Chicago 0= Herman Everhardus runs for a touchdown against Chicago in 1933. Michigan and Chicago played in Chicago on October 28, 1933. The game attracted many Michigan fans, drawn by the lure of the 1933 World's Fair (called the Century of Progress) being held in Chicago. Michigan's backup center, Gerald Ford, expressed a desire to attend the fair while in Chicago. Days before the Chicago trip, the future U.S. President wrote to a friend joking that he may not have time to see Sally Rand, a famous fan dancer performing at the fair. After returning from Chicago, Ford wrote to the same friend: \\"Had a swell time in Chicago and didn't see Sally Rand either. Saw all of the fair in 25 minutes, at least all I wanted to see.\\" Chicago's 1933 football team was led by a new head coach, Clark Shaughnessy, and by Jay Berwanger, who won the first Heisman Trophy two years later. Although the 1933 Maroons were reputed to be \\"the best Chicago team in years,\\" Michigan won, 28‚Äì0, the largest margin of victory recorded up to that time by Michigan against a Chicago team. On defense, Michigan allowed Chicago to cross the 50-yard line only twice, and one of those instances resulted from a Michigan fumble at its own 39-yard line. =1934: Chicago 27, Michigan 0= During the 1934 season, the Chicago Maroons were revived with by the play of their star halfback, Jay Berwanger. Michigan, on the other hand, experienced the worst season in its history, failing to win a single game in the Big Ten and scoring only 21 points in the entire season. The two teams met at Stagg Field in Chicago on October 13, 1934, and the Maroons routed the Wolverines 27 to 0 before a crowd of 25,000 spectators. The game marked the largest margin of victory for the Maroons in the long history of the Chicago‚ÄìMichigan football rivalry. Berwanger scored two touchdowns, including a 43-yard scoring run. The Chicago Daily Tribune called the game a \\"sweet victory\\" for the \\"long oppressed\\" Maroons who had been \\"starved and bullied these many moons by unsympathetic neighbors in the Big Ten.\\" =1937: Michigan 13, Chicago 12= After a two-year hiatus in 1935 and 1936, the Chicago‚ÄìMichigan series was renewed in 1937. On November 6, 1937, Chicago lost to Michigan by a 13-12 score in Ann Arbor. The game began as a one-sided contest in favor of Chicago. With four minutes remaining in the final quarter, Chicago led by a score of 12 to 0, and it \\"indeed looked like a big night on the Midway in Chicago just as soon as their special train could carry the Maroons back there.\\" Late in the game, a poor punt gave Michigan the ball at Chicago's 41-yard line. On the next play, Michigan halfback ran 41 yards for a touchdown, and an extra point brought Michigan back to within five points. On Chicago's ensuing drive, Davenport fumbled, and Smick of Michigan recovered the ball at Chicago's 21-yard line. Ritchie scored again this time from the six-yard line. Ritchie's second touchdown gave the Wolverines a 13-12 lead that held in the final seconds. =1938: Michigan 45, Chicago 7= In 1938, the Michigan football team experienced a renaissance under it new head coach Fritz Crisler. It was the most points scored by a Michigan team since 1926. Chicago's lone touchdown came on a long pass from Lew Hamity to Big Ten sprint champion John Davenport who caught the ball in stride at Michigan's 45-yard line and ran the remaining distance for the score. Michigan sophomore Tom Harmon ran 54 yards for a touchdown on the third play of the third quarter. =1939: Michigan 85, Chicago 0= By 1939, Chicago's glory days in football were in its past. On October 21, 1939, the Maroons lost to the Wolverines by a score of 85 to 0. With the first string playing only 20 minutes, Michigan registered 461 yards of net offense, scored 55 points in the first half, and intercepted three Chicago passes. Tom Harmon scored three touchdowns, including a 56-yard run for his first score of the game.

His parents died when he was still a child, and he was raised by an uncle, with whom he lived until he was 21 years of age, receiving only a limited education. In the fall of 1838, he struck out for the frontier, traveling mostly on foot. He eventually arrived in the Town of Geneva in the Wisconsin Territory on October 15 of that year, and immediately found work on local farms, in a store and in a gristmill. By March 1839, he was able to buy land in the nearby Town of Hudson, which plot he would retain for the rest of his life. He was soon elected to his first local offices, with the 1840 elections of the Town of Geneva, when he was elected as tax collector and constable. In the spring of 1842, having been moved by a series of revival meetings during the previous winter, he joined the Presbyterian Church in Geneva. On February 12, 1843, he married Lydia Ferris. On their first anniversary, they moved to his land in Hudson, where they would live for most of the next three decades. They continued to improve the original land and expanded their holdings over the years, and Hill pursued private studies to supplement his limited formal education.  Public office  Hill held numerous offices in the Town of Hudson during his time their, including chairing the township's board of supervisors. He would be elected repeatedly to the county board of supervisors at times from 1849 to 1867, including one year (1865) as the board's chairman; and as one of the county's Superintendents of the Poor. His first term in the Assembly was for the sixth (1853) session of the state legislature, succeeding in representing the 2nd Walworth County district (the Towns of Elkhorn, Geneva and Hudson). He was assigned to the standing committee on claims.Manual for the use of the assembly, of the state of Wisconsin, for the year 1853 Madison: Brown and Carpenter, Printers, 1853; pp. 71, 84, 99*, 109 He was succeeded in the next term by Simeon Spafard, a Democrat.

Based on Rudyard Kipling's eponymous collective works and inspired by Walt Disney's 1967 animated film of the same name, The Jungle Book is a live-action/CGI film that tells the story of Mowgli, an orphaned human boy who, guided by his animal guardians, sets out on a journey of self-discovery while evading the threatening Shere Khan. The film introduces Neel Sethi as Mowgli, along with voice and motion capture performances from Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Lupita Nyong'o, Scarlett Johansson, Giancarlo Esposito, and Christopher Walken. Favreau, Marks, and producer Brigham Taylor developed the film's story as a balance between Disney's animated adaptation and Kipling's original works, borrowing elements from both into the film. Principal photography commenced in 2014, with filming taking place entirely in Los Angeles. The film required extensive use of computer-generated imagery to portray the animals and settings. The Jungle Book was released in the United States in Disney Digital 3D, RealD 3D, IMAX 3D, D-Box, and premium large formats, on April 15, 2016. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing over $966 million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2016. The film received praise for its visual effects, vocal performances, direction, musical score, and its faithfulness to the spirit of the original animated film and the Kipling novel. It won accolades for achievements in visual effects at the 89th Academy Awards, 22nd Critics' Choice Awards and 70th British Academy Film Awards. A sequel is in development, with Favreau and Marks set to return as director/producer and writer, respectively. Plot In the jungles of India, Mowgli is a \\"man-cub\\" raised by the Indian wolf Raksha and her pack, led by Akela, in an Indian jungle ever since he was brought to them as an infant by the black panther Bagheera. Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves, but the boy faces certain challenges and falls behind his wolf siblings, while Akela objects to him using human \\"tricks\\", like building tools, instead of learning the ways of the pack. One day, during the dry season, the jungle animals gather to drink the water that remains as part of a truce during a drought that enables the jungle's wildlife to drink without fear of their predators. The truce is disrupted when a fire-scarred and vicious Bengal tiger named Shere Khan arrives, detecting Mowgli's scent in the crowd. Consumed by a vendetta against humans for scarring him with fire, he threatens to kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the drought ends, the wolves debate whether or not they should keep Mowgli. Mowgli decides to leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera volunteers to guide him to the nearby \\"man- village\\". En route, Shere Khan ambushes them, but Mowgli manages to escape amidst a wild water buffalo stampede. Later, Mowgli meets an enormous reticulated python named Kaa, who hypnotizes him. While under her influence, Mowgli sees a vision of his father being killed by Shere Khan while protecting him. Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but she is attacked by a himalayan brown bear named Baloo who rescues the unconscious Mowgli. Mowgli later awakens and retrieves some difficult-to-access honey for Baloo as repayment, with the two bonding in the process. Mowgli agrees to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Meanwhile, upon learning that Mowgli has left the jungle, Shere Khan kills Akela and threatens the pack to lure Mowgli out. Bagheera eventually finds Mowgli and Baloo and is shocked that Mowgli has not joined the humans as he had agreed, but Baloo calms him down and persuades both of them to sleep on it. During the night, Mowgli finds a herd of Indian elephants gathered around a ditch and uses vines to save their baby. Although Baloo and Bagheera are impressed, Baloo realizes that he cannot guarantee Mowgli's safety after learning that he is being hunted by Shere Khan. Baloo agrees to push Mowgli away to get him to continue onward to the man village. Mowgli is kidnapped by a gang of monkeys (namely lion-tailed macaques, northern pig- tailed macaques, langurs (Northern plains gray langurs, Gee's golden langurs, and Nilgiri langurs), and Hoolock gibbons that resemble northern white-cheeked gibbons) known as the \\"Bandar-log\\", who present him to their leader, a deranged gigantopithecus named King Louie. Assuming that all humans can make \\"the red flower\\" (fire), King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan in exchange for it. Baloo distracts King Louie while Bagheera tries to sneak Mowgli out, but their ruse is uncovered. As King Louie chases Mowgli through his temple, he informs Mowgli of Akela's death. King Louie's rampage eventually causes his temple to collapse on top of him. Furious that Baloo and Bagheera neglected to tell him about Akela's death, Mowgli goes to confront Shere Khan. He steals a lit torch from the man village and heads back to the jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who claims that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Seeing the wolves' fear of him, Mowgli throws the torch into a river in rage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack hold off Shere Khan, giving Mowgli enough time to flee into the burning jungle. But Shere khan defeats all of them single handedly and goes after Mowgli. He lures Shere Khan up a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight, and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and put out the fire. In the aftermath, Raksha becomes the new leader of the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to utilize his equipment and tricks for his own use, having found his true home and calling with his wolf family, Baloo, and Bagheera. Cast Neel Sethi, the actor who portrayed Mowgli * Neel Sethi as Mowgli: A young boy who was raised by wolves. The search for casting Mowgli was extensive, with thousands of children auditioning from the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Canada. Eventually, newcomer Neel Sethi was confirmed for the role, with casting director Rebecca Williams describing him as embodying \\"the heart, humor, and daring of the character. He's warm and accessible, yet also has an intelligence well beyond his years and impressed us all with his ability to hold his own in any situation\\". Sethi underwent parkour training in preparation for the role. ** Kendrick Reyes as toddler Mowgli. * Ritesh Rajan as Mowgli's father. =Voice cast= * Bill Murray as Baloo: A Himalayan brown bear who encounters and befriends Mowgli. Favreau had Murray in mind to voice Baloo since the beginning of the project. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs perfect\\", says the director. ‚ÄúBill just exudes all the charm and humor that you need and expect from Baloo. He has a certain dryness and a rebellious quality‚Äù. He had also always wanted to work with Murray, having been a huge fan of his work, though he has been aware of how hard it is to contact him. Fortunately for Favreau, he was able to get a hold of Murray, and he agreed to come on board, with Favreau going on to comment that ‚ÄúOnce he came aboard, he was incredibly passionate. He has a very high standard‚Äù. ‚ÄúI just couldn‚Äôt say no to playing Baloo\\", says Murray. ‚ÄúJon [Favreau] is a terrific storyteller and I‚Äôm such a huge fan of the original stories. Kipling wrote a lot of amazing stuff. I read that book when I was about 22 and I‚Äôve always thought that it was just extraordinary writing\\". * Ben Kingsley as Bagheera: A black panther who is Mowgli's mentor and protector. Favreau said that Kingsley \\"brought this elegance and refinement to the character, yet with great firmness. He's an interesting dude with crazy range\\". Kingsley said that Bagheera's \\"role in Mowgli's life is to educate, to protect and to guide\\". Kingsley said that \\"[Bagheera] is instantly recognizable by the way he talks, how he acts and what his ethical code is\\", and stated that \\"Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs stories of Mowgli‚Äôs adventures with these extraordinary, beautifully defined characters introduce many around the world to the Indian subcontinent and its culture\\" through he felt that both the film and the book's story was ultimately about Mowgli's search for a family. \\"There are many wonderful stories that are based on the struggle of an orphan to find a family‚Äîto create a family around him, which is a very poignant part of Jon Favreau‚Äôs version of the film. It will have its beautiful, thrilling, exciting, joyous moments of celebration. But must also quite rightly have its darker moments, because we‚Äôre dealing with a very isolated child who triumphs over enormous odds\\". * Idris Elba as Shere Khan: A fearsome, scarred Bengal tiger with a blinded left eye who wishes to kill Mowgli. Favreau felt that Elba's voice \\"wields tremendous presence in a room\\", and that \\"[Elba]'s got such gravity and brings his steely presence, a deep timbre that echoes in a larger-than-life way. He understands this scarred, imposing tiger in a way the character demands\\". Elba said that \\"Shere Khan reigns with fear. He terrorizes everyone he encounters because he comes from a place of fear\\". Elba was highly impressed with the film's effects, stating that \\"[w]hen Jon [Favreau] showed [Elba] Shere Khan's expressions and how he moves, [he] had to ask, ‚ÄòIs that a real tiger?‚Äô The technology is incredible\\". * Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha: A female Indian wolf who is Mowgli's adoptive mother. Favreau and Marks decided to give the character of Raksha a more predominant role in the film similar to Kipling's original tales. Favreau chose Nyong‚Äôo because he believed her voice imbued the emotion required for the role, commenting \\"Lupita has tremendous depth of emotion in her performance. There's an emotional underpinning she brings, and a strength, and we wanted that for this surrogate mother. Much of that comes from her voice\\". Along with saying that she was a fan of the original Disney animated film, Nyong‚Äôo also commented, ‚ÄúI really enjoyed preparing for this and learning about wolves and how social they are, how they stick together\\", continues Nyong‚Äôo. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs such an order‚Äîa hierarchy to a wolf pack. Mowgli tries to fit in with the other wolf pups. He has his challenges, but he is very much a part of the pack as far as Raksha is concerned\\". * Scarlett Johansson as Kaa: A gigantic reticulated python. Favreau decided to cast Johansson, a recurrent collaborator of Favreau's, to play Kaa, originally a male character, as he felt the original film was \\"a little too male-oriented\\". On Kaa's role in the film, Favreau said that \\"Mowgli is exploring different regions of the jungle‚Äîmistier, darker, more mysterious parts of the jungle. That‚Äôs where Kaa lives. That‚Äôs where she gets ahold of him‚Äîtill Baloo rescues him and brings him back to his cave\\". Johansson said that \\"For [her], the opportunity to play Kaa as envisioned by Jon [Favreau] was so exciting\\", and described Kaa as \\"the mirror into Mowgli‚Äôs past\\". * Giancarlo Esposito as Akela: A male Indian wolf who leads the pack. Producer Brigham Taylor praised Esposito, claiming that \\"Giancarlo is an esteemed actor who absolutely embodies the nature of the character\\". Along with commenting that he's a fan of both the animated film and Kipling's books, Giancarlo described his character as ‚Äú...a fierce patriarch of the wolf pack. He believes that the strength of the pack lies in what each and every wolf offers. He knows if they stick together, they can survive. He‚Äôs a great leader, a wise teacher. I aspire to be like him‚Äù. * Christopher Walken as King Louie: A gigantopithecus who rules the Bandar-log. Favreau decided to change King Louie from an orangutan to a gigantopithecus due to the fact that orangutans are not native to India, where the story takes place. His character was given a slight alteration from the 1967 film and was partly inspired by Marlon Brando's character Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, as well as incorporating Walken's own physical mannerisms. In regards to Louie's changes, Favreau stated, \\"We created this looming figure that was trying to extract the secret of fire from Mowgli. And also this gave Mowgli the idea that if he had fire, he could have power over Shere Khan, whether it was good or bad. So there was Lord of the Rings aspect to that; the fire was almost like the ring in that was going to give someone ultimate power, but corrupt them as well as create destruction\\". * Garry Shandling as Ikki, an Indian porcupine that observes the Water Truce, a character not featured in the original film. This would prove to be Shandling's final role, as he died of a pulmonary embolism prior to the film's release. * Brighton Rose as Grey Brother, an Indian wolf pup who is the youngest of Mowgli's adoptive siblings. * Jon Favreau as Fred, a pygmy hog. A character not featured in the original film. * Sam Raimi as an Indian giant squirrel. * Russell Peters as Rocky, an Indian rhinoceros. This character was originally meant to appear in the 1967 film, but Walt Disney scrapped the character. * Madeleine Favreau as Raquel, an Indian rhinoceros. * Sara Arrington as a Nilgai. Emjay Anthony, Max Favreau, Chloe Hechter, Asher Blinkoff, Knox Gagnon, Sasha Schrieber, and Kai Schrieber voice the Young Wolves. Dee Bradley Baker, Artie Esposito, Sean Johnson, and Allan Trautman provide additional animal voices. Production =Development= On July 9, 2013, Walt Disney Pictures announced that a live-action adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's short story collection The Jungle Book was in development, with Justin Marks set to write it. The film would be Disney's third live-action adaptation of Kipling's works, following the 1994 film and the 1998 direct-to- video film Mowgli's Story; and the studio's fourth overall after the 1967 animated film. Jon Favreau was confirmed as director that November. Favreau as a child used to watch Disney's 1967 animated film. He felt the need to strike a balance between the two films by retaining the buoyant spirit of the 1967 film, including some of its memorable songs while crafting a film with more realism and peril. He also stressed the importance of nature and realized how things have shifted during Kipling's time and now, \\"In Kipling's time, nature was something to be overcome. Now nature is something to be protected\\". He was encouraged by Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn to take advantage of the film's setting and story as an opportunity to use the latest advancements in photorealistic rendering, computer-generated imagery, and motion capture technologies. The story of the film is not independently taken from Kipling's works, but also borrows cinematic inspirations from other films, including the child-mentor relationship in Shane (1953), the establishment of rules in a dangerous world from Goodfellas (1990) and the use of a shadowy jungle figure in Apocalypse Now (1979). Pixar Animation Studios assisted in the development of the story, as well as providing suggestions for the film's end credits sequence. John Lasseter, Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios' then-chief creative officer, suggested to end the film with the original physical book featured in the 1967 film opening. =Filming and visual effects= Principal photography took place entirely on sound stages at L.A. Center Studios in downtown Los Angeles. The animal characters were created entirely in computer animation, with the assistance of footage of real animal movement, the actors recording their lines, and performance capture for reference. The production team underwent a thorough process to realistically convey the animals' speaking, while still making them perceptually believable to the audience. Favreau researched earlier films featuring anthropomorphic animals, including Walt Disney's animated features, such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Bambi, as well as modern films such as Babe and adopted certain techniques from those films into The Jungle Book. Nearly 70 separate species of animals native to India are featured in the film, with several species being portrayed as \\"150% larger\\" than their actual counterparts. Jim Henson's Creature Shop was brought in to provide animal puppet figures for Sethi to act against, although none appear in the finished film. The animal puppets were performed by Artie Esposito, Sean Johnson, Allan Trautman, and April Warren. Favreau utilized motion capture with certain actors, expressing a desire to avoid overusing the technology in order to prevent evoking an uncanny valley effect. For instance, Bill Murray's lifted eyebrow was incorporated into Baloo's facial gestures. The Moving Picture Company (MPC) and Weta Digital created the film's visual effects. MPC developed new software for animating muscular structure in the animals. Around 1,000 remote jungle locations in India were photographed and used as a reference in post-production. Weta was responsible for animating the King Louie sequence, with visual effects supervisor Keith Miller adding that, \\"It was important for Jon to see Christopher Walken in the creature. So we took some of the distinctive Walken facial features‚Äîiconic lines, wrinkles and folds‚Äîand integrated them into the animated character\\". Favreau expressed desire in wanting the film's 3D shots to imbue the abilities of the multiplane camera system utilized in Disney's earlier animated films. At Favreau's behest, the idea was extended into the film's version of the Walt Disney Pictures opening production logo, which was recreated as \\"a hand- painted, cel-animated multi-plane logo\\" in homage to the animated films of that era, also incorporating the word \\"Presents\\" in the same font as the 1967 film's opening credits. The film's ending also features the original physical book that opened the 1967 film. =Sound= Director Jon Favreau and composer John Debney sought to recreate the Fantasound experience Walt Disney, himself, had in mind. When mixing the soundtrack in Dolby Atmos, as Favreau said, \\"we isolated instruments when we could. And in the sound mix, we created a Fantasound mix. If you see the film in Atmos, you will feel that there are instruments that move around the theater\\". A mention for Fantasound appears in the film's closing credits. Music The musical score for The Jungle Book was composed and conducted by frequent Favreau collaborator John Debney, mostly drawing from George Bruns' original music. According to Debney, ‚ÄúJon [Favreau] wanted a timeless sound to the score and I embraced that\\". Debney created a theme for Mowgli that \\"[i]t's not overly emotional. It has an elegance and majesty to it. He‚Äôs becoming a man through this whole experience and that‚Äôs what [Debney and Favreau] wanted to say with his theme\\". Shere Khan's theme was conformed of a three or four-note motif, while Baloo's \\"called for quirky strings and bass\\" that is \\"frolicking and emotional\\". While Bagheera doesn't have a theme of his own, he's represented by French horns and strings, and Kaa's music features snake-like sounds, while King Louie's features many instruments, like percussion instruments, bass marimbas, etc. While Richard M. Sherman, who originally co-wrote songs for the 1967 film with his brother Robert, was originally reported to be writing new songs for the remake,https://web.archive.org/web/20141225200209/http://news.moviefone.com/2014/12/23/richard- sherman-jungle-book/ Favreau decided not to make the film a musical. Still, he and Debney incorporated several songs from the 1967 animated film. \\"The Bare Necessities\\", written by Terry Gilkyson, is performed by Murray and Sethi, and a cover version by Dr. John is featured in the end credits. \\"I Wan'na Be Like You\\" and \\"Trust in Me\\" ‚Äî written by the Sherman Brothers - are performed by Walken and Johansson, respectively; Richard M. Sherman wrote revised lyrics for Walken's version of \\"I Wan'na Be Like You\\". Johansson's rendition of \\"Trust in Me\\" was produced by Mark Ronson and appears in the end credits only. Used in trailers is the track \\"Take A Bow\\" by English alternative rock band, Muse, from their 2006 album, Black Holes and Revelations. Walt Disney Records released the film's soundtrack on April 15, 2016. = Track listing = * Note 1. Original \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" melody composed by Leigh Harline; Walt Disney Pictures logo melody composed by Mark Mancina; \\"The Jungle Book Overture\\" written by George Bruns. Release Jon Favreau at the premiere of The Jungle Book in Sydney, Australia The film was originally scheduled for October 9, 2015, but the film's release date was later postponed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures to April 15, 2016. The film was released in the Dolby Vision format in Dolby Cinema in the United States, and is the first film to be released in Dolby Vision 3D (in a few select theaters in New York City and Chicago). The Jungle Book held its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre on April 4, 2016. It was released on April 8 in 15 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Russia, Malaysia, and most notably in India a week ahead of its U.S. debut on April 15. The release date in India was strategic for the film as it coincided with the Indian New Year and was a holiday in most parts of the country. The film had a special Hindi version with famous actors giving their voices to the main characters, including Irrfan Khan as Baloo, Om Puri as Bagheera, Priyanka Chopra as Ka, Nana Patekar as Sher Khan and Shefali Shah as Raksha. As the Japanese anime series Jungle Book Sh≈çnen Mowgli had been immensely popular in India in the 1990s, Disney India also commissioned a contemporary recording of \\"Jungle Jungle Baat Chali Hai\\" (originally used for the popular Indian version of Jungle Book Sh≈çnen Mowgli), overseen by the original Hindi song's composers Vishal Bhardwaj and Gulzar, and released it as part of the film's promotional campaign in India. =Home media= The film was released digitally on August 23, 2016, and on DVD and Blu-ray on August 30 (August 22 in the UK). A 3D Blu-ray was said to be coming by the end of the year. The film topped the NPD VideoScan overall disc sales chart for two consecutive weeks. In the United States, the DVD and Blu-ray releases sold 2,027,137 units by December 2016 and have grossed as of August 2018. It's available on Disney+ as of June 19, 2020. Reception =Box office= The film became a huge financial success and a sleeper hit. It briefly held the record for the biggest remake of all time until the studio's own Beauty and the Beast surpassed it the following year. It grossed $364 million in the United States and Canada and $602.5 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $966.6 million, against a budget of $175 million. Worldwide, the film was released across 28,000 RealD 3D screens and had an IMAX worldwide opening of $20.4 million from 901 IMAX screens, a new record for a PG film. It grossed a total of $39 million in IMAX screens worldwide. On May 13, it became the second film of 2016 (after the studio's own Zootopia) to pass the $800 million mark. On June 10, it became the third film of 2016 after Zootopia and Captain America: Civil War to pass the $900 million mark. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $258 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the sixth-most profitable release of 2016. United States and Canada Projections for its opening weekend in the United States and Canada were continuously revised upwards, starting from $60 million to as high as $88 million, with female and older male quadrants being the prime draw. The Jungle Book was shown across 4,028 theaters of which 3,100 theaters (75%) were in 3D, including 376 IMAX screens, 463 premium large format screens, and 145 D-Box locations. It opened Friday, April 15, 2016, on around 9,500 screens across 4,028 theaters, and earned $32.4 million, the fourth-biggest April Friday. This includes $4.2 million from Thursday previews, the biggest preview number for a Disney live-adaptation film (tied with Maleficent), an almost unheard-of for a PG title which rarely attracts many ticketbuyers later in the night. In total, it earned $103.3 million in its opening weekend, exceeding expectations by 40% and recorded the biggest PG-rated April opening (breaking Hop's record), the second-biggest Disney live-action adaptation opening (behind Alice in Wonderland), and the second-biggest April opening (behind Furious 7). It also performed exceptionally well in both 3D and IMAX formats, where they both generated an income of $44 million and $10.4 million of the film's opening-weekend gross, respectively, the later broke the record for the biggest April Disney release IMAX opening. Notably, it also became the only second PG-rated release to ever open above $100 million (following Alice in Wonderland) and the third film of 2016 overall to open above $100 million (following Deadpool and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). It earned $130.7 million in its first full week, the second-biggest for a Disney live-action adaptation, behind only Alice in Wonderlands $146.6 million seven-day gross. Buoyed by excellent word of mouth and benefiting from spring break, it fell only by 40% in its second weekend earning $61.5 million, still maintaining the top position and far surpassing newcomer The Huntsman: Winter's War. That puts The Jungle Book in the top fifteen-second weekends of all time and in terms of films that opened above $100 million, it scored the fourth-smallest drop behind Shrek 2 (‚àí33%), Spider-Man (‚àí39%), and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (‚àí39%). Of those numbers, $5.6 million came from IMAX shows for a two weekend cumulative total of $18.4 million which represents about 10% of its entire North American box office gross. It crossed $200 million on its twelfth day of release and managed to hold the top spot for the third consecutive weekend with $43.7 million from 4,041 theaters (an addition of 13 more theaters), a fall of only 29%, outgrossing the next six pictures combined (including the openings of three newcomers) and recorded the sixth-biggest third weekend of all time. Moreover, the 29% drop is the smallest third-weekend drop (from its second weekend) for a $100 million opener ever. Disney added an additional 103 theaters for the film's fourth weekend of release which propelled its theater count to 4,144 theaters, but nevertheless, it was overtaken by Disney's own Captain America: Civil War after experiencing a 50% decline. It passed $300 million on its thirtieth day of release, on May 14, as it continued to witness marginal declines in the wake of several new releases weekend after weekend. It made 3.53 times its opening weekend numbers, which is one of the biggest of all time for a film opening above $100 million. It became one of the few surprise hits and one of the highest-grossing films of the year, alongside Finding Dory, The Secret Life of Pets, and Zootopia, centered around talking animals to dominate the year-end chart. Other countries The film was released in approximately 70 countries. Outside the US and Canada, it opened across 15 markets and 69 IMAX screens a week ahead of its US debut, and faced notable competition from newcomer The Huntsman: Winter's War and holdover Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the latter of which was entering its third weekend. The reason behind the divided release pattern was because Disney wanted to get some space before Captain America: Civil War releases in early May, as well as availing school holidays and avoiding local competitors. It eventually grossed $31.7 million, debuting at first place in all markets and second overall at the international box office, behind Dawn of Justice, which was playing across 67 markets. In its second weekend, it expanded to an additional 49 countries (88% of its total marketplace) and grossed $138.6 million from 64 countries, easily topping the international box office, a bulk of it came from China. Approximately 63% or $85 million of that came from 3D screenings, with the largest 3D opening haul represented by China (98%), Germany (83%), Brazil (73%), Russia (60%), Mexico (47%), and the UK (39%). $10 million alone came from 525 IMAX screens, a record for a PG and April release. It further continued to hold the top spot in its third weekend after adding another $98.9 million from 53 territories, falling only by a marginal 32%. IMAX generated another $6.1 million from 484 IMAX theaters for a three-weekend total of $20.6 million. After three straight No. 1 runs, it was finally dethroned by the studio's Captain America: Civil War in its fourth weekend. In India, it scored the second-biggest opening day for a Hollywood film, earning $1.51 million (behind Avengers: Age of Ultron) from around 1,500 screens and went on to score the second-biggest Hollywood opening weekend of all time, with $8.4 million from 1,600 screens, behind only Furious 7 in terms of local as well as U.S. currency, performing better than expected and its initial $5‚Äì6 million opening projection. Its opening weekend in India alone surpassed the entire lifetime total of Disney's other live-fantasy adaptations‚ÄîCinderella, Maleficent, Oz the Great and Powerful, and Alice in Wonderland‚Äîin the country. It then went on to score the biggest opening and single week for a Hollywood film with $15.1 million. In its second weekend, it dropped just by a mere 40% to $4.97 million. In just ten days, it became the fourth-highest-grossing Hollywood film there with $21.2 million. On Wednesday, April 19‚Äîits twelfth day of release‚Äîit surpassed Furious 7 to become the highest-grossing Hollywood/foreign release of all time there. By the end of its theatrical run, the film made an estimated $38.8 million with half of its revenue‚Äî58%‚Äîcoming from local dubbed versions, compared to Avengers: Age of Ultron, which saw 45% of its revenue from dubbed versions. In China, where the film was locally known as Fantasy Forest, expectations were high, with projections going as high $154‚Äì200 million or more. Ultimately, it was unable to hit these marks. Before the release of the film in the state, Disney had a very successful run at the box office with Zootopia the previous month, in which anthropomorphic animals were the central figure. Forbes noted that The Jungle Book was precisely the sort of film that Chinese audiences love with its 3D visuals, heartwarming story, and talking animal cast. It earned around $12 million on its opening day, including $300,000 worth of previews from 65,000 screenings. Buoyed by good word of mouth and positive reception (albeit mostly from audiences with polarized reception from Chinese critics), it rose 72% on its second day to $20 million. Through its opening weekend it grossed $48.5 million, including $5.1 million from 279 IMAX screens, a new record for April release. Its opening marked the biggest Walt Disney Pictures film opening ever, the second-biggest for a family film (behind Kung Fu Panda 3), the second-biggest April debut (behind Furious 7), and the fourth-biggest Disney opening (behind Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 3, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens). It topped the daily box office through the whole opening week and went on to remain at the top of the box office for a second weekend, after dropping by a mere 20% to $29.8 million, despite facing some competitions. It ended its run there with a total of $150.1 million after thirty days of playing in theaters, adding $1.2 million on its last day. Albeit falling just below expectations, it nevertheless emerged as a huge financial success and becoming the fourth-biggest Disney release there. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it had an opening weekend total of ¬£9.9 million ($14.1 million) from 594 theaters and in France with $8.1 million. Elsewhere, the highest openings were recorded in Russia and the CIS ($7.4 million), Germany ($5.1 million), Spain ($3.9 million), Australia ($2.8 million), Argentina ($2.3 million), and in Malaysia, where it scored the biggest opening weekend for a live-action Disney film with $2.3 million. In the UK, it became the first film of 2016 to earn over ¬£5 million in three straight weekends and the first film since Jurassic World, Spectre, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (all 2015 films) to achieve such an accomplishment, and the first film of 2016 to earn above ¬£40 million ($58 million). In South Korea, it faced competition with Warcraft, but ended up debuting atop the charts with $6.2 million. It has so far grossed a total of $18 million there. It opened in Japan on August 11, alongside the superhero film X-Men: Apocalypse and delivered a four-day opening of $6.2 million from 676 screens ($3 million in two days), debuting at second place behind The Secret Life of Pets. Although the opening figure was considered mediocre, Deadline Hollywood noted that Japan is a market that can see big multiples. It fell just 30% in its second weekend earning $2.1 million for an eleven-day total of $13.7 million. In total earnings, its biggest markets outside of the US and Canada were China ($150.1 million), the United Kingdom ($66.2 million) and India ($38.8 million). It was the highest-grossing film of 2016 in Europe with a total of $209 million, the United Kingdom and Ireland, and in India (although it was later surpassed by Sultan, in terms of Hollywood/imported films, it is still the biggest). =Critical response= The film garnered widespread critical acclaim from critics and audiences. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 323 reviews, with an average rating of 7.72/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"As lovely to behold as it is engrossing to watch, The Jungle Book is the rare remake that actually improves upon its predecessors - all while setting a new standard for CGI\\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported moviegoers gave it an overall positive score of 92%. Ninety-seven percent of the audience gave the film an A or a B, and it got A's from both the under- and over-25 crowd and A+ among those under 18 years of age and also for the over-50 audience. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Exceptionally beautiful to behold and bolstered by a stellar vocal cast, this umpteenth film rendition of Rudyard Kipling's tales of young Mowgli's adventures amongst the creatures of the Indian jungle proves entirely engaging, even if it's ultimately lacking in subtext and thematic heft\\". Andrew Barker of Variety felt that this version \\"can't rival the woolly looseness of Disney's 1967 animated classic, of course, but it succeeds on its own so well that such comparisons are barely necessary\\". Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film four stars out of five, and deemed it \\"a sincere and full-hearted adaptation that returns to Kipling for fresh inspiration\\". Alonso Duralde of The Wrap says \\"This 'Book' might lack the post-vaudeville razzamatazz of its predecessor, but director Jon Favreau and a team of effects wizards plunge us into one of the big screen's most engrossing artificial worlds since Avatar.\\" Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, gave the film four out of five stars and felt that the film had a touch of Apocalypto in it, finding the plot elements to be similar to those in The Lion King. He wrote that the film was \\"spectacular, exciting, funny and fun\\" and that it \\"handsomely revives the spirit of Disney's original film\\". Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood wrote that the film had laughs, excitement, an exceptional voice cast and, most importantly, a lot of heart, calling it a cinematic achievement like no other. He particularly praised Murray's performance and the visual effects, deeming it \\"simply astonishing\\". Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly graded the film an \\"A‚Äì\\", calling it one of the biggest surprises of 2016. He, however, felt the two songs were rather unnecessary and distracting, and believed the film to be a little too frightening for children. Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun- Times awarded the film three-and-a-half stars, pointing out the CGI as the apex achievement of the film. He labelled it \\"a beautifully rendered, visually arresting take on Rudyard Kipling's oft-filmed tales\\" but found the musical numbers to be trivial, saying that without the musical numbers, the film might have been a more exhilarating streamlined adventure. Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan remarked that \\"The Jungle Book is the kind of family film calculated to make even those without families wish they had one to take along\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, labeling it scary and thrilling, yet unique and unforgettable, and adding that it \\"fills us with something rare in movies today‚Äîa sense of wonder\\". The Village Voices Bilge Ebiri hailed the film as fast and light and that it \\"manages to be just scary enough to make us feel the danger of solitude in the middle of a massive jungle, but never indulgent or gratuitous\\". Cath Clarke of Time Out compared Elba's character of Shere Khan to Scar from The Lion King, calling him \\"baddie of the year\\". Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com also had high praise for Elba's portrayal of Shere Khan stating: \\"His loping menace is envisioned so powerfully that he'd be scary no matter what, but the character becomes a great villain through imaginative empathy. We understand and appreciate his point-of-view, even though carrying it out would mean the death of Mowgli\\". The film's visual effects and 3D photography were compared to those of Avatar, Gravity, Hugo, and Life of Pi. Sarah Ward of Screen International wrote that the level of detail on display in the film \\"is likely to evoke the same jaw-dropping reaction as James Cameron's box office topper\\". Entertainment Weekly called it \\"one of the few 3D movies that actually benefit from being in 3D\\". The film also had a positive reception from Indian contemporary critics and publications, such as The Times of India, The Hindu, India Today, The Indian Express, and The Economic Times. The film also had its share of criticism with most reviewers criticizing the inconsistent tone of the film and the director's indecision to stick to one vision. The New York Timess Manohla Dargis was less enthusiastic. Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine wrote, \\"Jon Favreau draws heavily on his film's animated predecessor for plot, characterizations, songs, and set pieces, but doesn't know how to fit these familiar elements into his own coherent vision\\". Josh Spiegel of Movie Mezzanine also echoed these feelings, saying that the film \\"stumbles because the people involved aren't willing to fully commit to either making a near- shot-for-shot remake or going in a completely different direction\\". Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald felt that the movie was soulless, writing that \\"The better these talking beasts look, the more the film resembles a gorgeous screen saver. You admire The Jungle Book, but you can't lose yourself in it\\".http://www.miami.com/039the-jungle-book039-soulless-adventure-pg-article =Accolades= Sequel Following the film's financial and critical success, the studio has begun working on a sequel. Jon Favreau and Justin Marks were in talks to return as director and writer respectively while Brigham Taylor was confirmed to be returning as producer. Shortly after the release of the film, Favreau and Marks signed on to direct and write the sequel, and it could potentially have a release sometime in late 2019 and will be shot back-to-back with Favreau's remake of The Lion King. But in March 2017, it was reported that the sequel was put on hold so that Favreau would have to focus mainly on The Lion King instead. By January 2018, Marks finished an early draft for the sequel, which he said will \\"go further through\\" Kipling's material, as well as feature elements of Bill Peet's rejected drafts for the 1967 film. In October 2018, Neel Sethi confirmed that he will reprise his role as Mowgli in the sequel.

She was one of the founders of the pan- African women's organisation Akina Mama wa Afrika (AMwA) and the Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners in Kenya (CRPPK), to protest the incarceration of Kenyans during Daniel arap Moi's regime. Education and career Kihoro graduated in economics from Columbia University, New York. She went on to complete an MA in development studies and a PhD at Leeds University during her working life in the late 1980s. In 1982, Kihoro and her husband settled in London on exile from Kenya, at a time when Moi's arrests of dissidents had intensified, particularly of lawyers and academics. This is when she helped found the Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners in Kenya (CRPPK). With other activists, Kihoro produced and wrote for Kenya News, which was then investigated by Moi's government. She began work for The Africa Centre, London in 1984. Other work involved the All African Conference of Churches, the National Christian Council of Kenya and the United Church Board for World Ministries. In 1985, she co-founded Akina Mama wa Afrika as a community-based organisation for African women. In 1992, she helped found ABANTU for Development to train African women for positions of leadership. ABANTU was set up in Nairobi, Kenya, with subsequent offices set up in Nigeria and Ghana. She returned to Kenya with her family when the new Kibaki government came to power in 2002. Death She died in 2006 after four years spent in a coma after a plane crash. During these four years, Kihoro's situation was contrasted with that of Terri Schiavo, with Kihoro's husband Wanyiri Kihoro and the rest of her family unanimous in believing she should continue to be on life support at Nairobi's Kenyatta National Hospital. At the time of her death, she was survived by her husband, and four children: Wangui, Pambana, Amandla and Wairimu. On her death, The Guardian commented that there were \\"few African women as well known as Wanjiru Kihoro\\". Wangui wa Goro wrote in Pambazuka News: \\"[S]he was a leader, activist for democracy, freedom, human rights, equality and justice and always stood on the side of the oppressed, particularly women and the poor.

Prior to being drafted into the CFL, he played Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) football for the Universit√© de Montr√©al. College career In university, Pruneau was known as a versatile player. He played defensive back before switching to linebacker for his final year, and also served on special teams. During the 2013 season, Pruneau scored two special teams touchdowns; one on a kickoff return and the other on the return of a missed field goal. Pruneau was named to the 2012 and 2013 second All-Canadian Teams by the CIS. Professional career The Ottawa Redblacks were impressed by Pruneau's speed and athleticism at the 2014 CFL Combine, and they selected Pruneau in the 1st round of the subsequent draft, 4th overall. In his rookie year, Pruneau saw much playing time on both defense and special teams. He was named the CFL's Canadian player of the month in October. He finished the 2014 season second on the Redblacks with 69 tackles while also contributing 11 special teams tackles and 2 quarterback sacks. Antoine Pruneau was nominated by the RedBlacks as their best rookie. Over the next two seasons Pruneau continued to be an important starter for the Redblacks defence (despite being briefly benched in 2016 due to poor performance). Following the 2016 season Pruneau and the Redblacks agreed on a contract extension, keeping him in Ottawa through the 2019 CFL season. He was named a CFL East All-Star in 2017 after totaling 65 defensive tackles, eight special teams tackles, four interceptions and one quarterback sack. Pruneau played in 13 games for the Redblacks in 2018, contributing with 50 tackles. Immediately following the close of the 2018 season Pruneau agreed to a three-year contract extension.

His vision for the college was one populated by a small society of priests. Indeed, Woodlark's original statutes for the governance of the college expressly excluded the teaching of medicine or law. Woodlark did not contemplate undergraduates at the college, instead desiring a small community of senior scholars of theology and philosophy.

He was the elected Archbishop of Esztergom between 1298 and 1303. Supporting the claim of the Capetian House of Anjou, he was a tough opponent of Andrew III of Hungary. He crowned Charles I of Hungary king with a provisional crown in 1301. He was murdered in Anagni by soldiers whom Philip IV of France had sent to Italy to capture Pope Boniface VIII. Early career He was born into the gens (clan) Bicske, which possessed landholdings in Pest and Fej√©r counties. According to the Chronicon Posoniense (\\"Chronicle of Pressburg\\"; present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), his father was Botond, which fact was also confirmed by a letter of Pope Benedict XI. Botond was the first known member of the Bicskei (later also known as Szerdahelyi) family. Gregory had two brothers, Peter and John.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Szerdahelyi [Bicskei] family) According to a document dating from 1306, Peter and John were granted permission to levy tolls in the locality of Bicske by Charles I for their military merits. The Bicskeis' genealogical origin was first written by historian Antal P√≥r. Beforehand, Jesuit scholar Gy√∂rgy Pray incorrectly considered that Gregory originated from the gens Kopp√°n (or Katap√°n), while N√°ndor Knauz also shared this opinion in his work Monumenta ecclesiae Strigoniensis. Gregory was first mentioned by a contemporary record in September 1274, when a certain noble, John Csapoli, declaring that he has no legitimate heir, handed over a portion of his estate Csabdi as a marriage donation to his wife, Botond's sister. Thereafter she donated the land to her nephews, Peter, John and Gregory. In the same time, they bought the remainder of the estate from John Csapoli. As the youngest of the three brothers, Gregory entered ecclesiastical career. He was referred to as a guardian (custos) of the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r Cathedral in 1291. He was elected provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r sometime between 24 April and 28 April 1295, replacing Theodore Tengerdi. Following that Lodomer, the incumbent Archbishop of Esztergom, personally wrote a letter to Pope Boniface VIII in order to confirm Bicskei's election. The document was part of the letter collection of Pietro della Vigna. As Lodomer reported in the letter, Bicskei, who \\"was of great origin and had proficiency in canon law\\", was unable to make a personal journey to Rome because of the \\"poverty of the church [Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r]\\" and the \\"intrigues of his relatives\\". As a result, the archbishop requested Boniface to let Bicskei to maintain his position as an apostolic administrator of Sz√©kesfeh√©v√°r, which was under the direct jurisdiction of the Holy See. His letter clarifies that Gregory was initially belonged to that politically united prelacy, which aimed to strengthen the royal power to put an end to the political anarchy, and even confronted with the Holy See, supporting Andrew and his fight against the provincial lords. In accordance with the Law of 1290‚Äì91, which legitimized a custom right, the office of royal vice- chancellery was permanently held by the provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. Nonetheless, Bicskei replaced Theodore Tengerdi (now as Bishop of Gy≈ër) in this dignity only around October 1297. In that capacity, for instance, Bicskei formulated that royal charter on 2 November 1297, in which Andrew III donated Pozsony County to his spouse Queen Agnes, the daughter of Albert I of Germany. Archbishop-elect =Facing Andrew and the Hungarian prelacy= Archbishop Lodomer, who was Andrew's staunch ally in his struggles against the provincial lords, died on 2 January 1298. Bicskei was elected as his successor sometime between 18 January and 12 February. During that time, he was considered a loyal partisan of Andrew III, along with the other prelates of the church in Hungary. He escorted King Andrew and Queen Agnes alongside other dignitaries to Austria on 12 February, where Andrew's only child Elizabeth of T√∂ss was betrothed to Wenceslaus, the son and heir apparent of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. Bicskei was last styled as vice-chancellor on 24 February. His relationship with the monarch and the other prelates had deteriorated permanently in the next six months. He refused to attend that assembly of the prelates, noblemen, Saxons, Sz√©kelys, and Cumans, which was summoned by Andrew in Pest in the summer of 1298. Historians agree that Bicskei wanted to reach the papal confirmation of his election as soon as possible, as a result he turned against Andrew and his courtiers, and became a strong advocate of the claim of Charles of Anjou to the Hungarian throne, who enjoyed Pope Boniface's support. With this step, Bicskei intended to disrupt the unity of the Hungarian prelates, who were the strongest pillars of Andrew's reign, but the suffragan bishops remained faithful to the monarch, with the leadership of John Hont-P√°zm√°ny, Archbishop of Kalocsa. One of the (23rd) articles of the 1298 diet established a four-member lesser council within the royal council, consisting of two nobles and prelates. Their veto power prevented Bicskei from sabotaging the operation of the royal council, which resulted his total isolation in the state government, despite his nominal leading position in the royal council. Although Bicskei unsuccessfully attempt to shift the prelates from supporting Andrew, but the king' confidence in the Hungarian clergy was shaken due to his activity, as a result he shortly entered into a formal alliance with five influential barons, who stated that they were willing to support him against the Pope and the bishops. Charles I's arrival to Hungary, depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle Pope Boniface refused to confirm Bicskei's election on 28 January 1299, but appointed him apostolic administrator of the archdiocese of Esztergom and the provostry of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. The pope indicated with that if Gregory will represent faithfully the Holy See's interests in Hungary, will receive the final confirmation later. Thereafter Bicskei arbitrarily styled himself \\"the legate of the Holy See\\" in his documents. Obtaining the pope's empowerment, he absolved the members of the K≈ëszegi family from the excommunication on 19 March 1299, which was proclaimed by Lodomer years earlier. Bicskei also forbade the prelates to participate at a new diet which was held around May 1299. In the same time, he convened a synod to Veszpr√©m with his self-declared authority of legate, and obliged the bishops to participate at the event, with the threat of excommunication. However, the prelates ignored the archbishop's order. On 6 July 1299, Emeric, Bishop of V√°rad was commissioned to send a letter to Pope Boniface to interpret the complaints of Andrew III, Archbishop John and the \\"entire prelacy and nobility\\" regarding the behavior of Bicskei and asked Boniface to place them under papal patronage against Bicskei. In the same time Andrew III sent two envoys, Paul, provost of Esztergom, and Henry Balog, a royal councillor of the inner council, to the court of Esztergom to reconcile with the rebellious archbishop, but, by then, Bicskei resided in Transdanubia under the protection of the K≈ëszegis. Later he moved to Szentkereszt Castle beyond the Drava river between Koprivnica and Kri≈æevci, owned by the oligarch Ivan K≈ëszegi. Andrew III deprived Bicskei from the perpetual isp√°nate of Esztergom County shortly before 29 January 1300, when the castellans of the confiscated Esztergom Castle, brothers Jaroslav and Barleus Div√©k were granted the title of isp√°n. In the same time, Andrew also sent his envoy, an Italian merchant Petrus de Bonzano from Tarvisio to represent his efforts in Rome. Andrew III wanted to achieve that the pope appoint his confidant Anthony, Bishop of Csan√°d as Archbishop of Esztergom, instead of Bicskei. Meanwhile, a group of powerful lords‚Äîincluding the ≈†ubiƒái, K≈ëszegis and Cs√°ks‚Äîurged Charles II of Naples to send his grandson, Charles of Anjou, who came to the Kingdom of Hungary upon the invitation of an influential Croatian lord, Paul ≈†ubiƒá, in August 1300. He landed at Split in Dalmatia. Bicskei was among those dignitaries, who welcomed the young pretender. They jointly continued to travel to Zagreb. Pope Boniface refused to appoint Anthony, but still did not confirm the election of Bicskei. The K≈ëszegis and Matthew Cs√°k, were shortly reconciled with Andrew, preventing Charles' success. Andrew, who had been in poor health for a while, was planning to capture his opponent, but he died in Buda Castle on 14 January 1301. =During the Interregnum= After learning the news, Charles hurried to Hungary with his small army, accompanied by Gregory Bicskei, Ugrin Cs√°k and other nobles. They arrived to Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, the traditional crowning place of Hungary. However, according to abbot Ganfridus's letter to James II of Aragon, the burghers of the town closed the city gate and did not allow the army. Thereafter Bicskei placed Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r under interdict at the end of February or early March. As the other pretenders, Wenceslaus and Otto were allowed to enter the town, historian Attila Zsoldos considered the magistrate of Feh√©rv√°r refused entry because of the doubtful legitimacy of Bicskei's status, whose position of archbishop-elect have not been universally recognized in Hungary by then. After that Charles moved to Esztergom, where Bicskei crowned him with a provisional crown before 13 May, following a possible short skirmish, as Bicskei did not own the castle and its town since January 1300. However, most Hungarians considered Charles's coronation unlawful because customary law required that it should have been performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. Pope Boniface VIII in a miniature Among the prelates, only Bicskei, Michael B≈ë and John of Nyitra supported Charles' claim, while the majority of the Hungarian lords and prelates decided to offer the crown to the young Wenceslaus and sent a delegation to his father to Bohemia. Although Wenceslaus was crowned with the Holy Crown in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, the legitimacy of his coronation was also questionable because John Hont-P√°zm√°ny put the crown on Wenceslaus's head, although customary law authorized the Archbishop of Esztergom to perform the ceremony. The Illuminated Chronicle claimed Wenceslaus was crowned by John, because the archiepiscopal see of Esztergom \\"was vacant\\". Some historians, including Gyula Krist√≥ and Elem√©r M√°lyusz claimed, that chapter of the chronicle was written by a pro-P≈ôemyslid Minorite friar, while philologist J√°nos Horv√°th argued the unconfirmed election of Bicskei was considered \\"invalid\\" in the eyes of his contemporaries. When Ivan K≈ëszegi, who became the strongest partisan of Wenceslaus, invaded and occupied Esztergom in August 1301, Bicskei sequestered to the territory of the Diocese of Eger. There he visitied the castle of Boldogk≈ë and successfully convinced the powerful oligarch Amadeus Aba to support Charles in the emerging conflict, while he also dealt with the possession cases of the provostry of Szepes (today Spi≈°sk√° Kapitula, Slovakia), which was vacated not long ago. After Wenceslaus' coronation, Charles withdrew to Ugrin Cs√°k's domains in the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface sent his legate, Niccol√≤ Boccasini, to Hungary. In October 1301, he summoned and convinced the majority of the Hungarian prelates to accept Charles's reign. The bishops, however, still did not recognize the legitimacy of Bicskei, as a result, Boccasini sent a letter to Pope Boniface, in which proposed that a consensual person fill the dignity. In response, Boniface warned his legate that he exceeded his powers, and preserved the personal selection of the archbishop for himself. The pope insisted on Bicskei, but he intended to maintain the status quo and did not confirm his 1298 election. Bicskei stayed in the royal camp, when Charles laid siege to Buda, the capital of the kingdom, in September 1302, but Ivan K≈ëszegi relieved the siege. When Bicskei issued a royal charter in √ìbuda on 10 September, he was styled as \\"vice-chancellor\\". Pope Boniface, who regarded Hungary as a fief of the Holy See declared Charles the lawful king of Hungary on 31 May 1303. The papal bull was annunciated by Michael B≈ë and Stephen, the new Archbishop of Kalocsa, as Bicskei was even refused by the pro-Charles prelates in Hungary. Pope Boniface finally wanted to settle the question and summoned him into Rome. He arrived unfortunate moment to Anagni, the summer residence of the popes. On 7 September 1303, an army led by King Philip of France's minister Guillaume de Nogaret and Sciarra Colonna attacked Boniface at his palace. The pope was slapped in the face and captured, while Bicskei was killed in the skirmish along with many clergymen, locals and courtiers.

He was Archbishop of Kalocsa between 1278 and 1301. In this capacity, he closely cooperated with fellow Archbishop Lodomer in order to restore royal authority over the kingdom. After Lodomer's death, John became head of the royal council from 1298 to 1301, initiating profound constitutional changes in the parliamentary system. He crowned Wenceslaus, one of the pretenders to Hungary, king in 1301, provoking the wrath of the Holy See. Family John was born into the Forg√°cs branch of the wealthy and prestigious gens (clan) Hont-P√°zm√°ny around 1240.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Hontp√°zm√°ny 6., Forg√°cs branch) The ancestors of the kindred, Swabian knights Hont and P√°zm√°ny arrived to the Principality of Hungary in the late 10th century, according to the chronicle of John's contemporary Simon of K√©za. John's father was Andrew, who erected castles near Tur√≥c and G√≠mes (present-day Kl√°≈°tor pod Znievom and Jelenec in Slovakia, respectively) following the First Mongol invasion of Hungary. He was a faithful confidant of B√©la IV, then Stephen V. Andrew served as count of the t√°rnoks (financial officials) from 1249 to 1256, and isp√°n of B√°nya (√Årkib√°nya) isp√°nate on several occasions, which laid in the territory of Nyitra County. John had several siblings, who also rose to prominence during the last decades of the 13th century. Thomas functioned as Judge royal (1291‚Äì1293), then Master of the horse (1293), and was considered a strong ally of his brother John in the royal advisory council. Andrew and Iv√°nka were skilled soldiers and served faithfully King Andrew III in his campaigns against the oligarchs. Both of them were killed in battles against the powerful rebellious lord Matthew Cs√°k. Through his elder son, Andrew was ancestor of the Forg√°cs (or Forg√°ch) noble family, which still exists and provided several magnates for the Hungarian elite in the following centuries. John's another brother was Nicholas, who was mentioned between 1295 and 1297. He also had two sisters, Yolanda and an unidentified one, who married Aty√≥cs of Z√≥lyom and Peter Sziksz√≥i, respectively. John owned Rim√≥ca (present-day Lehota nad Rimavicou, Slovakia) and was involved in a lawsuit over an intermediate land with his distant kin comes Nicholas, who owned the neighboring Kecege (today Kociha, Slovakia) in 1298. Early career It is plausible that John attended the University of Bologna, where obtained a degree of doctor of canon law (). He was styled as \\"magister\\" throughout his ecclesiastical career. When he returned to Hungary, his ecclesiastical career ascended quickly into the highest dignities. He functioned as a royal chaplain in the court of Stephen V from 1270 to 1272. He retained his position following the ascension of Ladislaus IV to the Hungarian throne. Beside his office in the royal court, John also served as archdeacon of G√∂m√∂r in the Archdiocese of Esztergom between 1273 and 1274. He was granted the villages √öjlak and √ñzd√∂ge (present-day Veƒæk√© Z√°lu≈æie and Mojzesovo in Slovakia, respectively) for his faithful service by Ladislaus IV in October 1273. The young monarch also donated a land called Hars√°ny in Nyitra County to John for the same reason in July 1274. John became count (head) of the royal chapel () by August 1276. Beside that, he also functioned as archdeacon of Nyitra (Nitra) during that time. In that year, he and his brothers were granted the village of Nemcsics, which laid near their castle of G√≠mes. According to the charter of Ladislaus IV, the Hont-P√°zm√°ny brothers successfully defended the fortress during the wars with the Kingdom of Bohemia. According to a document with doubtful credit, John served as vice-chancellor of the royal court and provost of Buda in August 1277. He succeeded Benedict in the latter dignity. He was also a member of the cathedral chapter of Esztergom. He sold some portions from his land in Ilm√©r (later √úrm√©ny, present-day Mojm√≠rovce, Slovakia), belonging to Szolgagy≈ër (Galg√≥c) isp√°nate, and entrusted his bailiff, a certain comes Egyed to define and draw new boundaries. John participated in the national diet of prelates, barons and noblemen in May 1277, when the young monarch Ladislaus IV was declared to be of age. Thereafter, when Ladislaus IV confirmed his political alliance with Rudolf I of Germany against Ottokar II of Bohemia in July 1277, John was a member of that Hungarian diplomatic mission, which was sent to Vienna. By the next year, in the summer of 1278, John was styled as vice-chancellor and provost-elect of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, succeeding Thomas. Both Ladislaus IV and the collegiate chapter of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r petitioned to the Roman Curia to request the confirmation of John's election. Rudolf also wrote a letter to Pope Nicholas III, in which he expressed to support the case. Archbishop of Kalocsa =The Cuman question= Before his confirmation as provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, John was elected as Archbishop of Kalocsa sometime around October 1278. He succeeded Stephen B√°ncsa in that dignity, who died in the summer of that year. John was also styled as chancellor of the royal court between November 1278 and March 1279. John was first referred to as archbishop-elect on 14 November, when transcribed and confirmed the privileges of the hospes (foreigner) gold miners of Rimaszombat (today Rimavsk√° Sobota, Slovakia), who belonged under the suzerainty of the Archdiocese of Kalocsa despite the great distance. Around the same time with John's election, Pope Nicholas sent Philip, Bishop of Fermo, to Hungary to help Ladislaus IV restore royal power and to arrange a number of Church irregularities in Hungary. The papal legate arrived in the kingdom in early 1279. The pope instructed Philip on 13 June 1279 to investigate the circumstances and regularity of John's election. On the same day, the papal legate appointed Lodomer as Archbishop of Esztergom on behalf of Pope Nicholas. In the midst of an escalating situation between the Holy See and the Hungarian royal court, the election in the Archdiocese of Kalocsa remained a marginal issue, as a result, the investigation process and the subsequent papal confirmation of John's election were delayed for years; he was still referred to as archbishop-elect throughout the years 1279 and 1280 too. Papal legate Philip, Bishop of Fermo arrives to Hungary, as depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle The arrival of papal legate Philip deepened the turmoil in Hungary. Initially, with the legate's mediation, Ladislaus IV concluded a peace treaty with the K≈ëszegis. Bishop Philip soon realized, however, that most Cumans were still pagans in Hungary. Following that he convened a synod in Buda on 14 September 1279, where the two archbishops, Lodomer and John, along with their suffragans attended. He extracted a ceremonious promise from the Cuman chieftains of giving up their pagan customs, and persuaded the young King Ladislaus to swear an oath to enforce the keeping of the Cuman chieftains' promise. An assembly held at T√©t√©ny passed laws which, in accordance with the legate's demand, prescribed that the Cumans should leave their tents and live \\"in houses attached to the ground\\". The national diet also authorized John Hont-P√°zm√°ny and four other bishops, whose dioceses were inhabited by a significant number of Cuman tribes, to visit and baptize the Cumans, to liberate Hungarian prisoners and to examine the noble lands surrounded by the tribes. The Cumans did not obey the laws, however, and Ladislaus IV, himself a half-Cuman, failed to force them. In retaliation, Philip of Fermo excommunicated him and placed Hungary under interdict in October. Ladislaus joined the Cumans and appealed to the Holy See, but Pope Nicholas III refused to absolve him. The policy of the papal legate, who had no regard for local political conditions, forced the Hungarian prelates to decide between the Hungarian monarch and the Roman Curia. Under such circumstances, Archbishop John was dismissed as royal chancellor sometime after March 1279. Following Ladislaus' step, when the Cumans seized and imprisoned Philip of Fermo in early January 1280, the prelates, who expressed \\"the liberty of the Church\\", turned against the royal power, and became his relentless opponents. Soon, Ladislaus was also captured. In less than two months, both the legate and the king were set free and Ladislaus took a new oath to enforce the \\"Cuman laws\\". This resulted a series of rebellions by the Cumans, who also pillaged and plundered the territory of the Archbishopric of Kalocsa, especially the area of Baja, whose inhabitants fled to the church of the H√°jszentl≈ërinc Chapter. In the following years the archbishopric became a location of acts of war, when Ladislaus launched military campaigns against the rebellious Cumans. Bishop Philip of Fermo left Hungary in the summer of 1281. Before his departure, he finally confirmed John's election, which occurred two and a half years earlier. Pope Martin IV already styled John as simply archbishop on 18 June 1282. In this letter, the pope ordered John to consecrate Thomas, the provost of Vasv√°r, who was elected Bishop of V√°rad. Before that, papal legate Philip refused to confirm the election, because Thomas was not ordained to the priesthood despite the decrees of the Second Council of Lyon. The cathedral chapter argued the decree applied only to the provosts dealing with pastoral care. Pope Martin accepted the argument and instructed Thomas' superior John to consecrate him. =Lodomer's ally= Since 1279, Lodomer and John Hont-P√°zm√°ny worked closely together in order to restore strong royal power, which was utterly weakened during the reign of Ladislaus IV. John actively supported his colleague in all efforts against the monarch. When Pope Nicholas IV proclaimed a crusade against Ladislaus and the Cumans at the turn of 1288 and 1289, John began to gather an army against his pagan subjects in the territory of the Archdiocese of Kalocsa. Around the same time, Duke Albert I of Austria launched a massive royal campaign against the K≈ëszegi family along the western border of Hungary, capturing dozens of castles. Ladislaus did not oppose the conquest because of the K≈ëszegis' continuous anti-royal uprisings. Four prelates, Lodomer, John, Andrew, Bishop of Gy≈ër and Benedict R√°d, Bishop of Veszpr√©m sent a letter to the monarch to change his way of life and behavior because the people will turn against him, according to the contemporary Steirische Reimchronik (\\"Styrian Rhyming Chronicle\\"). With the consent of Lodomer (and plausibly John), the K≈ëszegis offered the crown to the king's distant relative Andrew the Venetian, who arrived to Hungary in early 1290. Soon, Ladislaus was assassinated by three Cumans in July 1290. Andrew III was crowned king on 23 July 1290. John Hont- P√°zm√°ny was re-installed as royal chancellor in the next month. He held the office until the death of Andrew in 1301. Despite the highest court position John obtained, Lodomer was considered undoubtedly the strongest advisor of Andrew's reign. Under his guidance, Andrew III issued a charter promising the restoration of internal peace and respect for the privileges of the nobility and the clergymen. The king convened a national assembly to √ìbuda in the first days of September 1290, where he promised to preserve the rights and privileges of the nobility. In accordance with the adopted laws, both Lodomer and John were authorized to review the late Ladislaus' land donations. For instance, Andrew confirmed the powerful lord Amadeus Aba as isp√°n of Ung County in 1290, upon the request of the two archbishops. The skilled soldier Abraham the Red was also granted landholdings upon the advice of Lodomer and John in June 1291. In the following years, several royal land donations were strengthened by the seals of the two archbishops, for instance in the case of George Baksa in August 1291 (for his role in the war against Austria) and Radoslav Baboniƒá in July 1293 (for the successful liberation of Ugrin Cs√°k). From 1291 to 1293, altogether twelve royal charters emphasize the active advisory role of Lodomer and John, which imply significant influence over the monarch in political and economic affairs. In order to establish the new monarch's political alliance with foreign realms, Lodomer and John Hont- P√°zm√°ny welcomed the arriving Queen Fenenna in Upper Hungary; she became the first wife of Andrew III before the end of 1290. In the next year, Andrew III invaded Austria, forcing Duke Albert to withdraw his garrisons from the towns and fortresses that he had captured years before. Following that Lodomer and John Hont-P√°zm√°ny negotiated with Albert's envoys Bernhard of Prambach, Bishop of Passau and Leopold, Bishop of Seckau about the conditions for peace. The Peace of Hainburg, which concluded the war, was signed on 26 August 1291, and three days later Andrew and Albert of Austria confirmed it at their meeting in K√∂pcs√©ny (now Kopƒçany in Slovakia). In accordance with the prelates' goal, the peace treaty prescribed the destruction of the fortresses that Albert of Austria had seized from the K≈ëszegis earlier. For the archbishops, this meant lasting peace with the western neighbor and breakdown of the power of the K≈ëszegi family, a constant threat to the royal power. The Hungarian prelates, under the leadership of Lodomer, became the strongest pillars of the royal power, to protect the national sovereignty of the kingdom even against the pope's aspirations. They pursued an independent policy, maintaining an influence and pressure on Andrew, whose legitimacy was questionable due to his uncertain origin. On 31 January 1291, Pope Nicholas IV sent a letter to John, in which he expressed disappointment that the archbishop failed to continue the correspondence to inform the Holy See about the domestic conditions in Hungary, including the situation of the heretics and the pagans in the Archdiocese of Kalocsa. The Peace of Hainburg resulted that K≈ëszegis rose up in open rebellion against Andrew in spring 1292, acknowledging Charles Martel of Anjou, as King of Hungary, whose claim was also supported by the Holy See. From 1293 to 1298, sources rarely mentions John's name separately. As chancellor, he transcribed three royal charters upon the request of Michael, provost of Buda in January 1295. He successfully recovered the tithe of Csepel for the Bishopric of Veszpr√©m from Queen Agnes, Andrew's second spouse in April 1296. =Head of the royal council= The wealthy and prominent baron Matthew Cs√°k, who inherited large-scale domains in Upper Hungary, turned against Andrew at the end of 1297. This personally affected John, because the Hont-P√°zm√°ny clan's landholdings laid in the region (Nyitra, Bars and Esztergom counties), in the neighborhood of the aggressively expanding lord's territory. John's brothers, Andrew, Iv√°nka and Nicholas picked fight against the rebellious baron, also representing the monarch's interests, who excused them from all the damage caused to the Cs√°k brothers, Matthew and Cs√°k, and their familiares. Around the same time, his long-time ally Lodomer died on 2 January 1298, thus John became the most senior member of the Hungarian prelacy. In early February 1298, John escorted Andrew to Vienna, who visited Albert of Austria and promised to support him against Adolf of Nassau, King of Germany. Gregory Bicskei was elected as Lodomer's successor shortly thereafter. During that time, he was considered a loyal partisan of Andrew III, along with the other prelates of the church in Hungary. His relationship with the monarch and the other prelates had deteriorated permanently in the next six months. Historians agree that Bicskei wanted to reach the papal confirmation of his election as soon as possible, as a result he turned against Andrew and his courtiers, and became a strong advocate of the claim of Charles of Anjou to the Hungarian throne, who also enjoyed Pope Boniface VIII's support. With this step, Bicskei intended to disrupt the unity of the Hungarian prelates, but the suffragan bishops remained faithful to the monarch, with the leadership of John Hont-P√°zm√°ny. The new archbishop of Esztergom refused to attend that assembly of the prelates, noblemen, Saxons, Sz√©kelys, and Cumans, which was summoned by Andrew in Pest in the summer of 1298. Bicskei also forbade the prelates to participate at a new diet which was held around May 1299. In the same time, he convened a synod to Veszpr√©m with his self-declared authority of legate, and obliged the bishops to participate at the event, with the threat of excommunication. However, John and the bishops ignored the archbishop's order. On 6 July 1299, Emeric, Bishop of V√°rad was commissioned to send a letter to Pope Boniface to interpret the complaints of Andrew III, Archbishop John and the \\"entire prelacy and nobility\\" regarding the behavior of Bicskei and asked Boniface to place them under papal patronage against Bicskei. The portrait of Andrew III, painted by Anton Boys (16th century) Because of Bicskei's resistance and political isolation, John became de facto head of the Hungarian Catholic Church until his death. In response to Bicskei's actions and Pope Boniface's support for the Capetian House of Anjou, John and his fellow bishops initiated the convocation of the 1298 national diet, which, excluding the participation of Andrew III and the barons of the realm, proved to be a watershed in the constitutional system of Hungary and the formation of the parliamentary system. During the diet, Andrew's maternal uncle, Albertino Morosini was granted Hungarian nobility. The phrase \\"universitas regni\\", which first appears in the final act, implies that the participants of the national diet summed up the community of the kingdom as a whole. One of the (23rd) articles of the 1298 diet established a four-member lesser council within the royal council, consisting of two nobles (representatives of the \\"nobility with uniform status\\") and two prelates (suffragans each belonging to the archdioceses of Esztergom and Kalocsa) with a three-month term. One of the noble councilors was Thomas Hont-P√°zm√°ny, Archbishop John's brother, despite his magnate of origin, which reflects the influence of their clan over the royal court. Their veto power prevented Bicskei from sabotaging the operation of the royal council, which resulted his total isolation in the state government, despite his nominal leading position in the royal council. John and the prelates had a virtually exclusive right to elect the four council members; both Thomas Hont-P√°zm√°ny and Henry Balog were considered supporters of the Hungarian clergy. Several other articles of the national diet provided rights for John and the prelates to review the king's decisions and extended the right to ecclesiastical sanction against the barons and even the king, in order to defend Church interests and property. The articles emphasized the authority of the archbishop of Kalocsa, which confirmed John's status as head of the Church in Hungary. Although Bicskei unsuccessfully attempt to shift the prelates from supporting Andrew, but the king' confidence in the Hungarian clergy was shaken due to his activity and the subsequent pro-prelate resolutions of the 1298 diet, as a result he shortly entered into a formal alliance with five influential barons, including Amadeus Aba and Stephen √Åkos, who stated that they were willing to support him against the Pope and the bishops. Seeing the increased influence of John at the expense of royal authority, Andrew did not want to rely solely on the bishops during his reign. After the rebellious Baboniƒá family swore loyalty to Andrew in the summer of 1299, the monarch received them into his grace on 1 August upon the advice of Albertino Morosini, John Hont-P√°zm√°ny and the prelates of the realm. John and eight other bishops sealed the document, demonstrating the political unity of the Hungarian prelates. However, other events began to disrupt the political unity and stability that had developed. The conflict has recurred between Andrew III and Matthew Cs√°k by the second half of 1299. Following a failed royal campaign led by Demetrius Balassa against the Cs√°k territory, the oligarch's troops invaded the central parts of Upper Hungary. Archbishop John's brothers Andrew and Iv√°nka were killed in the skirmish. Around the same time, a harsh dispute emerged between Peter Monoszl√≥, Bishop of Transylvania and Andrew, Bishop of Eger in the question of jurisdiction over the sparsely populated M√°ramaros region (today Maramure»ô in Romania). Andrew III, confirming the decisions of his predecessors, granted the jurisdiction over M√°ramaros to the Diocese of Eger. After Peter Monoszl√≥'s protest and pressure, he changed his intention, withdrawing the decision, and handed over the matter to the competence of John Hont-P√°zm√°ny in February 1299. As Andrew of Eger did not present at the archbishopric chancellery and Emeric, Bishop of V√°rad conducted on-site inspections among the local noblemen, who mostly supported Peter, King Andrew III decided to donate M√°ramaros to the Diocese of Transylvania. In response, Bishop Andrew has launched a new lawsuit, while Peter initiated an investigation to the Holy See, arguing with the unauthorized nature of the secular courts. This was the first sign of the disintegration of unity among the Hungarian bishops, which also jeopardized the functioning of the royal council they dominated. =Coronation of Wenceslaus= Andrew III of Hungary died on 14 January 1301, leaving no male heirs. He was the last male member of the √Årp√°d dynasty. On hearing his death, Charles of Anjou hurried to Esztergom where Gregory Bicskei crowned him king in the spring of 1301. Being Pope Boniface's candidate for the Hungarian throne, Charles had always been unpopular, because the majority of the Hungarian lords feared that they would \\"lose their freedom by accepting a king appointed by the Church\\", according to the Illuminated Chronicle. Charles's coronation was not performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, as it was required by customary law, but with a provisional crown in Esztergom. John Hont-P√°zm√°ny and the overwhelming majority of the prelates also challenged Charles' legitimacy. They resided in Buda and guarded the crown jewelries. It is possible they also played a role in that action, when the burghers of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r closed the city gate and did not allow Charles' entourage. The barons and the prelates summoned a national diet at Buda, which declared Charles's coronation invalid. The ruins of Plaveƒç Castle (Palocsa) in Slovakia The participants of the diet also decided to offer the crown to another cognatic descendant of the √Årp√°ds, the young Wenceslaus and sent a delegation to his father to Bohemia. John Hont-P√°zm√°ny was also a member of that diplomatic mission, along with several barons (for instance, Dominic R√°t√≥t and Henry K≈ëszegi) and bishops. Wenceslaus II met the Hungarian envoys in Hodon√≠n in August and accepted their offer in his eleven-year-old son's name. Wenceslaus II accompanied his son to Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r where John Hont- P√°zm√°ny crowned the young Wenceslaus king with the Holy Crown on 27 August. The legitimacy of his coronation was also questionable because customary law authorized the Archbishop of Esztergom to perform the ceremony. The new monarch appointed John as chancellor of the royal court. He was also granted the castle of Palocsa (present-day Plaveƒç, Slovakia) and its accessories by Wenceslaus in September. It is possible that royal charter refers to the monarch's principal advisor Jan Muskata, the Bishop of Krak√≥w, instead of John Hont-P√°zm√°ny. In his letters to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Archbishop John of Kalocsa, Pope Boniface VIII emphasized that Wenceslaus had been crowned without the authorization of the Holy See. His legate Niccolo Boccasini, who came to Hungary in September, started negotiations with the Hungarian prelates to convince them to abandon Wenceslaus and support Charles of Anjou's case. Through his envoy, the pope summoned John to the Roman Curia on 17 October 1301, because of his \\"reckless transgression and foolish act\\", which referred to his dominant role in the coronation. John was given a deadline of four months to appear before the court, otherwise he will be stripped of his office and the archbishopric of Kalocsa will be declared vacant. However, John Hont- P√°zm√°ny died soon or already at the time of sending the letter, sometime between 26 September and 8 November 1301. John died in Buda. He was buried at the local Franciscan church devoted to St. John.

Earlier historiographical works also refer to him Ivan N√©met√∫jv√°ri (, , ). He was Palatine in 1281, between 1287 and 1288, and from 1302 until 1307, Ban of Slavonia in 1275, from 1284 until 1285 and in 1290, and Master of the treasury in 1276 and 1291. Originating from the powerful K≈ëszegi family, his career was characterized by series of rebellions and violations of the law against the royal power. As one of the so-called oligarchs, he established a province in Western Transdanubia, which laid in the borderlands of Hungary with Austria, and ruled Gy≈ër, Sopron, Moson, Vas and Zala counties de facto independently of the monarchs by the 1280s. Beside his rebellions in Hungary, he waged wars with the Duchy of Austria too. Because of his plundering and looting raids against the Styrian provinces, he was dubbed as \\"greedy wolf\\" by the Austrian chronicles. During the era of feudal anarchy, he usually played a role of \\"kingmaker\\". For instance, he invited Andrew the Venetian to the throne against the reigning Ladislaus IV of Hungary three times (1278, 1287, 1290). He initially supported Andrew III after his accession to the throne, but from 1292 he turned against the king and became a partisan of the pretender, Charles Martel, Duke of Salerno. After the extinction of the √Årp√°d dynasty in 1301, he betrayed the House of Anjou too and played an important role in the subsequent succession war as the partisan of Wenceslaus, then Otto. Family Ivan (also John) was born in the 1240s into the wealthy and influential K≈ëszegi family, originating from the gens (clan) H√©der, as one of the four sons of the powerful lord Henry I K≈ëszegi. His brothers were Nicholas I, Henry II ‚Äì who were also elevated into high dignities during the age of the late √Årp√°ds ‚Äì and Peter, the Bishop of Veszpr√©m from 1275 till his murder in 1289. His marriage to an unidentified noblewoman produced three children. His eldest son was Gregory, who held some minor offices before predeceased him in 1297. He left two sons, Nicholas III and Andrew, who inherited Ivan's wealth and dominion in 1308.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus H√©der 4. K≈ëszegi [and Rohonci] branch) Ivan also had an unnamed daughter, who married a certain Dominic, a familiaris of her father. During his advanced age, Ivan's younger son John the \\"Wolf\\" was born in the 1300s; after his downfall in Hungary, he integrated into the Austrian nobility, becoming ancestor of the Bernstein (or Pernstein) family. Ivan also had an illegitimate son, Nicholas, who was born in 1282 from an extramarital affair. Nicholas served as Bishop of Gy≈ër from 1308 to 1336. Early career Ivan K≈ëszegi first appeared in contemporary records in March 1265, when he participated in the Battle of Isaszeg alongside his father Henry and brother Nicholas. During the civil war between B√©la IV of Hungary and his son Duke Stephen, Ivan's father was a staunch supporter of the king and led the royal army against the duke. However Stephen gained a decisive victory over his father's army, and Henry K≈ëszegi and his two sons were captured. His defeater Pousa Tengerdi presented the fettered prisoner Ivan K≈ëszegi in the ducal court of Stephen following the clash. The K≈ëszegis were being held as prisoners and after the Battle of Isaszeg, B√©la IV was forced to accept the authority of Stephen in the eastern parts of the kingdom. On 23 March 1266, father and son confirmed the peace in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on 'Rabbits' Island and Henry and his two sons, alongside others, were released from captivity. Stephen V ascended the Hungarian throne in May 1270, following his father's death. In response, the king's sister Anna seized the royal treasury and fled to Bohemia. Several magnates and B√©la's closest advisors followed her and left Hungary, including Henry K≈ëszegi, who handed over K≈ëszeg, Borosty√°nk≈ë (Bernstein, Austria) and other castles along the western borders to Ottokar II. In the same time, Ivan K≈ëszegi also handed over his \\"two castles called Sztrig√≥\\" (today ≈†trigova, Croatia), which laid in Zala County, to the Bohamian king. Henry and his sons had spent the next two years in exile at Ottokar's court in Prague. Their departure caused a war between Hungary and Bohemia, which lasted until the conclusion of an agreement in Pressburg in July 1271. According to their treaty, Stephen V promised that he would not assist Ottokar's opponents in Carinthia, and Ottokar II renounced the castles he and his partisans held in Hungary. The royal armies soon recaptured K≈ëszeg, Borosty√°nk≈ë and other fortresses along the western border of Hungary. Henry K≈ëszegi and his sons returned from Bohemia to Hungary following Stephen's death in the summer of 1272. His ten-year-old son Ladislaus IV ascended the throne. During his minority, many groupings of barons fought against each other for supreme power. The arriving Henry K≈ëszegi brutally murdered Ladislaus' cousin, B√©la of Macs√≥, the only adult male member of the √Årp√°d dynasty. The K≈ëszegis entered alliance with the Gutkeleds and the Geregyes, forming one of the two main baronial groups (the other one was dominated by the Cs√°k and Monoszl√≥ clans). Ivan's father became a key figure in the early stage of the era of so-called feudal anarchy. When Henry extended his dominance in the royal council, Ivan served as isp√°n of Zala County ‚Äì where his initial lands mostly laid ‚Äì from September 1272 to March 1273 (with a short interruption in November 1272). In this capacity, he participated in private initiative Hungarian incursions into Austria and Moravia, Ottokar's realms in February 1273, along with Matthew Cs√°k, Denis P√©c, Joachim and Amadeus Gutkeled. Thereafter, Ivan functioned as isp√°n of Sopron County between June 1273 and September 1274. In retaliation for Hungarian incursions, Ottokar's troops invaded the borderlands of Hungary in April 1273. They captured Gy≈ër and Szombathely, plundering the western counties. The royal council sent Joachim Gutkeled and Ivan K≈ëszegi to recapture the castle of Gy≈ër. K≈ëszegi also participated in the battle at Laa in August. However Ottokar II launched a successful retaliatory strike in the autumn of 1273, and seized many fortresses again, including Gy≈ër and Sopron. Ivan successfully defended Kapuv√°r () by destroying the dam at the river V√°g (V√°h) and flooding the surrounding area. Thereafter he fought in Pereszteg and L√≥s, harassing the invading Bohemian army with hit-and-run tactics. He unsuccessfully tried to recapture Sopron from the Bohemian troops. Ivan lost influence for a brief time after the Battle of F√∂veny in late September 1274, when Peter Cs√°k defeated the united forces of the K≈ëszegis and the Gutkeleds. Henry K≈ëszegi was killed, but his sons Nicholas and Ivan managed to flee the battlefield, withdrawing their troops to the borderlands between Hungary and Austria. Thereafter Peter Cs√°k and the young Ladislaus IV gathered an army against the K≈ëszegis' domain in the autumn of 1274; their troops marched into Western Hungary, pillaging the brothers' landholdings. Nicholas and Ivan barricaded themselves in the castle of Szal√≥nak (present-day Stadtschlaining, Austria). The royal army besieged the fort, but failed to capture it because of the coming winter. Through his ambitious and unscrupulous sons, the K≈ëszegi family survived their paterfamilias' death. Powerful baron =Rebellions against Ladislaus IV= Despite their violent actions against the monarch, the K≈ëszegis regained their influence and retook the power by the spring of 1275, when Nicholas became Palatine, and Ivan was made Ban of Slavonia, at first jointly with Nicholas Gutkeled, later solely. In this capacity, K≈ëszegi was responsible for the territory between the river Drava and the Kapela Mountains, while Gutkeled administered the Adriatic Coast (the dignity of Ban of Croatia emerged from that time in the Kingdom of Hungary). Ivan K≈ëszegi lost his dignity by the autumn of 1275, when the Cs√°ks retook the positions in the royal council. Thereafter the Cs√°k group launched a massive military campaign against the K≈ëszegi and Gutkeled dominions; while Ugrin Cs√°k attacked Joachim Gutkeled's forces at F√∂veny, Peter Cs√°k plundered and devastated the territory of the Diocese of Veszpr√©m which headed by Bishop Peter K≈ëszegi, Ivan's brother. Joachim Gutkeled and the K≈ëszegis again removed their opponents from power at an assembly of the barons and noblemen at Buda around 21 June 1276. Ivan became Master of the treasury during that time, while Nicholas elevated into the position of Palatine of Hungary for the second time. Beside that Ivan was also isp√°n of B√°nya (√Årkib√°nya) isp√°nate, which laid in the territory of Nyitra County. K≈ëszeg Castle, owned by Ivan and his descendants after 1279 Joachim Gutkeled died while battling against the Baboniƒái in April 1277. A month later, the general assembly declared Ladislaus IV to be of age, who was also authorized to restore internal peace with all possible means. These events ended the five-year chaotic conditions in the realm. The K≈ëszegis and the Baboniƒái divided the Gutkeled's province between each other on the border of Transdanubia and Slavonia. Sometimes in the second half of the 1270s, Nicholas and Ivan handed over the family's landholdings in Vara≈ædin County to their much younger brother Henry. In the course of the division of lands between the two elder brothers in 1279, Ivan was granted K≈ëszeg, Borosty√°nk≈ë and S√°rv√°r, while Szentvid and L√©ka (present-day Lockenhaus, Austria) went to Nicholas' property. Since then, Ivan K≈ëszegi began to pursue an independent policy from Nicholas, which contributed to the establishment of an oligarchic province by the end of the 13th century. Simultaneously Ladislaus IV defeated his allies, the Geregyes, Ivan attempted to play off the late Stephen V's first cousin, Andrew the Venetian, against Ladislaus. Upon his invitation, the duke came to Hungary for the first time in 1278. Andrew demanded Slavonia for himself, adopting the title of \\"Duke of Slavonia, Dalmatia and Croatia\\" and marched as far as Lake Balaton with K≈ëszegi's troops. Duke Andrew also made Ivan as treasurer of his ducal court. In addition, Ivan K≈ëszegi was styled as isp√°n of Zala County too from 1278 to 1279. Andrew achieved nothing, however, and went back to Venice in autumn, because the Hungarian royal troops played a decisive role in Rudolf's victory over Ottokar II in the Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August, which strengthened Ladislaus' domestic political positions. Thereafter the K≈ëszegi brothers pledged allegiance to Ladislaus IV in early 1279, with the mediation of the arriving papal legate, Philip, Bishop of Fermo. The K≈ëszegi brothers stayed away from the conflict between Ladislaus IV and Philip of Fermo, which emerged over the question of treatment of the pagan Cumans in Hungary. Taking advantage of the chaotic situation following the papal legate's arrival, Nicholas, Ivan and Henry plundered the estates of the Diocese of Zagreb at various times in the following months. As a result, Timothy, Bishop of Zagreb excommunicated them in March 1281. According to the bishop's letter to the other prelates in the realm, Ivan K≈ëszegi held the isp√°nates of Orb√°sz (Vrbas), Szana, Garics (Podgaric) and Gecske (Gacka) in Slavonia and Croatia during the excommunication, and also usurped the Gerzence (Gare≈°nica) lordship from the diocese. Following Philip's departure from Hungary in the autumn of 1281, Ivan K≈ëszegi was made Palatine of Hungary by Ladislaus IV despite his earlier crime; the young king wanted revenge on those barons who have captured him during his conflict with the papal legate. As historian Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs noted, this appointment marked a recurrence to the anarchic-type changes of governments, which characterized the first five regnal years of the minor Ladislaus. Ivan K≈ëszegi actively participated in the subsequent war against the rebellious Finta Aba in mid-1281. His troops were present at the sieges of Gede and Szal√°nc castles (present-day Hodejov and Slanec, Slovakia). Yet, he was soon dismissed and replaced as Palatine by Matthew Cs√°k under unknown circumstances at turn of 1281 and 1282. Bernstein Castle (Borosty√°nk≈ë), owned by Ivan K≈ëszegi and his heirs Since the early 1280s, Nicholas and Ivan K≈ëszegi extended their influence over Sopron County, taking advantage of that both powerful leaders of the neighboring Cs√°k clan, Matthew II and Peter had died by 1283 or 1284. During this course, Ivan embroiled in conflict with several members of the native Osl clan in the county. At the end of 1283, Ladislaus IV laid siege to Borosty√°nk≈ë, which was held by Ivan. However, he resisted, forcing the king to lift the siege in early 1284. During the royal campaign, Ivan captured Herbord II Osl and held him in captivity. Subsequently, several documents refer to Ivan's violent actions against local landowners, including the Osls in the region. According to historian Gyula Krist√≥, Ivan brought whole Sopron County under his jurisdiction and annexed it to his emerging oligarchic province by 1285, when several local nobles were mentioned as his familiares. The advancing K≈ëszegi troops gradually also displaced another local strongman Conrad Gy≈ër from the region, who had once possessed huge landholdings in Moson County. Conrad's lands laid in the boundaries of interests of the two most powerful and aggressive oligarchic provinces ‚Äì Ivan K≈ëszegi seized his villages one after another in Moson County by the mid-1280s and handed over them to their familiares and relatives, the H√©derv√°ris, while the Cs√°ks expelled him from Pozsony County. Ivan K≈ëszegi also persuaded the members of the J√°k clan by threat and violence to hand over to him their inherited lands in Sopron and Vas counties through unprofitable contracts. Following his failure, Ladislaus had to reconcile with the K≈ëszegi brothers in the spring of 1284. While Nicholas became again Palatine, Ivan was appointed Ban of Slavonia. He held the dignity until the next year. Ladislaus spent the last years of his life wandering from place to place, staying among his Cuman subjects. Hungary's central government lost power because the prelates and the barons ruled the kingdom independently of the monarch. Ivan K≈ëszegi launched an individual foreign policy at the borderlands between Austria and Hungary, establishing a de facto independent province, which threatened both realms. Contemporary Austrian chronicles ‚Äì the Annales Sancti Rudperti Salisburgensis and Ottokar aus der Gaal's Steirische Reimchronik (\\"Styrian Rhyming Chronicle\\") ‚Äì preserved Ivan's serious clash with Albert I, Duke of Austria in 1285. Accordingly, the K≈ëszegi troops invaded the neighboring Habsburg lands and marched into Wiener Neustadt, devastating the region and looting the settlements along the river Leitha. Initially, Albert tried to settle the conflict by negotiation, but the pillage of the Austrian and Styrian borderlands \\"has become commonplace\\" on Ivan's part. Therefore, the duke summoned his army from the Austria, Styria and Swabia and commissioned his councillor Hermann von Landenberg to lead his forces into Hungary. The Austrians intended to besiege Borosty√°nk≈ë, but Ivan asked for help from his three brothers, Nicholas, Peter and Henry, who recruited an army of 1,000 people. This was the source of uncertainty in Landenberg's army. Taking advantage of their inaction, Ivan K≈ëszegi and his troops encircled the enemy and shot their camp with arrows. Several Austrian nobles were captured during the skirmish. After that Albert made a covenant with the K≈ëszegis; in return for the release of prisoners, the duke promised he will support Ivan K≈ëszegi's any efforts and ambitions in the Kingdom of Hungary against all his opponents, excluding the Holy Roman Empire, which was ruled by Albert's father Rudolf. The duke also proclaimed that he took Ivan under his protection and considered the Hungarian oligarch as his subject. In response, Ivan guaranteed that he put his forces for Albert's disposal, if necessary. Archbishop Lodomer persuaded Ladislaus to convene a general assembly in the early summer of 1286 in order to reconciliation between the king and the K≈ëszegi brothers. There Ladislaus provided one-year grace period to the K≈ëszegis and their familiares. In September 1286, the king managed a self-coup, expelling members of the K≈ëszegi‚ÄìBorsa baronial group from the royal council. Neglecting the K≈ëszegis' rival, the Aba clan, Ladislaus IV appointed his own loyal soldiers and lesser nobles to the high positions. Thereafter Ladislaus IV launched his fifth and last royal campaign against the K≈ëszegi territory in November 1286. The king seized K≈ëszeg, but Ivan managed to escape. He and his brothers moved to the left bank of the Danube, they also captured Pressburg Castle for a brief time. Duke Albert took advantage of the opportunity, and marched into Hungary, where his army successfully besieged and seized Pressburg from the K≈ëszegis in the spring of 1287. Simultaneously, the K≈ëszegis' allies, the Borsa brothers ‚Äì Roland and James ‚Äì arrived from Transtisia; they joint troops defeated Ladislaus' army at the river Zsitva (≈Ωitava) in March. After a new reconciliation, Ivan K≈ëszegi was appointed Palatine of Hungary, he was first mentioned in this capacity in June 1287. He was also styled as isp√°n of Sopron County since that year until at least 1295, but it is plausible that he bore the title until his death. As Palatine, Ivan K≈ëszegi summoned three \\"general assemblies\\" (generalis congregatio) for \\"the will of all nobles and free men with other social status of Vas County\\" in Szombathely in June 1288. This was the first time when a palatine convened a county assembly in his own right, neglecting the monarch's contribution. Gyula Krist√≥ writes, Ivan summoned the assembly explicitly without the permission of Ladislaus. In the same year, Ivan K≈ëszegi exchanged his castle of Plo≈°ƒáica in Slavonia (today ruins in Ivanska, Croatia) with the Gutkeleds for their lands in Vas County. Ivan K≈ëszegi and his brothers involved in the conflict between Duke Albert and Rudolf von Hoheneck, the Archbishop of Salzburg over the affiliation of the Admont Abbey. The archbishop complained that his subject, abbot Henry entered the duke's service as captain-general of Styria and threatened those clergymen with excommunication, who held secular positions in the ducal court. In response, Albert confiscated the abbey and the surrounding Enns Valley from the archdiocese. Rudolf gathered his army at the end of 1288. He entered alliance with the K≈ëszegis and took an oath that he will support them in their efforts against Duke Albert. In accordance with the agreement, as the Steirische Reimchronik narrates, Ivan K≈ëszegi sent his 300 soldiers to invade Styria and plunder Radkersburg. The chronicles say Ivan looted the surrounding cities and settlements like a \\"greedy wolf\\" (). His attack soon resulted an escalation into a large-scale war in the borderlands between Austria and Hungary. Duke Albert launched a massive royal campaign (\\"G√ºssing Feud\\"; ) with his 15,000-size army against the K≈ëszegis and their familiares' castles and forts in the spring of 1289. The Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses and settlements along the western borders, including Nagymarton (Mattersburg), N√©met√∫jv√°r (G√ºssing), Sopron (√ñdenburg), Kabold (Kobersdorf), Szal√≥nak (Stadtschlaining), Rohonc (Rechnitz) and √ìv√°r (Altenburg). Albert later launched two additional expeditions against the K≈ëszegis in the remaining year; his troops captured K≈ëszeg (October) then Szentvid (December) too. Ivan managed to defend Borosty√°nk≈ë only on 26 September. According to Albert's chronicles, Ivan K≈ëszegi ordered to mutilate his 500 Austrian prisoners of war. Despite these conquests at the expense of the Hungarian realm, Ladislaus IV did not intervene in the war, and passively supported Duke Albert. =Andrew's ally then enemy= With the consent of Lodomer, Ivan K≈ëszegi offered the crown to the king's distant relative Andrew the Venetian. After twelve years, the pretender returned to Hungary at the beginning of 1290. He appointed Ivan K≈ëszegi as Ban of Slavonia and isp√°n of Vas County. Before Andrew was successful, however, Ivan's local enemy Arnold Hah√≥t captured and sent him to the court of Duke Albert in Vienna. Ladislaus IV was assassinated by his Cuman subjects in July 1290. After his release, Archbishop Lodomer crowned Andrew III king in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r on 23 July 1290. Although Ivan K≈ëszegi and Lodomer jointly invited Andrew to the Hungarian throne, their motivation was different: the oligarch wanted a new controllable and weak- handed ruler to lead the kingdom instead of the unpredictable Ladislaus, while Lodomer and his suffragans were aimed to strengthen the royal power to put an end to the political anarchy. Due to his short-term interests in order to recover his lost castles and estates, Ivan initially supported Andrew's efforts. He handed over the dignity of Ban of Slavonia to his younger brother Henry by October 1290. Ivan was referred to as Master of the treasury from February to October 1291. He also administered the B√°nya isp√°nate beside that. As Rudolf I of Germany attempted to bestow Hungary on his own son, Duke Albert of Austria, on 31 August 1290, Andrew III also had temporary interest community with the K≈ëszegis. At first, Andrew restored √ìv√°r in April 1291. After the failure of the diplomatic negotiations between the two realms, Ivan and his two brothers participated in the king's military campaign in the summer of 1291, when the Hungarian troops invaded Austria, forcing Albert to withdraw his garrisons from the towns and fortresses ‚Äì including Pressburg and Sopron ‚Äì that he had captured two years before, many of which were held by the K≈ëszegis before their conquest. Albert I, Duke of Austria (also King of Germany since 1298), painted by Anton Boys The Peace of Hainburg, which concluded the war, was signed on 26 August 1291. The peace treaty prescribed the destruction of the fortresses that Albert had seized from the K≈ëszegis, which was in the interests of both monarchs. The K≈ëszegis were outraged at Andrew's move. Ivan lost his dignity of Master of the treasury and his position in the royal council around October, while Nicholas was also replaced as Palatine. At the turn of 1291 and 1292, Ivan K≈ëszegi met papal legate John, Bishop of Iesi. During their negotiations, Ivan proclaimed that he will only recognize that king who is supported by the Holy See, which had definitely meant the betrayal of Andrew. After a few months of tension, the K≈ëszegi brothers rose up in open rebellion against Andrew in spring 1292, acknowledging the late Ladislaus' nephew, Charles Martel of Anjou, as King of Hungary. As a political gesture, his father Charles II of Naples perpetually donated Vas and Sopron counties to Ivan and his son Gregory, as fiefdoms, which element of feudalism was unaccustomed in Hungary. Since then the isp√°nate of Vas County was usurped by Ivan and his descendants without interruption until 1327. Simultaneously, in a letter, Charles Martel's mother Queen Mary of Naples authorized \\"her beloved follower\\" Ivan to launch a war against Andrew, \\"the usurper of the Hungarian throne and his accomplices\\". While Nicholas fought against the future oligarch, but still a courtly knight, Matthew III Cs√°k in Pozsony County, Ivan was active in Vas and Zala counties. He besieged and occupied the fort of Buz√°dsziget from Andrew's faithful partisan Atyusz Hah√≥t. The royal troops subdued the rebellion by July, but Ivan K≈ëszegi captured and imprisoned Andrew III during his journey to Slavonia for a brief time in August, as the Annales Mellicenses recorded. He entrusted his loyal castle warriors in Moson Castle to guard the prisoner. Andrew was liberated within four months, after his supporters sent their relatives as hostages to Ivan K≈ëszegi (one of them died in captivity). His protege Charles Martel died in August 1295, leaving Ivan without external support. Andrew III married Agnes, the daughter of Duke Albert of Austria in February 1296. Afterwards, with his father-in-law's support, Andrew launched another war against the K≈ëszegis in August 1296. While the Austrian troops besieged Ivan's some castles, Archbishop Lodomer excommunicated the brothers. By October, the royal army managed to capture only K≈ëszeg and two other forts from Ivan K≈ëszegi. While Ivan K≈ëszegi remained rebellious for the remaining part of the reign of Andrew, his brother Nicholas pledged allegiance to the monarch after the 1296 rebellion, their political orientations had separated from each other. Around that year the emerging Matthew Cs√°k overshadowed the K≈ëszegis as the monarch's most dangerous enemies. The river Danube marked the border between the developing domains of the K≈ëszegi and Cs√°k families. After the close of the 1298 diet, Andrew III entered into a formal alliance with five influential barons ‚Äì Amadeus Aba, Stephen √Åkos, Dominic R√°t√≥t, Demetrius Balassa and Paul Sz√©cs ‚Äì who stated that they were willing to support him against the \\"rebellious lords\\", which term definitely primarily covered Matthew Cs√°k and the K≈ëszegi brothers. Ivan K≈ëszegi still supported the claim of the House of Anjou. After his election, the pro-Angevin Archbishop Gregory Bicskei absolved Ivan and Henry from the excommunication in March 1299. Bicskei resided in Transdanubia under the protection of Ivan; he even moved to Szentkereszt Castle beyond the Drava river between Koprivnica and Kri≈æevci, owned by Ivan K≈ëszegi, who remained the only rebellious member of his family by that year (Nicholas died soon and Henry attended the national diet and acted as one of the mediators between Bicskei and his pro-Andrew suffragans). Ivan K≈ëszegi was among the group of those powerful lords, who urged Charles II of Naples to send his grandson, the 12-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary in order to become king. However, by the young pretender's arrival in the summer of 1300, the K≈ëszegis and Matthew Cs√°k were shortly reconciled with Andrew, preventing Charles' success. Historian Attila Zsoldos argued Andrew III entered into a new feudal contract with the barons in the summer of 1300: Matthew Cs√°k and Ivan K≈ëszegi (who was the most senior member of the family after Nicholas' death) became \\"perpetual\\" Palatines and Andrew accepted their suzerainty over their provinces, while the king's two most powerful partisans, Amadeus Aba and Stephen √Åkos were also granted this privilege. In addition to them, two co-palatines of the previous year, Roland R√°t√≥t and Apor P√©c also received the title as a counterweight, according to Zsoldos' theory. =During the Interregnum= The oligarchic provinces in the early 14th century Andrew III died on 14 April 1301. With his death, the √Årp√°d dynasty became extinct. Ivan K≈ëszegi was a central figure of the subsequent period of interregnum, which lasted for seven years and various claimants ‚Äì Charles of Anjou, Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and Otto of Bavaria ‚Äì fought for the Hungarian throne. Taking advantage of the emerging chaotic situation, Ivan cooperated with his former rival and enemy, Hermann von Landenberg and seized the Pannonhalma Abbey and its surrounding lands. His family unlawfully possessed the abbey until their downfall in 1317. In the following months, Ivan also captured the royal castle of √ìv√°r. In the early 14th century, Hungary had disintegrated into about a dozen independent provinces, each ruled by a powerful lord, or oligarch. Among them, Matthew Cs√°k dominated the northwestern parts of Hungary (which now form the western territories of present-day Slovakia), Amadeus Aba controlled the northeastern lands, Ivan and Henry K≈ëszegi ruled Transdanubia and the northern parts of Slavonia, James Borsa dominated Tisz√°nt√∫l, and Ladislaus K√°n governed Transylvania. Ivan K≈ëszegi was referred to as Palatine since February 1302. In the upcoming years, seven barons held the dignity simultaneously. Majority of the historians, including Gyula Krist√≥ and Jen≈ë Sz≈±cs, considered, these barons, for instance, Matthew Cs√°k, Amadeus Aba, Ivan K≈ëszegi and Stephen √Åkos were arbitrarily styled themselves palatines, usurping the position, which marked its devaluation. However, in accordance with Attila Zsoldos' theory (as presented above), the claimants to the Hungarian throne inherited Andrew's last decision, and they were forced to accept the status quo. As Zsoldos emphasized the oligarchs recognized each other's titles, in addition to the monarchs, cathedral chapters and other institutions. Accordingly, Ivan K≈ëszegi was considered a \\"perpetual\\" Palatine, alongside other powerful lords. He performed his judicial role in his territorial province (Sopron, Vas and Zala counties), in addition to Veszpr√©m County, where acted as an judge in June 1303 in a lawsuit between the chapter of Veszpr√©m and some local nobles over the ownership of Csopak. Beside his dignity of Palatine, Ivan was also styled as isp√°n of Moson and Sopron counties in 1303. Immediately after Andrew's death, Charles of Anjou hurried to Esztergom where he was crowned king irregularly. Being Pope Boniface VIII's candidate for the Hungarian throne, Charles had always been unpopular, because the Hungarian lords feared that they would \\"lose their freedom by accepting a king appointed by the Church\\", as the Illuminated Chronicle narrates. Despite his nominal pro-Angevin standpoint in the 1290s, Ivan K≈ëszegi was among those lords, who supported Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. According to the narration of the Steirische Reimchronik, after Wenceslaus II met the Hungarian delegation in Hodon√≠n in the summer of 1301, the Bohemian king sent his envoy to K≈ëszegi and invited him to a personal meeting. The chronicle says K≈ëszegi departed Hungary from his castle of Kapuv√°r to Bohemia. There, instead of himself, Wenceslaus II offered his eleven-year-old namesake son, who was not only B√©la IV's great-great-grandson, but also the bride of the late Andrew III's daughter, Elizabeth, for the throne of Hungary. Ivan K≈ëszegi got a night-time thinking time. Returning to his accommodation, he found 1000 silver coins, many gold and silver treasures and scarlet broadcloth there. On the following day, K≈ëszegi accepted the king's offer, also referring to the generosity of the late Ottokar II, Wenceslaus' father, who had create him knight of Teutonic Order during his exile decades earlier. However, K≈ëszegi's main motivation behind his support was to defend his province against the House of Habsburg; Wenceslaus' opponent Charles of Anjou was the nephew of Duke Albert, who intended to enter alliance with his maternal relatives. Esztergom Castle, captured by Ivan K≈ëszegi twice Ivan and Henry were among those Hungarian lords, who moved to Brno in order to welcome the young Wenceslaus, who arrived to Hungary with his father's army. While Buda fell into Wenceslaus' arms, the castle of Esztergom was conquered by Ivan K≈ëszegi, expelling its pro-Angevin residents, including his former ally, Archbishop Gregory Bicskei. Subsequently, he handed the fort over to Bohemian royal mercenaries in return for a significant sum of money. Wenceslaus was crowned king with the Holy Crown by John Hont-P√°zm√°ny, Archbishop of Kalocsa on 27 August 1301. Ivan also attended the ceremony. After Wenceslaus's coronation, Charles withdrew to Ugrin Cs√°k's domains in the southern regions of the kingdom. Charles and his general Stephen Cs√°k laid siege to Buda, the capital of Wenceslaus' kingdom, in September 1302, but the arriving Ivan K≈ëszegi relieved the siege. Despite Pope Boniface declared Charles the lawful king of Hungary on 31 May 1303, Ivan remained a partisan of Wenceslaus. However many lords left the court of the P≈ôemyslid king and pledged loyalty to his rival in the following months, including Stephen √Åkos and the R√°t√≥ts. Historian Tam√°s K√°d√°r argues Matthew Cs√°k, who also left Wenceslaus in the same period but did not support Charles either, had tensions with Ivan over the affiliation of Kom√°rom County, inheriting their rivalry from their fathers, and their conflicts of interest caused his departure. On K≈ëszegi's advice, as the Steirische Reimchronik emphasizes, Wenceslaus II of Bohemia came to Hungary at the head of a large army in May 1304 to strengthen his son's position. The Bohemians entered the border at Holics (present-day Hol√≠ƒç, Slovakia), Ivan and his \\"relatives\\" joined his accompaniment. Marching towards the center of the kingdom, Wenceslaus recaptured Esztergom, looting its treasury, and handed it over to Ivan K≈ëszegi in June. However, his negotiations in Buda with the local lords convinced him that his son's position in Hungary had dramatically weakened, thus decided to take him back to Bohemia. The young Wenceslaus did not renounce Hungary and made Ivan K≈ëszegi governor of his realm before leaving for Bohemia in August. The Bohemian king even took the Holy Crown with himself to Prague. After the outbreak of scandal, Ivan K≈ëszegi faced general uproar and anger against his person; the barons blamed him for having lost the crown jewels. In response, Ivan promised through Bishop Benedict R√°d to recover the Holy Crown from Bohemia within a year, if they guarantee his safety. Thereafter, according to the Steirische Reimchronik, the \\"crafty palatine\\" sent a letter to Duke Otto of Bavaria, B√©la IV's grandson, and invited him to the Hungarian throne. Accordingly, Ivan wrote in his letter that Otto can prove his ability by acquiring the crown from the Bohemian court. The Illuminated Chronicle also confirms the K≈ëszegis initiated the arrival of the Bavarian duke to Hungary. After signing an alliance with his cousin, Charles and Rudolph III of Austria jointly invaded Bohemia in autumn 1304. His army plundered the nearby landholdings in Sopron and Moson counties, owned by Ivan K≈ëszegi and marched into Moravia. According to the short-spoken Anonymi Leobiensis Chronicon, Charles launched a royal campaign against Ivan K≈ëszegi in 1305; receiving assistance from Rudolf III, he captured the rebellious lord' three unidentified forts. The K≈ëszegis looted and plundered the surrounding region with their raids from the occupied fort of Esztergom. Therefore, residing in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Archbishop Thomas excommunicated Ivan and Henry for their crimes against the burghers of Esztergom in July 1305. He also placed their provinces under interdict. After negotiations, Wenceslaus abandoned his claim to the Hungarian throne in favor of Otto and handed the Holy Crown over to him in Brno on 9 October 1305. When Otto arrived to Sopron, he sent his envoys to the local oligarch Ivan K≈ëszegi, whose first question was whether he brought the crown with him. After a favorable response, Ivan K≈ëszegi moved to Sopron too and escorted Otto into Buda, who reached the capital around 11 November 1305. Thereafter Ivan K≈ëszegi retired from the public affairs and stayed away from further events. Charles seized Esztergom and Visegr√°d from the K≈ëszegis in June 1306, and thereafter also captured the many fortresses in the northern parts of Hungary (now in Slovakia), owned by Demetrius Balassa and his family. Around the same time, the Austrian troops also plundered Ivan's estates in Gy≈ër and Sopron counties. Ivan did not acknowledge Charles as his king even after Otto's imprisonment and departure from Hungary. He was absent from that assembly in October 1307, where Charles' claim to the throne was confirmed. According to the Steirische Reimchronik, Ivan K≈ëszegi died on 5 April 1308. His province and wealth were inherited by his grandson Nicholas.

He left his home town in 1836, and spent some time logging on the Muskegon and White Rivers of Michigan. In 1841, he moved to the Wisconsin Territory, settling first in Racine, where he went into the produce business and sold cattle. On December 14, 1846, he married Ann Ball, a native of Virgil, New York; the couple would have three sons. In 1849, he went into the business of manufacturing fanning mills, a business he continued until 1854. He was a Trustee in 1845 of the then-Village of Racine, then in 1850 was an alderman of the City of Racine (the Village of Racine incorporated as a city in 1848). When the city created a school board, he was among those elected to it. When, in 1855, a Racine Gas-light and Coke Company was organized, he was among those elected to its initial board of directors.Western Historical Company.

Herrick won 2,423 votes, to 1,519 votes for former state senator and State Representative Philo Belden, the regular Republican candidate. In 1874, Baker (who had lost his race for Lieutenant Governor) ran for his old seat, and beat Herrick by 2,706 votes to Herrick's 2,130 as the candidate of the Liberal Reform Party, a short-lived coalition of Democrats, Reform and Liberal Republicans, and Grangers formed in 1873 which secured the election of a Governor of Wisconsin and elected a number of state legislators.

Outside the United States and Canada, the film was released as Continuum. Plot In 2000, a professor (Sewell) from Toronto goes to Princeton, New Jersey for a conference but doesn't return. Devastating his wife (Anderson) and young son Erol (Ruttan), he is eventually presumed dead. Twelve years later, Erol (Osment) talks with his grandfather (Garber), who suggests that the father's disappearance may have been the result of a scientific experiment involving time travel. Erol is determined to find out the truth. Erol is a mathematical genius and solves the equations necessary to recreate the time travel machine his father had built to go back in time to 1946. As he's working with his grandfather on this machine and the math and physics of it, Erol's girlfriend Grace, becomes pregnant and makes him doubt the necessity of this endeavor. However, when Grace has a miscarriage, and Erol's mother commits suicide as a result of the loss and confusion of never knowing why her husband never returned, Erol realizes that this timeline that he's living in is a direct result of his father leaving. None of this would have happened naturally had his father come home. This time line is a dead-end and has to be corrected. With renewed vigor, Erol finishes the time machine. He uses the time machine to go back to 1946 and finds his father who is looking for Albert Einstein as he finished the work Einstein started. Erol reveals his identity and the chain of events which led him here to his father. He then reveals to him that, knowing his Dad's mind, he knew it wouldn't be that simple to convince him to come home. Erol tells him to go back home and give his family the life they deserve and to remember that he, Erol, is what he is because of his father's mistake. Then Erol shoots himself, dying instantly. This burns the message into his father's mind that he has to go back and prevent all of this from happening.

Rather than send George to his own alma mater, William & Mary, Robert sent George to the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (now Brown University), writing to its president James Manning that his sole motivation for doing so was Virginia's devotion to slavery, and that \\"On this consideration only, I do not intend that these two sons shall return to this State till each of them arrive at the age of 21 years.\\"The Way It Was in The Free Lance-Star - 8 June 2002.

In 1805, George Carter filed suit in an attempt to stop the remaining emancipations of Carter slaves, but the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled against George in 1808.

Now also there are some ancient materials can be seen in the church boundary. The Franciscan historian Friar Paulo da Trinidade (1571-1651) as he writes the history and activities of the Franciscan friars in Sri Lanka mentions that there were five churches built by Franciscan friars in Mannar main land. Namely, Friar Pedro de Betancor built those before 1594. St James Church is one of them. It is believed that for the seeking of fishing and agricultural opportunity some catholic people came from Jaffna, Navaali, Allaipitti etc. and settled in Vidathaltheevu and they made a foundation for this St James Church. And also it is believed that the derivatives of them are living now in Vidathaltheevu. When they were worshipping in St James Church there were another church also was built in Vidathaltheevu in 1918. Now there are two churches, the St James Church and the St Mary Church. From 1948 St James Church was running as a parish under Iranaitheevu parish. The priests came from Iranaitheevu by boat and did the spiritual duties to the people. Then it was joined with the Adampan parish. Now it is running as a single parish as Vidathaltheevu parish. References * Trinidade,Conquesta Spiritual Do Oriente. (Translated by Rt.Rev.

Hazel is now pregnant, and has largely recovered from the death of her daughter; heiress Cayla Bannock (in \\"Those in Peril\\"). After a gynecologist visit, the pair set out in separate vehicles for their English estate. An ambush occurs and, while Hector kills the pair of gunmen attacking his wife's vehicle, Hazel is badly wounded from a bullet wound to the head. Rushed to hospital, their baby daughter, named Catherine Cayla Bannock-Cross, is saved by caesarean section. Hazel dies of brain damage the next day. Hector believes the murder is the result of the blood feud from surviving members of the family of Hadji Sheikh Mohammed Khan Tippoo Tip (the engineer of Cayla's kidnapping, killed in \\"Those in Peril\\"). A second attempt is then made on Catherine and Hector's lives when a pair of hired thugs use white phosphorus grenades to burn down Hector's estate. The thugs are captured by Hector's security personnel and enough details of their employer are provided to identify him, but he is killed by Hector without giving up his employer (to save the life of one of his team). Tracking down the new Tip Clan leader, Aazim Muktar, in Mecca, Hector secures Catherine in a fortress atop a skyscraper in Abu Zara. Hector then slips into Mecca to confront Muktar, only to learn he‚Äôs a peaceful holy man. Determined to identify the true villain, Hector investigates the business interests and past associates of Hazel and her first deceased husband and Bannock Oil's founder, Henry Bannock. Also at this time, Hector begins to accept his loss and move onto a relationship with lawyer Jo Stanley. Jo's boss, Ronnie Bunter, Henry's old friend and Bannock Family Trust lawyer, gives Hector the details of the destruction of the entire Bannock family, in a novel written by Ronnie on Carl Peter Bannock, Henry's stepson (briefly mentioned in \\"Those in Peril\\"). Carl was born Karl Pieter Kurtmeyer, his biological father Heinrich was a German Gestapo officer, and despite being an acknowledged genius, no one was aware he was a cruel, twisted, sadistic monster. Henry married Carl's mother, Marlena, and takes both her and her son into his home and family, with Carl eventually becoming a company director and Henry's heir at Bannock Oil. Secretly, Carl sexually groomed his half-sister, Sacha, and eventually the abuse drove her insane, but the truth is uncovered by his younger half-sister, Bryoni, who secures Sacha's testimony on record. Carl is infuriated at being discovered and assaults and rapes Bryoni, only for the Bannock family staff to stop him and have him arrested by the police. With his history of abuse of his sisters publicly exposed, Carl's personal and professional life is destroyed by a public trial, which has him imprisoned in Texas on all charges for many years. Applying his genius to his desire for revenge, and retaining his status as a Bannock Trust beneficiary, Carl befriends and begins a torrid sexual relationship with Johnny Congo, aka King John Tembo Kikuu of Kazundu, originally a refugee of African royalty, now a psychopathic ex-U.S. Marine and crime lord on death row for dozens of homicides. Using Johnny's connections and his own wealth, Carl has a gang of Mexican pirates break into the tropical estate of his mother and sisters, drown Marlena for her abandonment of him, and subjects Sacha and Bryoni to a horrific fate - Carl sells them to a South American brothel, where they endure countless rapes, beatings and heroin injections, both during the journey and endlessly upon arrival. Sacha dies of illness, and Bryoni is crippled and eaten alive by a pack of wild pigs. This is all retained on video at Carl's direction, which is then sent anonymously to Ronnie and shown to Henry. Henry, at this point married to Hazel and father to Cayla, is ailing due to age, bad health and worry of his missing daughters. The horrific scenes on the video cause Henry to suffer a fatal stroke, exactly as Carl designed. Hazel is then left to run Bannock Oil. Carl is released from prison after serving his full sentence, and, knowing he cannot stay in the United States or modern society due to his crimes, engineers Johnny‚Äôs escape, and the two psychopaths restore Johnny to his African throne in the Congo. Establishing a kingdom of gluttony and sadistic murder, Johnny is a tyrannical king and Carl acts as his prime minister. Carl learns of Cayla's beheading in \\"Those in Peril\\", and this motivates him to have Johnny give the order to have Hazel killed. With the death of Hazel, Catherine is now the final heir, and Hector realizes Carl is the one who wants her eliminated. With Carl and Johnny's activities facing investigation from the U.S. government, Hector gathers Jo and his team and marshals them to attack and destroy Johnny's kingdom. Johnny is knocked out and captured, while Hector cripples Carl and ignores his sadistic pleas of innocence and offers of bribes. Despite Jo's protests against killing the defenseless Carl, Hector enacts vengeance for Hazel and the Bannock family - Carl is thrown into his own crocodile pit and eaten alive. To prove his love to Jo, however, Hector agrees to turn over Johnny to the U.S. Marshals Service, so they can return him to prison for execution. Hector, however, does make a point of punching Johnny in the face after he shouts he gave the order to have Hazel killed at Carl's direction. Believing the threat to Catherine is now totally removed, Hector and Jo receive the news Johnny attacked and killed three of his guards and escaped. Jo, knowing Hector blames her for stopping him from killing Johnny when he had the chance, and not wanting any further part in his extra-legal lifestyle, leaves him. Hector is left on his own with his daughter, planning to hunt down Johnny.

The line was the first subway line that offered through services in Tokyo. Japan operates a variety of or or through trains which are direct seamless connections between rail operators, using leased trackage rights and junctions, to cut cross metropolitan area commutes without having to change trains, wait, figure out connections, or cross platforms/stations. Most of these junctions have been constructed well after the lines have been operating. Some far-flung spur lines have been shortened (abandoned stations and track due to low patronage); through service is a frequently used method to integrate the surviving short stub lines into multiple rail operator's systems, enhancing convenience and ridership. Through-service proliferation is increasingly common phenomenon as the railway networks, urban density (and Japan's demographics) have matured and new line construction is minimal. There are several dozen unique through service runs in Japan, the actual track usage details are complex (but as a seamless service offers an abstraction layer for the end user), the Japanese Wikipedia page has a complete list. Standardization is required for cross railway services, in terms of rolling stock dimensions, rail gauge, overhead power, not to mention coordinated scheduling between a mixture of separate companies and/or government agencies. Through services in Japan are commonly of two types: unidirectional or bidirectional (unidirectional trains return empty on non-circular tracks). The first usage of through services was on the Tobu Kameido Line in 1904, but was suspended in 1910. Japan's first modern (postwar) through services began in 1960, from the Toei Asakusa Line to Keisei Oshiage Line. There are also through services that have been discontinued (not listed here).

The bulk of the film collection covers the years 1938 to 1979 with many photos dating back to 1915; 11,500 movies and 5,000 actors are represented. Beginning The family business, which eventually became Movie Star News, began in 1938 when he and his sister Paula opened a struggling used bookstore at 209 East 14th Street in Manhattan. After he observed teenagers frequently tearing out photos from his movie magazines, he saw an opportunity and started selling movie star stills and lobby photo cards. He set up a small box of used movie stills. When these quickly sold, he contacted the studios for more stills. Irving approached the studios directly back when most Hollywood studio publicity departments lined Manhattan's 11th Ave and discovered they were in the habit of throwing away their publicity materials after a film had had its run. Irving bought as much as he wanted for almost nothing, convincing publicity departments he was doing them a favor. Irving would take these originals and negatives meant for magazine and newspaper art departments and reproduce 8√ó10 glossies of them directly for the purchasing public. The customers could order by item number from catalogs of sample photos. These sold so well that he stopped selling books and moved the store from the basement to the street-level storefront and renamed it Irving Klaw Pin Ups. Business thrived, and the self-named \\"Pin-Up King\\" moved to 212 East 14th Street and took on the name \\"Movie Star News\\". Archiving In later years the studios, having thrown away their publicity archives would often have to rent their own photos back from Irving. Around the time that Klaw started his bookstore, he also began a mail-order magic trick business, the Nutrix Novelty Library. Like book sales, magic novelties were a financial bust. However, Klaw soon realized that mail order could enhance his movie- still business. He placed advertisements in magazines and shipped catalogs. Before long, mail order was the mainstay of Movie Star News. During World War Two, Movie Star News sold pin-ups of movie stars to the troops with a mailing list of 100,000 names. Fetish photography By the late 1940s, he was receiving frequent requests for \\"Damsel-in-distress\\" photos of actresses being bound and gagged, spanked, and flogged. Sometime between 1947 and 1950, Irving Klaw was approached by a prominent lawyer with some \\"special needs.\\" He offered to pay all the costs if Klaw would produce original bondage pictures for him. Klaw would retain the rights. His first bondage model was Lili Dawn. She was photographed in midtown studios by various freelance photographers. Eventually, Klaw rented the third floor over Movie Star News and turned it into a shooting studio. By 1955, Irving Klaw was allegedly grossing $1.5 million a year, primarily through mail order of his fetish pics. While he worked with many different models, Klaw's images with Bettie Page were his most popular and best known. He met Page when he contacted camera clubs looking for models for his burgeoning fetish photography business. Page was the most popular pin-up of the 1950s, appearing on more covers than anyone else in the decade. While she was Playboy's Playmate of the Month for January 1955, Page is best remembered for Klaw's bondage photos and the nudes by Bunny Yeager. Klaw always went to great pains to make sure his photographs contained no nudity, which would make the material pornographic and hence illegal to sell via mail. Models were often required to wear two pairs of panties so that no pubic hair could be seen. He and Paula, who actually posed and took most of the photos, started selling bondage and fetish photos using burlesque dancers like Baby Lake, Tempest Storm, and Blaze Starr as models. Klaw always went to great pains to make sure his photographs contained no sex acts or nudity, which would have made the material pornographic and hence illegal to sell via mail. Through his production company Nutrix Co. (and later also Mutrix Corp), Klaw also published and distributed illustrated adventure/bondage serials by fetish artists Eric Stanton, Gene Bilbrew, Adolfo Ruiz and others. Irving Klaw had an unusually close relationship with his sister Paula. The story of Irving and his business has primarily been told through her anecdotes. Paula often ran the front end of the store, but when Klaw began to produce his own photographs and films, Paula befriended the models, often treating them as her own daughters. When another photographer wasn't available, she would grab the camera and shoot the photos. In 1963, in an attempt to satisfy the courts, Irving destroyed his photographs and movies, Paula, unbeknownst to her brother, preserved his legacy ‚Äì and her financial future ‚Äì by hiding thousands of the images. After her brother's death, she became fiercely protective of his reputation and his work. Without Paula's foresight, Irving Klaw might have been just an odd, barely remembered footnote in the annals of pin-up history and Fifties puritanism. Closing In the early 1980s Movie Star News moved to 134 W. 18th Street to avoid rising rents on 14th street. In 2012 Movie Star News moved to Las Vegas Nevada and continues to sell originals and reproductions from the collection.

It tells the story of a man in his sixties who is released after a long prison sentence, and tries to have a relationship with a younger woman, while still determined to live outside the law. Blain described the film as \\"not a gangster film, but a love film and a relentless tragedy\\". Sylvia Jeanjacquot, the widow of the criminal Jacques Mesrine, appears in a minor role. The film was shot in December 1994 in Lyon, Villeurbane, V√©nissieux and Sathonay. It was shown at the Montreal World Film Festival and Cairo International Film Festival in 1995.

In great rigour, it evokes the cinematography of Robert Bresson, admittedly referenced by Blain throughout his whole filmography.\\" P√®re continued: \\"With its rigorous aesthetics and moral, Jusqu‚Äôau bout de la nuit distinguishes itself from all and sundry of the French cinematic output of its time.

Subsequently, another tribe, the NgƒÅti T≈´matak≈çkiri (originally from Taupo) invaded the Nelson region during the early 17th century and displaced the NgƒÅi Tara tribe that had moved to Waimea.History and traditions of the Maoris of the West Coast of New Zealand, prior to 1840 Contact with the Dutch After the first sighting of New Zealand by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642, the ship Heemskerck sailed into the Wainui Inlet of the Nelson Region by the 18 December 1642.First contact between MƒÅori and Europeans The NgƒÅti T≈´matak≈çkiri sent two waka canoes in their customary ritual to challenge and frighten the unknown ships that entered their territory. The Dutch sailors subsequently blew their trumpet to warn the Maori wakas not to approach their ship in such a hostile manner as to endanger the safety of the crew. This was ignored by the Maoris and the Dutch subsequently ordered cannon to be fired upon the approaching wakas. The Maoris flew into a rage and the next day, seven waka were dispatched to ram into the Heemskerck resulting in four Dutchmen killed in the ensuing conflict.Story: European discovery of New Zealand The Maori wakas then paddled back to shore. As the Dutch were dropping in their anchor near the coast, eleven Maori wakas suddenly approached the Heemskerck, however this time the crew on the warship Zeehaen quickly fired upon the wakas and the Maoris returned to shore with 1 casualty. Hence the Dutch named the Bay as \\"Moordenaers Baaij\\" (Murderer's Bay).Tasman‚Äôs Voyage to New Zealand: Setting the Record Straight As a result of hostility from the inhabitants of the area, the Dutch did not land ashore at the area and headed to the North Island after sailing near parts of the Cook Strait. British exploration In January 1770, Captain James Cook explored the Nelson region and named the sea between the North and South Island as \\"Cook Strait\\". They landed at Queen Charlotte Sound and Ship Cove, both names of which were named by the British explorer. There, they spent several weeks repairing their ship The Endeavour and reloading food and water supplies. Captain Cook's and his crew were to enter the Ship Cove in their subsequent voyages to New Zealand in 1773 and 1777 respectively.Queen Charlotte Track : Description French exploration On 22 January 1827, the French explorer Dumont d'Urville along with French crew on the ship Astrolabe entered the Tasman Bay into what is now known today as the French Pass and D'Urville Island. The crew found safe anchorage near the Farewell Spit and painted the nearby scenery. The crew refilled their provisions and traded with local Maori. D'Urville himself also had some knowledge of the Maori language and was able to communicate with the local inhabitants.Dumont d'Urville's Tasman Bay Odyssey In 1838, Captain Jean Francois Langlois of the whaling ship Cachalot embarked on a scheme to establish a French colony at Akaroa. He was also instructed by members of the French Government, \\"You should also win over the chief Te Rauparaha and induce him to sell the lands under his control in the northern part of the South Island. There is great advantage in setting up establishments in various parts of the Island for acquisitions [of territory] will only go unchallenged where there is effective act of possession.\\" The French plan was to place sufficient French settlers in the South Island to convince the British to give up on any ambitions to annex the South Island. In February 1840 the ship L‚ÄôAube departed from France to aid the first French settlers. However the British, after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in the North Island, proceeded in May 1840 with the Treaty documents to Akaroa where NgƒÅi Tahu chiefs signed the Treaty. The British subsequently claimed possession of the entire South Island.French Settlement in New Zealand and What Might Have Been New Maori invasions (late 18th century) By the late 18th century, the NgƒÅti T≈´matak≈çkiri faced a new threat from the NgƒÅti Apa tribe whom launched frequent waka canoe attacks on the Nelson region from their home base in the Kapiti coast of the lower North Island. The NgƒÅti T≈´matak≈çkiri were simultaneously harassed by the NgƒÅti Kuia tribe that resided in the Marlborough region to the east.History of MƒÅori of Nelson and Marlborough The reasons for these intrusions was for the securing of greenstone trail of which the various tribes needed to cross NgƒÅti T≈´matak≈çkiri-controlled land in order to reach the greenstone deposits of the West Coast of the South Island. Conflicts between the NgƒÅti T≈´matak≈çkiri and NgƒÅi Tahu of the Canterbury area was also sparked after some NgƒÅi Tahu people were killed by NgƒÅti T≈´matak≈çkiri. The NgƒÅti T≈´matak≈çkiri planned a massive wave of canoe attacks on the NgƒÅti Apa home base at Kapiti coast with the intention to occupy Kapiti Island. However, unfavourable winds resulted in several canoes capsizing and the survivors were finished off by their enemies by the time they reached the shores of Kapiti Island. This left NgƒÅti T≈´matak≈çkiri vulnerable to reprisal attacks from all three neighbouring tribes and their controlled land was gradually wrested from them. The great Tainui- Taranaki invasion (1820s) During the mid to late 1820s, the northern South Island was invaded by the forces of Te Rauparaha who was originally from Kawhia. The Kawhia tribes had been at war against the Waikato and NgƒÅti Maniapoto tribes. Due to the ability of the Waikato tribes to obtain muskets from European traders at the Manukau area, the Kawhia tribes were outgunned battle after battle and during a desperate siege by the Waikato-Maniapoto tribal alliance, negotiations commenced between both sides and the Kawhia tribes were given the option to either face defeat and annihilation by the victors or to permanently vacate their homes at Kawhia and relocate southwards to settle. The latter option was chosen and a great migration occurred during 1821.Kawhia History - The arrival of Tainui and its history They initially moved with their families to the tribes of the Northern Taranaki region who were allied to them. Te Rauparaha then initiated a campaign of conquest and occupation of the regions stretching from South Taranaki to Wanganui, Manawatu and the present day Wellington Region. Despite resistance from the tribes in those areas, they were overpowered by Te Rauparaha's forces whom had obtained muskets from European traders. The remnants of the NgƒÅti Apa fled to the northern South island where, under the leadership of Te Rato, they would plan frequent raids into the lower North Island to inflict casualties on tribal settlements allied to Te Rauparaha. Te Rauparaha and tribes allied to him launched several campaigns into the Nelson and Marlborough region to remove the NgƒÅti Apa resistance fighters and also conquer the areas. The invasion was also due to the insult from a Marlborough chief who pledged to smash Te Rauparaha's head with a patu aruhe (fernroot pounder) if he were to cross Te Moana Raukawa (Cook Strait). The Kaikoura chief also pledged to slit open Te Rauparaha's belly with a shark tooth if he entered Kaikoura.The Raids of Te Rauparaha One by one, the wooden pa fortifications of NgƒÅti Kuia fell to the incoming invaders and the survivors fled to the hills whilst others submitted and made peace with the invaders. Te Rauparaha's forces then split into two with one group heading westwards towards Nelson and the Tasman region while the other group led by Te Rauparaha himself raided the eastern coast of the South Island as far as Kaikoura. The Kaikoura chief was defeated and executed by Te Rauparaha. Sealers, whalers and traders British colonisation The New Zealand Company founded by Edward Gibbon Wakefield had founded a settlement at Wellington. Since they needed more arable land for settlement, they sent three ships in May 1841 to find a suitable location to establish a new settlement named Nelson on the upper South Island. Negotiations were commenced by the New Zealand Company representatives at the Kapiti coast with Te Rauparaha to purchase land at present day Nelson. Te Rauparaha consented and the first ship carrying settlers arrived on 1 November 1841. Within two years, 2,000 settlers had reached Nelson.Nelson's early settlement The Wairau Affray and the Land Wars The New Zealand Company later discovered that they needed an extra seventy-thousand acres in order to accommodate all the settlers and subsequently dispatched surveyors to survey the fertile Wairau valley. The NgƒÅti Toa claimed that the Wairau valley was not included in their land sales but the New Zealand Company ignored their objections.Wairau Affray Te Rauparaha then requested to the Land Commissioner William Spain that the surveyors be removed from the Wairau area however before William Spain had arrived to hear the case, the New Zealand Company surveyors continued their surveying. Te Rauparaha and his men then carried out acts of obstruction such as the removal of surveying equipment and the burning of huts. The New Zealand Company charged Te Rauparaha for arson, argued that the upper South island had been obtained by NgƒÅti Toa through conquest and therefore the land did not belong to him in the first place, then sent an armed group to arrest and hand-cuff Te Rauparaha.The Wairau incident Te Rangihaeata insisted the land was theirs. A gun that was fired by someone by accident then resulted in a gunfight that led to eleven settlers and two Maori killed. The Wairau Affray resulted in the residents of Nelson forming the Nelson Battalion of Militia and constructing a fortification known as Fort Arthur on Church Hill.

In his 1997 study of the Second Intermediate Period, Ryholt argues that the kings of the 16th Dynasty ruled an independent Theban realm c. 1650-1580 BC.K.S.B. Ryholt: The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c.1800‚Äì1550 BC, Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, vol. 20. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997, excerpts available online here. Consequently, Ryholt sees Bebnum, who bears a Semitic name, as the 34th king of the 14th Dynasty which regroups kings of Canaanite descent. As such Bebnum would have ruled from Avaris over the eastern Nile Delta concurrently with the Memphis-based 13th Dynasty. This analysis has convinced some Egyptologists, such as Darrell Baker and Janine Bourriau,Darrell D.

The fact that the fragment on which Bebnum figures is not attached to the rest of the document made its chronological position difficult to ascertain. However an analysis of the fibers of the papyrus led Ryholt to place the fragment on the 9th column, row 28 of the canon (Gardiner entry 9.30).

It was famous of the hottest whaling place of Korean Peninsula before banning commercial whaling by IWC. Now, Jangsaengpo is a rising tourist attraction with Jangsaengpo whale museum, Whale ecological Experience Hall & Ulsan whale cruise.  History  The Jangsaengpo whaling originates from the establishment of the Pacific Fisheries Co., Ltd. by the Russian Emperor, Aleksandrovich Nikolai II in 1891. However, as Japan monopolized the whaling business after the victory of the Russo-Japanese War and overhauled whaling stations nationwide, Jangsaengpo drew attention as the center of the whaling business. After liberation, Korean people jointly took over the Japanese-run company and changed its name to Joseon Whaling Co., Ltd. This was the start of the history of Korean whaling. In the late 1970s when the whaling was at its zenith, Jangsaengpo held 20 whaling ships, with 10,000 residents. However, careless whaling reduced the catch and some species were even in danger of extinction by 1980. These drawbacks led the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to decide to ban commercial whaling in 1986, and eventually, the whaling industry was stopped. Then, as industrial complexes were created in the vicinity of Jangsaengpo and most of the residents moved away, the decline of Jangsaengpo resulted.  Tourist attractions  * Jangsaengpo whale museum & Whale ecological Experience Hall : As the only whale museum in Korea, Jangsaengpo Whale Museum collects, maintains and displays whaling-related artifacts, which have been disappearing since 1986 when whaling was prohibited. It also provides a variety of information related to whales and marine ecosystems and is a space for education, research and experience. * Whale Cruise : Encounter whales in their natural environment when you take to the seas along a whale migration route. Since dolphins also migrate in groups, a chance of watching them could add to the unforgettable experience. The possibility for seeing whales is highest between June and August.

It was built by the Artuqid Turkmens in the mid-12th century, between about 1147 and 1167, and at the time its central arch was one of the largest in the world, if not the largest. The bridge was repaired by Ayyubid Kurdish and Aq Qoyunlu Turkmen rulers during the 14th and 15th centuries and appears to have eventually collapsed in the early or mid-17th century. The bridge's ruined piers still stand (two of them in the Tigris River), as does one arch. The ruins of the bridge are expected to be submerged, along with most of the town of Hasankeyf, by the filling of the Ilƒ±su Dam starting in 2018. Background In Roman times, Kepha (Hasankeyf) was a base for legionnaires on the frontier with Persia, and for a time the capital of the Roman province of Arzanene. The existence of a Roman bridge across the Tigris at Hasankeyf has been viewed as \\"highly probable\\" by one scholar who speculates that (like the later bridge) it may have had \\"a wooden superstructure based on piers of masonry and natural stone\\". However, none of the remaining structure of the bridge appears to date from Roman times. Roman builders had trouble bridging major rivers that were subject to spring flooding, such as the Tigris. Nevertheless, there was at least one bridge across the Tigris upstream from Hasankeyf as early as the fifth century AD, when Bishop John of Amida (who was appointed in 483/484) is reported to have built the bridge that forms the foundation of the present-day On G√∂zl√º K√∂pr√º outside Diyarbakƒ±r. There may have been bridges across the Tigris even closer to Hasankeyf, as surveys in 1989‚Äì1991 showed evidence of two bridges crossing the Tigris near its confluence with the Batman River, upstream from Hasankeyf. One was a probably Roman bridge at K√∂pr√ºk√∂y, upstream from the rivers' confluence; three piers of this bridge remain, but it can only be dated approximately. The second was a possibly neo-Assyrian bridge at ≈ûahinli, slightly downstream of the confluence; only some stones of the southern footing remain on the riverbank, near Hirbemerdon Tepe. The earliest mention of any bridge across the Tigris at Hasankeyf is in an account of the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia in 638. Over the subsequent five centuries, Hasankeyf was ruled by the Ummayad and Abbasid caliphates and later by semi-autonomous Hamdanid and Marwanid rulers. There is little information on river crossings at Hasankeyf during this period. The late-10th-century Arab geographer al- Muqaddasi describes Hisn Kayfa as a \\"place of abundance\\" with a strong citadel and many churches, whose residents get their drinking water from the Tigris, but makes no mention of a bridge. In the 11th century, Seljuq Turks and their Turkmen and Oguz allies moved into eastern Anatolia, culminating in the Seljuq defeat of Byzantine forces at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Victory at Manzikert quickly resulted in Seljuq forces controlling large parts of Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia. The Seljuq sultan Rukn ad-Dƒ´n BarkiyƒÅruq granted Hasankeyf as a fief to the Artuqids in . Control of trade along the Diyarbakƒ±r‚ÄìMosul route down the Tigris, and north‚Äìsouth between Lake Van and the Euphrates generated prosperity for the Artuqids and ensured their power in the region. Consequently, the existence of a reliable river crossing for goods and people was a priority. Construction and Artuqid period =Date= Current scholarship suggests the bridge was built in the mid-12th century, no earlier than 1147 and no later than 1167. Late 19th- and early 20th-century scholars generally dated its construction to the year AH 510 (1116/17), and described the bridge as being rebuilt on the site of some undescribed earlier bridge. Most scholars of the time traced this date to an anonymous writer who annotated what is now known as the Paris manuscript of Ibn Hawqal's Surat al- Ard some time after AH 534 (1139/40). The English geographical historian Guy Le Strange, using the Ibn Hawqal annotation as his source, specifically says the bridge was restored by QarƒÅ ArslƒÅn in AH 510 (1116/17). The same reconstruction date was given by Henry Hoyle Howorth, citing the Hamdanid ruler Sayf al-Dawla. Support for the AH 510 dating waned after closer reading of a pair of manuscripts by the 12th-century Artuqid historian ibn al-Azraq al-Fariqi held by the British Library. Ibn al-Azraq writes that the bridge was built on the orders of Fakhr ad-Din Qara Arslan of the Artuqid dynasty. Ibn al-Azraq also states that the Hasankeyf bridge was built later than the Malabadi Bridge, the earliest in the Diyar Bakr. Construction of the Malabadi Bridge started in AH 541 (1146/47) under the Artuqid ruler of Mardin, , and finished in AH 548 (1153/54) under his son . A date later than AH 541 (1146/47) for the Hasankeyf bridge is consistent with Qara Arslan's sponsoring its construction, as his accession is variously dated to AH 539 or 543 (1144/45 or 1148/49) and he ruled Hasankeyf until AH 562 (1166/67). The same conflicting sources are not totally clear about whether the Hasankeyf bridge was built entirely new, or was rebuilt from an earlier structure. The German historian of Islamic art Michael Meinecke quotes Ibn al-Azraq's report that the bridge was a replacement for an earlier and less substantial one. Le Strange (citing the annotator of Ibn Hawqal) says it was \\"restored\\"; Howorth (citing Sayf al-Dawla) says it was \\"re-erected\\". =Construction= A view of the Old Bridge from upstream, looking east. Beyond it is the new bridge, built in 1967. The bridge had four main arches. Two huge piers were built in the river to support the -wide main arch. Again, there is some confusion as to how this main arch was built. Some scholars describe it as a wooden construction anchored into the stone piers and describe the purpose as being to allow the crossing to be easily dismantled in time of war. Other sources, including several from the period before the bridge was destroyed, do not mention a wooden element, despite providing a detailed description of the bridge. And one 17th-century source that does mention a wooden central span describes it as a repair due to an earlier collapse. However it was built, this central arch had a span of about . That was about larger than the nearby Malabadi Bridge, which means it probably had the largest span of any single arch from the time of its construction until completion of the Pont du Diable in the Principality of Catalonia (now France) in 1341. The roadway of the bridge rose from the north bank (where it is just above the flood plain) to the south bank (where it meets the top of the cliff on which the lower city sits). Flanking the main arch were slightly smaller arches to the north and south, with the roadway climbing towards the center of the bridge. A fourth arch, smaller than the others and the only one still remaining somewhat intact, carried the roadway to the northern abutment. At the south, where the roadway meets the steep slope up to the citadel, there was no need for a corresponding fifth arch, and the flanking arch led directly to the massive masonry construction of the abutment. The southern abutment is pierced by an arched gateway, and it appears that some writers have counted this as a fifth structural arch. Meinecke describes the bridge as a whole as being \\"a unique masterpiece of architectural engineering\\". The total length from one abutment to the other is about . Meinecke notes that the sides of the bridge contained passages that could accommodate townspeople on both sides of the river in case of emergency. The presence of arrow slits indicates that these passages had a defensive purpose. =Decoration= On the western (upstream) faces of the triangular buttresses is a series of reliefs that have been interpreted by Estelle Whelan as QarƒÅ ArslƒÅn's khƒÅ·π£·π£akiyya (his page corps or bodyguard). Five reliefs remain out of a total that Whelan estimates was originally eight, two on each of the four upstream walls of the two main piers. Each shows a single human figure carved on a vertical block and set into the middle course of masonry. The western pier shows a standing human figure wearing a kaftan, boots and hat known as a sharbush. His bent arms rest on a straight object that may be an arrow or a mace. A figure on the inner wall of the same pier rests on a bow and the other figure on this wall holds a bird. In early 2018, as the Turkish government prepared to fill the lake behind the Ilƒ±su Dam, four of the reliefs were moved to the garden of the Batman provincial museum. =Comparison with contemporary bridges= Meinecke compares the style of the bridge in Hasankeyf to that of two other bridges: Malabadi Bridge (built AH 541‚Äì548 (1146/47‚Äì1153/54)) over the Batman River about north of Hasankeyf on the orders of the Artuqid ruler , and a bridge in Cizre (built before AH 558 (1162/63) on the orders of the vizier of Mosul, Jamal ad-Din Muhammad al- Isfahani. Meinecke records Ibn al-Azraq's statement that the Hasankeyf bridge was modeled on Malabadi Bridge, but does not explain how the Hasankeyf Bridge apparently predates the Malabadi one. All three bridges contain similar panels of figural designs, and follow a similar pattern of construction. Meinecke also notes that the Hasankeyf and Cizre bridges display similar Artuqid mason's marks, as does the Great Palace in the Hasankeyf citadel. Describing the bridge at Hasankeyf in the Mu'jam Al-Buldan (\\"Dictionary of Countries\\", 1224‚Äì1228), the Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi wrote: \\"I have not seen a bigger [bridge] in any of the lands I have traveled.\\" Yaqut describes the bridge as having a single great arch over two smaller ones, a description that may have been intended to indicate the flanking arches. Rebuilding during Ayyubid and Aq Qoyunlu periods ·∏§asan Ibn al-Munshi æ records in the Ta ærƒ´kh bait Aiy≈´b () that by the early 14th century the bridge was unusable. It was restored during the reign of the Ayyubid sultan al- øƒÄdil GhƒÅzƒ´, AH 742‚Äì768 (1341‚Äì1367). There is evidence that additional repairs were made around when Hasankeyf was under the rule of the powerful Aq Qoyunlu bey Uzun Hassan who had conquered Hasankeyf from the Ayyubids in 1462. Historian Thomas Alexander Sinclair dates the brick repairs on the surviving northern arch to the Aq Qoyunlu period. Meinecke sees the presence of brick masonry, and turquoise glazed bricks in particular, as evidence that the repairs were performed by a group of Iranian craftsmen who also worked on the nearby Tomb of Zeynel Bey along with local stonemasons. Meinecke speculates that the leaders of the Iranian workshop included Pƒ´r ·∏§asan b. ustƒÅdh  øAbd ar-Ra·∏•mƒÅn, whose name is inscribed on the tiles of the Zeynel Bey Tomb's entrance niche. He believes they operated as craftsmen-for-hire and traces their route from work on the Blue Mosque in Tabrƒ´z before , to Istanbul's √áinili K√∂≈ük in , and then to the tomb and bridge in Hasankeyf around , before moving on to the south iwan of Isfahan's Masjid-i Jum øa in . A Venetian merchant who traveled to Hasankeyf around 1507 provides a detailed description of the bridge: Ottoman period After Sultan Selim I's victory at the Battle of Chaldiran, the Ottoman empire gained control of Hasankeyf in 1515. There are few direct accounts of Hasankeyf or the bridge for the next century, but official records do indicate that the town remained a key crossing point on the Tigris. A 1997 study of Ottoman tax records showed that about 858,500 sheep crossed over the bridge during one tax cycle. These were likely herded by nomads moving between pastures in the mountains and pastures in the steppe. By the second half of the 17th century, travel to the region had evidently increased, and two accounts suggest that the bridge remained functional, although perhaps with some damage. This detail from a 17th-century map (south at top) shows Hasankeyf in miniature at the left and Diyarbakƒ±r at the right. The bridge over the Tigris is clearly depicted just outside Hasankeyf as the road from Diyarbakƒ±r enters the city. From a 17th-century Ottoman map of the Tigris and Euphrates that may have been created by Evliya √áelebi. The Ottoman traveller Evliya √áelebi visited Hasankeyf in 1656 during his third major travel through Kurdistan. √áelebi's trip north from Baghdad, which took him through Cizre, Hasankeyf and Nusaybin, is recorded in fragmentary notes in Volume 4 of his Sey√¢hatn√¢me (written in 1673) that have not yet been published in full. Excerpts from the manuscript indicate that √áelebi was clearly impressed by the \\"great bridge\\" at Hasankeyf, which he laments his inability to adequately capture. He does note that the Hasankeyf and Batman bridges contained chambers to accommodate travellers on both sides. √áelebi also mentions the bridge at Hasankeyf later in Volume 5 as one of several notable bridges that was less impressive than the 15th-century Uzunk√∂pr√º Bridge near Edirne. Neither reference describes the bridge as ruined and the implication is therefore that the Hasankeyf bridge was functional in 1656. The young Venetian nobleman Ambrosio Bembo traveled down the Tigris and reached Hasankeyf on 6 February 1673. He provides a clear description of the state of the bridge. \\"Over the river there is a broken stone bridge of four arches, one of which has fallen and has been remade in wood. In the middle of the bridge there is a covered place that serves as a guardhouse. The entire bridge used to be covered in ancient times. All around, it has several figures in relief, but I was not able to get any information from these ignorant people.\\" Given that the central arch was likely always wooden, resting on stone piers, Bembo may have mistaken this for repairs to a fallen arch or the bridge may have been genuinely damaged by this point. The importance of Hasankeyf shrank beginning in the 17th century and subsequent historical records of southeast Anatolia do not mention the bridge. Therefore, it has been assumed that the bridge became unusable due to damage during the late 17th century. =19th-century travelers= By the 19th century, European travelers were passing through the region more frequently, en route to Mesopotamia. While many of them traveled by road between Diyarbakƒ±r and Mosul through the Tur Abdin, a few ventured along the Tigris, often on rafts called kalaks, and passed by Hasankeyf. These visitors invariably noted the already-collapsed bridge for its impressive ruined piers, and regularly speculated on who had built it. Among the earliest of these travelers were three Prussian military officers based in Anatolia who were working on modernizing the Ottoman army in response to the campaigns of Muhammad Ali of Egypt: Captain Karl von Vincke, Major-General and Captain Helmuth Graf von Moltke, later to serve as chief of general staff for the Prussian and German armies. On 15 April 1838 they set out from Diyarbakƒ±r on kalaks, bound for Cizre. Moltke's description of Hasankeyf includes this assessment: \\"But the most remarkable object is the remnants of a bridge which, in a vast arch spanning 80 to 100 feet, has crossed the Tigris. I do not know whether one can attribute such a bold construction to the old Armenian kings, the Greek emperors, or rather the caliph.\\" Moltke's brief comment is somewhat ambiguous about the exact state of the bridge at the time of his visit. The British consul in Diyarbakƒ±r, John Taylor, visited Hasankeyf in October 1861. He forded the river and described this \\"noble bridge of three large and three smaller pointed arches\\" as \\"now in ruins\\". However, his comment that the piers \\"appear much older than the superstructure\\" suggests that there may have been some attempt to repair the bridge after its initial collapse. Taylor mentions the relief figures on the two central piers, which he interpreted as Parthian, and also notes the overall similarity with the Malabadi Bridge. By 1873 a report noted that the \\"only remaining arch\\" had fallen in 1869. As the smallest arch still remains standing, this probably referred to the collapse of one of the two arches flanking the main span. The artist Tristram James Ellis traveled down the Tigris on a raft from Diyarbakƒ±r in March 1880 and at \\"Hassan-Keyf\\" noted \\"some high towers standing in the river, with a minaret on one side, and huge precipices rising from the water just in front.\\" He correctly identified these towers as \\"piers of a Saracenic pointed arch bridge, now ruined, which at one time carried the great Persian caravan road over the river\\". During a raft voyage down the Tigris in April 1909, Ely Banister Soane encountered \\"the great piers of a once colossal bridge ... that tower above and shadow the passer-by in his humble kalak\\". Soane reported theories that the bridge was Roman or Venetian. Modern period and archaeological study Present-day road traffic crosses the Tigris slightly to the east on a modern three-arch concrete bridge built in 1967. The old bridge has been a focus of architectural and historic interest by scholars for many years. Gertrude Bell photographed the bridge during a visit to Hasankeyf in April and May 1911. At this time, the only river crossing was via raft. The Gertrude Bell Archive at Newcastle University contains many of her photographs of the bridge from this visit. The first detailed survey was performed by the French architectural historian , who visited Hasankeyf twice in 1932 along with the epigraphist Jean Sauvaget. Their survey of the town was published as a chapter of Gabriel's Voyages arch√©ologiques dans la Turquie orientale. This included detailed plan and elevation drawings of the bridge. =Ilƒ±su Dam impact= Although the first plans for a dam across the Tigris below Hasankeyf were made in 1954 it was not until 1997 that the State Hydraulic Works added the Ilƒ±su Dam to its formal programme. The remains of the bridge are expected to be submerged by the filling of the reservoir behind the Ilƒ±su Dam. This is expected to begin during 2018 and take at least a year. The lake is expected to have a surface elevation of , above the current river level at Hasankeyf. =Rescue archeology= Following the announcement of the plans for the Ilƒ±su Dam, the bridge was among various historic sites in Hasankeyf to receive closer scrutiny. Based on notes from short visits in June 1975 and May 1989, noted Islamic scholar Michael Meinecke gave it considerable attention in the chapter on Hasankeyf in his 1996 book Patterns of Stylistic Changes in Islamic Architecture. Since 1986, Professor M. Olu≈ü Arƒ±k of Ankara University has been the prime investigator documenting the archeological heritage of Hasankeyf. Arƒ±k helped organize the site survey in late 2002 by the Center for Research and Assessment of the Historical Environment (TA√áDAM) at Middle East Technical University that resulted in a detailed plan of both the town and the bridge. Between 2006 and 2013, the Hasankeyf Directorate of Archaeological Excavations conducted three digs near the bridge's northern footing, at the ƒ∞mam Abdullah Zawiyah, Caravanserai and Bridge Pier sites. The Bridge Pier excavation (actually the farthest from the bridge) examined a area west of the approach road. This uncovered a complex of 15 windowless rooms with walls of rubble stones cemented largely with mud, and floors of stone and rammed earth. The archeologists speculated that the rooms were lit by openings in the roofs, which were likely of vaulted construction. Three rooms may have been kitchens as they had evidence of ovens. The study conjectured that the complex was inhabited by a single extended family. The site was not dated, and the archeologists speculated that it could have been occupied any time between the neolithic and the 19th century. The Caravanserai excavation lies immediately west of the bridge's northern approach. This examined an area east-west by north-south. The 2006 ƒ∞mam Abdullah Zawiyah excavation examined a zawiya or religious complex on a site to the northeast of the road approaching the bridge's northern footing. The complex is built around a courtyard that has since become a graveyard. The most prominent buildings are a domed mausoleum on the north side of the courtyard with a minaret or tower adjacent to the east. Visitors entered the courtyard through the east wall and along the inside of this wall was built the zawiya. Along the courtyard's south side is the masjid, or prayer hall. The mausoleum houses the tomb of Imam Abdullah, said to be a descendant of Muhammad. The 2006 excavation confirmed earlier assumptions that the zawiya was originally built by the Artuqids in the 12th century. The tomb was rebuilt during the Ayyubid period by Sultan Muwahhid Taqiyya ad-Din Abdullah (1249‚Äì1294). An epigraph above the tomb's entrance records later repairs by one of the sons of the Aq Qoyunlu Turkmen leader Uzun Hassan in . Sinclair visited the site in 1979 and, noting a tile on the south wall of the prayer hall with the blessing of the Twelve Imams, speculated that the building had at some point been used by a Shia group, such as the Qara Qoyunlu or the Qizilbash. Sinclair sees parallels with 12th-century Syrian woodwork in the tomb's original, intricately carved doors, which are now in Diyarbakƒ±r Museum. =Proposed relocation= As construction of the dam progressed, there was increased focus by the Turkish government on the idea of relocating or preserving some of the historic structures in Hasankeyf that would be flooded by the reservoir. Early plans called for the bridge piers to be included among a core group of monuments that would be moved to new sites. While relocation was ultimately chosen for some monuments, such as the Tomb of Zeynel Bey, this approach to preserving the ruined bridge appears to have been abandoned. In April 2017, it was reported that work was underway to shore up the piers of the bridge with new masonry and supposedly impermeable mortar. Turkish authorities are reportedly planning to include \\"historical scuba diving\\" around the submerged piers among the activities to be offered to tourists after the reservoir is filled.

The Mendip district covers a largely rural area of ranging from the Mendip Hills through on to the Somerset Levels. It has a population of approximately 110,000. The administrative centre of the district is Shepton Mallet but the largest town (with more than twice the population of Shepton Mallet) is Frome. A scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \\"schedule\\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; Historic England takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \\"monument\\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War. There are 234 scheduled monuments in Mendip. These include a large number of bowl and round barrows and other neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age tumuli such as the Priddy Circles and Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries. There are also several Iron Age hill forts on the hill tops and lake villages on the lowlands such as Meare and Glastonbury Lake Villages. The lake villages were often connected by timber trackways such as the Sweet Track. There are several Roman sites particularly around the Charterhouse Roman Town and lead mining. Some later coal mining sites are also included in the list. Two major religious sites in Mendip at Glastonbury Abbey and Wells Cathedral and their precincts and dispersed residences, tithe barns and The Abbot's Fish House, are included in the list. Prehistoric defensive features such as Ponter's Ball Dyke were supplemented in the medieval period by motte- and-bailey castles such as Farleigh Hungerford, Nunney and Fenny Castle. Commercial and industrial development is represented by the Old Iron Works at Mells and various market crosses. The most recent site on the list is a World War II bombing decoy complex and anti-aircraft obstructions, which were built in 1940, on Black Down, the highest point of the Mendip Hills. The monuments are listed below using the titles given in the Historic England data sheets.

The barrows sit on crests of land at either end of a field in an area of the Mendip Hills with several Neolithic remains. They are assumed to be related to the Priddy Circles which lie to the north. Ashen Hill consists of six bowl barrows and two bell barrows aligned east to west while Priddy Nine Barrows divided into one group of seven round barrows and another pair slightly separated from the others. Excavations in 1815 uncovered cremation burials and grave goods. A geophysical magnetometry survey suggested that there may have been three further barrows.

Building of the palace started around 1210 by Bishops Jocelin of Wells and Reginald Fitz Jocelin. The chapel and great hall were added by Bishop Robert Burnell between 1275 and 1292. The walls, gatehouse and moat were added in the 14th century by Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury. The Bishops House was added in the 15th century by Bishop Thomas Beckington. The great hall later fell into disrepair and was partially demolished around 1830. The palace was originally surrounded by a medieval deer park. When the walls were built, streams were diverted to form the moat as a reservoir. In the 1820s, the grounds within the walls were planted and laid out as pleasure grounds by Bishop George Henry Law, who created a reflecting pond near the springs. Parts of the buildings are still used as a residence by the current bishop, however much of the palace is now used for public functions and as a tourist attraction.

It is named after the shoemaker Richard Brown, who was the next door tenant in 1553.

His son, Sir Walter Hungerford, extended the castle with an additional, outer court, enclosing the parish church in the process. In the English Civil War in 1642, the castle was seized by Royalist forces in 1643, but recaptured by Parliament without a fight near the end of the conflict in 1645. By the 18th century the castle fell into disrepair; in 1730 it was bought by the Houlton family, when much of it was broken up for salvage. In the 1915 Farleigh Hungerford Castle was sold to the Office of Works and a restoration programme began. It is now owned by English Heritage, who operate it as a tourist attraction.

It was rebuilt and by the 14th century was one of the richest and most powerful monasteries in England. The abbey was suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII of England. The last abbot, Richard Whiting (Whyting), was hanged, drawn and quartered as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor in 1539. From at least the 12th century the Glastonbury area was frequently associated with the legend of King Arthur, a connection promoted by medieval monks who asserted that Glastonbury was Avalon. Christian legends have also claimed that the abbey was founded by Joseph of Arimathea in the 1st century. The ruins of Glastonbury Abbey were purchased by the Bath and Wells Diocesan Trust in 1908 and are now the property of and managed by the Glastonbury Abbey trust.

Finds of flints indicate a prehistoric Mesolithic occupation. The fort has multiple ramparts (multivallate) following the contours of the hilltop, enclosing an area of about 2.4 ha (6 acres). Most of the perimeter is a double rampart, but the flatter eastern side has an extra counterscarp rampart with well-defined double ditches. There are two entrances to the south-east: one is a simple opening with evidence of a guardhouse; and the other shows linear features of a holloway. The fort contains about 14 round barrows (tumuli), which form a line of burials running east-west along the crest of the hill. The fort and the barrows appear to be Bronze Age, but excavations have found some Iron Age pottery in the barrows and the ditches.

Fishing was carried out in artificial ponds, which were mentioned at Meare in the Domesday Book and from the River Brue and Meare Pool. The present rectangular stone building was constructed by the abbot between 1322 and 1335 for the storage and processing of the fish and as a residence for the chief fisherman. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the building fell into disrepair and it was seriously damaged by fire in the 1880s.

It was commissioned for the family chapel of Pope Clement VIII Aldobrandini and completed between 1603 and 1608. It was most likely the sight of Barocci's Presentation of the Virgin in the Chiesa Nuova at its unveiling in 1603 that led to the commission of the Communion four months later. On 13 August 1603 the pope communicated with the minister to Francesco Maria II della Rovere, duke of Urbino, Giacomo Sorbolongo, about acquiring an altarpiece from Barocci. At this time the Cavaliere d'Arpino was the pope's most important artist; the letter goes on to ask that d'Arpino not be told of the commission. Study for the servant at the left front, ca. 1604 Detail from the School of Athens, Michelangelo as Heraclitus The commission was completed entirely in Urbino and efforts were made to supply Barocci with extensive information about the contextual chapel, which was frescoed by Cherubino Alberti with a Triumph of the Holy Cross. Gian Pietro Bellori wrote that the pope was supplied with preparatory sketches. The pope sought the removal of Satan from the original design, and thereafter asked that it depict a night scene. Barocci quotes from Raphael's School of Athens by inserting the portrait of Heraclitus, which many believe is a portrait of Michelangelo. Significantly, he depicts Judas Iscariot using Michelangelo's portrait. To an audience familiar with this association, this would have been taken as particularly strong commentary on the status of the Michelangelo. Furthermore, by directly quoting from Raphael, who was Michelangelo's antithesis and favoured by the Clementine church, Barocci, and by implication Pope Clement VIII, inserted a comment on the relative status of the two artists within the church of the time. Barocci asked 1,500 scudi for the altarpiece. The fee undoubtedly was influenced by the number of figures. At the same point in his career (1604), he had accepted 300 scudi for a much simpler Crucifixion (Museo del Prado, Madrid).

Lenepveu was an outstanding student, and qualified to practise law in December 1862. During his time at the Sorbonne he had been taking lessons in music theory and harmony with Augustin Savard, professor at the Paris Conservatoire, and counterpoint and fugue with Charles-Alexis Chauvet, organist of Saint-Merri and Sainte-Trinit√©, Paris. In 1862, Lenepveu won first prize in a competition with a cantata, which was performed in Caen. He decided to defy his father and abandon the law in favour of a career in music. In 1864, on Chauvet's recommendation, he was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire, where he studied composition under Ambroise Thomas. The following year he won France's most prestigious musical award, the Grand Prix de Rome, with his cantata Renaud in the Gardens of Armida to words by Camille du Locle. The Prize brought with it a two-year period of study at the French Academy in Rome, based at the Villa Medici. While there he successfully took part in a competition for dramatic composition; his three-act comic opera Le florentin, to a libretto by Henri de Saint-Georges. After much delay, and pressure from the composer, the piece was staged at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris in February 1874. It was moderately successful there and achieved greater success in the provinces.Wagstaff, John. \\"Lenepveu, Charles Ferdinand\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 25 August 2014. Before the delayed presentation of Le florentin Lenepveu's Requiem Mass was performed at Notre-Dame de Bordeaux in 1871, won critical approval, and was given in Paris the following year. =Professor= In Paris Lenepveu taught private pupils and, in 1880, he was appointed to the faculty of the Conservatoire. When Ambroise Thomas died in 1896, Lenepveu was elected to succeed him as a member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, beating his rival candidate, Gabriel Faur√©, by nineteen votes to four. Faur√© was thought by the conservative Acad√©mie members to be too innovative; Lenepveu's staunch traditionalism was more to their taste.Duchen, p. 120 At the same time as lecturing at the Conservatoire, Lenepveu remained active as a composer. Two one-act operas were completed but not staged. At the behest of its dedicatee, Adelina Patti, his four-act opera Vell√©da was presented at the Royal Opera House in London in 1883. The Times found the composer's melodies unoriginal and undistinguished but praised his skilful orchestration.\\"M. Lenepveu's Velleda\\", The Times, 6 July 1882, p. 10 In 1905, Lenepveu was at the centre of what became known as \\"l'affaire Ravel\\". Maurice Ravel, who was widely recognised as a composer of outstanding talent and promise, was eliminated from that year's Prix de Rome. When it emerged that Lenepveu, who was on the jury, had contrived to exclude all but his own pupils from the finals, there was a public outcry. He was denounced by the leading critic Pierre Lalo as \\"a poor musician, author of a few worthless compositions; without ideas or art; but he is a member of the Institut\\". Th√©odore Dubois, the director of the Conservatoire, had already announced his forthcoming retirement and brought it forward in the wake of the scandal. Lenepveu, as a member of France's musical Establishment, had been expected to succeed him, but, seeking drastic reforms, the French government appointed Faur√© over Lenepveu's head.Duchen, pp. 149‚Äì150 Lenepveu died at his home in Paris, at the age of 69. He was buried in his native Rouen.

After Sunset. H√∏jen (1909) The North Sea in Stormy Weather. After Sunset. H√∏jen () is a 1909 painting by Laurits Tuxen. Although his paintings of Skagen date from the beginning of the 20th century, Tuxen is now considered to be one of artists known as the Skagen Painters who gathered in very north of Denmark in the 1870s and 1880s. Background The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings and celebrations. Laurits Tuxen (1853-1927), a graduate of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, first visited Skagen in 1870. After further visits in the 1870s, he finally acquired a summer residence there with his second wife Frederikke Treschow in 1901. He was not present in Skagen when the artists' colony reached its heights in the 1880s but he is now considered to be one of Skagen's most important painters, thanks to the many works he painted between 1901 and his death in 1927. He is however remembered first and foremost for his large portraits of the royal families of Europe. Painting description The North Sea in a Storm is a painting of the sea at H√∏jen on the west coast of Skagen Odde. Measuring it is one of Tuxen's largest works. As a result of its monumental size, it gives the observer the impression he is standing beside the turbulent sea, especially as the waves reach right to the bottom of the frame. The blues and greens of the sea contrast with the warm orange and yellow shades of the sky. The sun has just set, its last rays reflected in the lower waves. While many of the works of the Skagen Painters depict the beaches, Tuxen's painting is restricted to the sea itself. The Tuxens donated the work to Skagens Museum where it is now part of the collection.

It is one of the few unusual photosynthetic protists that acquire plastids from algae by endosymbiosis. By forming massive blooms, particularly in late summer and spring, it causes red tides. It produces toxic substances and the red tides cause widespread infection of seafood, particularly crabs and mussels. When infected animals are consumed, severe diarrhoea occurs. The clinical symptom is called diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. The main chemical toxins were identified in 2006 as okadaic acid and pectenotoxins. They can produce non-fatal or fatal amounts of toxins in their predators, which can become toxic to humans. Description Dinophysis acuta is a marine unicellular protist, and is the largest among Dinophysis. It is an armoured species with a distinct body covering called theca or test. The body is laterally compressed with a small, cap-like epitheca and a much larger hypotheca. It has the double collars (known as cingulum) around the top of the cell, and a further wing (known as the sulcus) running vertically down the cell. It is oblong in shape with almost entirely rounded posterior end, but the tip of the end is slightly pointed. The size ranges from 54 to 94 ¬µm in length and 43 to 60 ¬µm in dorso-ventral width, with the widest region below the middle. The small epitheca is composed of four plates. It is low, flat or weakly convex, and is invisible in lateral view, which is a good identifying feature. The sulcus consists of several irregularly-shaped plates, and it contains the flagellar pore. The hypotheca has four large plates that constitute the majority of the cell. The anterior two-thirds of the hypotheca has convex margins, while the posterior third forms a broad asymmetrical triangle with a straight dorsal edge, and occasionally a slightly concave ventral edge. Reproduction is by simple binary fission. The most unusual cellular structure is the presence of numerous reddish-yellow chloroplasts, which are derived from its prey, which in turn had acquired from algae. Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning The first cases of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) due to D. acuta were recorded in 1972 in Peru, but were reported to the scientific community only in 1991. It is a mildest form of seafood poisoning, indicated by severe diarrhoea. The first toxins isolated from the species were pectenotoxins (PTX-2 and PTX-11) in 2003 from specimens collected from the west coast of South Island, New Zealand, and PTX-12 independently at Skjer, Sognefjorden in Norway. In 2004, the presence of okadaic acid esters was reported. Further identification and the importance of these compounds as causal factors of DSP were discovered in 2006.

It was constructed by ƒ∞brahim Aƒüa in 1454. History The Aƒüa Hamamƒ± was constructed for Fatih Sultan Mehmet as a private hamam for him and his sons. At that time, Beyoƒülu District was not settled and the Padishahs would come there for hunting. The sultan constructed this building as a hunting house in 1454. Aƒüa Hamamƒ± was designed as a hamam below the two flats above. It underwent a large-scale renovation in 1844 by Abd√ºlmecid I . It was used by the Padishahs and their sons until the final years of the Ottoman Empire. Architecture Aƒüa Hamamƒ± Entrance Door =External structure= It is a three-floor building sitting on a 650 sqm of land. The first two floors were built as the house and the entrance floor as the Aƒüa Hamamƒ±. The exterior and the top of hammam (a skylight dome with round frames) were designed to receive the daylight from sunrise to sunset. The hammam has a 250 sqm section at the back to heat it. In those years this section was named ‚Äúkulhan‚Äù. This building was influenced by the classic era that began at the end of the 15th century. Many buildings that were constructed by Mehmed the Conqueror right after the Conquest of Constantinople followed this trend. =Internal structure= The internal structure consists of sections called ‚Äúsoyunmalik, iliklik and sicaklik‚Äù (changing rooms and the sections for warming up and heating up respectively) Apart from these sections, the installations section takes up a huge room. This section consists of the water reservoir, kulhan and cehennemlik (literally ‚Äúhell room‚Äù). The most voluminous spaces in Aƒüa Hamamƒ± are usually the changing rooms. The house and the hammam have very high ceilings which extend up to 3.5 meters. High ceilings are the most prominent features of historical buildings. The internal part of Aƒüa Hamamƒ± consists of three sections: * Entrance (changing room) There are three floors in the entrance section and the middle part of these three floors is open, which is an architectural example of that period. The changing rooms and the recreation chamber are in this section. This section has no heating system and hot water installations. * Inside the hammam (iliklik and sicaklik) The ‚Äúiliklik‚Äù is the section that helps your body to adapt to the temperature changes between the changing room and the section called ‚Äúsicaklik‚Äù. The most important space of hammams is the ‚Äúsicaklik‚Äù. It was constructed as two parts. In the first part there are doorless cells called ‚Äúhalvet‚Äù located at the corners. In the second part there are bathing niches (located between the cells), marble banks running along the wall sides and in the middle a center stone. There are nine ‚Äúkurnas‚Äù and a center stone in the large area. This is the part for sweating and bathing. Walls and floors are covered with marble. Halvets have three kurnas each. * Kulhan Kulhan section includes the water reservoir and the cehennemlik. Kulhan is the section from which the hammam is heated. It sits on an area of 250 square meters. It is both used for the storage of firewood and for the heating of hammam. It is located at the rearmost of the hammam. Here, the heat generated in a furnace is distributed below the hammam (in the cehennemlik). The furnace also heats the bathing water. Features During the 15th century, sultans or padishahs constructed hammams for the public use and therefore the hammams were used to be constructed as double (separate parts for men and women). The most important feature of the Aƒüa Hamamƒ± is its being a public hammam. It was a hammam which the padishah of the time constructed for himself under a hunting house. Despite not being a definite example of a palace hammam it is an example of a private padishah hammam. Renovation The hammam underwent a large-scale renovation in 1844 by Abdulmecid, moving it further away from the classic era architecture that began in the 15th century. The last renovation of the hammam was in 1986 by Ali Yilmaz, the last owner. There have been no renovations for about thirty years.

Its titular is the Our Lady of Candelaria (also Our Lady of Candles). The church is known for its Spanish colonial architectural style and the rococo- influenced retablos. The church and retablo of the Our Lady of Candelaria Parish was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines on 3 February 2017.  Church History  The Franciscans started evangelizing Silang in 1585 with the permission of Fr. Cristobal de Salvatierra. After ten years, the parish was established on February 3, 1595. They built a small chapel made of light materials under the patronage of St. Diego of Alcal√° and a small school and took charge of Silang until 1611. Due to the request of an encomendero (grantee of an encomienda), Capt. Diego Jorge de Villalobos to the rector of the Society of Jesus in Manila, the Jesuits were assigned to Silang in May 1599. The first Jesuits in town was Fr. Diego Sanchez and Fr. Diego de Santiago. The first two Jesuits were followed by Fr. Luis Gomez, Fr. Francisco Almerici, Fr. Pedro Chirino, and Fr. Leonardo Scelsi. The church and school built by the Franciscans was destroyed by fire on August 30, 1603. With a new order of priests to administer, the church and school previously built by the Franciscans were transferred in a new location and made even larger. The stone church was built from 1637 to 1639 under the auspices of Fr. Juan de Salazar and was dedicated to the Nuestra Senora de Candelaria in 1640. When the Jesuits were expelled from the Spanish colonies, the parish was taken over by the secular clergy in 1788, the Augustinian Recollects in 1849, back to the secular clergy in 1868, Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (CICM) in 1910, seculars in 1913, Columbans in 1936 and is now administered by the secular clergy since 1978.  Features  Unlike other Jesuit churches like Antipolo and Tanay built under the auspices of Fr. Salazar, Silang church is a typical baroque church without any elaborate and magnificent ornamentation on its simple fa√ßade. Huge stone walls were built to protect the church from bandits. Like its exterior, the interior of Silang is also simple. There are no ornamentation on its pilasters and small windows are placed high on walls. It also has a large wooden church entrance. The lack of magnificence on Silang church was due to the death of Fr. Salazar in 1645 who primarily administered the church construction In 1937, the original wooden floor was replaced by red clay tiles. Due to a fire in 1950, the ceiling was replaced one meter away from the original location. = Belfry = It has a four-story belfry connected to the main church. The first floor is four sided while the rest of the floors are octagonal. The fourth story of the belfry was destroyed in the 1880 earthquake and was only restored to its original height in 1989, after a hundred years. = Retablos or Altarpieces= The retablos of Silang falls under the baroque style and is built from 1643 to 1663. It has three retablo, one retablo mayor or main altar and two side altars or colaterales in each side of the transepts which are mirror images of each other. The side altars have three levels containing relieves except for the central niche of the second story. The first and second level has three niches while the third level has a single niche. Fluted ionic columns and corinthian columns designed the first story and the second and third stories respectively. On top of the altars are statues of angels holding shields. One of the side altar is dedicated to women saints, saints in the New Testaments and martyrs. The other one was dedicated to the Jesuit saints. The presence of local styles such as plants, fruits, volutes or circular designs and millipedes made the retablo of Silang distinct. The altar mayor is the largest and highest altar among the three altars and known relieves depicting the story of Jesus in the life of Mary based on the mysteries of the Holy Rosary. It has three levels, seven alternating niches for saints and relief and same divisions like the side altars. Instead of fluted Corinthian column separating the retablo sections, garlanded Corinthians and salomonicas are used. The same local styles are also used in the main altar like fruits and flowers including decorative motifs of foliage, angel heads, acanthus crenelations, cartouches and empty rectangle. The six relieves on the altar mayor are: # Ang Pagbisita (Visitation of the Angel Gabriel to Mary) # Ang Panunul√∫yan (Re-enactment of the journey of St. Joseph and Mary in search for lodging in Bethlehem) # Ang mga Mago (The Three Kings) # Ang Presentasyon sa Templo (The Presentation of Jesus at the Temple) # Ang Koronasyon (The Coronation of Mary) The seventh relief on the topmost level is a relief of the Santo Ni√±o de Ternate. The image of the Nuestra Se√±ora de Candelaria¬∏ patroness of Silang is currently located at the central niche of the first level of the altar mayor. = Restorations = During the 1980s up to the early 1990s, the church had a white interior with hints of gold in the columns, niches, pediments, saints and foliage of the retablo which was done during the 1970s restoration by Talleres de Maximo Vicente through application of varnish. Revarnishing was done in 1989 for preservation. The original pastel color of the retablo was restored in 2002 by carefully removing layers of lacquer, modern varnish, paraffin and soot. In 2004, the golden pillars were restored to beige with a hint of avocado green and its rouge flowers to pink to complement the modern-day adobe wall-cladding. Ceiling height was also restored to its original location. During the 21st century restoration, a statue of St. Paul holding a sword located at the right-most portion of the retablo was stolen. It was never recovered and a replica was used to replace the original statue.  Devotion to the Virgin of Candelaria  Andres, an indio from Silang discovered a box containing an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the mountains of Silang in 1640. Another indio, stunned by the glory of the image requested Andres to give it to him and without hesitation, Andres gave it to the indio. Later on, a tabernacle was built because of the large number of devotees. On January 30, 1643, the indio left the town and forgot about the sacred Friday devotion that he inherited from his ancestors. Upon his return to Silang, the image was not anymore in the tabernacle. He asked for forgiveness, searched for the image and found it. It again disappeared for nine times over the next few years. Upon the advice of the Jesuit rector, he ordered the people to make vigil, bring the image to the church in festive mood. From then on, the image was permanently placed in the retablo of the church of Silang. Until now, the same procession and festive mood is still celebrated in Silang from February 1 to 3 every year that coincides with the feast of the Virgin of Candelaria every February 2.

Thomson's three autobiographical works were: The Road to Dunfermline: The Story of a Thirty- Five Years' Quest,Thomson, D.P. (1951) The Road to Dunfermline: The Story of a Thirty-Five Years' Quest - part I, An Evangelist in Training 1916-1933 Crieff: Barnoak, National Library of Scotland shelfmark NF.702.d.5(7). Why I BelieveThomson, D.P. (ed.) (1963)Why I Believe: Tom Allan, James S. Stewart and D.P. Thomson discussing personal Christian belief with Ian Pitt-Watson on B.B.C.

(1967) Personal Encounters Perth: The Research Unit, National Library of Scotland shelfmark NF.1365.e.5. In the 1930s, while Warden of the St Ninian's Centre, Lassodie, Thomson created The Lassodie Press and published further Christian titles edited by him, including Scottish Pulpit: Sermons by representative Scottish preachers,Thomson, D.P. (ed.) (1937) Scottish Pulpit: Sermons by representative Scottish preachers Dunfermline & London: Lassodie Press 1937, National Library of Scotland shelfmark L.150.i. Professor as Preacher: Sermons by Scottish Theological Professors,Thomson, D.P. (ed.)

(ed.) (1944) Women in the Pulpit: Sermons and Addresses by Representative Women Preachers Dunfermline & London: Lassodie Press, National Library of Scotland shelfmark 5.1074. Four of Thomson's books attracted more commercial publishers and a wider readership: these were Men Christ Wants: Evangelistic Addresses, How I found Christ. Personal Narratives Of Conversion, and two books containing stories of missionary adventures, intended for a younger readership: Labrador To Savage Island - Stories Of The Ships Of Christ - Maritime Missionary Adventure Throughout The World, and Goodwin Sands to Solomon Islands: More Stories of the Ships of Christ. Many of Thomson's pamphlets were on Scottish church history. George Wishart: The Man Who Roused Scotland was commissioned by the Wishart Quarter-Centenary Committee for the commemoration held that year at St Andrews.Thomson, D.P. (1946)George Wishart, The Man Who Roused Scotland Edinburgh: Church of Scotland Publications Dept., National Library of Scotland shelfmark L.117.i.3(2). Other pamphlets were produced in connection with campaigns in particular areas: for example, It Happened in Kintyre supported the campaign in the Kintyre peninsula of 1949.Thomson, D.P. (1949) It Happened in Kintyre Glasgow: The Church of Scotland Offices, National Library of Scotland shelfmark N2.205.3596L; Bardgett, Scotland's Evangelist p.216. Adult ministry - first phase Ordained in 1928, 'DP' served first as minister of Dunfermline: Gillespie Memorial congregation. In 1934 he was appointed to the staff of the Home Board of the Church of Scotland as an evangelist, leading Seaside Missions in the summer and local campaigns in the winter months. During this period he also founded the St Ninian‚Äôs, Lassodie, Training Centre (in Fife) and the Lassodie Press. D.P. Thomson married Miss Mary Rothnie in 1939: she was the daughter of Rev. Douglas Rothnie, minister at Lucea, Jamaica. They had no children.Frame, Fire in His Bones pp.16-17. During the Second World War he was minister at Cambuslang: Trinity Church of Scotland and founded ‚ÄòThe Church of Scotland Fellowship in Evangelism‚Äô.Bardgett, Scotland's Evangelist pp.163-188. Many members of the congregation were called up for war-service and at the end of the war the Service Personnel Committee of Trinity Church published a duplicated volume, Letters To The Manse From Members And Adherent Of Trinity Church, Cambuslang, On Service With The Navy, The Army, The Air Forces, The WMS The ATS, The WAAF, The Mercantile Marine, The Land Army And The Nursing Services 1939-1945, on behalf of its funds.Thomson, D.P. (ed.) (c.1945) Letters to the Manse [etc], Cambuslang:Service Personnel Committee of Trinity Church; National Library of Scotland shelfmark 5.1125. Learning that his friend Eric Liddell had died in a Japanese Internment Camp on 21 February 1945, D.P. Thomson became Secretary to the Eric Liddell Memorial Committee.Bardgett, Scotland's Evangelist p.185. Funds were raised to assist Liddell's widow and for the education of their children and also to endow an Eric Liddell Memorial Trophy for the best boys‚Äô performance at the Scottish Schools Athletic Championships.Magnusson, The Flying Scotsman p.180-81; To support the Fund, 'DP' wrote a short biographical pamphlet: Eric Liddell: The Making Of An Athlete And The Training Of A Missionary, which was published in Glasgow by the Committee in 1946.Thomson, D.P. (1946), Eric Liddell: The Making Of An Athlete And The Training Of A Missionary, Glasgow: The Eric Liddell Memorial Committee, \\"4th edition, completing 55,000\\". National Library of Scotland shelfmark 5.1129. The archives of Eric Liddell Memorial Fund are [2014] held by the Lloyds Banking Group Archives (Edinburgh). Later, Thomson wrote a full-length biography of Eric Liddell: Scotland's Greatest Athlete: The Eric Liddell Story, republished in hardback as Eric H. Liddell: Athlete and Missionary. Adult ministry - second phase From January 1946 'DP' was again appointed by the Home Board as organiser for seaside mission and summer camp work, a post which also allowed him to lead evangelistic campaigns.Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae vol.10, p.456. One of these, in Glasgow: North Kelvinside, the parish of one of his seaside mission leaders, Rev. Tom Allan, caught public attention for its use of intensive visiting of the parish by congregational members and volunteers from outside. Thomson came to specialize in Visitation Campaigns, which in their developed form involved teams visiting all homes in the target area as well as most places of work, cinemas, pubs, football matches etc. - the worlds of home, work and leisure.Highet, The Scottish Churches, 75-82; Secretariat for Evangelism, Ecumenical Studies: Evangelism in Scotland, Geneva: World Council of Churches 1954, pp.22, 33-35, 45. In order to concentrate on this work, he secured Tom Allan's secondment from North Kelvinside to organize the seaside mission programme of 1949.Bardgett, Scotland's Evangelist p.215-16. D.P. Thomson had a supporting role in the Tell Scotland MovementHighet, The Scottish Churches, 86-87 and also in the Edinburgh events of the Billy Graham All-Scotland Campaign of spring 1955. To coordinate the volunteers Thomson recruited from congregations across Scotland he founded the Work & Witness MovementFrame, Fire in His Bones pp.23-26. and, 1955‚Äì58, led geographically ambitious campaigns in the Western and Northern Islands. These campaigns were not without their critics. Some thought that the use of volunteers from outside undercut mission by church members living in the area, that the missions were \\"perfunctory and superficial\\". In 1958 ‚ÄòDP‚Äô founded his second Residential Centre for Lay Training at St Ninian‚Äôs, Crieff, and was its Warden until retirement in 1966 - after which he continued writing from what he described as ‚ÄòThe Research Unit', his own home at Barnoak, Crieff.Bardgett, Scotland's Evangelist pp.339-374. D.P. Thomson was awarded an honorary D.D. by the University of Glasgow in 1962. He died on 16 March 1974.Frame, Fire in His Bones pp.35-37. The Council on Mission and Discipleship of the Church of Scotland is D.P. Thomson's literary executor, and they retain his remaining archive of papers, including his multi-volume 'Diary of My Life'. Theology D.P. Thomson, in his autobiographical The Road to Dunfermline, claimed to have learned most from the American evangelist, Dwight L. Moody.Thomson, The Road to Dunfermline p.12. He also admired Henry Sloane Coffin and claimed that as an adult his own trajectory was away from the fundamentalism of his youth.Bardgett, Scotland's Evangelist pp.221-228. Within British evangelicalism Bebbington held the broad or open evangelical approach he described as \\"centrist\\" ... \\"was probably most successful in Scotland, where D.P. Thomson and Tom Allan were leaders of an effective movement of co-ordinated lay evangelism.\\" As he was not primarily a theologian, Thomson's approach could also be described as \\"pragmatic\\".Doyle, 'Introduction' in Women of the Scottish Church p.11. Evangelism, D.P. Thomson believed, was an imperative: \\"Evangelism is at once the primary work of the Church and the most urgent need of the hour. It is hardly possible to exaggerate its urgency or to overestimate its importance.... If [the Church] fails to display a living and vigorous evangelism, she has failed in her essential and ultimate mission, and the days of her influence are numbered.\\"‚ÄòIntroduction‚Äô in 'Two University men' (ed.) (1924),Evangelism in the Modern World, London: Thomson & Cowan. Significance Although after 1947 Thomson sought primarily to utilize the \\"sleeping giant of the lay forces of the Church\\",Frame, Fire in His Bones p.23. his ministry was also said to be responsible for \\"a steady stream of men and women for the whole-time service of the Church, as ministers, missionaries, deaconesses, lay missionaries and teachers\\".Frame, Fire in His Bones p.13. Thomson emphasized the contribution offered by women to the ministries of the church, publishing pamphlets on Women as Elders: The Verdict of Experience,Thomson, D.P. (ed.) (1965), Women as elders the verdict of experience: 200 ministers, session clerks and women elders of the Presbyterian Church of England and the United Free Church of Scotland discuss this vital topic Crieff: St Ninian's Training Centre: National Library of Scotland shelfmark 5.4846. Women Ministers in Scotland: Personal Records of Experience and Discovery and The Elder‚Äôs Wife: her place in the life and work of the ChurchThomson, D.P. (ed.)(1973) The Elder's wife her place in the life and work of the Church Crieff: The Research Unit: National Library of Scotland shelfmark HP1.85.536. He supported the Order of Deaconesses. After 1955 'DP' diverged from both Tom Allan and Billy Graham, preferring to emphasize the significance of the personal approach rather than the mass meeting as means of outreach, publishing his findings in Dr Billy Graham And The Pattern Of Modern Evangelism, Crieff: St Ninian's Training Centre 1966.Doyle, 'Introduction' in Women of the Scottish Church p.9. Thomson's influence in the Scottish Churches of the period following the Second World War has been compared to that of Rev. George MacLeod, whose biographer wrote: \\"Church people often divided themselves into Thomson men or MacLeod men\\". Not all appreciated Thomson: in a memorial tribute, Ian Doyle acknowledged that Thomson could be thought \\"a difficult man to work with\\", \\"off-hand and ungracious\\", with an \\"arrogance and loudness of his manner\\"; \\"he gave offense to some by the sheer vehemence of his enthusiasms\\". Yet he also admired Thomson's deeper humility, loyalty, capacity for affection and commitment.Doyle, 'Introduction' in Women of the Scottish Church p.11.

During his career, he handled many rare books, including items from the library of Herman Melville. Early life Harzof was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. According to David A. Randall, Harzof's father decided to emigrate to America after he and his family were pushed off the sidewalk and into the gutter by a group of soldiers. The family arrived in New York City in 1881. Harzof attended grade school in the city until he was twelve years old and then obtained a job as an office boy with the booksellers F.W. Christern & Co. Career Harzof went into business for himself in 1905 with a shop in Lexington Avenue called the Lexington Bookshop. His firm was G.A. Baker and Company Inc. Over 30 years, he developed a reputation as an expert in book values and was sought by serious book collectors for his advice and assistance in building their collections. He would never allow his name to be mentioned in dedications, acknowledgements, or in any other way in books, even though he was instrumental in training book dealers, helping academics in their research, and aiding collectors in building their libraries. He had an additional business line of insurance and tax valuations. He was honest in his dealings, generous, plain-speaking (sometimes crude), and \\"no respecter of persons\\". When asked by bookseller Gabriel Wells why he was selling Wells an Oscar Wilde manuscript for the price of $1,040, Harzof candidly admitted, \\"I wanted to make an even thousand-dollar profit\\". When one wealthy woman did not like his valuation of her worm-eaten books, she accused him of being a \\"mere junk dealer\\". Harzof replied, \\"That could be, but I have never heard it said that a bookworm made any distinction between a ten-thousand-dollar book and a ten- cent one\\". On another occasion, the writer Edward Larocque Tinker incurred the displeasure of Harzof and found his works included ever after in Harzof's catalogues under the rhyming insult STINKER. Harzof thought honesty a rarer quality than intelligence. He lent his assistant William Hobart Royce to bookseller Wells. According to Harzof, Royce's \\"main virtue was that he could be implicitly trusted with bags of uncounted gold\\". One beneficiary of Harzof's generosity was David A. Randall, who was allowed to work from Harzof's shop for three years from 1931 when he found himself unemployed due to the Depression. It was Harzof who was responsible for Randall meeting Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., of the pharmaceutical Lilly family, when in 1932 Randall took a suitcase full of William D. Breaker's books to Lilly on behalf of Harzof. Lilly later donated his extensive collection to Indiana University to form the Lilly Library, on condition that Randall went along with it. Herman Melville When Moby-Dick author Herman Melville died in 1891, his widow sold the remains of his library to a book dealer in Brooklyn for $110 after a New York dealer offered only $100. Items from that sale were still turning up on both sides of the Hudson River in the 1930s. One was Melville's personal annotated copy of Thomas Beale's The Natural History of the Sperm Whale (London, 1839), which was found in a collection of miscellaneous maritime books brought into Harzof's shop. In 1932, Harzof found Melville's personal copy of Owen Chase's Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex, of Nantucket; Which was Attacked and finally Destroyed by a large Spermaceti-Whale, in the Pacific Ocean (New York, 1821), which included eighteen pages of notes in Melville's writing in which he said that \\"the reading of his wondrous story upon the landless sea ... had a surprising effect upon me\\". Death Harzof died 3 January 1942 at the age of 67. He was survived by his wife, Mildred. His business was bought by his former employees John S. Kebabian and Bernard G. Otto.

Childhood, education and personal life  Mander was the younger son of Sir Geoffrey Mander, a Wolverhampton industrialist and Liberal politician, born by his second wife Rosalie Glynn Grylls, herself a Liberal political activist in the 1920s and then writer, biographer and art collector. Mander grew up in Wolverhampton at Wightwick Manor, going on to Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he established a reputation for his poetry. He first married Gertrude (Necke) Bracher from Stuggart on 17 December 1956, whom he met while in Germany. They were divorced in the 1960s and he remarried Penelope Loveday on 19 April 1969. He died in September 1978.  Career and writings  From 1954 to 1958 Mander lived in Berlin and Munich, gaining a detailed knowledge of German language and culture in the then West Germany. He returned to live in Islington, London, in 1958, becoming Assistant Literary Editor of the New Statesman from 1960 to 1962 and then from 1963 to 1965 the Assistant Editor of Encounter, serving on its editorial broad for eight years. Mander published several books on Germany. The first two, The Eagle and the Bear (1959) and a Penguin Special Berlin: Hostage for the West (1962), were heavily marked by the Cold War concerns of the day. Our German Cousins: Anglo-German relations in the 19th and 20th Centuries (1974) reflected more the development of European integration and the respective historical tensions and links between Britain and Germany. Following an Encounter sponsored trip to Latin America in the late 1960s, he also published Static Society: the Paradox of Latin America, in 1969. Mander was part of the centre right Anglo-American cold war consensus that grouped around Encounter and similar magazines. In 1961 he published The Writer and Commitment, looking at changing forms of commitment on the Left. These issues were also discussed in another Penguin Special Great Britain or Little England, 1963, in part also prompted by the issue of whether Britain should 'join Europe' in the then form of the European Community. Mander was also active as part of this informal grouping in supporting oppressed writers and intellectuals in the former Soviet bloc and Yugoslavia. With his first wife, Necke, Mander also translated three books from German: Klaus Roehler's, The Dignity of Night, Carl Zuckmayer's Carnival Confession and, most important in terms of its wider impact, Georg Lukacs's, The Meaning of Contemporary Realism. His poetry was printed in some magazines such as the New Review and in various limited editions. Writings =Books= *John Mander, Berlin : The Eagle and the Bear, London: Barrie and Rockliff, 1959.

Robert Cargill. It is a sequel to the 2012 film Sinister and it stars James Ransone, reprising his role from the original film, and Shannyn Sossamon as a mother whose sons are tormented by the ghostly children taken by Bughuul at their rural farmhouse. It also stars Robert Daniel Sloan, Dartanian Sloan, Lea Coco, and Tate Ellington in supporting roles. Sinister 2 was released in the United States on August 21, 2015, by Gramercy Pictures and Focus Features. The film received negative reviews from critics, with criticism for its jump scares, horror cliches and story, while Ransone's performance received some praise and grossed over $54 million against its reported budget of $10 million. Plot A home movie is shown depicting a family being hung up like scarecrows with sacks over their heads in a cornfield and burned alive. It is revealed to be the nightmare of nine-year-old Dylan Collins, who is squatting in a rural farmhouse next to a deconsecrated Lutheran church, with his twin brother, Zach, and their mother, Courtney. The family is on the run from an abusive husband, Clint. Dylan is visited nightly by a group of ghost children, led by an older boy named Milo Jacobs, who once lived in the house. Milo and the other children coerce Dylan to watch \\"home movies\\" of families being murdered in various savage ways, such as being eaten alive by alligators, buried alive up to their necks in the snow on Christmas Day, and being electrocuted in a kitchen. A former sheriff's deputy, now a private investigator, is researching the murders connected to Bughuul and burning down the homes where each murder took place before another family can move into them, including the house where Ellison Oswalt and his family were murdered. He arrives at the farmhouse to destroy it, but realizes Courtney and her sons are living there. He tells Courtney he is there to investigate the church on the property where a gruesome murder of a minister and his family took place. Clint shows up at the farmhouse with the police to try and take the boys but leaves after the Deputy threatens them, warning them that they need a court order. The Deputy reveals that he was arrested as a suspect for the murder of the Oswalts, but was cleared of the charge, and he was fired from the police for releasing classified information to Ellison. Courtney wants to leave with the boys, but the Deputy advises her not to, knowing that each of the murders connected to Bughuul occurred only after the families had left the homes where the previous murders had occurred. Courtney invites him to stay, and the two develop a budding romance. The Deputy meets with a professor who has come into possession of a ham radio that belonged to Professor Jonas from the previous film, who has mysteriously disappeared. The professor said the ham radio first belonged to a Norwegian family who was murdered in 1973. He plays a recording of a young girl screaming, \\"Bughuul can't hear me over your yelling, Mom!\\" as she kills her family. The Deputy deduces that Bughuul exclusively targets the children of the families, and orders the professor to destroy the ham radio. Zach becomes jealous of the ghost children who visit Dylan, and insists on having their attention, but Milo rejects him. The children show Dylan the video of the church murders, which are revealed to be done by Milo. He nailed his family to the floor by their wrists and put a rat on each person‚Äôs stomach. He then put metal bowls over the rats and placed hot coals on top of the bowls, which forced the rats to escape by eating through the victims. After Dylan refuses to watch the last movie, the children turn their attention to Zach and abandon Dylan, saying he is not their real target. Clint arrives with the court order and Courtney is forced to leave with Zach and Dylan. The Deputy drives to Clint's home to warn them about the danger, but Clint beats him up. The next day, Zach, as directed by the ghost children, films the family playing golf. That night, Dylan contacts the Deputy for help. Courtney, Dylan, and Clint are drugged and hung on scarecrow posts with sacks over their heads in the cornfield. A possessed Zach lights Clint on fire and films him as he burns to death. Just as Zach is about to light Dylan on fire, the Deputy hits Zach with his car. He frees Courtney and Dylan and they flee into the cornfield. However, Zach survived being hit and cuts off the fingers of the Deputy's left hand with a sickle. Inside the home, the ghost children try to help Zach find them. Just as Zach is about to kill Courtney and Dylan, the Deputy manages to break the camera, thwarting Zach's home movie and breaking the cycle. Zach tries to find another camera, but he is shamed by the ghost children for failing to kill his family. Without an object to influence living children and earn souls for Bughuul, they are now trapped in the spirit realm. Bughuul appears and places his hand on Zach's shoulder, causing Zach to decay and burst into flames. The house catches on fire as the Deputy, Courtney, and Dylan escape. Later, while collecting his things to leave with Courtney and Dylan, the Deputy finds the unharmed ham radio in his motel room and the ghost children begin speaking through it.

CinemaScore announced that audiences gave the film an average grade of \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale. IGN awarded it a score of 1 out of 10, saying, \\"Sinister 2 is an abysmal follow-up to its predecessor. At least that film knew that less is more. And less is scarier.\\" MoviePilot awarded the film 7 out of 10, calling it \\"one of the most creepiest horror films of the last few years.\\" Future =Potential crossover sequel= Prior to the release of Insidious: The Last Key, Jason Blum stated that a crossover film between Sinister and the Insidious series had previously been in development, tentatively entitled Insinister, and that he personally believed it had potential for re-entering it, stating that \\"we're going to cross our worlds at some point\\".https://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/10/insidious-sinister-movie- crossover/ References External links  * Category:2015 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2015 horror films Category:Films shot in Chicago Category:American sequel films Category:Snuff films in fiction Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Blumhouse Productions films Category:Demons in film Category:Entertainment One films Category:Focus Features films Category:Gramercy Pictures films Category:Films produced by Jason Blum Category:Films about nightmares Category:Films about domestic violence Category:Films about child abuse Category:Films scored by Tomandandy Category:Religious horror films ","title":"Sinister 2"},{"id":"43653265","text":"Eurysolen is a genus of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, first described in 1898.

The factory was founded by brothers Umberto and Dardano Randi, along with his cousin Ettore Randi. They started the business repairing machines, then building, with recycled materials, circular saws sold to some local carpenters and used by them until the end of the 90s (nearly 40 years of service). Subsequently, the factory began to transform American and English military tracked motor vehicles, left by the Allies after the end of the war, in tracked agriculture tractors. They adapted petrol 8 cylinder engines in order to operate with agricultural oil. Umberto, an expert engineer trained in Autocentro Militare in Bologna, invented, for this purpose, an oil agriculture vaporizer, using war materials remnants (shells of large caliber bullets and a series of copper tubes). In light of the success of the early fifties, the company began to produce real wheeled tractors of medium size (models R14 - R50), and made almost all the pieces needed for their construction. At the same time, Cugini Randi began to produce their first motocultivator as well as some machines such as the \\"Grillo\\" and the tiller R5. At the end of the 50s, Umberto died. Dardano and Ettore continued to work in the agriculture sector, diversifying the production. They started building steering boxes for different types of vehicles (construction machinery, etc.), they abandoned the production of medium-sized tractors and focused the production in tiller, motocultivators and small 4-wheel drive tractors. During the maximum production years (70s and 80s), the Cugini Randi had a decent network of representatives in Italy and a presence in Portugal, Greece and Belgium. Due to a very strong competition (with much greater production capacity), a professional machines of the type produced drop in demand, and a lack of a generational change, around the mid-80s, Cugini Randi company gradually ceased the activities, leaving the management of spare parts to its employees.

Saint Chad, who died in 672, was the first Bishop of Lichfield. The church was built in the 12th century, and is the oldest building in Stafford. The church was neglected in the 17th and 18th centuries, and much of the Norman architecture was obscured; there was much restoration work in the mid 19th century, particularly by George Gilbert Scott. The original building The building is cruciform and has a crossing tower.St Chad, Stafford The Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland, accessed 12 August 2014. There is an inscription in Latin on the impost at the north-east corner of the crossing: ORM VOCATUR QUI ME CONDIDIT (\\"He who built me is called Orm\\").

The two windows in the north wall of the chancel have interiors which are the only original window features in the building.Stafford St Chad GENUKI, accessed 12 August 2014. The tower was rebuilt in the 14th century; after this the church became neglected. In the 17th century the original aisles were destroyed, the arcades were bricked up, and the transepts were removed. Restoration There was some restoration in the 1740s by Richard Trubshaw, after the west end of the nave collapsed. His work included rebuilding the parapets of the tower and building a new west front, of brick. In the 1850s some restoration of the chancel was done by Henry Ward of Stafford. Restoration work was continued in the 1870s by George Gilbert Scott: he built a new west front of stone, in Romanesque style, and he opened up the south arcade and built a new aisle on this side. After his death in 1878, work was continued by Robert Griffiths of Stafford, using Scott's designs. From 1880 to 1886 he opened up the north arcade and built a new north aisle; he restored the tower, and the north transept. The south transept was built in the 1950s. Furnishings The organ was built by J. Kirkland of London in 1888, and extended by J. J. Binns of Leeds in 1909. It was restored in 1995 by Peter Collins of Melton Mowbray. The font, in Norman style, was built in 1856. The altarpiece was created in 1910 by Sir Walter Tapper. The inner porch, the rood-beam and the telescopic cover of the font were designed in the early 20th century by Sir Charles Nicholson, 2nd Baronet.

At a performance of Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy's oratorio Elijah at Birmingham in August 1846, Robinson (successfully) asked Mendelssohn to orchestrate the accompaniment of his Hear my Prayer for performance by the Antient Concerts Society. He married the English pianist Fanny Arthur (1831‚Äì1879; later known as \\"Mrs Joseph Robinson\\" or Fanny Robinson) in 1849, and their house at 3 Upper Fitzwilliam Street became a centre for visiting international musicians, including Joseph Joachim. He liked conducting at massive choral and orchestral occasions such as the 1852 Cork Industrial Exhibition, the 1853 Great Industrial Exhibition in Dublin, the 1865 Dublin International Exhibition of Fine Arts and Manufactures, and the centenaries of Daniel O'Connell (1875) and Thomas Moore (1879). Robinson was a co-founder of the Royal Irish Academy of Music in 1848 and professor of singing there (1856‚Äì75, and again from 1887), also conducting choral and orchestral classes, and a vice-president of the institution's Board of Studies, 1892‚Äì6. Charles Villiers Stanford was his most prominent (private) pupil. His busy teaching and conducting schedule left comparatively little time for composition. Two evening services and some anthems constitute his religious music, and there are also a number of songs and arrangements of Irish folk songs, the latter particularly lauded by Stanford.See Bibliography. He twice declined the conferment of a \\"Doctor of Music\\" (MusD) title from Trinity College Dublin, preferring to be known as \\"Joe Robinson\\".

The Mother Lodge \\"The Three Globes\\" was reactivated in 1946 and is currently a member of the umbrella organization United Grand Lodges of Germany.  History  On the night of 14/15 August 1738, the future Frederick the Great, then Crown Prince, was initiated as a Freemason in Brunswick, being quickly passed to fellowcraft and raised to Master, all without the knowledge of his father. He invited Baron von Oberg and the writer Jakob Friedrich von Bielfeld, who were instrumental to his candidature, to form La loge premi√®re/La loge du Roi notre grand ma√Ætre at Rheinsberg Castle, with Oberg as Master. After his accession to the Crown he led the lodge himself from 20 June 1740. The foundation of the Grand Lodge is taken as 13 September 1740, when, with the King's permission, the lodge Aux Trois Globes was formed under the auspices of the privy council and Charles-√âtienne Jordan. It was modelled on the Premier Grand Lodge of England, although it received no charter from it. When the King departed in the same year for the first Silesian War, La loge premi√®re was dissolved and its members joined the new lodge. This new lodge created according to the custom of their time in the coming years lodges in Meiningen, Frankfurt an der Oder, Wroc≈Çaw, Dresden and Neuch√¢tel. On 24 June 1744 they therefore took the name Great Royal Mother Lodge of the Three Globes, and finally changed this on 5 July 1772 to Grand National Mother Lodge of the Prussian-States. On 5 March 1767 the Mother Lodge \\"The Three Globes\\" became submerged in the Rite of Strict Observance as L'union, but withdrew in 1778. After the Williamsbad Congress of 1782/3, which ended Strict Observance, they declared independence and adopted the \\"Rectified System\\". To escape the Masonic hostility of the Third Reich, they turned to the \\"National Christian Order Frederick the Great\\" to, but this had no effect, because in 1935 they had to dissolve. After the Second World War, the Great National Mother Lodge was reactivated in 1946, but their effect area was initially limited to the American Sector in Berlin. A total of 42 lodges of GNML \\"3WK\\" joined the United Grand Lodge, founded in 1949, only five lodges in the Federal Republic remained faithful to their Grand Lodge, waiting for the local approval. The United Grand Lodges of Germany - Brotherhood of Freemasons was founded in 1958 as a national communicator with foreign grand lodges . To avoid name confusion, the United Grand Lodge of Germany changed its name to Grand Land AFAM from Germany and later to Grand Lodge AFAM of Germany. At the founding of VGLvD there were initially only two founding members. The Grand National Mother Lodge only joined in 1970 as an independent partner.website GNML \\"3WK\\"  Structure  Lodge House GNML \\"3WK\\" Heerstrasse,Berlin-Germany The Grand National Mother Lodge became a legal entity by royal charter on 9 November 1796. It is now a registered association. It is headed by the National Grand Master, supported since 1797 by the Federal Board of brothers with the highest degree. Similar to the Grand Landlodge of Freemasons of Germany, the GNML has separate bodies for the \\"higher degrees\\". In addition to the St. Johns lodges, administering the first three degrees of \\"apprentice,\\" \\"journeyman\\" and \\"Master\\", there is the 'General Old Scottish Lodge' for the 4th grade (\\"Scots Master\\") and the inner Orient 'for grade 5-7 (\\"Elect brothers\\", \\"Elect of the inner temple\\", \\"Intimate of perfection\\").

History  Campo Alegre Estate previously to the French physician Jean Pierre Salabert. It was confiscated in 1820, later became the property of John Jos√© da Costa and Arnaldo Ribeiro Barbosa. In 1895, Jo√£o Henrique Andresen purchased the Campo Alegre Estate. This Port wine dealer would later recuperate the gardens of the estate, imposing the romantic style that was popular at that time. Two members of the Andresen family would later become famous writers: Sophia de Mello Breyner and Ruben A., who lived in the estate and whose memories provide an historic record of the evolution of the gardens. The Portuguese state acquired the estate in 1949, converting it in 1951 in the Porto Botanical Garden. Since then, it has been managed by the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto and by the Gon√ßalo Sampaio Botanical Institute (which was later extinguished). The current head of the Botanical Garden is the landscape architect Teresa Andresen, a descendant of the former owners of the estate, with Professors Arnaldo Rozeira, Roberto Salema and Barreto Caldas da Costa preceding her. Following the construction of roads and a university sports center, the property later lost 8 of its 12 hectares. In compensation, the Burmester Estate garden, with 1,8 hectares, is added to the Botanical Gardens.

Definition Consider a monoid M. Consider a pair (A,L) where A is a finite subset of M that generates M as a monoid, and L is a language on A (that is, a subset of the set of all strings A‚àó). Let œÜ be the map from the free monoid A‚àó to M given by evaluating a string as a product in M. We say that L is a rational cross- section if œÜ induces a bijection between L and M. We say that (A,L) is a rational structure for M if in addition the kernel of œÜ, viewed as a subset of the product monoid A‚àó√óA‚àó is a rational set. A quasi-rational monoid is one for which L is a rational relation: a rational monoid is one for which there is also a rational function cross-section of L. Since L is a subset of a free monoid, Kleene's theorem holds and a rational function is just one that can be instantiated by a finite state transducer. Examples * A finite monoid is rational. * A group is a rational monoid if and only if it is finite. * A finitely generated free monoid is rational. * The monoid M4 generated by the set {0,e, a,b, x,y} subject to relations in which e is the identity, 0 is an absorbing element, each of a and b commutes with each of x and y and ax = bx, ay = by = bby, xx = xy = yx = yy = 0 is rational but not automatic. * The Fibonacci monoid, the quotient of the free monoid on two generators {a,b}‚àó by the congruence aab = bba. Green's relations The Green's relations for a rational monoid satisfy D = J.Sakarovitch (1987) Properties Kleene's theorem holds for rational monoids: that is, a subset is a recognisable set if and only if it is a rational set. A rational monoid is not necessarily automatic, and vice versa. However, a rational monoid is asynchronously automatic and hyperbolic. A rational monoid is a regulator monoid and a quasi- rational monoid: each of these implies that it is a Kleene monoid, that is, a monoid in which Kleene's theorem holds.

He and his family were presented to the Emperor of China. Circa June 13‚Äì14, 1776, Sonom and other rebel leaders were executed by lingchi.

Other women and the children were sentenced to life imprisonment ().Theobald, \\"The Second Jinchuan Campaign,\\" p. 84 (PDF 94/458). Misidentification as a Hmong king The 1988 book Hmong: History of a People by H. Keith Quincy stated that Sonom was a Hmong king.Entenmann, p. 1. The book by Quincy, cited by others, stated that in 1772 Sonom had defeated a Chinese army and that Sonom had held the Chinese government forces at bay for four years. According to the Quincy account, ultimately Sonom surrendered when the Chinese promised that his family would survive if he did so. Instead he and his family were executed. Paul Hillmer, the author of the A People‚Äôs History of the Hmong, wrote that \\"This compelling story helps set a dramatic tone for discussing the Hmong's life of hardship in China\\".Hillmer, Paul. A People‚Äôs History of the Hmong (UPCC book collections on Project MUSE). Minnesota Historical Society, 2010. , 9780873517904. Google Books Page unstated PT20. Robert Entenmann, author of \\"The Myth of Sonom, the Hmong King,\\" stated that Sonom in fact was not Hmong. Entenmann argued that the use of the word \\"Miao\\" was imprecise during the time when Jean Joseph Marie Amiot wrote an account of the Jinchuan Wars,Entenmann, p. 5. since the Qing government under the Qianlong Emperor referred to all ethnic minorities in Southwest China as \\"Miao people\\" ().Entenmann, p. 6. Amiot uses \\"Miao-ts√©e\\" () to refer to the Gyalrong people, of which Sonom was a part.Entenmann, p. 4. This is distinct from the word \\"Miaozu\\" ().Entenmann, p. 14. \\"30 Herbert A. Giles, A Chinese-English Dictionary, 2nd ed.

See his review essay, \\"The State of Hmong Studies,\\" in Nicholas Tapp, Jean Michaud, Christian Culas, and Gary Yia Lee, eds. Hmong/Miao in Asia (Chiangmai: Silkworm Books, 2004). \\" Fran√ßois Marie Savina, in Histoire des Miao, reprinted the account by Amiot. Entenmann stated that Savina made the error confusing the Gyalrong for the Hmong because he \\"was unfamiliar with Chinese history and the subtleties of Chinese vocabulary\\" even though he had studied Chinese.Entenmann, p. 6. The word \\"Miao\\" in general was also used to refer to Hmong people. Entenmann stated that the book Hmong: History of a People \\"does not offer a reliable history of the Hmong in China\\" because Quincy was \\"evidently not trained as a historian\\" and did not read Chinese, so he introduced the error made by Savina. Jean Mottin also included the Savina account in The History of the Hmong (Meo).Entenmann, p. 12. Anne Fadiman in her book The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down cited Quincy and stated that Sonom was Hmong. Entenmann wrote that because of the reliance on Quincy's book, Fadiman's book propagated the mistaken idea that Sonom was a Hmong king. Hillmer wrote that Entenmann's article \\"has largely proved[...]that Sonom was not Hmong\\".

In the second half of the 18th century he was the archbishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Skopje. His reports to the Vatican are an important source for demography study of his diocese.  Origin  Mazarek was born in Janjevo in 1726. There are different views about the ethnicity of the Mazarek family. Noel Malcolm believes that they were Albanians who absorbed Serbian and forgot the Albanian language. The basis for his position are toponyms in Mal√´sia (region of northern Albania and southern Montenegro). Some other authors, such as Luca Maiocchi, point to a Slavic origin of this family name, typical for the group of mixed Montenegrin-Albanian tribal names (i.e. Krasniƒá/Krasniqi). Vukanoviƒá believes this family name is derived from pan- Slavic word mes-ar—ä (). Skoko connected this family name with Serbo-Croatian name for a bird. Elsie links the name to Mazreku, an Albanian tribe north of Shkod√´r, the geographic position m(b)as rek√´s - \\"beyond the river\\" (). Career Before 1743 Jovan Nikoloviƒá (or Gjon Nikolle) sent Mazarek to Italy to be trained for his religious tasks. In 1750 he was archbishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Skopje. Many of his ancestors and descendants were notable Catholic priests, such as: * Pjeter Mazarek, archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar * Josip Mazarek, his brother, catholic priest.  Reports  He wrote notable reports to Vatican during the second half of the 18th century. Those reports include description about migrations of people from Mal√´sia (region now divided by Montenegro and Albania) to region he referred to as Serbia (modern-day Kosovo). In 1792 he reported that villages around ƒêakovica received influx of Catholics from Albania. He was not pro-Albanian and his reports include many complaints about Albanians who arrived from Malesia.

It was released in Japan in 2013, and worldwide in English by MangaGamer in 2015. Synopsis No, Thank You!!! follows a young man as he recovers from a car accident where he was hit to protect a bystander. Having lost his memories, he is taken in by the man he saved. But as he slowly gets his feet under him, working at the man's own bar, he learns the place is the scene of some shady goings-on. Development The game was developed by Parade, an at the time newly founded brand for boys love visual novels; most of the staff were employees at the eroge developer Clockup. Shigeo Hamashima served as concept artist, illustrator and graphic designer for the game. Like most other Parade staff, this was her first work for a boys love game. One major difference compared to her previous works was that the art had to show multiple male characters' faces on screen at the same time; in eroge marketed for men, the art is often drawn from a male character's point of view, with the aim to keep his face out of the shot. She did research in preparation for No, Thank You!!!, and consulted with other women to see how far she could go with her more explicit portrayal of sex while still having it be appealing to women, as well as whether she would be able to portray the characters in a masculine way rather than a \\"sparkly- clean, romanticized one\\". While she had to follow Japanese obscenity laws by adding mosaic pixelization to the art, she still drew details underneath, as she hoped that someone would get to see the uncensored art at some point. In 2013, Parade announced that an original video animation based on the game was being worked on.

Line T5 connects the centre of Saint-Denis (March√© de Saint-Denis) and Garges - Sarcelles station, in the Northern suburbs of Paris. Line T5 was √éle-de-France's first rubber- tyred tramway line. The line has a length of and 16 stations. It opened to the public on 29 July 2013. First envisioned during the 1990s as a means of providing better public transportation through Paris's northern suburbs, particularly the expanding districts of Pierrefitte-sur-Seine and Loch√®res in Sarcelles, actual planning activity for the line started during 1999. During February 2005, the defined Line 5 project was publicly announced by the Syndicat des Transports (STIF). Transit operator RATP was appointed as the principal contractor for performing the construction of the new line. During the latter part of 2009, work commenced upon Line 5's civil engineering works; construction commenced upon the track infrastructure and stations almost one year later. Line T5 is operated by the R√©gie autonome des transports parisiens (RATP) under the authority of √éle-de-France Mobilit√©s. Development =Background= Line T5 was designed with the stated aim of providing superior public transportation services in the northern suburbs of Paris, France, specifically the two neighborhoods of Pierrefitte-sur-Seine and Loch√®res in Sarcelles, which have been identified as possessing an expanding population during the years running up to the turn of the century. It was built to serve in excess of 86,000 neighbouring residents spread across five different communities, these being Saint-Denis, Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, Sarcelles, Garges-les-Gonesse and Montmagny. Key interchanges include St.Denis Market on the Line T1, Saint-Denis Basilica on Metro line 13 and at Garges- Sarcelles on R√©seau Express R√©gional (RER) Line D. Notably, Line 5 is unlike any previous tramways in the region in that it was designed to be a rubber- tyred tramway; as such, the completed line holds the distinction of being the first tyre-based tramway to be established in the √éle-de-France region. Between 1999 and 2004, planning and surveying of the intended line was performed while the project was quietly defined by planning authorities. During February 2005, the Line 5 project was publicly announced by the Syndicat des Transports (STIF), the transport authority for the IIe-de-France region. During November 2006, STIF issued its approval of the route's preliminary draft. During the first half of 2007, it was announced that an agreement concerning financing had been signed between the project's major stakeholders. Transit operator RATP became the principal contractor for the Line 5's construction, which included multiple stations and a maintenance depot. The regional councils of Val d‚ÄôOise and Seine-Saint-Denis were assigned responsibility for the civil works relating to the highway and associated public spaces. STIF served in a project management capacity on the construction phase, coordinating between the different parties involved. =Construction= During January 2008, work commenced upon preliminary construction of Line 5; during this phase, it was necessary to relocate numerous residents, pedestrian footpaths and bus stops along the route ahead of the actual construction activity. This displacement and relocation was supported by a one-off investment of ‚Ç¨40.23 million, which was contributed by the regional council of Seine-Saint-Denis. Displacement work stated that same month in Valley d‚Äô Oise; by January 2009, the process had reportedly reached the vicinity of Seine-Saint-Denis. During the final months of 2009, civil engineering works commenced simultaneously in the Val d‚ÄôOise and Seine-Saint- Denis districts. In the latter half of 2010, work began on the construction of the tracks, platforms and the maintenance depot for Line 5. On 29 July 2013, the completed tramway was officially opened for revenue services.\\"Inauguration Tramway line T5.\\" etf.fr, 5 September 2013. Reportedly, Line 5 had been constructed at an estimated cost of ‚Ç¨163.13 million. It is both owned and financed by STIF, who hold a 71.5 per stake in Line 5; the remaining minority stakes are owned by the State Region of France (17.2 per cent), the regional council of Val d‚ÄôOise (10 per cent) and RAPT (1.3 per cent). RATP is the body responsible for the line's operations, and has invested a total of ‚Ç¨52 million on the procurement of its rolling stock.\\"France: EIB lends EUR 300 million to finance √éle-de-France tramway.\\" European Investment Bank, 7 November 2011.  Route  Schematic map of Line T5 Rolling stock The T5 is operated by a fleet of Translohr STE3 rubber-wheeled trams. During 2007, a contract for the delivery of 15 trams was awarded to Lohr Industries. The STE3 is a three- carriage tram vehicle; with a length of 25 metres, it provides sufficient capacity for the boarding of up to 127 passengers at a time. The trams are fitted with a relatively low floor, easing the boarding process for passengers, particularly those who have reduced mobility.\\"Paris Tramway Line T5.\\" railway-technology.com, Retrieved: 11 June 2018. Typically, each tram traverses the entire route within the space of 22 minutes, during which it normally achieves an average speed of . The tram vehicle possesses a relatively small axial radius of 10.5 metres, which is a favourable quality for the T5 line, which has been considered to be somewhat curvy and have sharp bends present along its route. For more consistent stopping distances, they are equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS) system. According to the rolling stock manufacturer Alstom, the Translohr tramway system combines the benefits of a guided system with those of tyre-based vehicles, including increased brake performance due to the greater adherence of tyres, lower noise levels and favourable gradient performance.\\"Translohr tramway on tyres.\\" Alstom, 11 June 2018.

The project was discontinued because, according to developer Ernest W. Adams, Bullfrog had decided not to make any other real-time strategy games.

The full name of the sport is Double Harness Scurry Driving. Rules The aim is to achieve the fastest time in getting around the track, without knocking any balls off the top of the cones that mark the course. For every ball that is knocked off, a time penalty in incurred. It is almost always done at a gallop. Due to the small distance between the cones (170cm), accuracy is key. A course contains between 10 and 14 obstacles, such as a box and a slalom. The ponies are normally given names of famous pairings, such as Tom & Jerry, Bonny & Clyde, Judge & Jury, and so on. History The History of Scurry Driving Scurry Driving started at the Horse of the Year Show in 1968. It was evolved from the American Rodeo sport of Chuck Waggon Racing, an idea brought to Great Britain by Frank and Cynthia Haydon after competing with a Private Drag and team of Hackney Horses at the Devon Horse Show in Pennsylvania, where the Four in hand teams were invited to drive their Coaches through pairs of Forty five gallon barrels (reference to be added: http://www.britishcarriagedriving.co.uk/news/2005/2005_home/028_obituary_frank_haydon.htm). This first year at HOYS the competitions were open to pairs of Horses and ponies, the course consisted of pairs of (unnumbered) fibre glass ‚ÄúWatneys‚Äô Red Barrels somewhat smaller than the 45 gallon Barrels (205 Litre oil drums) that were used in the USA, the width was altered to give the same width tolerance for each competitor. There were three competitions, a Stakes Competition, with the clear rounds going into a drive off with the fastest clear round to win, the second Competition was a Scurry Class which was a speed competition with four seconds added to your time if you knocked a barrel, with the fastest corrected time to win. The Championship was again a Scurry class. So was born the Sport of Scurry Driving. These Scurry Driving Competitions were specifically formulated in 1968 for pairs of Horses and Ponies with the horse classes dropped out due to lack of support, and the pony class being split into 2 classes one under 12 hands and the other over 12hands and under 14.2 hands, and were not evolved from competitions for single Horses or Ponies. Scurry driving has become ever more popular over northern Europe during the first decade of the twenty-first century. The very best scurry drivers from Great Britain, such as Philip Litchfield, Lucy Scott, Jenny Bean, Robert Lightwood, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany regularly compete in the European Championships. The first European champion was British driver Lucy Scott in 2007. In 2008 the title was won by Belgian Pieter Van Den Broeck and in 2009 by Dutch driver Youri Otten. 'Carriage Driving Magazine', December 2009. The 2010 European Champion was again Pieter van den Broeck from Belgium with the UK's Philip Litchfield driving Thunder and Lightning in second place. In 2011 Dutch competitor Martien Van Viem won a hard fought European championship, second was British driver Jenny Mountain with Song and Dance. Official bodies The sport was governed by the British Horse Driving Trials Association since the 1960s, but in 2001, the Scurry Drivers Association was formed. Scurry driving was then recognised as a sport in its own right. There are now 2 governing bodies of Double Harness Scurry, running under slightly different rules. These are the Scurry Driving Association, and the Osborne Scurry Group both running national leagues leading to championships at the end of the year, and each crowning a champion for their own group. Shows Scurry driving takes place in the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Northern Europe. In most countries scurry driving is a fun, end of show activity. In Great Britain and Northern Europe it is very skilled and competitive. Currently the high point of the season are the European Championships which take place in the Netherlands. There are roughly 35 major shows in the UK, and 3 main championships. These are the Horse of the Year Show champion as competed for by the Osborne Scurry Group; The County Show series National Champion and the SDA Premier League Points Champion.

Biography Annab (standing front row in military uniform) praying alongside Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser during Ramadan, 1956 Radi Annab was born in 1897 in Nablus, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His father was Hajj Hassan Annab, an officer of the Ottoman Army. Annab's father instilled in him the values of military service, discipline and professionalism. Although Annab, like his father, enlisted in the Ottoman army, he later defected to join Sharif Hussein's British-backed Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916. In 1923, Annab was among the Arab officers who formed the core of the British-led Arab Legion of the Emirate of Transjordan, which was ostensibly ruled by Sharif Hussein's son, Emir Abdullah I. Annab was the chief of police for the Balqa District in 1930, as well as the Arab Legion's chief of public security. In 1937 he was assigned chief of police of Karak District, before being reassigned to Balqa the following year. In 1941, Annab was reassigned chief of public security and then posted as the chief of police in Amman and Ajloun in 1943 and 1944, respectively. As the Jerusalem District's police chief, Annab was present with King Abdullah I during the latter's assassination at the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem by a Palestinian shooter opposed to the king's policies. In the ensuing firefight with the shooter, who was shot dead, Annab was wounded.Yitzhak 2012, p. 102. On 29 June 1953, Annab met with Israeli general Moshe Dayan where they discussed ways to put an end to attempts by Palestinian refugees to infiltrate into the Israeli side of the Green Line, a cause of consternation for Israel. The Jordanian Armed Forces was formed on 1 March 1956 out of the Arab Legion. King Hussein, at the time, sought to distance himself from Jordan's former colonial power, the British, and disprove the contention of Arab nationalists that Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's commander, was the actual ruler of Jordan. Hussein Arabized the Army command, and Glubb was dismissed on the same date and replaced with Annab,Yitzhak 2012, p. 122. who became the Arab Legion's first Arab commander. Prior to his appointment, Annab had only held police posts. Annab retired two months later, on 24 May 1956, and was succeeded by Major Colonel Ali Abu Nuwar. During his lifetime, he was decorated with Jordan's Medal of Independence and Order of the Renaissance.

Tectosilicates are built on a framework of tetrahedra with silicon or aluminium at the centre and oxygen at the vertices; they include feldspars and zeolites, but leifite does not belong in either of these categories. It is a member of the leifite group, which includes telyushenkoite (Cs,Na,K)Na6(Be2Al3Si15O39) and eirikite KNa6Be2(Si15Al3)O39F2. Leifite was discovered in 1915, and named after Leif Ericson who was a Norse explorer who lived around 1000 AD, and was probably the first European to land in North America, nearly 500 years before Christopher Columbus. Eirikite was named in 2007 after Eirik Raude, or Erik the Red, (950‚Äì1003), who discovered Greenland and who was the father of Leif Ericson. The third mineral in the group, telyushenkoite, was discovered in 2001. It was not named after any of Leif Ericson's family members, but after a professor of geology in Turkmenistan.  Structure  Leifite is a trigonal mineral, class 2/m, space group Pm1.Canadian Mineralogist (2002)40:183-192 There are 3 formula units in the unit cell (Z = 3), and cell dimensions are 14.4 √Ö in the a direction and 4.9 √Ö in the c direction.American Mineralogist (1972) 57:1006Bulletin of the Geological Society of Denmark 20:134 (1970) It contains OH groups, but no water of crystallization as was previously assumed.Norsk Geologisk Tidsskrift (1995) 75:243-246 Tetrahedrons of silicon or aluminium atoms surrounded by four oxygen atoms link to form six-membered rings stacked along the c direction to form channels, similar to those in zeolites.  Appearance  Leifite is generally white or colourless, with a white streak and a silky or vitreous lustre. It occurs as fine needles making up radiating aggregates and rosettes. Individual crystals are deeply striated hexagonal prisms that are transparent to translucent.  Physical Properties  The mineral is hard, with Mohs hardness 6, the same as that of feldspar, and specific gravity 2.6, again like the feldspars. It is brittle, with an uneven to splintery fracture.  Optical Properties  Leifite is uniaxial(+) with refractive indices nœâ = 1.516 and nŒµ = 1.520. The maximum birefringence Œ¥ = 0. 011. Leifite is not luminescent.  Occurrence  The type locality is the Narsaarsuk pegmatite on the Narsaarsuk Plateau, Igaliku, Narsaq, Kujalleq, Greenland and type material is kept at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, US. Leifite occurs in cavities in alkali- pegmatite veins. At Mont Saint-Hilaire it occurs as crystals up to 5 cm long and as disk-shaped aggregates and radially fibrous spheres associated with albite, natrolite, serandite and catapleite. In Greenland it occurs in a pegmatite with microcline, calcite, zinnwaldite and acmite. In Russia it occurs in the Lovozero Massif associated with albite and natrolite. In Norway it occurs in a nepheline syenite pegmatite on the south eastern part of the island of Vesle Aroya in the Langesundsfjord District, Oslo Region, as white to colourless fibrous masses and radiating bundles.

For a while it was considered to contain the oldest known Etruscan frescoes. It is named after the owner of the land where and when the tomb was discovered. Because of a lack of inscriptions, it is unknown who was buried in this tomb. The tomb has not been dated with any precision. Description Painting of a horse A 6 feet wide passage is hewn in the rocks in the side of the Poggio Michele hill, with a sculpted stone lion on each side of the entrance, and two similar ones at the actual entrance of the tomb. On the side facing the entrance are a four paintings, placed one above another on each side of the door to the inner chamber. One is a three feet wide painting of a strange, multi-coloured horse with some humans and other animals. Beneath is a painting of other animals and legendary creatures. The opposite wall also has paintings in the same style. The sides, floor and ceiling are not decorated. The paintings are now badly faded, and the original colours are hardly discernable anymore. Though no longer considered to be the oldest known Etruscan paintings, they are still the earliest ones to display such a variety of forms in unified images instead of loose figures. On both sides sits a stone ledge, which had skeletons on them at the time of the discovery. One of them was a warrior, and the other a woman, perhaps the wife of the warrior. On the floor are four large vases of about three feet high, containing human ashes. These vases are decorated with geometric patterns, while a number of smaller ones have paintings of humans, in one instance depicting some Bacchanal. Other pieces of furniture, including bronze mirrors, and some small sculptures, were found in the tomb as well. The tomb also had a smaller inner chamber, decorated with two sculpted ceiling beams. On three sides, it had a ledge with earthenware vases and chests. These as well contained human ashes. The inner chamber did not contain any elaborate frescoes, only six depictions of multi-coloured discs on the side opposite the entrance. File:Tombe Campana dessin de fresque 1.jpgSecond painting, to be found beneath the horse painting File:Tombe Campana dessin de fresque 2.jpgOther painting from this tomb Discovery The tomb was found in 1842-1843 on the land of Marquis Gian Pietro Campana, a collector of all things Etruscan, who had opened the passageway to the tomb and installed a new door, but otherwise left it untouched. The first to describe it at length was George Dennis in 1848, in his work The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria. He considered the paintings to be the oldest Etruscan paintings and possibly the oldest paintings in Europe known at the time. The tomb has no inscriptions, and consequently it is not known who was buried there. The exact date of the tomb and its paintings and sculptures has been debated, with estimates ranging from the early seventh century BC, to the second half of the sixth century BC. Doubt has been cast on the finds in this tomb, apart from the lion sculptures and the frescoes which are not in dispute.

It is designated a protected scheduled monument. History The castle was built by the Calder family, but later came into the possession of the Forbes family. On the night before the battle of Alford in 1645, the Marquess of Montrose stayed at the castle. Structure The tower, which is three storeys high, has an entrance on the south, the principal entrance to the castle. This was the south-east tower of the castle, and it contained a turnpike stair to the first floor. The ground floor of the Hall was stone-vaulted. There are round gun-loops in the basement of the tower, while there are quirked roll-mouldings on openings on upper levels. There appears to have been private accommodation in the upper floor of the tower, access being only from the main castle. This was lit by a large window. There are two recesses for armorial, both now empty, one over the entrance, and the other above a first-floor level slit window.

Technical background  Swedish high-speed train X 2000 approaching Ledsgard. This phenomenon, which is similar to a sonic boom from supersonic aircraft, was theoretically predicted in 1994. Its first experimental observation took place in 1997-1998 on the newly built high-speed railway line in Sweden (from Gothenburg to Malmo) for high-speed trains X 2000. At some locations along this line characterised by very soft ground (near Ledsgard) the Rayleigh wave velocity was as low as 45 m/s, and train speeds of only 165‚Äì170 km/h were sufficient to observe the effect. In particular, the increase in train speeds from 140 to 180 km/h was accompanied by about tenfold increase in generated ground vibration level, which agrees with the theory. It is now understood that, with the increase of operating train speeds, this phenomenon represents a major environmental problem associated with building new high-speed railway lines.  Mitigation measures  The most efficient way to mitigate ground vibration boom is to reduce train speeds at locations where Rayleigh wave velocities in the ground are very low. If this is not desirable, e.g. for economic reasons, some mitigation measures can be applied, such as stiffening of railway embankments or building protective trenches and barriers between railways and residential or industrial buildings. Any mitigation measures would involve the specific ground investigation works along the route.

It was proposed in 1967 by Howard H. Rosenbrock.  Definition  Consider the dynamic system :: \\\\dot{x}= Ax +Bu, :: y= Cx +Du. The Rosenbrock system matrix is given by ::P(s)=\\\\begin{pmatrix} sI-A & -B\\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\end{pmatrix}. In the original work by Rosenbrock, the constant matrix D is allowed to be a polynomial in s. The transfer function between the input i and output j is given by ::g_{ij}=\\\\frac{\\\\begin{vmatrix} sI-A & -b_i\\\\\\\\\\\\ c_j & d_{ij} \\\\end{vmatrix}}{sI-A} where b_i is the column i of B and c_j is the row j of C. Based in this representation, Rosenbrock developed his version of the PHB test. Short form For computational purposes, a short form of the Rosenbrock system matrix is more appropriate and given by ::P\\\\sim\\\\begin{pmatrix} A & B\\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\end{pmatrix}. The short form of the Rosenbrock system matrix has been widely used in H-infinity methods in control theory, where it is also referred to as packed form; see command pck in MATLAB. An interpretation of the Rosenbrock System Matrix as a Linear Fractional Transformation can be found in. One of the first applications of the Rosenbrock form was the development of an efficient computational method for Kalman decomposition, which is based on the pivot element method. A variant of Rosenbrock‚Äôs method is implemented in the minreal command of Matlab and GNU Octave.

Established as a joint venture of the Polish government and 19 private companies of the arms industry, it became one of the largest arms dealerships of the 1920s and 1930s. Between 1926 and 1939 SEPEWE exported Polish and foreign-made military equipment to over 30 states, obtaining between 320 and 350 million z≈Çotys. The company specialised in both surplus military equipment of World War I vintage and modern weapons produced by Polish factories. Equipment sold ranged from small arms to modern PZL.37 medium bombers.  Name  The full name of the syndicate was \\"Eksport Przemys≈Çu Obronnego SEPEWE sp. z o.o.\\" - \\"Export of Arms Industry SEPEWE, Co. Ltd.\\". The SEPEWE name itself was initially an abbreviation meaning \\"Arms Industry Export Syndicate\\" (), but the full name was rarely used.  History  Although after World War I and the Polish-Bolshevist War Poland inherited a sizeable arms industry, the Polish Army also had large stocks of military equipment. As domestic orders for new weaponry dwindled, Polish arms industry tried to find new clients abroad, mostly in Romania, Yugoslavia and Turkey. Simultaneously, the Polish Army also tried to sell surplus war materiel to those states, both as a means of obtaining funds for further modernisation of the armed forces, and as a means of strengthening Poland's political influence in Central Europe. Initially the private companies tried to compete on their own while the government's efforts were directed by head of Army Administration Office, Gen. Mieczys≈Çaw Norwid-Neugebauer. The private companies tried to join forces by forming a Section of Military Industry (, SPW) lobbying group as part of the Metal Industry Exporters Union, but European markets of early 1920s were filled with surplus rifles, bullets and artillery pieces and the sales drive brought little effects. The situation changed dramatically after the May Coup d'√âtat of 1926. Already in late May Norwid-Neugebauer met with the industry's representatives to establish possible ways for the Army and the arms producers to cooperate. The new government of Kazimierz Bartel promised to lower the export tariffs, and Polish State Railways tariffs for arms transports, take over the promotion of Polish arms industry and provide the companies with cheap, state-sponsored credits. Finally on 5 November 1926 the Ministry of Military Affairs signed an agreement with 19 mostly privately held arms industry companies to establish the SEPEWE company. Although initially the company's shareholders were mostly privately held companies, the Sanacja focused on nationalisation of strategically important branches of the economy and already in 1928 most shares of the SEPEWE were in government hands, either directly or indirectly. In 1934 the company received a de facto monopoly for arms exports and in 1937 it was converted to a joint stock company, with most shares in direct government control.  Clients  At one point or another SEPEWE had representatives in 70 states, with roughly half eventually buying Polish arms. The income of the company made Poland one of the largest arms exporters of the era, though many arms deliveries were paid for with raw materials and other supplies rather than money. The largest clients were: * Spanish Republic - 180 million z≈Çoty * Greece - 20 million * Romania - 18,5 million * Bulgaria - 16 million * Turkey - 8 million * Yugoslavia - ca. 7.9 million * China - 7 million * United Kingdom - 5 million * Kingdom of Hejaz - ca. 3.62 million * Netherlands - 2.5 million * Estonia - ca. 2.1 million * Brazil - ca. 1.62 million * France - ca. 1.5 million * Palestine - 1.5 million * Hungary - ca. 1.5 million  Equipment sold  Although Poland was one of the first signatories of the arms embargo on Spain, the Spanish Republic was one of the largest clients of SEPEWE during the Spanish Civil War. Spain bought, among other types of weaponry: * over 1700 Ckm wz. 30 machine guns * 3000 pieces of M1895 Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifles (in January 1937, transported aboard SS Cieszyn) * 25,100 pieces of Polish-made Karabin wz. 98 Mauser and Karabin wz. 98a rifles (between September 1936 and September 1937) * 2000 pieces of Karabinek wz. 29 carbine * 2000 to 2600 pieces of ex-German Gewehr 98 rifles from the Erfurt Arsenal (in February 1937) * 37,400 pieces of ex-French Berthier rifles of various types (in three batches in March and April 1937) * 10,000 pieces of ex-French Lebel rifles (in December 1936) * 26,000 pieces of ex-British Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles (in October 1936) * 27,000 pieces of ex-Austro-Hungarian Mannlicher M1895 rifles (in four batches between October 1936 and April 1937) The Polish Army also sold to Spain an unspecified number of other rare types of rifles and carbines, among them Fusil Gras mle 1874, Kropatschek rifles and Vetterli rifles. In addition to service weapons, the SEPEWE syndicate also sold to Spain at least 7 Krupp 7.5 cm Model 1906 mountain guns and at least four 75mm Schneider guns of various types. The SEPEWE also supplied arms to the other side of the war, the Francoist Spain. While Spanish Republic wanted to buy the PZL P.11e fighter in 1935, Polish government feared that the design might leak to the Soviet Union and the deal was denied. Eventually in 1937 over sixty Polish planes were sold to the Nationalists through Portugal. Among them were 20 pieces of PWS-10, 20 Breguet XIX, 20 PWS-16, 4 RWD-13 and 1 RWD-8.

The museum consists of an outdoor park that includes three separate museum ships, a historic building with exhibitions on the theme of the sea and a hanger-workshop with exhibits on the building of small wooden ships and vessels.  Description  The museum is located in the municipality of L'Islet on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, about east of Qu√©bec City.Croteau, Andr√©; Tr√©carr√© (ed.) Les mus√©es du Qu√©bec: 400 mus√©es √† visiter, Saint-Laurent, 1997, p. 37, . The municipality has a rich maritime history, including the training of maritime navigators associated with the Canadian Merchant Navy. The museum's mission is to safeguard, enhance and enable the study of the maritime heritage related to the St. Lawrence River, from the Great Lakes to the high seas, including the Arctic territories. The museum was previously named as the Maritime Mus√©e Bernier in honour of Captain Joseph-Elz√©ar Bernier (1852‚Äì1934), a L'Islet native and mariner explored the Canadian Arctic.  History  = Origins = The maritime history of the L'Islet region dates to its New France period.Chass√©, Sonia. La Vie maritime dans L'Islet, Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, Qu√©bec: Publications du Saint-Laurent, 1995, pp. 17‚Äì18, , OCLC 35933543. In 1853, the Christian Brothers created a school and taught maritime navigation. After a slow start, the school took the form of an \\"Industrial College\\" in 1873, better known today as the l'√âcole des marins (School for sailors), providing seamanship training. In 1920, navigators who trained at the school founded the Association for Sailors in the St. Lawrence Valley. They organized several exhibitions in the local maritime college and founded the museum in 1968, Canada's first maritime museum. The region of Quebec that lies in the St. Lawrence River valley, from Levis to Kamouraska, has a history of shipbuilding with over 2,000 vessels built in the 19th century.Boulizon, Guy. Qu√©bec museums, Montreal: Fides, 1976, Vol. 2, pp. 157‚Äì160, , OCLC 715029312. From its inception, the museum benefited from the help of local agencies and the Ministry of Culture of Quebec. This support allowed the museum to collect hundreds of maritime objects in its early years, objects that form the core of its collection. It was recognized by the Ministry of Culture of Quebec in 1975 and is the proprietor of the National Maritime Collection of Quebec. = Maritime park enlargement in 1983 = In 1979 Canada Steamship Lines (CSL) donated the JE Bernier II, a maritime museum-boat which it had sponsored on a journey through the Northwest Passage in 1977. The museum acquired a second ship in 1980, the CCGS Ernest Lapointe, a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker used on the Saint Lawrence River. In 1983 the museum acquired a third ship, the military hydrofoil, HMCS Bras d'Or of the Canadian Forces Maritime Command, which became the world's fastest warship in the early 1970s. In 1983, the museum expanded and underwent a major renovation to meet current museum standards. In 1997, the museum began construction of a hangar-workshop to house the collection of traditional small wooden boats. The project proved controversial among locals because of the architectural style of windowless building and because its location west of the convent blocked the view of the river and its museum-ships. However, the museum's management argued that the site chosen was the only possible one and that the building could not use another location. The construction ended in June 1998, and the museum then possessed a collection of 35 vessels from most maritime regions of Qu√©bec (√éle d'Orl√©ans, √éle aux Coudres and Kamouraska). In 2001, the museum received an award from the Qu√©bec Ministry of Tourism. This award recognized the efforts of the museum over the previous 33 years and invited visitors to make \\"an appointment with naval history\\" through its exhibits and its museum ships. = Continued expansion and new exhibits, 2009‚Äì2013 = In January 2007, the museum received a grant CA$1.35 million from the Quebec Department of Culture and Communications to help its expansion plans and the preservation of its collections. Financial assistance also allowed the museum to improve its reception area, and its maintenance and repair of the main building. The total cost of the work is estimated at $2.25 million. At the end of 2007, the Canadian government announced its participation with a grant of $950,000. Rear of the former convent museum building, at left, as well as the museum's small vessel workshop at right The expansion work and restoration of the museum began in September 2009. Renovations were carried out on the former convent building of the Surs du Bon-Pasteur such as restoring its windows, masonry and roofing. The museum was expanded by adding a section between the convent and its chapel. The museum also took possession of a former National Bank branch building located next to the convent, which was converted into a conservatory storage facility. The space recovered in the convent building increased the exhibition space, especially for the collection of 200 boat models, and added a theatre that will be used mainly for maritime heritage films. Work was completed in July 2010. The total project cost was CA$4.4 million, with the Quebec government contribution increased to $3.05 million to allow completion of the work. The J.E. Bernier Foundation also contributed $250,000 in order to restore museum vessels. Other local agencies completed the financing of the project. On 15 September 2010, the museum received an additional $500,000 for the construction of a new permanent exhibit. The permanent exhibits are to be fully restored and the grant will aid the interpretation of shipbuilding. The public should have access to the new exhibit in June 2013. From the summer of 2012, the museum will be open to visitors through guided tours.

The church was built on the site of a thatched house that had previously served as a worshipping place for Jaffna's Catholics. The church has a total of fourteen novenas. The ancestors of the 10th and 11th novenaa gifted land for the church and the ancestors of the 12th and 13th novenas gifted land and also contributed with money for purchasing land for the church. By the early twentieth century the church, which was now a cathedral, had become too small to accommodate all its worshippers.

Fashion Tourism can be defined as ‚Äúthe interaction between Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs), trade associations, tourism suppliers and host communities, with people travelling to and visiting a particular place for business or leisure to enjoy, experiment, discover, study, trade, communicate about and consume fashion.‚Äù International cities are increasingly using the cultural industries for the development of tourism and other industries to boost their economic fortune and to position themselves in the global market. There is often no need for cities to specialize in any new activity but rather to diversify their economy and it is in this context that fashion tourism has been adopted and promoted in cities such as Antwerp, London, and Tokyo. Fashion is a global industry and many capital cities have press-grabbing trade activity at least twice a year, e.g. London through its London Fashion Week, and this is often the starting point for many DMOs to take fashion seriously as a new anchor for their tourism industry and visitor economy. They are consciously pushing fashion week trade events into the public eye to raise their city's fashionable credentials and encourage visitors to consider travel to their city.  Prime movers  London (via the Mayor of London's office) and New York (via the New York City Economic Development Corporation) government offices have been leading the way internationally to use their fashion credentials to attract visitors to their cities and wider. Other cities also following suit having seen the economic impact which London and New York's fashion credentials can bring. Seoul now has two fashion weeks, and riding on the reputation of these, the city now has a vast complex of shopping malls and wholesale retailers which attract more than two million visitors per year, including just about half of all the tourists who come to Seoul.Fashion is essential to tourism; 6 January 2012, by Hannah Bae; http://travel.cnn.com/seoul/shop/tell-me-about-it/hannah-bae-fashion- essential-tourism-405067 Singapore also has a fashion week and the Singapore Tourism Board includes fashion as one of the high-profile component for enhancing the city's destination attractiveness.Singapore Tourism Board: Annual report 12/13; http://www.stb.gov.sg/htm/STBAnnualReport/STB_AR12-13/pdf/stb_ar_2013.pdf Even a city as obscure as Lagos, Nigeria, (in terms of fashion credentials) has recently commissioned the Central University of Applied Sciences to prepare a report titled ‚ÄòThe Emerging Role of Fashion Tourism and The Need for a Development Strategy‚ÄôThe Emerging Role of Fashion Tourism and The Need for a Development Strategy in Lagos Nigeria, Olubukola Bada, Central University of Applied Sciences, June 2013 so that they could assess the advantages fashion could bring to their local and regional economy.  Shopping as a tourism motivator  Shopping has become a motive to travel and is now a major tourist activity. Visitors are increasingly choosing shopping as a way to experience local culture through an engagement with local products and local craftspeople, and some destinations provide special tourist shopping activities for tourists to shop for goods.Conciergeetcetera.com, Fashion Tourism ‚Äì The Ultimate Epicure of Travel, June 26, 2013Culture, shopping, Tourism As a niche market segment within shopping tourism, the economic importance of fashion tourism cannot be under-estimated. The recently launched Bicester designer shopping village, an hours train journey out of London is now the third largest shopping destination in the UK after Harrods and Selfridges, and the Bicester train station has signage in Mandarin and Arabic. Individual fashion brands also play a major part in fashion tourism marketing.

There is a trend within shopping tourism for consumers from emerging markets, notably China and South America, to plan their trips according to where fashion handbags are cheapest. Up to 50% of sales of luxury goods in Western Europe are generated by foreigners and global travel generates as much as 30% of total sales of luxury goods.The rise of accessories tourism; October 13, 2011 by Vanessa Friedman; http://blogs.ft.com/material-world/2011/10/13/the-rise-of-accessories-tourism/ The queues of non-Parisians outside Louis Vuitton clearly mean something, but according to an HSBC report ‚ÄòThe Bling Dynasty‚Äô,China's Bling Shoppers Choose Asia Over Europe; 3 April 2013, by Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani; https://www.cnbc.com/id/100611573 this is less about status (the chic of buying from the point of origin) than economic intelligence (the savings involved).

Bedi set the story in the economic turmoil of the post-partition North India, also experiencing a collapse in human values, fractured social fabric and growing cynicism towards the state. However, beyond that, the story of the film diverges from the original; Bedi took the story to a completely different development and also gives it an optimistic ending, unlike the original, where the protagonist turns into a ghost. The film starred Balraj Sahni, Nirupa Roy, Jayant, Brahm Bhardwaj, Rashid Khan, and Vijayalaxmi. Music was by classical singer Pandit Amar Nath, and songs were sung by Lata Mangeshkar. It was the first film of Cine Co-operative, a production company formed by Bedi along with Balraj Sahni and actress Geeta Bali in 1954, however when the film didn't do well commercially, he went back to writing screenplays for other directors, such as Madhumati (1958) and Anuradha (1960). His next film as a producer came in 1962; Rungoli. The film won the 1956 Filmfare Award for Best Story for Rajinder Singh Bedi. Plot Girdhari (Balraj Sahni) is small-time clerk in a post office, where he handles money orders. He barely manages a living along with his wife, Geeta (Nirupa Roy), two daughters and a son. He is unable to buy a new coat for himself and makes do with a tattered coat. One day after work, he sets out to buy toys for his children, but loses the 100-rupee note in the pocket of coat. Unable to find the money for household essentials, he plans to commit suicide, but misses the train. Upon returning home he confides in his wife. He tries part-time jobs and even petty crime, but never succeeds. Gradually he starts losing his mental balance. One day, he comes home find the pantry full, wife missing, and children playing outside his locked home. Unable to think clearly, he immediately suspects that she has taken up prostitution. He is unaware that his wife has taken part-time jobs. Unable to control his rage, he tries to strangle his wife, and rushes towards an oncoming speeding train. However, he is saved by his coworkers, Sher Khan and Munnilal, and brought home. On the way, he realises that the lost bank note had actually slipped into the lining, from his coat's pocket. Back at home, Geeta gives the 100-rupee note to Sher Khan, to buy the fabric for a new winter coat.

Smallcombe Cemetery is situated on the edge of Bath, Somerset, England, in a valley between Widcombe Hill and Bathwick Hill. The cemetery consists of two distinct parts, the Anglican section known as St Mary's Churchyard and the non-conformist section known as Smallcombe Vale cemetery. They are sometimes known together as Smallcombe Garden cemetery. The two cemeteries have been closed to new burials since 1988 and they are maintained by Bath and North East Somerset Council. The Bath Corporation assumed responsibility for both cemeteries in 1947. In 1977 the caretakers lodge, described as The Lodge, Bathwick Cemetery, BA2 6DD, was sold for ¬£800 without water or drainage.Information from the United Kingdom Land Registry, Title Number: AV23331.  St Mary the Virgin churchyard  Smallcombe Anglican Mortuary Chapel This churchyard is situated at the end of a private road leading from Horseshoe Lane, Bathwick. The Duke of Cleveland released the land at the southern end of Sydney Buildings for the St Mary the Virgin Churchyard which replaced the previous churchyard situated on the corner of Bathwick Street and Henrietta Road which had been closed in 1825. Thomas Fuller (1823‚Äì1898) was employed as the architect with George Mann as the builder of the Anglican Mortuary Chapel. It was Grade II listed 2008. The corner stone of the Chapel was laid on 9 May 1855 and the consecrated ground opened for burials in 1856. The consecration of the land by the Bishop of Bath and Wells took place on 15 Feb 1856 and this was reported in the Bath & Cheltenham Gazette of 20 February 1856. In 1907 the original St Mary the Virgin Churchyard was extended by a further six sections. The Mortuary Chapel was made redundant in 1992 and was sold by the Church authorities at auction in 2007 for ¬£70,000. It has lain derelict since that time. The churchyard contains four Commonwealth war graves of the First World War: *Second Lieutenant Charles Edward Hoare Halls, Wiltshire Regiment (1917) *Sergeant George Collins, North Somerset Yeomanry (1918) *Flight Cadet John Francis Fox, RAF (1918) *Admiral of the Fleet Sir George Astley Callaghan, RN (1920)  Smallcombe Vale Cemetery  The nonconformist Smallcombe Vale Chapel, designed by Alfred S Goodridge The Smallcombe Vale cemetery opened in 1861 or 1862 and was administered by the Bathwick Burial Board. The non-conformist Smallcombe Vale Chapel was designed by Alfred S Goodridge. It was Grade II listed in 2011.  Notable burials and monuments  George Fosbery's grave Frederic Weatherly's grave Smallcombe Cemetery contains the graves of a number of notable people, including: * Frederick Weatherly, composer of Danny Boy and Roses of Picardy amongst many other well-known songs; * the parents of the poet A. E. Housman and their seven children. The Housman memorial was restored by the Housman Society in 2003. * Wallace Gill, architect and the son of the architect John Elkington Gill. * Two Victoria Cross holders: **George Fosbery, Lieutenant, 4th Bengal Regiment, Indian Army, for valiant leadership in recapturing the Crag picket, Umbeyla Expedition, North West Frontier, India, 30 October 1863 **Henry Raby, Commander, Royal Navy, for heroism during the assault on the Redan, Sebastopol, Crimean War 18 June 1855. * Two Commonwealth war graves of the First World War: **Petty Officer 1st Class S.I.

Other servicemen include Malby Edward Crofton, Captain and Adjutant, 2/4th Regiment who fought in the Zulu Wars. The Hancock memorial which was erected around 1863, Rockshute Tomb of 1873, Pocock headstone from 1924 and an unknown memorial from around 1880 have been designated as listed buildings. A full list of burials was prepared by Philip Bendall and is housed in the Bath Record Office. The Sydney Buildings History Group with the Bathwick History Society have extracted names of residents of Sydney Buildings. It has identified approximately 3,000 plots spread over 16 sections: A to K, with I not being allocated, in the St Mary the Virgin cemetery and 5 sections, V to Z, in Smallcombe Vale. Sections V, W and Z being the nonconformist plots in Smallcombe Vale, divided from the adjacent sections by a line of stones.  Maintenance and restoration  Bath and North East Somerset Council maintains the grounds. The maintenance regime is to cut the churchyard fortnightly (weather permitting). All pruning, hedge cutting, etc., is carried out as winter works after the grass cutting season has ended. The council's arboricultural office keeps the trees under a 3 yearly review and all major tree works are carried out by the council's tree specialists. The Bereavement Services department carries out a 5-year rolling programme of memorial testing to ensure that memorials are preserved as well as possible and are safe. Memorials in danger of collapse are laid down. The Friends of St Mary's Churchyards have been working with the city council to support efforts to maintain the grounds to maintain biodiversity and to improve the general environment. The Smallcombe Garden Cemetery Project was launched by the Friends to prepare a bid for Heritage Lottery Funds to assist with the cost of preservation of Smallcombe Cemetery and to establish a longer term public amenity role for the 'closed' cemetery, which is compatible with, and respects, its primary function of being a peaceful sanctuary for the deceased. The ¬£75,000 project was completed in 2017 and included a new footpath which provides a link to National Trust land and the popular Bath Skyline trail.  Flora and fauna  In common with many old cemeteries and graveyards, Smallcombe has a large community of flora and fauna within its environs. The Bath Natural History Society conducted a survey in 2013 and identified a significant number of species.

By 1883 it was the largest manufacturer of woolens in the state, a position it held until it was eclipsed by the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company around 1900. The company was founded by Alfred I. Sawyer and operated in the family until 1899, when it went bankrupt and was acquired by the American Woolen Company. The mill complex was operated by American until it was closed and sold off in 1955. In the mid-1980s the complex was converted to residential use.

When these figures promote respectability politics, this may serve as an attempt to police some of their fellow group members. Proponents of respectability politics may be attempting to portray their personal social values as being continuous and compatible with dominant values. They may prefer not to challenge the mainstream for its failure to accept the marginalized group into the mainstream and that diversity also exists within the group. The concept was first articulated in 1993 by Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham in her book Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880‚Äì1920. In the context of Black American history, respectability politics was practiced as a way of attempting to consciously set aside and undermine cultural and moral practices thought to be disrespected by wider society, especially in the context of the family and good manners. The development of African-American politics of respectability has been traced to writers and activists including W. E. B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington, and has been used as a way of understanding the election and political trajectory of Barack Obama. The former president has also been criticized for his use of respectability politics during his presidency. For example, he brought up issues of Black criminality during his speech following the November 24th grand jury decision regarding the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. One of the most open proponents of respectability politics is former basketball player Charles Barkley. Respectability politics consists of three main facets. The first facet reinforces a hierarchy to contrast a respectable individual against a shameful other. Any behavior that is deemed unworthy of respect within a specific group will consequently be condemned and considered inferior compared to the differing ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù behavior. An example of this is the Madonna-whore dichotomy which categorizes women into these two categories based on the extent to which they express their sexuality, suggesting that women who express it less are superior than their counterparts. The second facet of respectability politics encourages people to defy stereotypes attributed to different aspects of their identity in attempts to present one‚Äôs self as respectable. For Latina women who are often sexualized and stereotyped as promiscuous, this could take the form of presenting one's self in a conservative manner that deviates from the stereotype. Finally, the third facet involves tailoring one‚Äôs behavior to better comply with white, middle- class cultural norms, and consequently reinforce the status quo. For example, a person who chooses to speak standard American English, as opposed to African-American vernacular English, to a non-Black audience would be aligning with white cultural norms. Oftentimes, these three facets are practiced by people from marginalized communities who believe that respectability politics will aid them in achieving social mobility.  Black respectability politics  The term 'politics of respectability' was first used in the context of Black women and their efforts to distance themselves from the stereotypical and disrespected aspects of their communities. Respectability politics continues to influence the behaviour of racially marginalized Black individuals today who gain status and rights by \\"adhering to hegemonic standards of what it means to be respectable\\". Black individuals practicing respectability politics are stereotyped as being most concerned with laziness, intellectual inferiority, violence, and immorality. While respectability politics has been an important way for Black citizens of the United States to integrate into their free lives post-emancipation, today there are many examples of Black individuals arguing that \\"a deliberate concession to mainstream societal values\\" does not promote respect, but is instead a defence mechanism of minority communities. Also, some research studies associate part of the high burden of mental health problems with Black Americans on assimilationist behaviours. Researchers, Hedwig Lee & Margaret Takako Hicken argue that further conversations about respectability politics should always consider the challenges Black Americans negotiate in everyday social spaces and establish how they impact Black American mental health. = Origin = In her 1993 book Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880‚Äì1920, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham coined the term 'the politics of respectability' to describe social and political changes in the Black community during this time. She particularly focused on the revitalization of the Black Baptist Church and how it became a location of self-help for Black individuals. This was particularly true for Black women, who used the church as a location of resistance against racism and dehumanization. These women built schools and provided social welfare services to enhance their respectability and promote their communities. This type of mobilization continued and infiltrated the methodology of teachers in Black communities in the Jim Crow South. Teachers encouraged their students to integrate themselves into white, middle class communities in the hopes of motivating and inspiring students to escape racial injustice. These teachers viewed their profession as a political act, helping young Black students disassociate from negative stereotypes. Black communities were also expected to integrate themselves into being more white in order to gain access to political benefits. In the book Black Power: The Politics of Liberation, Kwame Ture, formerly known as Stokely Carmichael, and Charles V. Hamilton, illustrate how the town of Tuskegee, Alabama is not recognized in politics by white politicians. The population of Tuskegee is 95% Black, yet those numbers do not represent the people in politics. Ture and Hamilton go on to discuss how Black people constantly have to prove themselves to white people. It is a never-ending cycle because once one aspect of being white is achieved, another obstacle is placed in their way. = Health implications of respectability politics = On an individual level, respectability politics can manifest itself in impression management behaviors. Across all socioeconomic levels, many Black people agree that partaking in impression management is necessary in order to navigate everyday life in a racialized society. However, these behaviors, also referred to as vigilant behaviors, can have negative consequences on people. In this specific case, vigilance can be defined as \\"anticipatory and ruminative thoughts and behaviors involved in the preparation for discriminatory treatment and mirror behaviors that align with the presentation of self strategies encouraged by proponents of black respectability politics but likely utilized by many African Americans to engage in racially hierarchical social spaces.\\" For many Black people, vigilant behaviors take the form of altering one's presentation of self (including one's dress, speaking, etc...), \\"avoiding social situations where likelihood of discrimination may be higher,\\" and \\"daily preparation for possible experiences with prejudice and discrimination.\\" In other words, these people anticipate stress often, and thus, act accordingly to try to avoid discrimination-based stress. However, research shows that anticipating stress often can be detrimental to one's health because this activates the body‚Äôs primary stress response system, known as the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Activating the HPA axis is helpful in that it activates the body to better deal with said stress. However, when the anticipatory stress is very frequent, it can cause \\"dysfunction of the stress response system and then poor mental and physical health.\\" = Black Lives Matter = The Black Lives Matter movement is an example of a movement against respectability politics. The movement was motivated by the shooting and death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager. The number of subsequent police killings of unarmed Black men that gained broad national attention motivated a conversation about racial stereotypes and why certain racial stereotypes came to imply Black men are \\"dangerous\\". The Black Lives Matter movement argues that people are deserving of rights regardless of \\"any ostensibly non-respectable behaviour.\\" Instead of acknowledging and shying away from negative Black stereotypes, the Black Lives Matter movement works to expand the concept of what it means to be \\"respectable\\" and argue that negatively stereotyped behaviour should not be met with deadly force. In line with the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement, some celebrities who have typically shied away from conversations about race have begun to engage with the topic. For example, at the beginning of her career, popular television producer and creator Shonda Rhimes aired shows that had colourblind scripts, despite having diverse casts (e.g. Grey's Anatomy). This was consistent with modern respectability politics in what is sometimes argued to be a post-racial era. Today, Rhimes engages in conversations about racial inequality in the media and addresses racially charged topics on her show, pushing against respectability politics and affirming the rights of all people regardless of their 'respectability'. = Rebranding 'ratchet' and anti-respectability politics = One way to challenge respectability politics is to reclaim negative stereotypes associated with minority communities, rather than disassociate from them. This can take place in the form of rebranding words that have been used as insults towards communities. Rebranding of the derogatory term \\"ratchet\\" has been one way Black women specifically have pushed back against respectability politics. Black women who identify as ratchet reclaim the negative stereotypes associated with Black culture, such as hyper-sexuality, and instead embrace individualism. The strategy of reclaiming negative stereotypes has been acknowledged as having potential for Black feminine liberation, but has also been criticized for its limitations contained within the confines of the terms that are being reconceptualized. For example, ratchet is associated with heterosexuality, which confines potential to liberate in the context of being 'ratchet'.  LGBT respectability politics  Respectability politics in the context of the LGBT community is the assimilation of LGBT or otherwise marginalized people based on sexuality and/or transgender status into a hegemonic and heteronormative society. This can be achieved by downplaying stereotypes or behaviors associated with homosexuality (e.g. crossdressing or flamboyant dressing, public displays of same sex affection) or participating in cisgender heterosexual institutions. There are many perspectives on whether engaging in respectability politics is the best way for LGBT people to gain acceptance. One perspective is that assimilation is an important and necessary way for the LGBT community to gain rights, and once they are integrated into society they will have more space to challenge mainstream institutions to make them more inclusive. Another perspective is that assimilation only reinforces cisheteronormative institutions and makes diversity invisible. Some LGBT people, for instance, choose to identify themselves as straight-acting, creating controversy within the community.Jay Clarkson, '\\"Everyday Joe\\" versus \\"pissy, bitchy, queens\\": gay masculinity on StraightActing.com.', The Journal of Men's Studies (2006): . Campaigners for LGBT rights have also struggled with the issue of respectability politics. A distinction has been drawn between an attitude that celebrated and affirmed sexual difference in 1960s gay rights campaigns and contemporary approaches that seek to reduce and underplay sexual differences. Gay people are portrayed as having similar values to the wider cisheteronormative society which is \\"a pride ... premised on a nonconscious agreement with dominant views about what is shameful\\". J. Bryan Lowder, writer for Slate, named Caitlyn Jenner as an advocate of respectability politics in the transgender community. \\"Since the beginning of the civil rights movement for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals,\\" she writes, \\"there have been individuals who attempted to gain straight society's approval by distancing themselves from‚Äîor stepping over the bodies of‚Äîmore 'radical' elements of the community. ... Respectability politics in the trans community, at least on the public stage, is a newer phenomenon, but it appears that Jenner is positioning herself to lead the way.\\" = Marriage equality = An example of respectability politics used by the LGBT community in the United States was the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. Much of the mainstream argument to include the LGBT community in a heteronormative institution like marriage was that the inclusion of LGBT people in marriage would not challenge or change traditional marriage values, like monogamy. In order to benefit from marriage as an institution, the LGBT community argued that their relationships were much akin and perpetuated the same values as heterosexual communities.  Women  In the United States, there are gendered qualities that define respectable behaviour for both men and women. Historically, women's respectability has been defined by certain attributes that, when subscribed to and followed, lead to certain rights and benefits. Some of the most consistent adjectives used to describe women's respectability are \\"neat, simple, quiet, (and) modest\\". Women's respectability politics differ from LGBT and Black respectability politics because in order to be respectable, women must abide by stereotypes of femininity, while LGBT and Black respectability is founded in them not abiding by the stereotypes associated with their own groups. Modern respectability politics for women are also further complicated because of inconsistent societal pressures for women in regards to sexuality. According to Lara Karaian, a professor from Carleton University, women receive inconsistent messages about what is respectable sexual behaviour, which leads to sexual victimization and slut-shaming (most often for young girls). = Fashion = One way in which women can abide by respectability politics is through their clothing. The ways in which women dress is highly indicative of their place and level of respectability within society and the community. Women who dress respectably are more likely to be admitted into social and political institutions. This precedent became most apparent in the Victorian era. = Marriage = According to scholars such as Simone de Beauvoir, getting married is an example of respectability politics for women. While being married gives participants access to a variety of benefits like health care and tax benefits, de Beauvoir argues this also comes with the necessity to abide by bourgeois respectability. This type of respectability is specific to women, and requires that women \\"perform a service in the marriage\\". These services include satisfying men's sexual needs and caring for the household. Today, respectability politics within marriages are challenged but not erased by greater levels of economic and social equality between men and women.  Respectability politics online  Scholars have discussed how young people of low socioeconomic status manage impressions online by adhering to normative notions of respectability. This is done through self-censoring, curating a neutral image, segmenting content by platform, and avoiding content and contacts coded as lower class. These strategies simultaneously enable and limit a participants‚Äô ability to succeed by reinforcing racist and sexist notions of appropriate behavior. = Regulating digital sexualities = In physical spaces, the female body has been a traditional site of respectability where norms are negotiated and traditional gender roles are upheld. Due to the intersection of racial and gender identities, women of color are further subject to critique and objectification ‚Äì a topic with a long history of gendered and racialized respectability politics that center on what women wear, how they engage sexually, and how they behave in publicFord, T. (2015). SNCCs soul sisters: Respectability and the style politics of the Civil Rights Movement. In Thadious M. Davis, Mary Kelley (Eds.), Liberated threads: Black women, style, and the global politics of soul (pp. 67‚Äì94). Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press.. In our digital society, social media provides another cultural space where these identities have to be negotiated. When adhering to respectability norms online, users consider sexual expression and whether or not they want to disclose certain social and sexual practices. In terms of sexuality, respectability politics online values sexual discretion and desexualized self-presentation. The performance of traditional gender roles and sexist social norms define and contribute to the notion of sexuality being viewed as unrespectable. Substantially affecting women, sexuality and respectability online concentrate on the ‚Äúnegative ramifications of explicit female sexuality.‚Äù User content and language that projects sexually explicit material and sexualization is frowned upon, enticing users to self-censor their online identities and limit participation on social media to avoid negative judgement. Instances where sexaultiy is deemed unacceptable is met with ridicule and public shaming including sexual shaming and othering. In the curation of an online sexuality, users must consider if their content falls inside or outside of the acceptable norms before making a post. If a post is viewed as too explicit or lewd, it is likely that that person will be subject to othering through a judgmental gaze. Sexually explicit material or nude photos serve as an example of content that online participants are more likely to view through the judgmental gaze. If a user‚Äôs post is too explicit, it is likely that that individual will be perceived as an outsider, something that would not only impact their sense of identity in this space but also their ability to succeed. In digital spaces, all users are subject to surveillance. Whether this gaze is coming from institutions, government officials, OR other participants online, this gaze can directly impact an individual‚Äôs ability to be perceived as a successful or educated individual. Therefore, users create these digital profiles with respectability politics in mind to avoid being depicted as an outcast. For users who wish to improve their social positioning with upward mobility, these pressures are often top-of-mind, even though digital respectability politics often reproduce racial and gendered hierarchies that are ultimately harmful for society.

Built in 1884, it is unusual for the period for its wood-frame construction, and for its financing, executed by local businessmen to attract shoe manufacturers to the city. The mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The building has been converted into apartments. Description and history The Queensbury Mill is located on the west side of downtown Somersworth, extending along the south side of Winter Street between its junctions with Market and Linden Streets. It is a wood frame structure, in length, with a gabled roof, and a full-height brick basement level, providing a full four stories of space. A brick chimney rises near the center of its length, near a projecting stair house which rises above the main roof line. The mill was built in 1884 and enlarged in 1892, and was owned by a consortium of local business leaders. They sought to diversify the city's economy by attracting shoe manufacturers, who were dealing with a period of labor unrest in the major shoe-producing centers of Massachusetts. Built by local craftsmen, the mill is unusual for its wood-frame construction, which was not the norm for mill buildings of the 1880s, and it lacks other features typically added to these buildings to limit the spread of fire. The building housed a shoe manufacturing operation until 1902, when it was taken over by the Queensbury Mills of Worcester, Massachusetts and converted to yarn production. The initiative to attract shoe manufacturing was broadly successful, however: the Somersworth Shoe Company operated in buildings formerly of the Great Falls Manufacturing Company until 1984.

He was one of the most important antiquarian booksellers in America and Britain in the first half of the twentieth century. He was president of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association in 1930. Early life He was born Gabriel Weiss in Balassa-Gyarmath, Hungary; his father was Moritz Weiss and he was one of six children. Gabriel changed his surname to Wells after immigrating to the United States in 1894, settling in Boston. He tutored in psychology and German language under William James, professor of psychology at Harvard, for three years, and also lectured on philosophy at conferences in New York and Massachusetts around the turn of the century. He was fluent in eight languages. Career Wells established his bookselling business in New York City. His first transaction set the stage for his lifetime modus operandi: He bought up copies of the ten-volume subscription edition of John L. Stoddard's Lectures at book auctions, rebound them, and sold them to regular book dealers who would not otherwise have access to subscription sets. He did the same with limited editions. Like his competitor, Dr. Rosenbach, Wells was active in the inter-war years in London and Europe buying up expensive books that could be sold to wealthy clients in the United States. In 1928, Wells purchased the business of the late Henry Sotheran in London, making him a force in bookselling on both sides of the Atlantic. Henry Sotheran have been antiquarian booksellers in London since 1760, and are independently owned today. Wells was involved in a long-running rivalry with Rosenbach, who tended to get the limelight for buying the most expensive item at an auction which he then sold on direct to the public. Wells spent more overall, but invested in less high-profile books that he often passed on through the trade. Unlike most booksellers, he never published a catalog of his offerings. Items handled In 1912, Wells bought at auction a fabulous jewelled edition of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam for ¬£405. Known as \\"The Great Omar\\", it had been estimated at ¬£1000. The book itself was undistinguished but John Harrison Stonehouse of Sotheran dealers had commissioned Sangorski to provide the most luxurious binding possible. The work took nearly two years to finish and included 1,050 jewels. It was described by James Sprague as \\"relatively the most expensive book binding ever done in the 20th century.\\" Wells gave it to a passenger on the R.M.S. Titanic to transport to the United States, and the book was lost when the ship sank. In 1922 Wells paid $200,000 for the right to print a limited run (1,024 copies) of the definitive edition of Mark Twain's writings. The edition includes the authenticated autographs of the author and of Albert Bigelow Paine on the flyleafs. The Gabriel Wells Definitive Edition, in 35 volumes, was published in 1922-1923. Another notable work that Wells handled was the original manuscript for Richard Brinsley Sheridan The School for Scandal. It was eventually sold to the Philadelphia journalist and collector Barton Currie, before 1931, but for less than the $75,000 reported in the press at the time. One of the most significant transactions of Wells' career was his purchase of a Gutenberg Bible from Joseph Sabin, who had bought it at auction in 1920. The two-volume work (one of 41 in existence) was not in perfect condition - it was missing 50 of its 643 leaves and some of those that remained had their illuminations cut out. Wells opted to break up the Bible and sell the leaves individually, thus reaching a wider market. The leaves in perfect or good condition sold for an average of $150 each (approximately $1,500 today), while the ruined leaves were priced around $100. Each leaf was elegantly slip-cased in a \\"black or dark blue morocco goatskin portfolio folder\\" with the words \\"A Leaf of the Gutenberg Bible (1450-1455)\\" embossed on the cover in gilt lettering. Wells commissioned A. Edward Newton to write a five-page essay, \\"A Noble Fragment, Being a Leaf of the Gutenberg Bible (1450-1455)\\", which was included with each sale. Wells' decision to sell the leaves individually allowed major institutions and universities to purchase pages that they were missing from their own editions of the Gutenberg Bible. Wells gifted the New York Public Library with all but one of the leaves that it was missing from its collection. In 1939, Wells was embroiled in legal action after John Hayward discovered that Lord Victor Rothschild's first edition of Henry Fielding's Tom Jones was not authentic. Some of the pages were from another edition. Rothschild had paid ¬£3,500 for the book including another work. The matter was settled out of court after a whole chain of dealers were shown not to have noticed the error, including Dr. Rosenbach. In addition to book dealing, Wells authored many pamphlets on the social and economic issues of his day. Death Wells never married. In his will, he left his estate to his siblings and their children, as well as to the Library of Congress, New York Public Library, Harvard, Rutgers University, and his native Hungarian town.

Dancers have to perform in leading roles, sometimes for many years, before they can be accorded the rank by the director of the Paris Opera, after nomination by the head of the ballet (directeur de la danse), in recognition of outstanding excellence and merit.La Danse, film by Frederick Wiseman, 2009, 159 min. There is no specific rule regarding the nomination. √âtoiles are usually chosen from among the premiers danseurs (the highest rank achievable through examinations), but exceptionally some dancers, such as Manuel Legris or Laurent Hilaire, have been promoted directly from the lower rank of sujet. The nominations were initially made in an administrative setting, then later backstage with the curtain closed. They now take place at the end of a performance, with the curtain open.

Traditional mino are an article of outerwear covering the entire body, although shorter ones resembling grass skirts were also historically used to cover the lower body alone. Similar straw capes were also used in China, Vietnam and Korea. Overview Rice straw has water repellent properties. Raindrops striking a mat of straw will tend to flow along the fibers of the mat, rather than penetrate underneath it. For this reason, early Japanese rain gear was often made of straw, which has the added benefits of being cheap to acquire, easy to weave and fasten, and light in weight. It is, however, bulky in size, and highly flammable. In earlier eras, straw clothing had an additional advantage: it afforded a significant degree of camouflage in certain terrain, including forests and wetlands, similar to modern ghillie suits. As synthetic fibers and later plastics were introduced to Japan, mino lost much of their practicality and fell out of use. Today, however, they are still worn as costumes in various traditional folk traditions and festivals, such as the new year celebrations of the Oga Peninsula, where men dress as ogre-like namahage wearing masks and mino.  Popular culture  Sarumino (ÁåøËìë Monkey's Raincoat) is a 1691 anthology of Bash≈ç-school poetry. It is widely considered to be one of the most important compilations of classical Japanese verse. The bagworm Pok√©mon, Burmy, is called Minomucchi („Éü„Éé„É†„ÉÉ„ÉÅ) in Japanese, which is a portmanteau of Minomushi („Éü„Éé„É†„Ç∑), the Japanese word for bagworm, and the Japanese suffix ‚Äîcchi, which denotes a cute nickname. Minomushi itself is a portmanteau of mino and mushi, meaning ‚Äúbug‚Äù. This means that Burmy's Japanese name roughly translates to mean ‚Äúa cutie in a straw coat.‚Äù Also, the Ice-type Pok√©mon Snorunt is based on a yukinko, a japanese folklore spirit from the snow, wearing a mino.

A child prodigy of law, Mayer graduated from Yale Law School before he could even legally practice the profession in his hometown of Chicago, Illinois. After several years organizing the Chicago Law Library, Mayer practiced with Adolf Kraus. Mayer became one of the most infamous lawyers in Chicago by defending large corporations against anti-trust litigation. Furthermore, he successfully defended the Iroqouis Theater and its manager in the aftermath of the Iroquois Theatre fire. At the time of his death, he was considered one of the richest lawyers in the United States. He is the namesake of Levy Mayer Hall at Northwestern University and his law firm is today known as Mayer Brown. Biography Levy Mayer was born in Richmond, Virginia, on October 23, 1858, the sixth of thirteen children The Life and Times of Florence Kelley. https://florencekelley.northwestern.edu/historical/mayer/ Retrieved Oct. 6, 2020.. His parents had immigrated from Bavaria three years earlier and moved to Chicago, Illinois when Mayer was young. Mayer attended public schools, including Chicago High School, where he graduated in 1874. He studied at Yale College, then the Yale Law School, graduating in 1876. When he returned to Chicago, he was hired as assistant librarian of the Law Institute in the Rookery Building, as he could not legally practice law until aged 21. He oversaw improvements at the library and, by the time he left, the collection exceeded 17,000 books. He edited two collections of manuscripts from David Rorer, one on judicial & execution sales and the other on interstate or private international law. Mayer also organized the first printed catalog at the library. The Supreme Court of Illinois admitted Mayer to the bar upon reaching age 21; he then left the library to practice with Kraus & Brackett. When Brackett retired soon afterward, Adolf Kraus admitted Mayer as junior partner of Kraus & Mayer. The firm was later known as Kraus Mayer & Stein and Moran Kraus Mayer & Stein. When Stein and Moran retired, the firm became Moran Mayer & Meyer. The firm focused on constitutional, corporation, and municipal law. He frequently defended corporations facing anti-trust suits, though he was often attacked in the press for it. He received legal fees from businesses he defended from $500,000 to $1 million. Mayer served as the legal adviser to the Chicago City Treasurer, occasionally also serving as adviser to the Cook County Treasurer. At the time of his death, he was the senior partner of Mayer, Meyer, Austrian & Platt and had offices in Chicago and New York City. =Major cases= Mayer co-founded the Illinois Manufacturers' Association and served as its general counsel. In 1895, he defended the group in the Supreme Court of Illinois in Ritchie v. People, which outlawed the eight-hour workday limit for women. Likewise, he co-founded the Distiller's Securities Corporation. Mayer oversaw the 1899 acquisition of Siemens & Halske Electric Company of America by the Electric Vehicle Company. In 1903, Mayer defended the Iroquois Theatre following the Iroquois Theatre fire. Mayer was able to convince a judge to move the case to Peoria, Illinois and successfully had the charges against theater manager Will Davis dismissed. In 1905, charges against the theater were thrown out. When Illinois courts reopened the case against Davis, he had the venue moved to Danville, Illinois. There, he convinced the judge that the city ordinances that targeted Davis were illegal. Davis was found not guilty. Mayer led the defense of the \\"Beef Trust\\" in Swift and Company v. United States in the Supreme Court of the United States. Mayer defended the Employers' Association of Chicago against the United Brotherhood of Teamsters in the 1905 Chicago Teamsters' strike. In 1908, he defended the Mattoon City Railway Streetcar Company after an accident resulted in eighteen deaths. He led a fundraiser at the Auditorium Theater in 1916 to support Jews impoverished by World War I. He defended Charles Comiskey in 1919 during the Black Sox Scandal. Late in his life he worked with distillers to fight the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the effort was unsuccessful, as the Supreme Court dismissed the case in 1920. He oversaw the sale of the Detroit Times to Arthur Brisbane on behalf of William Randolph Hearst in 1921. =Personal life= Mayer married Rachel Meyer in 1886; they had two daughters: Hortense and Madeline. Mayer was not active in any religious body or social club, though he did hold a membership in the Union League Club of Chicago, the Germania Club, and the Iroquois Club. He lived on Prairie Avenue in Chicago and had a second home in Boston, Massachusetts, where his children were schooled. In his free time, Mayer collected rare books and wines. He was never active in politics, though he served as a delegate to the 1920 Illinois Constitutional convention. Mayer died in the Blackstone Hotel on August 14, 1922. At the time of his death, his estate was estimated at $25 million. He was buried in Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago. After his death, Rachel donated a large sum of money to the Northwestern University School of Law; the university dedicated Levy Mayer hall in his honor in 1926. Edgar Lee Masters wrote a biography of Mayer in 1927. Cases argued in Supreme Court of the United States Mayer argued the following cases in the nation's highest court: *Swan Land Cattle Co. v.

She is also frequently called upon as Yaochi Jinmi (Áë§Ê±†ÈáëÊØç \\"Golden Mother of the Nacre Lake\\"). With this title, Xiwangmu is the central figure of many Chinese salvationist religions (the \\"Maternist\\" ones), representing the absolute principle of reality, or the creative origin of all things. One of her symbols is the Big Dipper. As early as the Han dynasty, 3 year BCE, there were millenarian movements worshipping Xiwangmu. Description in sectarian scriptures Wusheng Laomu is described in many ways in the scriptures of some Chinese folk religious sects. For instance, an excerpt from the \\"Precious Scripture of the Dragon-Flower\\", pertaining to the Dragon Flower sect, says: From another section of the Dragon Flower, \\"It is required that all male and female members gather with neither difference nor discrimination\\". Equality of men and women is a characteristic element of the Chinese sectarian tradition, for both males and females are equally children of the Eternal Mother, and both of them are the same in the \\"Former Heaven\\", the original state of birth from the goddess. The aim of every follower of the Eternal Venerable Mother is to return to her. For example, an excerpt of the \\"Precious Scroll Explaining the Great Vehicle\\" says: In the sect tradition, for example as explained in the \\"Precious Repentance of Blood Lake\\" of Hongyangism (ÂºòÈò≥Êïé), the condition of suffering is inherent to the human being in the world, necessary to creation itself. The material world is likened to a \\"Blood Lake\\", filthy and dirty waters that necessarily flow out of women's bodies when a child is born.

Rogell from a screenplay written by Lew Lipton and Ralph Murphy. The film stars Eddie Quillan, James Gleason, Marian Nixon, Lew Cody, and Paul Hurst, which centers around the travails and romances of jockey Buddy Doyle, known as the \\"Whoop-te-doo Kid\\" for his trademark yell during races. Produced by the newly formed RKO Path√© Pictures, this was the first film Charles R. Rogers would produce for the studio, after he replaced William LeBaron as head of production. The film was released on July 10, 1931, through RKO Radio Pictures. Plot Bud Doyle is a jockey who has discovered the secret to get his favorite mount, Six-Shooter, to boost his performance. If he simply chants the phrase, \\"Whoop-te-doo\\", the horse responds with a burst of speed. There is a special bond between the jockey and his mount, but there is increasing tension between Doyle and the horse's owner, Pop Blake (who also raised Doyle), over Doyle's relationship with local singer Babe Ellis. Blake sees Ellis as a distraction prior to the upcoming big race, the Camden Stakes. The owner of the club where Babe sings, Wally Weber, has his eyes on his horse winning the Camden Stakes. When the issues between Pop and Doyle come to a head, Pop tells Doyle that he has to choose: either he stops seeing Babe, or he'll be replaced as Six-Shooter's jockey in the big race. Angry and frustrated, Doyle quits. Weber approaches him to become the jockey for Rose Dawn, Weber's horse, and Doyle agrees, with the precondition that he not ride Royal Dawn in the Camden Stakes, for he wants Six-Shooter to still win the race. Weber accedes to that one precondition, however, on the day of the race, he makes it clear that Doyle is under contract, and that he will ride Rose Dawn in the race. Upset, Doyle has no choice but to ride Rose Dawn. However, during the race, he manages to chant his signature \\"Whoop-te-doo\\" to Six- Shooter, causing his old mount to win the race. Furious that his horse lost, Weber goes to the judges, who rule that Doyle threw the race, pulling back on Rose Dawn, to allow Six-Shooter to win, and suspend Doyle from horse-racing. Devastated, Doyle wanders from town to town, riding in small local races, until his identity is uncovered, and he is forced to move on. Soon, he is out of racing all together, and forced to taking one odd-job after another. Eventually, he ends up south of the border, in Tijuana, Mexico, working as a waiter. Doyle's friend, Sleepy Jones, hears of Doyle's plight. Jones gets the racing commission to lift the ban, by proving Doyle's innocence. He then, accompanied by Babe, gets a group to buy Six-Shooter from Pop, and they take the horse down to Tijuana, where there is another big race in the near future, the Tijuana Handicap. Doyle is reluctant to ride at first, however, he is eventually cajoled into it by Sleepy and Babe, and of course, his bond with Six-Shooter is there. He rides the horse to victory, re-establishing his credentials as a rider. The film ends by jumping a few years into the future, which shows Doyle and Babe happily married, with a child of their own.

While he gave no indication of what he thought about the quality of the film, he enjoyed the performances of James Gleason and Lew Cody, and he called Quillan's performance as Doyle \\"original\\".

He was extremely hot-tempered and was involved in several personal and family disputes with local Whig leaders. Early life Bulkeley was the eldest son of Richard Bulkeley, 3rd Viscount Bulkeley and his wife Mary Egerton, daughter of Sir Philip Egerton of Oulton, Cheshire. He was admitted at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1698 and was awarded MA in 1700. He married Bridget Bertie, daughter of James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon, in 1703 He succeeded as Viscount Bulkeley on his father's death in 1704. Career Bulkeley held office as Constable of Beaumaris Castle from 1702 to 1716. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Anglesey, following his father's death at a by-election on 30 November 1704 and was returned at the 1705 English general election. He voted on against the Court candidate for Speaker on 25 October 1705. In 1706 he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Anglesey and held the post until 1715. He was known for arrogance and violent tempers, and by 1708 he and his family were involved in various disputes with the local Whig leaders. A leading Whig, Owen Hughes, had the lease of a ferry under Bulkeley's control and on renewal in 1706, Bulkeley, with the support of the Treasury, awarded it to rival operators. Hughes retaliated by complaining that Bulkeley neglected the maintenance of Beaumaris Castle, for which he received a mild reprimand from the Treasury. Bulkeley had a further quarrel with Serjeant John Hooke, a long-standing enemy, concerning the council, which Bulkeley controlled. There was a contest for Anglesey at the 1708 British general election but Bulkeley defeated his Whig opponent Owen Meyrick. The bitter conflict between Bulkeley and the Whigs continued through the Parliament. Bulkeley was an inactive member but did vote against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. At the 1710 British general election Bulkeley was returned unopposed as MP for Anglesey. Under the Harley administration, he was listed as one of the ‚Äòworthy patriots‚Äô who exposed the mismanagements of the previous ministry, and as one of the ‚ÄòTory patriots‚Äô who opposed the continuance of the war. He was also a member of the October Club. He voted for the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713, and was subsequently rewarded with the office of constable of Caernarvon Castle. By this time he was suspected of being a Jacobite and various of his papers in around 1713 and 1714 attested to Jacobite sympathies. He was returned again as MP for Anglesey at the 1713 British general election, but lost his seat at the 1715 British general election. He lost all his public offices with two years of the Hanoverian succession. Bulkeley was in receipt of Jacobite correspondence at the time of the 1715 rebellion and subsequently his servants were informed against for drinking the Pretender's health. In 1721, he and his friend Watkin Williams-Wynn burnt pictures of the King and his family. With the assistance of Williams-Wynn, he was returned again as MP for Anglesey at the 1722 British general election. Later life and legacy Bulkeley died at Bath, on 4 June 1724. He and his wife had eight children: *Richard (1707‚Äì1738), who succeeded as fifth viscount, married Jane, daughter of Lewis Owen of Peniarth, Merionethshire, without issue *James (1717‚Äì1752), who succeeded as sixth viscount, married Emma, daughter of Thomas Rowlands of Caerau, Anglesey, and Nant, Caernarfonshire, with issue *Bridget, died unmarried *Eleanor, married George Harvey of Teddington, Oxford *Anne, married William Bertie, brother of Willoughby, 3rd Earl of Abingdon and grandson of James, 1st Earl of Abingdon *Elizabeth, married William Price of Bulace *Lumley *Sarah References Category:1682 births Category:1724 deaths Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland Richard Category:Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:English MPs 1702‚Äì1705 Category:English MPs 1705‚Äì1707 Category:Members of the Parliament of England (pre-1707) for constituencies in Wales Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Welsh constituencies Category:British MPs 1707‚Äì1708 Category:British MPs 1708‚Äì1710 Category:British MPs 1710‚Äì1713 Category:British MPs 1713‚Äì1715 Category:British MPs 1722‚Äì1727 ","title":"Richard Bulkeley, 4th Viscount Bulkeley"},{"id":"43655961","text":"Papanasam () is a 2015 Indian Tamil-language drama thriller film directed by Jeethu Joseph, a shot-for-shot remake of his 2013 Malayalam film Drishyam.

The film tells the story of Suyambu, a middle-class cable TV operator, and his family. They come under suspicion when Varun, the son of the Inspector-general of police (IG), goes missing soon after sexually harassing Suyambu's elder daughter. The rest of the film reveals how Varun disappeared and what Suyambu does to keep his family from going to prison. The production work of Papanasam was undertaken by Suresh Balaje and George Pious. Music for the film was composed by Ghibran. The cinematography was led by Sujith Vasudev and the editing by Ayoob Khan. Principal photography commenced on 25 August 2014 and lasted three months.  Plot  Suyambulingam (Kamal Haasan) is an orphan who had dropped out of school after his 5th grade. Now he is a businessman running a cable TV service in Papanasam, a small town in the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. He is married to Rani (Gautami) and they have two daughters, Selvi (Niveda Thomas) and Pulimeena aka Meena (Esther Anil). His only interest apart from his family is watching films. He spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office. During a nature camp, Selvi is photographed in the bathroom by a hidden cell phone. The culprit, Varun (Roshan Basheer), is the son of Inspector General Geetha Prabhakar (Asha Sarath). Varun is accidentally killed by Rani and Selvi when he comes to blackmail them. They hide his body in a compost pit, which is witnessed by Meena. Rani tells Suyambulingam about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the law. He removes Varun's broken cell phone, places the SIM card on another mobile phone which he throws onto a lorry and disposes of Varun's yellow Maruti Zen car, which is seen by Constable Perumal (Kalabhavan Mani), who has a grudge against Suyambulingam. Suyambulingam takes his family out on a trip to Tenkasi to pray in a temple, watch a movie, stay in a hotel and eat at a restaurant. Geetha starts an investigation into her missing son. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Suyambulingam and his family for questioning. Suyambulingam, who had predicted that this would happen, had already taught his family how to change their alibi at the time of murder. When questioned individually, they give the same replies. Suyambulingam also presents the bill of the restaurant, the hotel bill, the movie ticket and the bus tickets as proof of their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Suyambulingam's alibi. However, Geetha realises later that Suyambulingam had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later. Meanwhile, Suyambulingam tells his brother-in-law, Thangaraj (Abhishek Vinod) that if they are ever taken away by the police, he has to call the media and report their unlawful arrests. Geetha arrests Suyambulingam and his family and Perumal uses brute force to beat the truth out of them. Eventually, Meena gives in and reveals the place where the body is buried. After digging the compost pit, they find the carcass of a wild boar, indicating that Suyambulingam had moved the body. Meena reports to the media and complains against Perumal. The constable is suspended and Geetha resigns from her post. Later, Geetha and her husband Prabhakar (Anant Mahadevan) meet Suyambulingam to ask forgiveness for their rude and violent behaviour. Prabhakar asks Suyambulingam if he can tell them about their son. Suyambulingam then reveals indirectly that his family has committed a crime. Now in bail, Suyambulingam signs a register at the newly constructed local police station. As he leaves, a flashback shows him leaving the incomplete police station with a shovel in hand, indicating that he has hidden Varun's body in the foundations of the police station itself.
