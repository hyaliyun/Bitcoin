Early life She was born on 19 July 1883 in Newport, Rhode Island to some of the most prominent and wealthy American families. She was the daughter of the American financier Ogden Mills and Ruth (n√©e Livingston) Mills (1855‚Äì1920). She was a twin to Gladys Mills (who married Henry Carnegie Phipps) and sister of Ogden Livingston Mills, the United States Secretary of the Treasury who married Margaret Styuvesant Rutherfurd (daughter of Anne Harriman and Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, Jr.) Her maternal grandparents were Maturin Livingston Jr. and Ruth (n√©e Baylies) Livingston a descendant of Thomas Baylies. Her aunt, Elizabeth Livingston Cavendish-Bentinck, was married to William George Cavendish-Bentinck, a Member of Parliament for Penryn and Falmouth and descendant of the Dukes of Portland. Her paternal grandparents were Jane Templeton Cunningham and Darius Ogden Mills, a highly successful banker and investor worth over $36 million at his death. Her aunt, Elisabeth Mills, was married to Whitelaw Reid, the U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain. Through her aunt, she was the first cousin of Jean Templeton Reid, who married Sir John Hubert Ward, son of the Earl of Dudley. Thoroughbred racing Beatrice Mills was raised around horses at her family's Livingston Mansion in Staatsburg, New York. Her father owned Thoroughbred racehorses in the United States and in France in partnership with Edward, Earl of Derby. Beatrice's sister Gladys and her brother Ogden would establish Wheatley Stable that would become one of the preeminent Thoroughbred racing and breeding operations in the United States. Beatrice's husband, Bernard, was Master of the Horse whose duties for King George V included overseer of the Royal Stables and Stud. On January 29, 1929, Beatrice's father died. As part of her inheritance she received his stable of Thoroughbreds in France. That year, she led all owners in purses earned.

Gladys and Ogden bred Bold Ruler to the Champion racing mare, Misty Morn. The result of the mating was Bold Lad, a colt born in 1962 that earned American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt honors. Bold Ruler sired a second colt in 1964 by a different mare that was given the same Bold Lad name. Bold Lad II was bred by Lady Granard and raced in England and Ireland where it too won Champion Two- Year-Old Colt honors.Bold Lad II profile, nytimes.com; accessed 26 March 2016.

The bank did well in West Wales, but did encounter a run against its assets in 1866, the year of the Overend, Gurney and Company failure in London. Around a hundred depositors claimed that they wanted their money back to erect water mills, while others said they wanted to build new houses and other buildings. However, bank officials had sufficient resources to meet all calls for this fictional building boom, and all cheques were paid promptly. Depositors were then invited to re-deposit money with the bank once their fears were over. The run on the bank lasted seven days. Afterwards, nearly every depositor reopened an account at the bank. Sale to Lloyds Bank In 1890, Brecon Old Bank was sold to Lloyds Bank Ltd., after a successful period of trading. Around 1876, the partners in the bank were John Evans, William de Winton, Henry Jones Evans, T. J. Evans, E. B. Evans and W. S. de Winton. W. S.

He worked as a librarian in the industrial town of Jesenice and in the Lower Carniolan village of Krvava Peƒç. In the late 1950s, he started collaborating with the so-called Critical Generation, a group of young Slovene intellectuals that challenged the rigid cultural policies of the Titoist regime. In the 1960s, he returned to Ljubljana, where he lived as a freelance writer and later as a journalist. He frequently interchanged years in isolation and years of public activity. In the early 1990s, after downfall of the Communist regime, he became involved in politics.

He also experimented with surrealism and expressionism. He is best known for his literary depictions of lower urban classes, and individuals living at the edges of society. His novels are frequently set in amidst urban poverty. His most famous novel, 'The Death of Father Vincent' (Oƒçeta Vincenca smrt), in which he described his childhood experiences of war and exile, is considered as one of the best literary descriptions of World War Two in Slovenian literature.

It was previously an incorporated municipality between 1909 and 1944, Grouard is located north of Highway 2, approximately northeast of Grande Prairie. It is the administrative office of the Kapawe'no First Nations.  History  Grouard, named after Bishop √âmile Grouard, was originally incorporated as a village on September 27, 1909 and then as a town in December, 1912. In 1913, the community had a population of more than 1,000, but was largely abandoned once the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway (EDBCR) was built south of Grouard. Many of the residents and businesses moved to High Prairie, a community on the railway line. Grouard reverted from town status to village status on June 7, 1940, and then dissolved from village status on January 15, 1944 to become part of Improvement District No. 764.  Demographics  As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Grouard Mission recorded a population of 255 living in 85 of its 110 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 303. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

It is also known as Firebug Squad and Three Alarm Fire. Plot Joe Martin is a fire fighter in Los Angeles who is assigned by his department chief to the Arson Detail. His first assignment is to investigate a suspicious fur store fire that seems to be set by the store owner himself, Thomas Peyson. The reason why Joe Martin gets the assignment is because his predecessor in the Arson Detail was killed when inspecting the very same fire site. The predecessor's file with his findings wasn't found on his body and hasn't been recovered. This is just one of many equally suspicious fires in the last few years, where the insurance claims following the fires has been filed by the same agent, Frederick P. Fender. There is suspicion that Fender is somehow involved in the disappearance of all the destroyed stores' goods as well. Joe begins with Peyson, the store owner, and visits his apartment that was also raged by fire not long ago. He meets the babysitter, Jane, a pretty young teacher, and they get along so well that Joe drives her home and ask her out on a date the next evening. It turns out Peyson and Fender is in cahoots together, since the first thing Peyson does after Joe leaves, is phone his accomplice. They also meet up the day after, just when Joe comes to see Fender as the next logical step in his investigation. Joe never sees Peyson, as he sneaks out through a back door. Joe gets very little information of use from Fender, but his visit makes Fender put one of his men, Pete, on tailing Joe to see if he finds out something. Pete starts following Joe around everywhere he goes, even when he visits Jane. Soon Joe realizes that he is followed and when he knowingly enters an illegal gambling place Pete finally makes contact, offering Joe a chance of making a little extra money. Joe decides to play along and go \\"undercover\\". When visiting an illegal bookie, Joe starts to fight a policeman and the next day a picture showing him hitting a police officer is on the tabloids. He gets fired for this highly unfitting behavior, and Pete makes contact again, wanting to use the ex-fireman in the insurance fraud racket. Joe and Jane both meets Fender at a party held at Pete's, and Fender is smitten with the young teacher. Fender's secretary Betty sees this, and feels her own agenda is threatened. Joe is hired to do some work for Fender, and the following day he is to drive a car for Pete when he is doing a \\"job\\", setting fire to another store. Joe's job is to block the way for the fire trucks coming to put the fire out. Pete also jams the water sprinklers inside the store. Joe shares the plan with an undercover policeman, Murph, and after the fire is set, the cop steps in and single-handedly extinguishes the fire before it grows out of control. All the store goods are already removed from the store by Pete. But Pete returns to the store to see that the fire is destroying the store completely, and he finds Murph at the scene. Pete shoots Murph, but more police arrive to the store, and a car chase ensues, where Jie and Pete ultimately manage to shake the police. Fender realizes the police was warned and suspects his secretary Betty, who has been behaving strangely. Fender orders her towatch Pete by dating him, and so they go on a double date with Jie and Jane that night, at the Gaucho Club. Joe tells Jane about his undercover assignment on the way to the club. WhenBetty gets drunk she accidentally discloses the address where the furs are stored and after the dinner, Joe and Jane go there. Joe is unaware that Betty was ordered by Fender to slip the address to trap Joe. Joe drives the drunk Pete home and manages to find the file from the fireman investigator in Pete's apartment. He takes Jane with him and return to the warehouse where the furs are, alerting the police on the way. Meanwhile, Pete wakes up again and discovers what has happened. When Joe and the police arrive at the warehouse there are no furs in it. The police look at the file Joe brought and they find evidence implicating Pete as involved in setting the fire. The police leave to arrest Pete, but Pete arrives to the warehouse with a gun and points it towards Jane. Fender is alerted of the situation by a night watchman and tries to get there as fast as he can, driving in his car with Betty by his side. Joe manages to take the gun from Pete, but Pete gets the gun from the night watchman and pursues Joe and Jane as they try to escape. Pete sets fire to the warehouse, trying to trap Joe and Jane inside. Fire trucks get the alarm and comes to the warehouse, and Fender crashes his car on the way, driving too fast. With the help of the firemen, Joe catches Pete and overpowers him, and the rest of the villains are caught. After the big intermezzo at the warehouse, Joe and Jane continue dating each other.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/67663/Arson-Inc-/  Cast  *Robert Lowery as Joe Martin *Anne Gwynne as Jane Jennings *Edward Brophy as Pete Purdy *Marcia Mae Jones as Betty ‚Äì Fender's Secretary *Douglas Fowley as Frederick P.

Her younger brother William Herbert is now Earl of Pembroke. Latter life and career Herbert's parents did not fight her eccentric lifestyle. On leaving school, she went to New York, where she lived in a Lower East Side house. She later commented \\"It was straight from A-levels to crack dens, junkies, shootings. I saw lots of very ugly things which made me decide I didn‚Äôt want to do them myself.\\" On her return to England, Herbert met a performance art group, Mutoid Waste Company, and one of them became her boyfriend. She learnt acrobatic skills from the Mutoids and toured Europe with them. Other friends at that time included the pop group Sigue Sigue Sputnik and the singer Lemmy, of Mot√∂rhead. She became a stuntwoman, getting her first job in Xena: Warrior Princess, and said in an interview \\"I whiplashed my spine falling out of a tree, but it was brilliant fun jumping through explosions and coming out of the sea in leather loincloths\\". She then joined 'Generating Company', also known as 'Genco', a circus theatre group, appearing with them around Europe. In 2002, she performed at the Privilege night-club on the island of Ibiza, better known for its sex shows. In 2003, The Sunday Times reported on her work as a trapeze artist and acrobat, calling her \\"one of Britain‚Äôs leading exponents... Nobody can question her hard work and bravery\\" and noting that she was at the cutting edge of modern circus. She then had spiky pink hair, with a black badger streak, and a chin stud. In 2004, she was a trapeze artist at 'Time', a club in Naas, County Kildare, Ireland, where she was reported to be the star attraction. After spending a year touring New Zealand as lead aerialist in the Weber Bros Circus, in 2005 Herbert married Robin Vickers, the next year gave birth to a daughter, Vanessa Esvedra Rose Vickers, and became a teacher of circus arts at the Performing Arts School of New Zealand, Auckland.

It was founded in 2002 by a group of spine surgeons and geneticists, and was closed in March 2013. The company's mission was to deliver diagnostics that improve and personalize the treatment of spine disorders. Axial Biotech conducted genetic research on scoliosis and degenerative disc disease. In September 2009, Axial Biotech announced the commercial launch of the ScoliScore AIS Prognostic Test with the claim of it being a DNA-based diagnostic test for scoliosis. In 2012 Transgenomic acquired the rights to the ScoliScore test. AIS genetic testing AIS genetic testing is the process of analyzing the DNA of a patient who has been diagnosed with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis to determine his or her likelihood of progression to a severe spinal curve. Approximately 4% of AIS patients will progress to the point where surgery is done. The majority of adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis are observed at regular intervals (usually between 4‚Äì6 months) with a physical exam and x-ray to evaluate the magnitude of the curve.Kuivala, Thomas, M.D. \\"What You Need to Know About Scoliosis.\\" 1/17/08 Spine Universe. 2009 Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis is a polygenic trait, meaning it is affected by the characteristics of more than a single gene. The heritability of scoliosis has long been suspected, and many research projects have been conducted in search of the genes responsible for the disease.Ward K, Ogilvie J, Argyle V, Nelson L, Meade M, and Braun J. \\"Polygenic Inheritance of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Study of Extended Families in Utah\\" 2008 Axial Biotech performed a genome-wide association study, testing millions of genetic markers to find any associated with scoliosis. The study of DNA heritability was enhanced through the use of rich genealogical data available in Utah. Utah contains the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which emphasizes the knowledge of ancestry and genealogy.Ward, K. \\"Demystifying the Genetic Test for Scoliosis\\" Roundtables in Spine Surgery, Volume 2, Number 3, 2008 Over the course of the research, DNA samples from over 9500 patients from 100 clinical sites worldwide were analyzed.\\"Axial Biotech Announces Commercial Availability of SCOLISCORE AIS Prognostic Test\\" Press Release. Sept 24, 2009 Researchers at Axial Biotech identified 53 genetic markers (28 which, when positive, contribute to the progression of the scoliosis curve and 25 which, when positive, protect against the progression of the curve.) The ScoliScore test was developed around these 53 markers. ScoliScore ScoliScore AIS Prognostic Test is a genetic test, which analyzes the DNA of patients who are diagnosed with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis, the most common type of scoliosis. The test shows the likelihood of spinal curve progression. In other words, it helps doctors and patients to see how likely it is that a patient's spine will become more curved and whether it is likely that the patient will eventually need surgery or other interventions. Approximately 85-90% of patients initially diagnosed with AIS will never have their mild scoliotic curve progress to a magnitude that requires surgical treatment. The test results may be used to predict, with over 99% probability, when a mild scoliotic curve is unlikely to progress to the point of requiring surgical treatment. This knowledge can make it unnecessary for these patients to undergo numerous office visits and be exposed to radiographic imaging over many years to monitor potential curve progression. The ScoliScore test is a powerful tool, which helps physicians predict spinal curvature through one test, accomplishing what was previously only possible through years of observation. The test is distributed by DePuy Spine, a Johnson & Johnson company. It was made available in a few physicians offices in September, 2009, and will be commercially launched in 2010. In 2012 Transgenomic acquired the rights to the ScoliScore test.

Description  Radiols (spikes) of a \\"slate pencil sea urchin\\". They are a classical souvenir. This species is a large sea urchin, with some specimens reaching over 8 cm in diameter, with spikes up to 10 cm. Most specimens are bright red, but brown and purple colorations are also seen. The spines may have a different color from the body. Spines have a white ring at their stem and have alternating light and dark rings. The spines are rounded to triangular in cross-section and taper towards the tip. Surprisingly during the night the red spines turn into a chalky pink. Specimens from Hawai‚Äòi tend to have bright red spines, while specimens from other parts of the Pacific may have yellowish or brown spines. Other variations of H. mammillatus, such as those living on the Ogasawara Islands, have slimmer spines instead of the species' characteristic thick, broad spines. It has been debated whether this specific variant truly belongs within the classification of H. mammillatus and not Heterocentrotus trigonarius, another type of pencil urchin. However, it has been concluded that the Ogasawara type is indeed a form of H. mammillatus. Heterocentrotus trigonarius is a similar species that has longer and darker spines, more angular, and is always monochromic. Red pencil urchin - PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea.jpgRed pencil urchin at French Frigate Shoals. Slate pencil urchin at Abu Basala.JPGBrown H. mamillatus at the Red Sea Heterocentrotus mamillatus MHNT.jpgBrown dried specimen MHNT Heterocentrotus mammillatus MHNT bouche.jpgBrown dried specimen MHNT  Range and habitat  This species can be found throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region (from the east coast of Africa to the Pacific archipelagos), but is especially abundant in Hawai‚Äòi. It can also be found on the shores of the Sinai Peninsula. H. mammillatus is found in reefs in depths from eight to 25 meters. It roams the subtidal zones of these areas and appears to prefer burrowing into hard sediments like limestone, coral, and basalt. The juveniles of this species of urchin can be found hiding under rocks.  Diet and behavior  H. mammillatus predominantly feeds on encrusting coralline algae, but has been noted to consume small amounts of other algae like Pterocladia and Ulva. Sea urchins are primarily marine grazers and tend to eat the algae in closest proximity to them. Thus, several species live a rather sedentary lifestyle. However, Heterocentrotus mammillatus appears to be somewhat active in comparison to other urchins like Echinothrix calamaris, Echinometra mathaei, and Echinometra oblonga. H. mammillatus was observed to travel up to 600 cm away from its starting site and moved an average of 96 cm per day (Ogden et al., 1989).  Predators  Heterocentrotus mammillatus shares many of the same predators as the other tropical sea urchins living in its habitat. For example, fish, such as those belonging to the families Balistidae, Labridae, and Lethrinidae, are known to prey on sea urchins. H. mammillatus is also collected and eaten by humans, though not as often as Tripneustes gratilla is.  Spines  Heterocentrotus mammillatus has thick, rounded spines that allow it to bore into hard substrates and defend itself against predators, wave drag, and pressure. Similar to other sea urchins, its spines are made of magnesium calcite arranged into a porous network, allowing for the passage of fluids and organic matter within the spines. The spines have a dense base and become more porous up towards the tip. However, H. mammillatus is unique in how its spines contain other layers of dense material organized throughout, sandwiching the more delicate porous layers. The layered structure allows for graceful failure, preserving the bottom layers of the spine which are farthest from the point of pressure. This graceful degradation occurs because energy is forced to travel through several layers and dissipates. The layered constitution of H. mammillatus‚Äô spines also allows for crack deflection.  Locomotion  Bilateral symmetry creates an anterior ‚Äúfront‚Äù end and posterior ‚Äúback‚Äù end in living organisms. The anterior end of bilateral organisms often undergoes cephalization and becomes a ‚Äúhead‚Äù, hosting a cluster of sensory organs, the mouth, or both. This head often becomes a locomotor anterior in which the organism orients itself, moving forward so that the head of the body is first to approach the upcoming environment. However, despite being bilaterally symmetrical, Heterocentrotus mammillatus does not possess a fixed locomotor anterior like many other bilaterally symmetrical organisms do, which allows it to proceed with equal ease in whatever direction it chooses. Instead, H. mammillatus seems to display temporary locomotor anteriors when moving, orienting itself in the direction that it first moves. Therefore, H. mammillatus often insists on continuing in its initial direction of movement, even if it is interrupted by being picked up or placed down in a different orientation.  Reproduction  Like other sea urchins, Heterocentrotus mammillatus periodically develops gametes to be released into the water for fertilization and undergoes a rest period in order to resume the cycle again. However, the timing and duration of these cycles varies from urchin to urchin. H. mammillatus from a reef near where the Gulf of Aqaba meets the Red Sea displayed an annual reproductive cycle. Its resting period is from October to January, accumulating nutrients in its gonads in preparation for gametogenesis. It begins gametogenesis in January and finishes in May, during which its gonads are nearly completely filled with gametes. Spawning usually occurs between May and June, but sometimes can take until October for all the urchins to finish releasing their eggs and sperm. The start and end times of these periods are not always rigid and can vary by a couple months. This data on H. mammillatus‚Äô reproduction indicates a possible lunar or semilunar cycle in spawning and gametogenesis, meaning that H. mammillatus may take temporal cues from the moon. Given that spawning did not always happen during the same phase of moon, other factors may contribute to the timing of H. mammillatus‚Äô reproductive stages (such as the tidal cycle, for example).  Organisms associated with H. mammillatus  The small shrimp, Levicaris mammillata, has been found clinging to the spines of Heterocentrotus mammillatus in Hawaii, the Ogasawara Islands, and the Ryuku Islands. The relationship between this shrimp and H. mammillatus has not been fully characterized yet, but it is theorized that the shrimp functions as a cleaner to H. mammillatus rather than a malignant parasite.

Only a few were produced. Design and development The Breda 79S was unusual amongst the Societ√† Italiana Ernesto Breda's products in the late 1930s in that it was a civil machine rather than a military one. It was a single-engined high-wing monoplane with a rather well equipped cabin for four. The wings were joined to the upper fuselage longeron and braced with streamlined vee struts to the lower longeron in the conventional way. They had almost straight leading edges with taper on the trailing edges and rounded tips. Trailing edge flaps and leading edge slots were interconnected. The tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage height and was braced to the rounded fin, which carried a wide chord and unbalanced rudder. These tail surfaces were fabric over wooden frames. The aircraft was powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Alfa-Romeo 115 six-cylinder inverted inline engine, neatly cowled but giving the Breda 79 a long-nosed look. The engine drove a two-bladed propeller. The fuselage was a fabric-covered welded steel structure, faired to an oval cross section. Behind the engine and under the wings was the cabin with four seats in two rows of two. Glazing was generous, including an openable roof window, and the cabin was both thermally and acoustically insulated with controllable ventilation. The seats were deep enough to allow everyone to wear a parachute backpack and in an emergency the pilot could open both the wide side doors and the roof light with a single lever. Flight 16 June 1938 p.593 The pilot's position was instrumented, and the aircraft lit, for night flying. The divided undercarriage had widely splayed legs attached at the bottom of the wing bracing struts, carrying semi- spatted wheels (closely streamlined but with the outer side of the wheel visible). The first Breda 79, c/n 78001 was registered as I-ABFU on 20 April 1936 together with a second example, I-ABFT c/n 78002 but it is not known when they first flew. Records are sketchy, but three seem to have been flown and used by the Ministero Aeronautica.

In a career which lasted from May 1966 until June 1967 he ran nine times and won five races. Bold Lad was unbeaten in 1966 and was the highest-rated two-year- old of the season in the United Kingdom and Ireland. He failed to reproduce his best form in 1967, but went on to be a successful stallion. Background Bold Lad was a bay horse with a small white star standing 16 hands high. He was bred in Ireland by American-born Beatrice Mills Forbes, 8th Countess of Granard, sister of Gladys Mills Phipps and Ogden L. Mills who owned his sire, Bold Ruler, an eight-time Leading sire in North America. Bold Lad's dam, Barn Pride, was a descendant of the mare Edvina, a member of family 2-e and the ancestor of the 2000 Guineas winner Martial. The colt was sent into training with Paddy Prendergast at his stables near the Curragh in Ireland. In 1962 Bold Ruler had sired another Champion Two-Year-Old Colt named Bold Lad who raced in the United States for owner/breeders Gladys Mills Phipps and Ogden L. Mills. Racing career=1966:two-year-old season Bold Lad began his career by winning the Youngsters Stakes in Ireland and was then sent to Royal Ascot to contest the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot in which he defeated a field which included Royal Palace. He won the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster defeating the previously unbeaten Ribocco, after which Prendergast described him as the best two-year-old he had ever trained, including Windy City. In September he won the Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the season's best juveniles, he was rated three pounds clear of runner-up Royal Palace giving him Champion honors in Ireland and England. 1967:three-year-old season Bold Lad began his three-year-old campaign with a win in the Tetrarch Stakes at The Curragh in Ireland. Sent to England, he was the 100/30 joint-favorite with Royal Palace going into the Classic 2,000 Guineas Stakes at Newmarket. He finished unplaced behind Royal Palace and Taj Dewan, having been denied a clear run in the closing stages. Bold Lad then started favourite for the Lockinge Stakes at Newbury but was beaten three-quarters of a length by the Irish-trained four-year-old Bluerullah. In the last race of his career, ran third to Reform in Ascot's St. James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. Assessment Bold Lad was given a Timeform rating of 133 as a two-year-old in 1966. In the same year he finished third in the voting for British Horse of the Year behind the three-year-olds Charlottown and Sodium. Stud career Retired to stud at a fee of 400 guineas, Bold Lad made a \\"spectacular\\" start to his breeding career, siring the 1000 Guineas winner Waterloo in his first crop of foals. He also sired the leading sprinters Boldboy and Never So Bold, the Richmond Stakes winner Persian Bold (sire of Kooyonga) and Ballad Rock, the sire of Chief Singer.

This scale was developed by McNair, Droppleman, and Lorr. Advantages of using this assessment include the simplicity of administration and ease of participant understanding. Another feature of the assessment that is notable is POMS psychological states can be assessed quickly due to the simplicity of the test. POMS can be administered and measured through written or online forums. The POMS measures six different dimensions of mood swings over a period of time. These include: Tension or Anxiety, Anger or Hostility, Vigor or Activity, Fatigue or Inertia, Depression or Dejection, Confusion or Bewilderment. A five-point scale ranging from \\"not at all\\" to \\"extremely\\" is administered by experimenters to patients to assess their mood states. There are two forms of the test; the long form that is administered primarily to adults and the short form which is primarily administered to adolescents. Completion of the assessment can take 5‚Äì15 minutes, depending on the form. __TOC__ History In 1971, Douglas M. McNair along with Maurice Lorr and Leo F. Droppleman developed the first Profile of Mood States which became the building block for being able to measure mood changes in people. With creating this scale, McNair and his colleagues came up with six distinct dimensions of mood swings that anyone can experience over time; Tension or Anxiety, Depression or Dejection, Anger or Hostility, Vigor or Activity, Fatigue or Inertia, and Confusion or Bewilderment. The first edition of the POMS scale is made up of 65 self-report questions where participants use a Likert scale to indicate whether each question related to them or not. This scale was the only in existence until 1983 when S. Shacham created the POMS-SF, a more concise version of McNair's original creation. Composed of only 37 questions, the shortened version still could produce significant results for participants while dramatically cutting down on the time it took to take the test. Recently there has been an updated edition created by McNair and Juvia P. Heurchert, the Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition (POMS 2). Like the original one created in 1971, this one also includes a short and long form of the test with 35 & 65 questions respectively. POMS - long form The first edition of the Profile of Mood States scale is known as the POMS-Standard version or the POMS-long form. It was developed by McNair, Lorr, and Doppleman in 1971 and is still in use today. Composed of 65 questions, those taking the test are asked to give a self- report for each question on how well they do or do not relate. Most of those who complete this test are adults and it takes approximately 5‚Äì15 minutes. With an extensive number of questions, the data that is collected from the test can provide the participants with data that is reliable and consistent. One of the drawbacks of the POMS-long form scale is including too many questions. This can limit those who have a physical illness or some type of impairment that does not allow them to fully complete the test to the best of their ability. POMS - short form The second edition of the Profile of mood states scale is known as the POMS-short form. POMS measures six different dimensions of mood swings over a period of time. These include: Tension or Anxiety, Anger or Hostility, Vigor or Activity, Fatigue or Inertia, Depression or Dejection, Confusion or Bewilderment. The short version of POMS was introduced in 1983 by S. Shacham, this version reduced the number of questions down to 37 from the original long-form's 65. The short form still covers all aspects and accurately exhibits the mood states of those who took this form. The short form is considered to be a great alternative to the long form if a briefer measure of psychological distress is needed.

Background Bold Lad bred and raced by Gladys Phipps and her brother Ogden L. Mills under their Wheatley Stable banner. His sire was eight-time leading sire in North America Bold Ruler, and his dam was the racing mare Misty Morn. He was trained by Bill Winfrey. Beatrice Mills Forbes, Lady Granard, the sister of Gladys Mills Phipps and Ogden L. Mills, bred the British mare Barn Pride to Bold Ruler, producing another colt named Bold Lad. Bold Lad raced in England and Ireland, where he, too, won Champion Two-Year-Old Colt honors. 1964: two-year-old season At age two, Bold Lad won every important race for his age group. He set a new Saratoga track record of 1:15 3/5 in winning the 6¬Ω-furlong Hopeful Stakes and equalled the Aqueduct track record time of 1:16 in his win in the 6¬Ω-furlong Futurity Stakes. Bold Lad's performances made him a unanimous selection as the 1964 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt. At the end of 1964, Thomas Trotter, handicapper for The Jockey Club, assigned Bold Lad high weight for 1965 of 130 pounds in the Experimental Free Handicap. The exceptional weight was higher than even the amount assigned to Secretariat, that was allotted 129 pounds in 1972. Bold Lad was the winterbook favorite for the first leg of the 1965 U.S. Triple Crown series, the Kentucky Derby. 1965: three-year-old season In early February, Bold Lad suffered a popped splint in his right foreleg while at Hialeah Park Race Track. He did not return to racing until April 5, when he scored a win over older horses in a six-furlong sprint at Aqueduct Racetrack. He then ran third in the 1‚Öõ-mile Wood Memorial Stakes and won the Derby Trial Stakes. Sent off in the 1¬º-mile Kentucky Derby as the betting favorite, Bold Lad was in contention at the top of the stretch, but then tired badly and finished 10th in the field of 11 horses behind winner Lucky Debonair. Bold Lad was diagnosed as suffering from a slight case of anemia and did not run in the Preakness Stakes or Belmont Stakes. Injured again on June 20, 1965, while working out at Aqueduct Racetrack, he underwent surgery and did not race again that year. 1966: four-year-old season He was brought back slowly in his four-year-old season by trainer Eddie Neloy, who took over the Wheatley Stable when Bill Winfrey retired. Bold Lad returned to racing on April 30, 1966, with a win at Garden State Park. On May 6, at Aqueduct Racetrack, he won the Alerted Purse and then on May 18 won the Roseben Handicap by three lengths. Still at Aqueduct, on May 30, 1966, Bold Lad won the prestigious Metropolitan Handicap by lengths while running the mile in 1:34 1/5 under 132 pounds. Unbeaten after four starts that season, he was entered in the Suburban Handicap. He was assigned 135 pounds, the highest weight for that race since Grey Lag in 1923. On an extremely hot day, he finished sixth to winner Buffle, which carried 110 pounds. Jockey Braulio Baeza said Bold Lad seemed to favor his left ankle after the finish of the race. Precautionary X-rays were taken and on August 2, 1966, it was announced that Bold Lad was to be retired to stud. Despite his shortened 1966 campaign, at the end of the year, Bold Lad was runner-up to Bold Bidder in the voting by the Thoroughbred Racing Association for 1966 American Champion Older Male Horse honors. Stud record While Bold Lad sired a number of good offspring as a stallion in Kentucky, France, and Japan, none matched his success on the track. Successor, a full brother to Bold Lad bred by Wheatley Stable and foaled in 1964, also won American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt honors.

They are led by General Quantrill (Brion James), a descendant of Confederate cavalry officer William Quantrill. A mysterious motorcycle riding gunslinger named Yuma (Joe Lara) arrives in town and joins the gang, but actually plays the thugs against each other, causing the drunken riders to shoot each other. The next morning Yuma's girlfriend Sarah kills two other gangmembers, but the Regime believes Yuma is responsible. Yuma tracks down his accusers and shoots six. He is chased by the rest of the gang to the tire refinery, but kills them all, including Quantrill's son. The sole survivor, Ackett (Bo Svenson) escapes to warn Quantrill. Most of the townsfolk flee but Sarah stays to help Yuma. Quantrill descends on the town with his entire army, only to find the road blocked by coffins filled with the bodies of his son and troops. Enraged, he shoots Ackett with a shotgun and enters the town, only to find it empty. The buildings, rigged with explosives, are detonated and most of Quantrill's army is destroyed. The remaining thugs converge on the town center and are attacked by armed townsfolk. Quantrill spots Yuma in a tower and sends his men after him. When they enter the tower Yuma abseils down and detonates a bomb hidden inside. Meanwhile, Sarah's son hides in an armored school bus which is later taken by Quantrill and chased by Yuma and Sarah. Aftet a chase, in which Yuma boards the bus and fights Quantrill, it crashes, and is then split apart by the truck Sara is driving.

Retrieved: 2009-09-29. Located at what was once a strategic crossing of the French Broad River, by 1860 the plantation had become one of the largest in East Tennessee, and one of the few in the region that rivalled the large plantations of the Deep South in size and influence.Susan Andrews and Amy Young, \\"Plantations On the Periphery of the Old South: Modeling a New Approach.\\" Tennessee Anthropologist, vol. XVII, no. 1 (Spring 1992), pp. 4, 7-9. The farm remains in operation, and several of its historic structures-- including two plantation houses and an 18th-century plank house-- have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. John Brabson II (1773-1848) established Brabson's Ferry Plantation after purchasing the plantation's namesake ferry in 1798, and acquired the surrounding fertile farmland over subsequent decades.Jones, 188. Brabson's sons continued operating the plantation after his death, and established a business that catered to the ferry's traffic. As the Brabsons supported the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War, their plantation was looted by Sevier County Unionists and toward the end of the war most members of the family were forced to flee.Jones, pp. 30, 36, 39-41. Several eventually returned, however, and by the end of the 19th century had rebuilt the plantation and ferry. The Brabson family still owns and manages the farm. Location Brabson's Ferry Plantation is located at the confluence of Boyds Creek and the French Broad River in the Boyds Creek community a few miles northwest of Sevierville. State Highway 338 (Boyds Creek Highway, or Old Knoxville Highway) passes along the plantation's southern boundary, and Indian Warpath Road traverses its western section. The Brabson Cemetery is located atop a steep hill with a sweeping view of the French Broad River on the north end of the plantation. History Highway 338 follows what was once a stretch of the Great Indian Warpath, a trail used for centuries by Native Americans travelling up and down the Tennessee Valley. The ancient path crossed the French Broad River at a ford near the mouth of Boyds Creek. In 1780, John Sevier crossed at this ford to engage and defeat a Cherokee force at the Battle of Boyds Creek.David Templin, The Lesser Franklin. Retrieved: 2009-09-30. In the early 1790s, an early pioneer named Andrew Evans established a ferry and a farm at the Boyds Creek ford. John Brabson, who migrated to the area from Frederick County, Virginia, purchased the Evans farm and ferry in 1798. Brabson plank house (left) and barn Brabson continued acquiring land in the early 19th century. By the time of his death in 1848, he owned , making him one of the largest landholders in East Tennessee. He was also one of the region's largest slaveholders, with 49 slaves, most of whom were split up among his children (Brabson's will emancipated only one elderly slave). One of Brabson's sons, Reese Bowen Brabson (1817-1863), moved to Chattanooga in 1848, and was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1858.Gary Jenkins, Reese Bowen Brabson.

Brabson's two eldest surviving sons, Benjamin (1809-1866) and Thomas (1813-1894), inherited most of Brabson's Ferry Plantation. Benjamin and Thomas built more elaborate houses (in 1856 and 1854, respectively), and in 1852 established a company, Brabson and Brother, that operated a general store, tannery, blacksmith shop, gristmill, and stagecoach stop for local farmers and stagecoach traffic using the family's ferry.Jones, pp. 215-217. Brabson Cemetery While most of Sevier County supported the Union during the U.S. Civil War (96% of the county voted against secession in 1861), the Brabsons supported the Confederacy. Benjamin Brabson's son, William, enlisted in the Confederate army, and in 1863 was captured by the Union Army while fighting near Muscle Shoals. Toward the end of the war, as Union forces re-gained control of East Tennessee, vengeful Sevier Countians began harassing and threatening the Brabsons. Most of the family's livestock were stolen, the plantation houses were looted, and family members were forced to flee. In an October 1865 letter, Benjamin Brabson's wife, Elizabeth (1821-1894), wrote, \\"they rocked my house so, burned my carriage, and fired my outbuildings, they also shot at me several times.\\" Thomas Brabson and his wife moved to Knoxville, where there had been more sympathy for the Confederacy. Benjamin Brabson moved to Winchester, Tennessee, writing in 1865 that his future looked \\"dark.\\" He died a few months later, and, according to his wishes, was buried in Winchester rather than the family cemetery in Boyds Creek. After Benjamin Brabson's death, his family returned to Sevier County and began rebuilding the family's plantation, largely through the efforts of his son William (1842‚Äì1888). Benjamin's son, John Brabson IV (1858-1943), assumed ownership of the plantation after his mother's death, and made several modifications to the Benjamin Brabson house. By 1900, Brabson's Ferry had again become a major center of local commerce.Margaret Ann Roth, \\"Transportation and Communication.\\" The Gentle Winds of Change: A History of Sevier County, Tennessee, 1900-1930 (Sevierville, Tenn.: Smoky Mountain Historical Society, 1986), p. 61. After the death of John Brabson IV, his son Benjamin Davis Brabson III (1905-1982) and his wife, Estalena Rogers Brabson (1912-1989), took over ownership and operation of the farm until Benjamin's death in 1982. Estalena maintained an enthusiastic interest in genealogy and family history, and published several books, including: John Brabson I, Patriot of the American Revolution And Some of His Descendants (1975) which chronicles the origins of Brabson's Ferry Plantation. Estalena was responsible for placing Brabson's Ferry Plantation on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The farm is currently managed by Benjamin Brabson's great-grandson, Ben D. Brabson, Jr., and his wife, Elaine, and in 2008 was designated a Tennessee Pioneer Century farm. The Brabson farm produces beef cattle, wheat, oats, corn, hay, and soybeans. Historical structures Log cabin near the Brabson Cemetery Brabson's Ferry Plantation contains several notable antebellum structures, including both the Benjamin Brabson and Thomas Brabson houses, a late 18th-century plank house, a frame tannery building, a 19th-century barn, and a late 18th-century log cabin. The center of the farm, which contains the Benjamin Brabson house, plank house, and barn, is situated along a gravel driveway just off Indian Warpath Road. The Benjamin Brabson house once overlooked Brabson's Ferry along the French Broad River. The Thomas Brabson house overlooks the junction of Indian Warpath Road and Highway 338, where the Brabsons' tannery, blacksmith shop, and storehouse once stood. Slave houses (no longer standing) were once located on the east side of Indian Warpath Road between Highway 338 and the gravel driveway, and at least one once stood between the Benjamin Brabson house and the river. The Brabson plank house was built by either Andrew Evans or John Brabson sometime between 1790 and 1810. The plank house was constructed using an odd technique known as piece-sur-piece construction, which involves stacking horizontal planks and tying them in with vertical posts. In the 19th century, the plank house was moved from its original location and renovated for use as a carriage house. A large double-door was added to the front, and the chimney was removed. A hewn log cabin, possibly built by John Brabson in the late 18th century, originally stood near the river but was moved to its present site near the cemetery in the 19th century.Michael Carberry, \\"National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Brabson's Ferry Plantation,\\" 1974-07. The Thomas Brabson house, built in 1854, is a two-story Federal-style house with a Greek Revival portico. A 1.5-story kitchen wing is attached to the rear of the house to create an \\"L\\" shape. Square doric columns grace the house's portico. The Benjamin Brabson house, built in 1856, was originally a Federal-style house similar to the Thomas Brabson house, although a Victorian porch and Queen Anne-style gable were added to the front of the house in the 1890s. Both houses contain most of their original design elements, including large post- and-lintel mantels and open \\"dog-leg\\" staircases.

Polanski underwent a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, and he was placed on probation. However, upon learning that he was likely to face imprisonment and subsequent deportation, Polanski became a fugitive from justice, fleeing to London and then France in February 1978, hours before he was to be formally sentenced.https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/03/archives/polanski-flies-to-paris- as-officials-in-us-ponder-prosecution-move.html Since then Polanski has mostly lived in France and has avoided visiting countries likely to extradite him to the United States. Rape case On March 10, 1977, Polanski, then aged 43, faced multiple charges involving drugging and raping 13-year-old Samantha Jane Gaileypage 3 of transcript via Roman Polanski, Fugitive Director 10 June 2008 at TheSmokingGun. (now Samantha Geimer). A grand jury charged Polanski with five charges: #Rape by use of drugs #Perversion #Sodomy #Lewd and lascivious act upon a child under fourteen #Furnishing a controlled substance to a minorhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/roman-polanski-victim-testimony-i-was-ready- to-cry/ This ultimately led to Polanski's guilty plea to a different charge of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. According to Geimer's testimony to the grand jury, Polanski had asked Geimer's mother (a television actress and model) if he could photograph the girl as part of his work for the French edition of Vogue, which Polanski had been invited to guest-edit. Her mother allowed a private photoshoot. Geimer testified that she felt uncomfortable during the first session, in which she posed topless at Polanski's request, and initially did not wish to take part in a second but nevertheless agreed to another shoot. This took place on March 10, 1977, at the home of actor Jack Nicholson in the Mulholland area of Los Angeles.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ekEsAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=Es0EAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5571%2C2750543 When the crime was committed, Nicholson was on a ski trip in Colorado, and his live-in girlfriend Anjelica Huston who was there had left, but later returned while Polanski and Geimer were there. Geimer was quoted in a later article as saying that Huston became suspicious of what was going on behind the closed bedroom door and began banging on it, but left when Polanski insisted they were finishing up the photoshoot. \\"We did photos with me drinking champagne,\\" Geimer says. \\"Toward the end it got a little scary, and I realized he had other intentions and I knew I was not where I should be. I just didn't quite know how to get myself out of there.\\" In a 2003 interview, she recalled that she began to feel uncomfortable after he asked her to lie down on a bed, and described how she attempted to resist. \\"I said, 'No, no. I don't want to go in there. No, I don't want to do this. No!', and then I didn't know what else to do,\\" she stated, adding: \\"We were alone and I didn't know what else would happen if I made a scene. So I was just scared, and after giving some resistance, I figured well, I guess I'll get to come home after this\\". Geimer testified that Polanski provided champagne that they shared as well as part of a quaalude, 2003 archive and despite her protests, he performed oral, vaginal, and anal sex acts upon her, each time after being told 'no' and being asked to stop. Although Geimer has insisted that the sex was non-consensual, Polanski has disputed this. Describing the event in his autobiography, Polanski stated that he did not drug Geimer, that she \\"wasn't unresponsive\\", and that she did not respond negatively when he inquired as to whether or not she was enjoying what he was doing. The 28-page probation report submitted to the court by Kenneth Fare (signed by deputy Irwin Gold) concluded by saying that there was evidence \\"that the victim was not only physically mature, but willing.\\" The officers quoted two psychiatrists' denial of Roman being \\"a pedophile\\" or \\"sexual deviant\\". Claiming to protect Geimer from a trial, her attorney arranged a plea bargain. Polanski accepted, and, under the terms of the agreement, the five initial charges were dismissed. Instead, Polanski pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of engaging in unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. Conviction and flight Under the terms of the plea agreement, the court ordered Polanski to report to a state prison for a 90-day psychiatric evaluation, but granted a stay to allow him to complete his current project. Under the terms set by the court, he traveled to Europe to complete filming. While in Europe for the filming of upcoming 1979 remake of Hurricane, Polanski was photographed at Oktoberfest 1977 with his arms on multiple young girls and jars of beer around him.http://time.com/2901712/roman-polanski-venus-in-fur/ He was subsequently ordered to return to California and reported to Chino State Prison for the evaluation period beginning on 19 December 1977, and was released after 42 of the 90 scheduled days. Polanski's lawyers expected that Polanski would receive probation at the subsequent sentencing hearing, with the probation officer, examining psychiatrist, and the victim all recommending against prison time. During this time, on 20 January 1978, Polanski lost his job as the director of Hurricane that he had been prepping.Los Angeles Times; 20 January 1978; page 47 Polanski's attorneys said that the presiding judge, Laurence J. Rittenband, suggested to them that he would send the director to prison and order him deported. According to the 2008 documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney David Wells showed Rittenband the photographs of Polanski partying in Munich with young girls, and said Polanski was being cavalier about the charges against the 13-year-old girl. This would have constituted an ex parte communication as although Wells was not an attorney of record in the case, he was technically a lawyer for one of the parties involved due to his work for the state of California. In response to the threat of imprisonment, Polanski became a fugitive from justice, fleeing the United States and going to England. Regarding the proposed sentencing, Rittenband said: > On January 30, Mr. Dalton and Mr. Gunson came to my chambers to discuss > [Polanksi's psychiatric report]. I told them that I had carefully read it > and that I felt it was superficial, replete with many inaccuracies and > factually unsupported conclusions, and was conspicuous more for what it > failed to report than what it did report. I believe I used the word > ‚Äòwhitewash‚Äô. I stated that there was absolutely no mention in the report of > any discussions which the counsellors [sic ] and psychiatrists at Chino had > with Mr. Polanski relating to the serious and aggravated charges of rape by > drugs and alcohol, sodomy, and oral copulation of the 13-year-old victim. I > believe I pointed out to them that a statement in the report ‚Äòthat > throughout the experience (with the victim) Mr. Polanski seems to have been > unaware that he was involving himself in a criminal offense, an isolated > instance of naivete, unusual in a mature sophisticated man‚Äô, was one of the > most fatuous statements in a diagnostic report that I have ever read. I told > Mr. Dalton that I did not propose to follow the recommendations which were > for straight probation without any additional time in custody. Polanski fled initially to London on 1 February 1978, where he maintained a residence. A day later he traveled on to France, where he held citizenship, thus avoiding the possibility of extradition to the United States by the United Kingdom. Consistent with its extradition treaty with the US, France can refuse to extradite its own citizens, and an extradition request later filed by US officials was denied. Polanski has never returned to England and later sold his home there. The US could still request the arrest and extradition of Polanski from other countries should he visit them, and Polanski has avoided visits to countries (such as the UK) that were likely to extradite him. In 1979, Polanski gave a controversial interview with novelist Martin Amis in which, discussing his conviction, he said \\"If I had killed somebody, it wouldn't have had so much appeal to the press, you see? But ... fucking, you see, and the young girls. Judges want to fuck young girls. Juries want to fuck young girls. Everyone wants to fuck young girls!\\" Original reactions to his flight Filmmaker Joseph Losey (who exiled himself to the UK after being blacklisted by HUAC) responded to Polanski's flight by saying \\"I have not contacted him ‚Äì and I'm not going to.\\" Actor Robert Stack called his flight \\"a coward's way out,\\" and then added \\"the ranks are closing in on him.\\"https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/2722570-martin-amis- interviews-roman-polanski Post-conviction Geimer sued Polanski in 1988, alleging sexual assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress and seduction. The case was settled out of court in 1993. After Polanski missed an October 1995 payment deadline, Geimer filed papers with the court, attempting to collect at least US$500,000. The court held that Polanski still owed her over $600,000, but it was unclear as of 2009 if this had since been paid. In a 2003 interview, Geimer said, \\"Straight up, what he did to me was wrong. But I wish he would return to America so the whole ordeal can be put to rest for both of us. I'm sure if he could go back, he wouldn't do it again. He made a terrible mistake but he's paid for it.\\" In 2008, Geimer stated in an interview that she wishes Polanski would be forgiven, \\"I think he's sorry, I think he knows it was wrong. I don't think he's a danger to society. I don't think he needs to be locked up forever and no one has ever come out ever ‚Äì besides me ‚Äì and accused him of anything. It was 30 years ago now. It's an unpleasant memory ... (but) I can live with it.\\" In 2008, a documentary film of the aftermath of the incident, Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Following review of the film, Polanski's attorney, Douglas Dalton, contacted the Los Angeles district attorney's office about prosecutor David Wells's conversation with the trial judge, Laurence J. Rittenband. Based on statements by Wells included in the film, Polanski and Dalton sought judicial review of whether Wells acted illegally and engaged in malfeasance in interfering with the operation of the trial. However, after Polanski's arrest, Wells recanted his statements in the film, admitting that he had lied and \\"tried to butter up the story to make me look better\\". In December 2008, Polanski's lawyer filed a request to Judge David S. Wesley to have the case dismissed on the grounds of judicial and prosecutorial misconduct. The filing claims that Judge Rittenband (deceased in 1993) violated the plea bargain by keeping in communication about the case with deputy district attorney Davis Wells, who was not involved. In January 2009, Polanski's lawyer filed a further request to have the case dismissed, and to have the case moved out of Los Angeles, as the Los Angeles courts require him to appear before the court for any sentencing or dismissal, and Polanski did not intend to appear. In February 2009, Polanski's request was tentatively denied by Judge Peter Espinoza, who said that he would make a ruling if Polanski appeared in court.Judge: Roman Polanski must return to U.S., Today.com, 22 January 2010 The same month, Samantha Geimer filed to have the charges against Polanski dismissed from court, saying that decades of publicity as well as the prosecutor's focus on lurid details continues to traumatize her and her family. Judge Espinoza also stated that he believed there was misconduct by the judge in the original case but Polanski must return to the United States to apply for dismissal. There is no statute of limitations governing the case because Polanski had already been charged and pleaded guilty in 1978 to having had unlawful sex with a minor. While some legal experts interviewed in 2009 thought he might at that point face no jail time for unlawful sex with a minor, his failure to appear at sentencing is in itself a crime. On 7 July 2009, Polanski's attorneys filed a petition for a writ of mandate (the California equivalent of a writ of mandamus) with the Second Appellate District of the California Court of Appeal in order to seek review of Judge Espinoza's decision on an expedited basis.Docket for Case Number B217290, California Courts Appellate Case Information System. The next day, the Court ordered the prosecution to file an opposition, thus indicating that it was assuming jurisdiction over the case. This was unusual; petitions for extraordinary writs are usually summarily denied without any explanation.Science Applications International Corp. v. Superior Court, 39 Cal. App. 4th 1095 (1995). In this case, the Court of Appeal explained: \\"We deny the vast majority of petitions we see and we rarely explain why. In reality, perhaps the most fundamental reason for denying writ relief is the case is still with the trial court and there is a good likelihood purported error will be either mooted or cured by the time of judgment.\\" Arrest in Zurich On 26 September 2009, Polanski was detained by Swiss police at Zurich Airport while trying to enter Switzerland, in relation to his outstanding 1978 U.S. arrest warrant. Polanski had planned to attend the Zurich Film Festival to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award. The arrest followed a request by the United States that Switzerland apprehend Polanski. U.S. investigators had learned of his planned trip from a fax sent on 22 September 2009, from the Swiss Justice Ministry to the United States Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs, which had given them enough time to negotiate with Swiss authorities and lay the groundwork for an arrest. Polanski had been subject of an Interpol red notice at the request of the United States since 2005. The Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police said Polanski was put \\"in provisional detention.\\" An arrest warrant or extradition to the United States could be subject to judicial review by the Federal Criminal Court and then the Federal Supreme Court, according to a ministry spokesman. Polanski announced that he intended to appeal extradition and hired lawyer Lorenz Erni to represent him. On 6 October his initial request for bail was refused by the Federal Department of Justice and Police; a spokesperson commented, \\"we continue to be of the opinion that there is a high risk of flight.\\" On 2 May 2010, Polanski published an open letter entitled \\"I can remain silent no longer!\\" on Bernard-Henri L√©vy's web site. In it, he stated that on 26 February 2010 Roger Gunson (the deputy district attorney in charge of the case in 1977, retired by the time of the letter) testified under oath before Judge Mary Lou Villar in the presence of David Walgren (the present deputy district attorney in charge of the case, who was at liberty to contradict and question Gunson) that on 16 September 1977 Judge Rittenband stated to all the parties concerned that Polanski's term of imprisonment in Chino constituted the totality of the sentence he would have to serve. Polanski also stated that Gunson added that it was false to claim (as the present district attorney's office does in their request for his extradition) that the time he spent in Chino was for the purpose of a diagnostic study. On 12 July 2010, the Swiss court rejected the U.S. request and released Polanski from custody.Nick Cumming-Bruce & Michael Cieply, Swiss Reject U.S. Request to Extradite Polanski in New York Times dated 12 July 2010 Reactions to the arrest In reaction to the arrest, the foreign ministers of both France and Poland urged Switzerland to release Polanski, who holds dual citizenship of both countries, but subsequently withdrew their support for Polanski. =France= The arrest provoked particular controversy in France, where over the years many had downplayed the severity of Polanski's crime, highlighting instead his achievements as a film director and the many years that had passed since his flight from the United States. The French minister of Culture and Communication, Fr√©d√©ric Mitterrand, was vehement in his support, all the while announcing his \\"very deep emotion\\" after the questioning of the director, \\"a French citizen\\" and \\"a film-maker of international dimension\\": \\"the sight of him thrown to the lions for an old story which doesn't make much sense, imprisoned while traveling to an event that was intending to honor him: caught, in short, in a trap, is absolutely dreadful.\\" These reactions resulted in political backlash in France. Daniel Cohn-Bendit criticized these statements by Mitterrand, mainly on the grounds that it was a \\"matter of justice\\" in as much as \\"a 13-year-old girl was raped\\", adding \\"I believe that a minister of Culture, even if his name is Mitterrand, should say: I'll wait and read the files [myself]\\". \\"It is a tough call, since it is true that a 13-year-old girl was raped, that she said in her own words 'I complained [as it was happening]' and that she afterwards added 'I accepted a large sum of money' [to remain silent]\\". Marc Laffineur, vice president of the French National Assembly and a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy's center-right party, criticized government ministers for rushing to judgment, saying the charges against Polanski should not be minimized. Marine Le Pen, from the National Front, during a TV talk show on how to prevent sex crime recidivism, criticized Mitterrand for his support of Polanski., 5 October 2009 She recalled that in 2005, Mitterrand had published the book The Bad Life in which he wrote about having sex with male prostitutes in Thailand. In the book, Mitterrand was quoted, \\"I got into the habit of paying for boys...All these rituals of the market for youths, the slave market excite me enormously. One could judge this abominable spectacle from a moral standpoint but it pleases me beyond the reasonable.\\" Le Pen called for Mitterrand to resign. The SACD, a society that collects authorship fees for film and theater works and redistributes them to authors, hosted an international petition in favor of Polanski. The petition stated: > By their extraterritoriality, film festivals the world over have always > permitted works to be shown and for filmmakers to present them freely and > safely, even when certain States opposed this. A number of celebrities, most of them French, expressed their support for Polanski by means of a public manifesto, whose concluding statements were \\"Roman Polanski is a French citizen, an artist of international reputation, now threatened to be extradited. This extradition, if brought into effect, would carry a heavy load of consequences as well as deprive the film-maker of his freedom.\\" The signatories concluded: \\"we demand the immediate release of Roman Polanski.\\" Not all assessments coming from the French film-making mainstream have been openly partisan, however. Luc Besson, for instance, remarked: \\"I do not know the history of the trial. ... I feel a lot of affection for [Polanski], he's a man I really like and I know him a bit, our daughters are very good friends but there is one justice, [and] it is the same for everyone\\". On 30 September 2009, the French government dropped its public support for Polanski, on the grounds that he was not \\"above the law\\". Government spokesman Luc Chatel said: \\"We have a judicial procedure under way, for a serious affair, the rape of a minor, on which the American and Swiss legal systems are doing their job,\\" adding: \\"One can understand the emotion that this belated arrest, more than 30 years after the incident, and the method of the arrest, have caused.\\" Public opinion polls in France consistently show between 65% and 75% of the population want to see Polanski extradited to the United States. =Poland= Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk responded to early reactions by urging his cabinet ministers to exercise calm and reminding them that it is a \\"case of rape and of punishment for having sex with a child.\\" A 2009 opinion poll showed that more than 75% of Poles would not like to see Polanski escape another trial. =Switzerland= In Switzerland, the arrest caused widely varying reactions in the media and in politics, while the Swiss minister of justice, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, defended the arrest as legally required under the Swiss-U.S. extradition treaty and as a matter of equality before the law. =United States= When asked if he would consider granting Polanski a pardon, then-California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said: \\"I think that he is a very respected person and I am a big admirer of his work. But, nevertheless, I think he should be treated like everyone else. It doesn't matter if you are a big-time movie actor or a big-time movie director or producer.\\" Schwarzenegger added: \\"And one should look into all of the allegations, not only his allegations, but the allegations about his case. Was there something done wrong? You know, was injustice done in the case?\\" More than 100 people in the film industry, including Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, Darren Aronofsky, David Lynch, Wes Anderson, Tilda Swinton, Pedro Almodovar, Guillermo Del Toro, Harmony Korine, Michael Mann, Alfonso Cuaron, Jonathan Demme, Alexandre Desplat, Terry Gilliam, Stephen Frears, Thierry Fr√©maux, Wim Wenders, Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, Julian Schnabel and Wong Kar-wai, among many others signed a petition in 2009 calling for Polanski's release.The full list of petition signers can be read here . Harvey Weinstein also defended Polanski.Lena Dunham: Harvey Weinstein and the Silence of the Men, New York Times, 9 October 2017Harvey Weinstein: Polanski has served his time and must be freed, Independent, 28 September 2009 However, in 2018, Natalie Portman, Xavier Dolan and Asia Argento expressed regret and apologized for signing the petition. Whereas a number of those in Hollywood have rallied behind Polanski, the Los Angeles Times reports that the rest of the nation seems to have a different perspective: \\"In letters to the editor, comments on Internet blogs and remarks on talk radio and cable news channels, the national sentiment is running overwhelmingly against Polanski.\\" Following the rearrest, David Wells announced that he had lied in the Wanted and Desired documentary, claiming that director Marina Zenovich told him that the documentary would not air in America, if he refused to lie in it (which Zenovich denied). Wells then proceeded to blast Polanski, calling him a pedophile rapist. Wells said \\"It's outrageous. This pedophile raped a 13-year-old girl. It's still an outrageous offense. It's a good thing he was arrested. I wish it would have happened years before.\\" In May 2018, Polanski was expelled as a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The Academy stated: \\"The board continues to encourage ethical standards that require members to uphold the academy's values of respect for human dignity.\\" Polanski's legal team responded to the dismissal by threatening a lawsuit stating the Academy had violated its code of conduct. The Academy responded to Polanski's lawyers by stating: \\"The Board of Governors retains its independent duty and authority as outlined in the bylaws to address and take action on any matter, whether submitted by the process outlined above or not, related to a member's status and to enforce the Academy's Standards of Conduct.\\" Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner turned down an invitation to join the Academy in support.  Outcome  On 30 September 2009, New York Times reported that Steptoe & Johnson's Reid Weingarten, a well-known criminal defense lawyer, had been hired by Polanski for his defense along with attorneys Douglas Dalton, Bart Dalton, and Chad Hummel. According to the New York Times: > Mr. Weingarten is expected to mount a legal effort to block Mr. Polanski's > extradition before the issue works its way through the Swiss legal system, > according to people who were briefed on Mr. Weingarten's involvement, but > spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak > publicly. A critical step will most likely be a move to stop the extradition > before United States authorities send the required documents to Switzerland. > Mr. Polanski's team may do so by arguing either that his crime does not > qualify for extradition, because he was originally to have been sentenced to > less than a year in prison, or that he has already effectively served his > sentence, during a 42-day psychiatric evaluation. On 21 October, after Swiss authorities had rejected Polanski's initial pleas to be released on bail pending the result of any extradition hearing, one of his lawyers, Georges Kiejman, floated the idea of a possible voluntary return to the United States in an interview with the radio station Europe 1: \\"If this process drags on, it is not completely impossible that Roman Polanski could choose to go finally to explain himself in the United States where the arguments in his favor exist.\\" On 25 November, the Federal Criminal Court of Switzerland accepted Roman Polanski's plea to be freed on US$4.5M bail. The court said Polanski could stay at his chalet in the Swiss Alps and that he would be monitored by an electronic tag during his house arrest. On 10 December, Division 7 of the California Court of Appeal of the Second Appellate District heard oral argument on Polanski's petition for writ of mandate. Television stations including CNN, France 2 and TVN24 also filed applications to cover the hearing. The Court denied Polanski's petition in an opinion filed on 24 December. The Court reasoned that since Polanski had adequate legal remedies in 1977 and at present in 2009, there was no reason to carve out a special exception to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. In arriving at that holding, the Court pointed out that neither side had realized that Polanski had the option of simply asking to be sentenced in absentia, which would result in a hearing where Polanski could directly attack the trial judge's alleged malfeasance in 1977. On 6 January 2010, upon remand to the superior court, Polanski's lawyers followed the appellate court's advice and presented a notarized letter from Polanski in which he asked to be sentenced in absentia. The court asked the parties to brief the issue and scheduled a hearing for 25 January. At the hearing, Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza ruled Polanski must be present in court for sentencing. On 12 July 2010, the Swiss authorities announced that they would not extradite Polanski to the U.S. in part due to a fault in the American request for extradition. Polanski was no longer subject to house arrest, or any monitoring by Swiss authorities. In a press conference held by Swiss Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, she stated that Polanski's extradition to the U.S. was rejected, in part, because U.S. officials failed to produce certain documents, specifically \\"confidential testimony from a January 2010 hearing on Mr. Polanski's original sentencing agreement.\\" According to Swiss officials, the records were required to determine if Polanski's 42-day court-ordered psychiatric evaluation at Chino State Prison constituted Polanski's whole sentence according to the now- deceased Judge Rittenband. Reasoning that if this was the correct understanding, then \\"Roman Polanski would actually have already served his sentence and therefore both the proceedings on which the U.S. extradition request is founded and the request itself would have no foundation.\\" Legal actions In 2013, Samantha Geimer published her view on the rape in her autobiography The Girl: A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski. In late October 2014, Polanski was questioned by prosecutors in Krak√≥w, and released. Back in 2010 the Polish prosecutor general stated that under Polish law too much time had passed since the crime for Polanski to be extradited. On 25 February 2015, Polanski appeared in a Polish court for a hearing on the U.S. request for extradition. The judge scheduled another hearing to be held in April or sooner, to give time to review documents that arrived from Switzerland. On 30 October 2015, Polish judge Dariusz Mazur denied a request by the United States to extradite Polanski. According to the judge, allowing Polanski to be returned to American law enforcement would be an \\"obviously unlawful\\" act, depriving the filmmaker of his freedom and civil liberty. His lawyers argued that extradition would violate the European Convention on Human Rights. Polanski holds dual citizenship with Poland and France. On 27 November 2015, Poland decided it will not extradite Polanski to the U.S. after prosecutors declined to challenge the court's ruling, agreeing that Polanski had served his punishment and did not need to face a U.S. court again. Preparations for a movie he was working on had been stalled by the extradition request from last year.\\"Poland Will Not Extradite Roman Polanski to the US\\", ABC News, 27 November 2015 On 6 December 2016, the Supreme Court of Poland ruled to reject an appeal filed by Polish Minister of Justice Ziobro, and to uphold the October 2015 ruling. On 17 August 2017, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon rejected a request from Samantha Geimer to dismiss the case against Polanski. On December 2017, Polanski filed a ‚Ç™1.5 million suit in Herzliya Magistrates' Court against Israeli journalist and filmmaker Matan Uziel. Polanski maintained that Uziel, through his website, www.imetpolanski.com, falsely reported that five women had come forward to accuse him of raping them. Polanski was suing for libel and defamation of character. Herzliya Magistrates' Court rejected Polanski's request to be exempt from appearing in court after filing the libel suit. While Polanski gave various reasons for his inability to appear, the presiding judge, Gilad Hess, dismissed these one by one and ordered Polanski to pay Uziel ‚Ç™10,000 in costs. In November 2018, it was published that Polanski decided to drop the lawsuit, and was ordered by the court to pay Uziel ‚Ç™30,000 (US$8,000) for court costs. The court accepted Uziel's request that the suit not be dropped, but rather that it be rejected, making Polanski unable to sue Uziel again over the same issue in the future.

W., 1990, Utah Place Names,  Geography  The House Range is bounded by Tule Valley to the west, Whirlwind Valley and Sevier Desert to the east, and trends with the Fish Springs Range to the north. The range has three notable passes: Skull Rock Pass (which US Highway 6/US Highway 50 travels through), Marjum Canyon (which the old US Highway 6 travels through), and Sand Pass (which the Weiss Highway passes through). The highest point in the House Range is Swasey Peak, at . Other notable peaks include Notch Peak, a frequent climbing and base-jumping hotspot, and the very square Tatow Knob. It is also known for one of the tallest limestone cliffs in the world, Notch Peak.  Geology  The geology of the House Range is dominated by gray Cambrian to Devonian carbonate rock which was intruded by a pink Jurassic granitoid in the central part of the range. In the Wheeler Amphitheater, away from the intrusion, the Lagerst√§tte that contains the well- preserved fauna is found in the Cambrian section of the range.

According to the dictionary of the Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, achala means 'fancy dress' or 'striking costume'. Many Quechan terms contain the word achala. A similar word is achalay, meaning 'grooming' or 'decorating.' According to the dictionary of Dr. Gonz√°lez de Holgu√≠n, the word achala does not exist in that context, but one finds the similar words achallay and achallay √±ichini, which mean both 'to cause something' and 'self-admiration.' The word could have originated from a distortion of the original term, which was later converted into a word more agreeable to the Spanish of the area, and could refer either to the clothing historically worn by inhabitants of the region, allowing them to withstand the severity of the weather, or to the admiration the inhabitants had for this special region. Orography=General description Pampa de Achala is located in the province of Cordoba in Argentina. The northern boundary consists of the mountains of Los Gigantes, and the southern boundary of the northern portion of the Sierra de Comechingones, with the Summits of Achala located in the central area of the region. It is a rugged area, whose small plains and low slopes are responsible for its classification as 'plains'. These slopes and plains allowed for the formation of an intricate underground water network that supplies a great number of springs. Within this region, there are numerous deep ravines with vertical walls between 600m and 800m high, many of which are more than 1,000m wide. The most important and popular ravines are the Quebrada del Condorito and the Quebrada de Yat√°n. These streams have nurtured microclimates that allow for the development of ecological niches, with many endemic species (species that do not live anywhere else on the planet), worthy of study and observation. In general access to them is difficult due to the rugged terrain, often inaccessible to any vehicle (including those with all-wheel drive) and thus can only be reached on foot, by mule or on horseback. Antenna near 'Altas Cumbres' road, in the Pampa de Achala, situated above 2,300 m. Cartography There are many maps published and available on the Internet that detail the region. The region appears to be a large mass of rock from north to south, crossed by a single road: National Road RN 20. Position, limits, and extension The region covers southern Cruz del Eje Department, the south west of Punilla Department, San Alberto Department and San Javier Department and the west of Calamuchita Department. It is difficult to differentiate the water reserve Provincial Pampa de Achala from the Pampa de Achala itself. The water reserve was purposely created to protect the Pampa. Its boundaries are set by geographical features: the northern boundary reaches the provincial route RP 28 (formerly the National Road RN 20), which surrounds the massif of Los Gigantes. The southern boundary is Mount Champaqu√≠, 2,790 meters high. Its eastern and western limits are set by the high altitude of 1,500 meters. In this region are the highest peaks of the province. Its size is about 65 km from north to south and 24 km from east to west, which represents an area of approximately 150,000 hectares, of which 40,000 are the Quebrada del Condorito National Park. Altas Cumbres route), also called 'Jorge Ra√∫l Recalde', in memory of this rally driver, native to this region Paths To access this region, two provincial roads: Provincial Route No. 28 (gravel), linking the towns of Tanti with Taninga (near the town of Salsacate). After traveling nearly 40 km from Tanti, and climb over 1,700 meters you reach the far north of the region, more precisely at the foot of the massif 'Los Gigantes'. From there you can follow the same route to the town of Taninga. The second option is the provincial route RP 34 (tarmac), located about 30 km south of the former. It crosses the city of Villa Carlos Paz, crossing the towns of San Antonio de Arredondo, Villa Icho Cruz, Mayu Sumaj, Cuesta Blanca, and deposited us in the Pampa de Achala. This road is also known as Camino de las Altas Cumbres or route Jorge Ra√∫l Recalde, in tribute to this rally racer. Continuing along the same route, it accesses the Traslasierra Valley. While these are the two most relevant options, there are regional roads and tourist access to reach specific sectors within the region. As mentioned above, except for these two alternatives, the other, in most cases are suitable only for special vehicles, and yet they can not access certain areas. Suspension bridges road was constructed and opened in 1918 linking the Valley Traslasierra with the city of Villa Carlos Paz in the Punilla Valley. Physical geography=Geology Fractured rocks at Achala, near to 'La Pampilla' The geological evolution of the Pampa de Achala cannot be isolated from the evolution of Sierras de C√≥rdoba and Sierras de San Luis. The geological history of these, dating back 15 million years, with the formation of a sedimentary basin which was then subjected to enormous strain as a result of horizontal pressure. Elevated basement blocks are reverse faults of approximately north-south direction, west verging, which are composed by metamorphic rock and Igneous of the Neoproterozoic in the Palaeozoic. Less affected by successive orogenic cycles: the Pampean orogenies, the Proterozoic higher-Cambrian medium (Rapela et al. 1998), Famatinian, the Ordovician less than half (Ace√±olaza and Toselli 1976, Dalla Salda 1987) and achaliana of Devon medium to Carboniferous lower (Sims et al. 1998; Stuart-Smith et al. 1999), which would be related to successive stages of convergence and collision of land with the craton of the River Plate, along the proto-Andean margin of Gondwana (sic) . Here, there was intrusion of large igneous bodies - batholiths - ended granite, producing the rise of the emerging mountains. In the Tertiary old structures were activated and generated new ones. Along with the strain developed a significant volcanism in the western region and, finally, late in the same era and the beginning of the Quaternary, the whole region was uplifted to build the current ranges. The tectonic forces at work in the Andean folding were horizontal pressures generated from the west and due to the rigidity of the underlying material caused the existence of faults, almost all north-south and an alignment of the strings accordingly. The result was that seen at present, a mountain range with steep western slopes and eastern slopes with gentle slope, which allowed the formation of natural lakes and streams of high ecological value. These mountain ranges are represented the three types of rocks: metamorphic, sedimentary and igneous. The granites geochemically include calc-alkaline granites with alkaline, meta-aluminous to peraluminous more abundant and monzogranites granites. Granodiorites, leucogranites and tonalites are also present. Mafic enclaves, dikes including lamprophyres, pegmatites and aplites. Its chemical composition places it within the field of collisional or intraplate granites (Rapela et al. 1990), and has been interpreted as a product of partial melting of the crust due to changes in the thermal regime during regional uplift (Otamendi et al. 2002). Since the foundation of the Pampas, the Sierras has been involved in a series of extensional events in the Late Paleozoic (Gondwanan cycle), the latter accompanied by a large magmatism, volcanism, and finally the Cenozoic Andean orongenic cycle, which produced the present morphology. The brittle tectonic Andica is represented by reverse faults among which stand out in the hills of Cordoba those high peaks, the Giants, Copina and Cumbrecita. Typical image of Pampa de Achala. The most common here are metamorphic rocks formed from the Precambrian plutonic- metamorphic basement composed mostly of coarse-grained gneiss and migmatites, intruded by large granite batholiths, common in the Pampa de Achala. Minerals found primarily include quartz, mica, biotite and muscovite. magnetite, fluorapatite, rutile, chlorite, kaolinite and uranium ore. The latter has generated considerable controversy regarding its acquisition, due to the high degree of pollution involved in the extraction. Climate The climate of the region is temperate with high thermal aptitude. The maximum temperatures are generally 30 ¬∞C in the summer, and the temperature does not fall below -20 ¬∞C during the winter (approximately the end of April to the beginning of September). As is typical of the climate of mountain regions, the weather conditions can change within minutes. Throughout the Pampa de Achala, hundreds of water sources spring from the bowels of the mountain Hydrography The average precipitation for the area is 800 mm. In summer precipitation is in the form of rain, and generally in the winter it is found in the form of snow. Fog is common all year due to the humid winds from the east; the cold winds from the south are also not uncommon. An intricate network of streams, ponds, lakes and springs give this region the characteristic function as a 'sponge' that absorbs and retains the moisture throughout the year, channeling it into the water sources which supplied much of the population of the province. It is a natural basin for precipitation, and for this reason, the provincial government declared the region as the provincial water reserve of Pampa de Achala. The area contains the headwaters of four major rivers of the province: Suqu√≠a (or First River), Xanaes (or Second River) and Ctalamochita (or Third River) flowing towards the eastern margin of the Sierras. Towards the western side of the region we find the headwaters of the Rio Mina Clavero river. Biology and ecology This particular eco-region, as defined by the convergence of the biogeographical provinces of Chaque√±a del Espinal, Pampeana and Mountain, has been influenced by many types of flora and fauna. It is regarded as an \\"island\\" due to its specific biogeographical characteristics and it is thus distinguished from other areas within the environment of Chaco by its altitude and the species that inhabit it. The mountains of Los Gigantes, the northern boundary of Pampa de Achala with an elevation of 2,340 metres. Flora Several phytogeographical provinces converge here: Chaque√±a, Andean, Patagonian and Magellanic. The confluence of these very diverse currents confers on the area a synthesis of microclimates which makes it unique, a uniqueness accentuated by the presence of endemic species, the number of which is probably greater than is presently known. The sparse vegetation consists of coarse grasses and low palatability. In the ravines and on the mountain slopes are copses or small woods of tabaquillo and mayten, called in the mountain zone \\"quebracho\\", the coexistence of which is a unique biogeographical phenomenon. The tabaquillo has relatives which are distributed the length of the Andes from Venezuela to Argentina, while the mayten originates from the woodlands of south-west Argentina (the cool Andean- Patagonian woodland). or Andean-Patagonic forest (in Spanish) The greatest density of these woods is in the bottoms of the ravines, where they acquire a low forest physiognomy with great quantities of ferns and epiphytes. Both the grasslands and the woodlands of the pampas and of the ravines respectively are composed of plants of very diverse origins. Some, approaching from the eastern slopes of the mountainous area, are native to the Austro-Brazilian region. Other species of specifically Andean origin have in the Pampa de Achala their most southerly distribution. On the other hand, numerous species of the south of Argentina find in this region their most northerly habitat. Great specimen of Tabaquillo Not only the rocky walls of the ravines but also the granite outcrops of the Pampa de Achala, at first glance sites deprived of vegetation and of fauna, represent highly diverse habitats, capable of sustaining in their cracks and fissures a flora and fauna of significant scientific interest. Below the 1,500 metre line, the tough grasslands of the high altitudes are replaced by thickets in which the romerillo (Heterothalamus alienus) predominates. The high altitude woodlands make way for the mountainous Chaque√±o woodlands, with trees of molle and coco. Fauna The characteristics of this area primarily correspond to the Andean-Patagonian region, with the typical species of the plain encountered at an altitude that limits their distribution. The geographical isolation of the area has favoured the survival of its unique fauna. Biologists and birdwatchers from around the world travel to Pampa de Achala to observe the endemic species of the region. ;Amphibians Amphibians native to the region include Achala toads (Rhinella achalensis and Bufo achalensis,) and the \\"Achalan frog\\" (Odontophrynus achalensis). ;Birds Eleven subspecies and species of birds of the Passeriform order of Andean-Patagonian lineage are exclusive to this area, including: rufous-banded miner, common miner, bar-winged cinclodes, white-winged cinclodes, cordilleran canastero, puna castanero, white-tailed shrike-tyrant, cinereous ground tyrant, plain-colored seedeater, plumbeous sierra finch (also known as yal plomizo) and ash-breasted sierra finch (also called yal chico), long-tailed meadowlark (Sturnella loyca obscura), which nests in the ground and in large, oddly-shaped rocks. The most inaccessible cliff walls are used as nesting sites by the black-chested buzzard-eagle (Geranoetus melanoleucus), the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus).:es:Archivo:Colca-condor-c03.jpg The Andean condor is one of the more recognized species in the area; as of 2007, 101 Andean condors remained in the region. The king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa) has also been spotted in Pampa de Achala. ;Mammals Among the mammals native to the region is the culpeo or Andean fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus)-in the region, is called red fox-, which is in danger of extinction. They share this region with 30 other species of mammals, including the puma (Felis concolor), classified as vulnerable; the colocolo (Oncifelis colocolo); the ferret (Mustela furax); and Geoffroy's cat (Oncifelis geoffroyi).:es:Oncifelis geoffroyi Small rodents and hare are also abundantly present in the area. Guanacos have recently been reintroduced to the region, as they were disappearing slowly towards the early twentieth century. ;Insects The local scorpion, (Urophonius achalensis), is of particular interest. Of the numerous species of arthropod, the fire ant () stands out on account of the size of its nests and pathways. ;Reptiles Achala's green lizard (Pristidactylus achalensis) Along the arroyos are well- watered areas (fertile plains, marshes) and reed beds where the native coral snake Liophis anomalus () feeds on the local tree frog Hyla pulchella ( or \\"bramble-patch frogs\\"). An endemic species is also to be found, the eye- catching green lizard of Achala, Prystidactilus achalensis. The sole venomous snake is a species of hognose snake, Lystrophis dorbignyi (). ;Fish The commonest species of fish in the water courses of the Pampa de Achala are the rainbow trout, arroyo trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), Astyanax fasciatus (), and . Indiscriminate fishing has caused the loss of numerous species throughout the region (and indeed the entire province). The rivers and arroyos are perpetually being re-stocked with salmon, with the intention of maintaining the ecology. Regrettably the goal can never be reached, as secret fishing is constant and difficult to control, and has caused the loss of very many species. As at September 2009, all fishing in all locations throughout the province is forbidden during the hours of darkness. History=Pre- history The original inhabitants of the region were the Comechingones, the indigenous inhabitants of the plains and mountains beginning approximately 500 years ago, and who are responsible for most of the names given to the major elements of the region of the Cordoba mountains. They arrived in the region by fleeing the persecution of Spanish colonizers. In the area of pampa de ol√°en, researchers have found evidence of an earlier culture, ayampit√≠, which existed in the region approximately 6,000 years earlier. Modern population The population of the region is extremely low. Access to the region is difficult, with many roads being steep, and many areas accessible only by walking or riding a mule or horse. Obtaining water is not easy, as it seeps down to the bedrock very quickly. Electricity is provided exclusively through solar power. Despite the difficulties of living in Pampa de Achela, schools exist in the region (including Ceferino Namuncur√°, Padre Liqueno, among others) that serve as convergence points for inhabitants of the area. Some schools have to offset their academic terms due to inclement weather in the winter (consisting of temperatures regularly approaching -20 ¬∞C, accompanied by strong winds and snow), causing classes to be suspended until spring. The region also contains some very basic health centers. The principal activity of the region is the breeding and raising of goats, cattle, and sheep. These animals are used to sustain the inhabitants of the region through the sale of leather, and raw or woven wool. Some inhabitants also produce pottery to sell to tourists. Economy Entrance to National Park Quebrada del Condorito, in the Pampa de Achala Tourism and ecology Some areas (particularly Los Gigantes) have high mountain ranges are used by climbers, both amateur and professional, as well as Scout groups. During the summer, the water ways that have small sandy beaches at their banks attracts some tourists. Another popular attraction is \\"the path of the high peaks.\\" While the current route is relatively new (the project dates from the late 1950s), the original existed before the twentieth century and is known as a path of suspension bridges. The route was constructed along the path of a public trail, which was used by hikers and horseback riders. Its construction is due to the tireless work of the priest Jos√© Gabriel del Rosario Brochero, more famously known as the Cura Gaucho. Today, this road is used as one of the stages of the world rally championship, and as a tourist attraction. With the declaration of natural reserves (and national park area of the Quebrada del Condorito), it is expected that the impact of the tourism on the ecology of the region will be measured and controlled to better protect the local ecology. Mining Mining in the area is limited, as it has been proven that mining is devastatingly detrimental to the area's ecology. There are a few mines in the area that were established prior to the creation of the reserve, and they operate under strict environmental controls. The most notable of the mines in the area is the uranium mine of the Los Gigantes, property of ADARSA, which extracts and processes material for the nuclear power plants of Embalse and Atucha. Legislation The region was declared a Provincial Water Reserve in 1999 due to the area receiving the most precipitation in the province (in the form of both rain and snow), providing most of the water resources for Cordoba and surrounding provinces. This transforms the area into the most important watershed of central Argentina. thumbleft620pxPanoramic picture of the region.

Also known as Puente Rio La Plata, it was the longest bridge constructed in Puerto Rico during the Spanish colonial period. It crosses the Rio de la Plata, the longest river in Puerto Rico. According to the U.S. National Park Service, \\"[t]his is the most important metal bridge in Puerto Rico from the period.\\" The bridge is still standing.It is stated by the National Park Service that the bridge is still in use, at the bottom, here. However, this sat-image at Google indicates a newer bridge on the east for the modern traffic, and shows cars parked in approach to the historic bridge. History The bridge was built as \\"part of the Carretera Central, the first highway across the central mountains of Puerto Rico.\\" The Carretera Central, a 134 kilometer highway between San Juan and the port of Ponce was largely completed by 1886, with temporary bridges in place at some crossings and 13 permanent bridges completed. The installation of the permanent Arenas Bridge in 1894 was near the completion of the Carretera in 1898. Because of scarcity of iron in Puerto Rico, there were no metal fabricators in the country. Instead, bridges like this were fabricated overseas and shipped in parts to Puerto Rico. A Spanish government agent in Paris secured international bids, largely from French and Belgian firms, for bridges to be built in the overseas colonies of Spain. The Arenas Bridge itself was fabricated by Nicaise et Delcuve, a Belgian firm, and was shipped on the steamship Teutonia to Puerto Rico for assembly. An alternative to a truss bridge would have been a suspension bridge design, which was a well- developed technology for long spans before the Arenas Bridge was built. However, there were no truly long spans in Puerto Rico that would have absolutely required a suspension bridge in colonial times, as there are no particularly wide rivers or canyons, and chief engineer Manuel Sanchez-Nunez assessed that suspension bridges were unsuited to the tropical climate, even removing, a few years later, one that had been constructed in Caguas in 1857. As a result, suspension bridge technology was not widely employed in Puerto Rico. Even today it is believed that there are only three suspension bridges in the commonwealth, one being a modern pedestrian bridge in Bayamon. The bridge was designed by Mariano Sichar. A steel truss bridge, it weighed 23,623 pounds and was contracted to be built for 56,221 pesos. Stone abutments to support the bridge were constructed under supervision of Jos√© Roque-Paniagua; engineer Julio Larrinaga oversaw assembly of the bridge. It brings what is now Puerto Rico Highway 735 over Rio de la Plata between Barrio Monte Llano and Barrio Arenas.Per note in National Park Service's Focus database system, with spelling change from \\"Barrio Montellano\\" in that note to \\"Barrio Monte Llano\\", which is a barrio in Cayey. It is between the municipalities of Cayey and Cidra. In the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, American forces moved from south to north over the Carretara Central. Another Carretera bridge was demolished by the Spanish to delay the American advance, but not Arenas Bridge.

McKenzie Professor of Economics at the University of Rochester. Previously, he served as the 12th president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis until December 31, 2015. Appointed in 2009, he joined the Federal Open Markets Committee in 2011. In 2012, he was named one of the top 100 Global Thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine.  Early life and education  Kocherlakota was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to a European American mother and a Telugu-speaking Hindu father originally from the Coastal Andhra region of southern India. Both of his parents earned PhDs in statistics from Johns Hopkins University.https://www.bis.org/review/r140514a.htm They taught at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where Kocherlakota spent most of his childhood.Ann Saphir, \\"How a Fed inflation hawk changed his mind\\", Reuters, October 9, 2012. He entered Princeton University at age 15 and graduated with an A.B. in Mathematics in 1983 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"Optimal income taxation\\" under the supervision of Robert M. Anderson. He earned a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 1987.  Career = Academic  Kocherlakota's first faculty position was at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He subsequently was a professor of economics at the University of Iowa, Stanford University, and the University of Minnesota. He served as the chair of the University of Minnesota's economic department from 2006 until 2008, As chair of the University of Minnesota's Economics Department, Kocherlakota decisively \\"recruited multiple economists to the school at once\\" (nine new hires within a two-year span), which improved its national rank in the U.S. News & World Report from 15th to 10th place among graduate programs in economics. Kocherlakota's research in monetary economics, asset pricing, and public finance has appeared in Econometrica, Journal of Political Economy, Journal of Economic Theory, Journal of Monetary Economics, and Journal of Money, Credit and Banking. He is one of the founders of \\"New Dynamic Public Finance\\", which is an approach to optimal tax design \\"given only minimal restrictions on the set of possible tax instruments, and on the nature of shocks affecting people in the economy\\". It establishes a \\"formal connection between the problem of dynamic optimal taxation and dynamic principal-agent contracting theory,..[which] means that the properties of solutions to principal-agent problems can be used to determine the properties of optimal tax systems\\". His contributions include articles on optimal taxation and optimal unemployment insurance. He published a graduate textbook on the subject in 2010 called The New Dynamic Public Finance by Princeton University Press. In 2008, he was among 270 economists who signed a petition protesting the Obama administration's economic stimulus plan that eventually passed and signed into law in February 2009. Paid for by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, the petition was published in several major national newspapers. According to Kocherlakota, he signed the petition not necessarily because he was opposed to the stimulus, but because he thought it was important to point out that the beneficial effects of an economic stimulus were not \\"a settled question within the academe.\\"  Minneapolis Fed presidency  On October 8, 2009, Kocherlakota assumed the presidency of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis following the retirement of Gary H. Stern. Kocherlakota had been a consultant at the Minneapolis Fed since 1999. In January 2011, Kocherlakota contested the idea that the Federal Reserve caused the U.S. housing bubble in the 2000s. He noted that \\"land prices started to rise in 1996 and that prices grew 11% per year between 1996 and 2001, when the Fed's target rate was between 4.75% and 6.5% ...[,] 'hardly ... loose monetary policy.'\\"Goldstein, Steve, \\"Kocherlakota: Fed didn't cause housing bubble\\", MarketWatch, January 11, 2011. In August 2011, he was one of the three governors who voted against the statement promising to keep the short-term interest rate near zero for two more years. After being appointed to the Minneapolis Fed in 2009, he underwent a \\"dramatic and unexpected intellectual transformation\\" from monetary hawk to dove, signaled in a September 2012 speech delivered at Gogebic Community College in Ironwood, Michigan, in which he advocated that the Fed \\"keep the fed funds rate extraordinarily low until the unemployment rate fall[s] below 5.5 percent\\" to everyone's surprise. He said that he realized that labor- market problems like unemployment were, in fact, related to demand. He cast the only dissenting vote at the October 2014 Fed meeting, during which the Committee voted to conclude the QE asset purchase program, because of his view that inflation rates are still too low and that an interest-rate hike in 2015 would be a \\"mistake\\", especially as inflation is unlikely to reach the targeted 2% until 2018. Kocherlakota is the Lionel W. McKenzie Professor of Economics at the University of Rochester since January 1, 2016.  Personal life  Kocherlakota is married to Barbara McCutcheon, who holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago.\\"Minneapolis Fed: Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis names Narayana Kocherlakota new president\\", Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, September 30, 2009 He enjoys rap music, Jack White, and American football.

He wrote for Bulaklak, Liwayway, Silahis, Kislap, Tagumpay - the country's leading weekly magazines during his time. He was poet laureate of the Republic of the Philippines in 1945 and won the Commonwealth literary awards in the 1940s and the Rizal Centennial Literary Awards in 1961. His contemporaries were Amado V. Hernandez, Fausto Galauran, Simeon Mercado, Nemesio Caravana and Liwayway Arceo, among others. He was one of the best 50 writers of the Philippines. Education He began his early education at a kindergarten school ran by Maestra Enchang on Folgueras St., Tondo and Colegio La Juventud ran by Prof. Perfecto del Rosario. He also went to the Tondo Primary School and the Meisic Elementary School. He finished high school at the Manila North High School, now Arellano High School, in Santa Cruz, Manila. He was in the same class (1922) as Lorenzo Sumulong, a Philippine senator. He went to the University of the Philippines and National University, where he obtained his A.A. degree. He finished his law studies at the Philippine Law School and became a member of the Philippine Bar in 1939. As a student he was given these various honors: Sobresaliente, Lectura Castella, Colegio La Juventud Honor Student, Tondo Primary School Model Student, Meisic Primary School Distinguished Student and Declaimer, Tondo Interrmediate School Class Poet, Manila North High School Orator, Philippine Law School (PLS) Senator, PLS Junior Philippine Senate Editor, The National, student organ of the National University As a newsman and writer, he was a member of the pre-war TVT Publication (Taliba-La Vanguardia-Tribune). He covered Malacanang, the Senate and Congress. He contributed countless articles, features, short stories to the newspapers and magazines of his time. He was one of the few who was a prolific writer in both English and Filipino. Literary honors *Holder of the Literary Award Record in short story and poetry in the pre-war Taliba and Liwayway *Winner, Commonwealth Literary Contest (1940) *Novelist of the Republic for his novel \\"Muling Pagsilang\\" (1942), adjudged by a juror headed by the illustrious senator and writer, Claro M.

Cruz 1975 Palanca Awards Public and government service As a lawyer, he was associated with Atty. M. V. Roxas and F. Soc Rodrigo. He was a first grade civil service eligible and writer-translator, an attorney under Republic Act No. 1080, and attorney-claim investigator under the Judge Advocate General Office (1947). He was in the Press Relations Division and also the Legal Division of the Office of the President of the Commonwealth from February 10, 1939 till December 31, 1941. He was corrector of style and professor in Filipino and translation technique at the National Assembly (1942). He was Inspector General of the National Land Settlement Administration from March 24, 1948 to December 31, 1949. From February 5, 1949 to December 31, 1950 he was an assistant at the Department of Foreign Affairs. He was appointed Justice of the Peace for Indang-Inopacan, Leyte on August 16, 1951, but did not serve due to his commitments in the country's capital, Manila. He was special attorney and legislative researcher at the Philippine Senate from March 1, 1951, until he retired from government service in 1961. He is remembered, first, as a novelist, short story writer and poet. His works graced the pages of the prime entertainment sources of his time - the newspapers and weekly magazines, such as, Liwayway, Bulaklak, Silahis, Kislap Graphic and, then later, Tagumpay. His short story \\"Rosa Malaya\\" was featured in the high school textbook Diwang Ginto. He was included in the top 100 short story writers of his time in a book edited by Pedrito Reyes, \\"50 Kuwentong Ginto ng 50 Batikang Kuwentista\\". His novels \\"Ang Bungo\\", \\"Lakandula\\" and \\"Halimuyak\\" had been published as college textbook by Ateneo University. As the first accredited vernacular newsman in Malacanang, he was the first newspaperman welcomed by President Manuel L. Quezon to write and translate his speeches, addresses and pronouncements into the National Language, making it possible to bring the message of the Chief Executive and make it better understood by the people. To-be-president Diosdado Macapagal was in the same press relations office in Malacanang, at that time. As lawyer of the Tondo Foreshore Residents' Association, he was instrumental in the preparation of a bill that granted the right to thousands of poor bonafide occupants of the Tondo foreshore area to purchase the lots they had occupied since liberation on an installment plan basis. He argued for them in the hearings until the bill became Republic Act 559, benefiting thousands of families in the Tondo foreshore area. Inspired by the late Claro M. Recto and Jos√© P. Laurel, he initiated together with Jose Villa Panganiban, who became Director of the Institute of National Language, the project to translate into Filipino all acts and resolutions of the Congress of the Philippines in order that the people may understand better their rights and obligations as citizens. Final years Alberto immigrated to the United States in the mid-1960s to be with his children and grandchildren. His last work was Sariling Parnaso, a collection of poems. He had ten children, who all ended up living in the United States. He came back to the Philippines and spent the rest of his years at the house he and wife, Patrocinio, built in Project 8, Quezon City. He died in 1987 at the age of 86. His friend and contemporary National Artist Amado V. Hernandez who also grew up in Tondo had the highest respect for Alberto. \\"Siya'y isa kong iginagalang na makata at manunulat.\\" \\"Sa ilang nobela ni Alberto Segismundo Cruz ay makikita ang pagsasanib ng tradisyonal na tema ng protesta at ilang elemento ng modernismo.

For example, two diameters of a circle are conjugate if and only if they are perpendicular. Of ellipse right300pxthumb Two conjugate diameters of an ellipse. Each edge of the bounding parallelogram is parallel to one of the diameters. For an ellipse, two diameters are conjugate if and only if the tangent line to the ellipse at an endpoint of one diameter is parallel to the other diameter. Each pair of conjugate diameters of an ellipse has a corresponding tangent parallelogram, sometimes called a bounding parallelogram (skewed compared to a bounding rectangle). In his manuscript De motu corporum in gyrum, and in the 'Principia', Isaac Newton cites as a lemma proved by previous authors that all (bounding) parallelograms for a given ellipse have the same area. It is possible to reconstruct an ellipse from any pair of conjugate diameters, or from any bounding parallelogram. For example, in proposition 14 of Book VIII of his Collection, Pappus of Alexandria gives a method for constructing the axes of an ellipse from a given pair of conjugate diameters. Another method is using Rytz's construction, which takes advantage of the Thales‚Äô theorem for finding the directions and lengths of the major and minor axes of an ellipse regardless of its rotation or shearing. Of hyperbola ::For any œÜ, the indicated diameters of the circles and hyperbolas are conjugate. Similar to the elliptic case, diameters of a hyperbola are conjugate when each bisects all chords parallel to the other. In this case both the hyperbola and its conjugate are sources for the chords and diameters. In the case of a rectangular hyperbola, its conjugate is the reflection across an asymptote. A diameter of one hyperbola is conjugate to its reflection in the asymptote, which is a diameter of the other hyperbola. As perpendicularity is the relation of conjugate diameters of a circle, so hyperbolic orthogonality is the relation of conjugate diameters of rectangular hyperbolas. The placement of tie rods reinforcing a square assembly of girders is guided by the relation of conjugate diameters in a book on analytic geometry. Conjugate diameters of hyperbolas are also useful for stating the principle of relativity in the modern physics of spacetime. The concept of relativity is first introduced in a plane consisting of a single dimension in space, the second dimension being time. In such a plane, one hyperbola corresponds to events a constant space- like interval from the origin event, the other hyperbola corresponds to events a constant time-like interval from it. The principle of relativity can be formulated \\"Any pair of conjugate diameters of conjugate hyperbolas can be taken for the axes of space and time\\". This interpretation of relativity was enunciated by E. T. Whittaker in 1910. ReferencesFurther reading  * * W. K.

The highway runs from its southern terminus at a T-intersection with Old Mill Road in a quiet residential neighborhood in the eastern Cleveland suburb of Gates Mills to its northern terminus at a signalized intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Willoughby that doubles as the eastern terminus of SR 640\\\\. Route description The routing of SR 174 takes it through eastern Cuyahoga County and western Lake County. No portion of SR 174 is included within the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of routes determined to be most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country. SR 174's northern terminus and concurrency with US 20 has been unsigned since the early 1960s. History When SR 174 was established in 1923, it consisted of the following routing: Starting from its southern terminus at SR 91 in Solon, it followed what is now Solon Road northeasterly into Chagrin Falls. It then ran northwest along what is now Chagrin Boulevard, formerly designated as US 422 and, before that, SR 16, to Chagrin River Road. From there, SR 174 utilized Chagrin River Road heading north into Gates Mills, where it tied into its present-day southern terminus, and then followed the entirety of its current routing to its northern terminus in downtown Willoughby. In 1929, SR 174 took on its present shape when all of the highway south of Gates Mills was removed from the state highway system. Its new (and present) southern terminus was at US 322, which followed Old Mill Road at the time. Even though US 322 was re- routed to the north within Gates Mills in 1940, SR 174 continues to end at Old Mill Road to this day. OH 174's \\"northern terminus\\" in Willoughby.

Route description All of SR 175 traverses the eastern portion of Cuyahoga County. SR 175 begins at the intersection of Richmond Road and Aurora Road (Ohio State Route 43).It quickly intersects Cannon Road, turns right to follow Cannon Road, and immediately turns left to continue north along Richmond Road. SR 175 intersects with the Outerbelt East Freeway, commonly known as Interstate 271 and also part of U.S. Route 422. However, it is only a partial interchange; there is an exit ramp from I-271 South/US 422 East and an entrance ramp to I-271 North/US 422 West. It soon after intersects with Harvard Road, passing the Ahuja Medical Center and entering the city of Beachwood. Further into Beachwood, it crosses Chagrin Boulevard (now with the US 422 designation) and picks up the designation for OH-87. OH -87 leaves Richmond Road at an intersection for Shaker Boulevard. SR 175 continues through the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, eventually terminating with Lakeshore Boulevard (OH 283). History When SR 175 was created in 1923, it ran from Painesville westward along current SR 283 along Lake Erie to the current intersection of SR 175 and SR 283 in Euclid, then turned south along its current alignment until just northwest of its current southern terminus, where it followed Perkins and Columbus Roads southwest to SR 14 in Bedford. In 1929, the portion of SR 175 along Lake Erie was replaced with part of the SR 6 designation (now SR 283), and SR 175 was shortened to its current northern terminus. In 1946, SR 283 was re-routed and extended southward through its current southern terminus to SR 14/Broadway Avenue on the boundary between Cuyahoga and Summit Counties, replacing the SR 613 designation that had run between SR 43 and SR 14\\\\. (SR 14 was later relocated onto Interstate 480.) By 1967, SR 175 was shortened to its current southern terminus.

History  The Aquatic Species Program launched in 1978 was research program funded by the U.S. DoE, tasked with investigating the use of algae for the production of energy. The program initially focused efforts on the production of hydrogen, however, shifted primary research to studying oil production in 1982. From 1982 through its culmination, the majority of the program research was focused on the production of transportation fuels, notably biodiesel, from algae. In 1995, as part of the over-all efforts to lower budget demands, the DoE decided to end the program. Research stopped in 1996 and staff began compiling their research for publication. In 2007, Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act, which required the United States to increase biofuel use. In accordance with this legislation, the Department of Energy dedicated $125 million to biofuel research in 2014 and brought the United States to use 45% of the world's biofuels, according to a 2014 article by Delia Gallinaro. The Department of Energy created the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which supports R&D; on alternative fuels. Within EERE, the Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) created a Multi-Year Program Plan describing many specific challenges to overcome and goals to complete in order to increase the percentage of fuel in the United States coming from biological sources. BETO organized an Algae Program dedicated to researching and improving the viability of algae as an energy source. EERE's official page for the Algae Program lists goals including improving yields of algae strains while decreasing expenses of growing algae, filtering the algae from the water, extracting the oils, and processing the biofuel. The United States Department of Agriculture has also been ordered to fund $881 million of biofuel research, so the organization partnered with the U.S. Navy and the Federal Aviation Administration with the goal of researching algae-based biofuels that can be \\"dropped-into\\" current military fuel infrastructure. This financial incentive for algae biofuel research has facilitated the creation of many algae strains that can be converted to fuel. Current economic assessments cite large-scale pond- cultivated algae fuel prices ranging from at $0.42 to $7.50 per Liter. However, a 2012 economic analysis of commercialization potential and cost optimization determined a much smaller price range of $0.42 to $0.97 per Liter. Research Universities working on oil from algae include *The University of Texas at Austin. *University of Maine *University of Kansas *Old Dominion University. *University of California, Davis *University of Kentucky Researchers at the Center for Applied Energy Research (CAER) of the University of Kentucky are currently developing the algae-mediated conversion of coal- fired power plant flue gas to drop-in hydrocarbon fuel. Through their work, these researchers have proven that the carbon dioxide within flue gas from coal-fired power plants can be captured using algae, which can subsequently harvested and utilized, e.g. as a feedstock for the production of drop-in hydrocarbon fuels. Use of wastewater At the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution the wastewater from domestic and industrial sources contain rich organic compounds that are being used to accelerate the growth of algae. Also the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering of the University of Georgia is exploring microalgal biomass production using industrial wastewater.http://openwetware.org/images/2/2e/09-Microalgal_Biomass_Production_Chinnasamy.pdf Algaewheel, based in Indianapolis, Indiana, presented a proposal to build a facility in Cedar Lake, Indiana that uses algae to treat municipal wastewater and uses the sludge byproduct to produce biofuel. Organizations The National Algae Association (NAA) is a non-profit organization of algae researchers, algae production companies and the investment community who share the goal of commercializing algae oil as an alternative feedstock for the biofuels markets. The NAA gives its members a forum to efficiently evaluate various algae technologies for potential early stage company opportunities.

It is characterised by decreases in mean arterial pressure and stroke volume and a parallel increase in heart rate. It has been shown that a reduction in stroke volume due to dehydration is almost always due to the increase in internal temperature. It is influenced by many factors, most notably the ambient temperature, internal temperature, hydration and the amount of muscle tissue activated during exercise. To promote cooling, blood flow to the skin is increased, resulting in a shift in fluids from blood plasma to the skin tissue. This results in a decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure and reduced stroke volume in the heart. To maintain cardiac output at reduced pressure, the heart rate must be increased. Effects of cardiovascular drift are mainly focused around a higher RPE (Rate of Perceived Effort); that is, a person will feel like they are expending more energy when they are not. This creates a mental block that can inhibit performance greatly. Prevention or minimization of cardiovascular drift includes consistently replacing fluids and maintaining electrolyte balance during exercise, acclimatization to the environment in which one is performing, and weight training to supplement cardiovascular efforts.

The Minister of Defence administers his functions through the Ministry of Defence and a range of other government agencies. Its headquarters is in Kuala Lumpur.  History  Ministry of Defence was established on 31 August 1957 and officially began operations in a building located in Brockman Road (now Jalan Dato' Onn), Kuala Lumpur. This building also housed the office of the first Defence Minister, the late Tun Abdul Razak bin Datuk Hussein, who served from 31 August 1957 to 22 September 1970. The first building of the Ministry of Defence was constructed by the Federal Government at a cost of RM122,000.00 and was officially opened by Tun Haji Abdul Razak bin Datuk Hussein on 18 March 1960. The building constructed in Jalan Padang Tembak also housed the Chiefs and Officers of the Malaysian Armed Forces of the three services. As a result of growing awareness among leaders of the importance of the armed forces, a complex consisting of six blocks of four storeys high was built in front of the Office of the Member Services Division to cater for the growing membership. The RM 2 million building was officially opened by Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra on 6 April 1967. After the withdrawal of the British troops, the Malaysian Government took drastic measures to improve the security of the country from any threat. This task is entrusted to the Ministry of Defence as well as the task of improving efficiency in the management of military needs from time to time. To accommodate all the agencies under one roof, the government has decided to build a new building for the Ministry of Defence. As a symbolic, the foundation stone was laid by the then Deputy Defence Minister, Dato' Abu Bakar bin Datu Abang Abang Haji Mustapha on 10 March 1982. The new building is located at Jalan Padang Tembak, Kuala Lumpur and was built with a budget of RM144 million and was completed in mid 1985. This 20 storey high building is known as \\"WISMA PERTAHANAN\\" and provides office space and meeting rooms. The area around \\"WISMA PERTAHANAN\\" known as the Defence Complex also provides facilities such as multi-storey car park building, auditorium, prayer room, Field of Defence (Parade Ground), guard stations, towers, computer room, 'helipad', cafeteria and others.

It is composed primarily of petroleum distillates, including mineral oil (60‚Äì100%), mineral spirits (10‚Äì30%), tricresyl phosphate (an antiwear and extreme pressure additive in lubricants, 0.1‚Äì1.0%), ortho-dichlorobenzene (a softening and removing agent for carbon- based contamination on metal surfaces, 0.1‚Äì1.0%), and para-dichlorobenzene (a precursor used in the production of chemically and thermally resistant polymers, <0.1%). Origin The Marvel Oil Company (also known as Marvel Carburetor Company; Marvel-Schebler Carburetors since 1928) was founded by Burt Pierce in 1923. After World War I, the company produced carburetors for automobiles and aircraft. Some of these encountered problems with clogged jets, prompting Pierce to formulate a blend of chemicals and petroleum to clean and maintain them. Marvel claims the oil creates a top ring seal producing higher compression, preventing blow-by on power strokes, resulting in more power. Supporting evidence is not provided. The Marvel Oil Company was initially based in Chicago, moved to New York in 1941 and was purchased by Turtle Wax Inc. in 1999, returning to Chicago. According to the company, the name Mystery Oil comes from Pierce's answer to the question, \\"what kind of oil is this?\\" to which Pierce would respond, \\"It's a mystery!\\"  Composition  According to the company's 2015 safety data sheet Marvel Mystery Oil is composed of: * Petroleum distillates (hydrotreated heavy naphthenic) also known as mineral oil, 60‚Äì100% * Petroleum distillates (Stoddard solvent) also known as white spirit, 10‚Äì30% * Tricresyl phosphate, an antiwear and extreme pressure additive in lubricants 0.1‚Äì1.0% * Ortho-dichlorobenzene, a softening and removing agent for carbon-based contamination on metal surfaces, 0.1‚Äì1.0% * Para-dichlorobenzene, a precursor used in the production of chemically and thermally resistant polymers, <0.1% In an NTSB post aircraft accident investigation published in 2003, it was reported that Marvel Mystery Oil was composed of 74 percent mineral oil, 25 percent stoddard solvent, and 1 percent lard., but failed to mention any other trace chemical components.  Claims  Marvel Mystery Oil marketing literature claims benefits which include improved lubricating qualities, primarily cleaning and friction reduction capabilities. The product has previously been marketed as a fuel additive in all kinds of engines, including aircraft (although the company no longer markets it for the latter application on their website). It has also been used as an oil additive, corrosion inhibitor, penetrating oil, and in automatic transmissions as a leak stopper and seal relubricator. Supporting evidence for claimed benefits is not provided by the manufacturer. The lubricant was used as a fuel additive in a Lycoming aircraft engine which was specifically cautioned against oil additives (Service Instruction No. 1014M, which also stated its use would void the warranty) which suffered catastrophic damage during take- off. The NTSB listed the probable cause of the accident as \\"The improper use of [a] fuel additive which resulted in a power loss.\\" Auto manufacturers Ford and GM recommend against using engine oil additives, stating they are unnecessary in their contemporary engine designs and may void their warranties.

Lying just to the north and east of Jordanelle Reservoir along Utah State Route 248 (SR-248), the town was incorporated in 2008 under a short-lived state law. The population was 656 at the 2010 census. Geography Looking south at the Jordanelle Reservoir from Utah State Route 248 in Hideout, April 2016 Hideout lies about east-southeast of Park City, in an area of the Wasatch Mountains known for its ski resorts and other upscale recreation. The Hideout town boundaries extend from the Todd Hollow Apartments, at the northernmost point of Jordanelle Reservoir, south and east along SR-248, running past the submerged ruins of the ghost town of Keetley. It stops just at the Summit County line, some west-southwest of Kamas. The town includes the luxury planned communities of Hideout Canyon and Soaring Hawk, both still under development. Climate This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to Weather.com, Hideout experiences an average daytime high temperature of 87 degrees in July. The highest recorded temperature was 101 ¬∞F in 2002. December is the average coolest month. The lowest recorded temperature was -31 ¬∞F in 1990. October is the average wettest month, with 1.76 inches of precipitation. History In 2005, Mustang Development company and Wasatch County entered into a development agreement to develop Hideout Canyon. In 2007, Mustang successfully lobbied the Utah State Legislature to pass H.B. 466. This bill, backed by the Utah League of Cities and Towns and passed unanimously by the Legislature, amended the state law on petitions to incorporate a town. The new provisions allowed a petition for a new town with 100‚Äì999 residents to be filed with just the signatures of the owners of a majority of the land area, even a single majority landowner. There was no requirement to ask the residents' consent. If the petition met the conditions of state law and its signers owned the majority of the land by value, the new law required the county government to grant the petition and appoint a mayor and town council from a list of individuals approved by the petitioners. In July 2007 Ruby's Inn, in Garfield County, became the first to take advantage of the new law, incorporating as Bryce Canyon City. A petition to incorporate Hideout was filed in November 2007 by Richard Sprung, a real estate agent for Hideout Canyon. By then two other such petitions were pending in Wasatch County: Aspen (ultimately unsuccessful) and Independence. In February 2008, the Wasatch County Council voted to allow the Todd Hollow Apartments, home to the vast majority of the proposed town's population, to opt out of the incorporation plan, citing a state law permitting \\"non-urban\\" properties to opt out. The Council then denied the petition for insufficient population. By March 2008, the Legislature had amended the law again, unanimously passing H.B. 164, which required a petition for incorporation to have the support of half the residents, and provided for an elected mayor and town council. There must also be at least five petition sponsors, who were not allowed themselves to own more than 40 percent of the land. An effort to make the new law retroactive failed, and petitions filed under H.B. 466 went forward. Sprung sued in state court, insisting that Todd Hollow was obviously urban. The court ruled in Sprung's favor, ordering the county to grant the petition. The County Council voted to grant Hideout incorporation in June 2008. Demographics At Hideout's incorporation, the Utah Population Estimates Committee produced an official population estimate of 820. Most of the town's residents live in the Todd Hollow Apartments, with luxury homes scattered between Todd Hollow and the Hideout Canyon development. As of the census of 2010, there were 656 people living in the town. The racial makeup of the town was 46.0% White, 1.1% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.5% Asian, 51.5% from some other race, and 0.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 77.0% of the population, making Hideout one of two Utah municipalities (along with Wendover) that are \\"majority minority\\". There were 217 housing units, of which 191 were occupied. Only 6 of these units, with a total of 16 residents or 2.4% of the population, were owner-occupied. In the 2017 election for Hideout town council, a total of 177 votes were cast.

Museum caption Prior to July 2012, Yad Vashem affixed the following caption, in English and Hebrew, to two photographs of Pius XII in its Jerusalem memorial: > In 1933, when he was Secretary of the Vatican State, he was active in > obtaining a Concordat with the German regime to preserve the Church's rights > in Germany, even if this meant recognizing the Nazi racist regime. When he > was elected Pope in 1939, he shelved a letter against racism and anti- > Semitism that his predecessor had prepared.

In December 1942, he abstained from signing the Allied > declaration condemning the extermination of the Jews. When Jews were > deported from Rome to Auschwitz, the Pope did not intervene.

An excerpt follows: :The Israeli newspaper Haaretz provided some excerpts from the revised language. The new text cites the pope's defenders, who maintain that his \\"neutrality prevented harsher measures against the Vatican and the Church's institutions throughout Europe, thus enabling a considerable number of secret rescue activities to take place at different levels of the Church.\\" However, \\"until all relevant material is available to scholars, this topic will remain open to further inquiry,\\" the new text reads. Nominations as Righteous among the Nations Yad Vashem was created by the Knesset in 1953. The nominations process for designation as Righteous among the Nations has been administered by a committee chaired by a justice of the Supreme Court of Israel since 1963. Dr. Arieh Kubovy, an early chairman of the Yad Vashem Memorial authority, was somewhat at odds with Pius XII over his unsuccessful attempts to induce the pope to effect the return of Jewish children baptized during the Holocaust by Catholic institutions.New York Times. 1966, May 18. \\"Dr. Arieh Kubovy dies at 69\\". p. 46. Nominations may only be made by Jews and may not concern the rescue of Jews converted to Catholicism during the Holocaust. The honor has been extended to two of Pius XII's nuncios: Angelo Rotta (in Hungary) and Andrea Cassulo (in Romania). Rabbi David Dalin proposed such a nomination in his 2005 book The Myth of Hitler's Pope, but it is unclear if he himself made any formal nomination with Yad Vashem.Zenit. 2006, January 17. \\"Rabbi says Pius XII deserves 'Righteous' title \\". Sister Margherita Marchione, a religious who has written many books defending Pius XII against his critics, stated around the same time: \\"I have asked Yad Vashem to posthumously recognize and honor him as 'Righteous among the nations'\\", although as a non-Jew she would be unable to make such a nomination.Zenit. 2006, October 8. \\"Pius XII's massive crusade\\".

Just to the southeast of the young town of Daniel, Independence lies on a popular recreational corridor between Heber City and Strawberry Reservoir. History In 2007, the Utah State Legislature unanimously passed H.B. 466, a bill that amended the state law on petitions to incorporate a town. The new provisions allowed a petition for a new town with 100-999 residents to be filed with just the signatures of the owners of a majority of the land area, even a single majority landowner. If the petition met the conditions of state law and its signers owned the majority of the land by value, the new law required the county government to grant the petition and appoint a mayor and town council from a list of individuals approved by the petitioners. In July 2007 Ruby's Inn, in Garfield County, became the first to take advantage of the law, incorporating as Bryce Canyon City. A group of Wasatch County landowners led by developer Mel McQuarrie filed the first petition to incorporate Independence on October 12, 2007, but county officials denied it for an incomplete land survey. Some residents who would have been included in the original boundaries of the proposed town petitioned to be annexed into nearby Daniel, rather than be included in Independence. The incorporation petitioners re-filed on December 17, 2007. In its review of the second petition, the Wasatch County Council allowed some potential Independence residents to opt out of the proposal on February 6, 2008, then denied incorporation again on February 13, 2008, this time for insufficient population. By March 2008, the Legislature had amended the law again, unanimously passing H.B. 164, which required a petition for incorporation to have the support of half the residents, and provided for an elected mayor and town council. There must also be at least five petition sponsors, who were not allowed themselves to own more than 40 percent of the land. An effort to make the new law retroactive failed, and petitions filed under H.B. 466 went forward. Among those grandfathered in were the third Independence petition, which had been filed just before the repeal, as well as pending requests for the town of Hideout, also in Wasatch County, and Powder Mountain in Weber County. The Wasatch County Council finally granted the petition to incorporate Independence on April 2, 2008. Demographics At Independence's incorporation, the Utah Population Estimates Committee produced an official population estimate of 117. Many of the residents live on land that has been in their families for generations. As of the census of 2010, there were 164 people living in the town. There were 66 housing units. The racial makeup of the town was 98.2% White, 0.6% Asian, 0.6% from some other race, and 0.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 9.8% of the population.

Opened in 1896 by the Great Northern Railway of Ireland (G.N.R.) it extended some 8 Kilometres westward from the Dublin-Belfast mainline. It had one intermediate halt, at , and a large freight handling yard at Ardee. Never very prosperous, it suffered, like many branches, with the onset of the private motor car, and bus, and passenger rail services were withdrawn in 1934, although the occasional special served the line from time to time, there was never a regular passenger timetable on the line after that. Dromin Junction Station itself closed to rail passengers in 1955, but it remained in operation for rail staff to manage the Ardee line. However, it continued to enjoy brisk freight business, and this continued up until the early 1970s. With rail out of favour with the government of the day, the now state owned rail company C√≥ras Iompair √âireann (C.I.E.) phased out the freight service on the line, the last service being a special in October 1975. The line was 'mothballed' and was quickly disconnected from the mainline within a few years, although the official Abandonment Order was not effected until 1987. The rail tracks were lifted in the same year, and were still in good condition, having remained in situ since disconnection from the mainline. Today, little evidence remains of 'The Junction' although the trackbed itself has been largely retained, and is now a very scenic and easily walked public cross country walking track. The junction itself has been severed from the former branch by the Dublin-Belfast M1 Motorway, which cut through the trackbed in 2001.

From its establishment, it was the largest and senior-most of the themes, and its military governors (stratƒìgoi) were powerful individuals, several of them rising to the imperial throne or launching failed rebellions to capture it. The theme and its army played an important role in the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars of the 7th‚Äì10th centuries, after which it enjoyed a period of relative peace that lasted until its conquest by the Seljuk Turks in the late 1070s. Geography and administration In its \\"classical\\" form during the 8th and 9th centuries, the theme stretched over the ancient regions of Lycaonia, Pisidia, Isauria, as well as most of Phrygia and parts of Galatia Salutaris... Initially, the Anatolic Theme included the western and southern shores of Asia Minor as well, but by c. 720 they were split off to form the Thracesian and Cibyrrhaeot themes.. Under Theophilos (r. 829‚Äì842), its eastern and south-eastern portions, facing the Arab frontier zone and including the forts that guarded the northern entrance to the Cilician Gates, were detached to form two new frontier districts (kleisourai), those of Cappadocia (originally a division, or tourma, of the Anatolics) and Seleucia.. Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886‚Äì912) later ceded the region west of Lake Tuz (the banda of Eudokias, Hagios Agapetos and Aphrazeia) to Cappadocia. The theme's capital was Amorium, until the sack of the city by the Abbasids in 838.. After that, it was probably transferred to the nearby fortress of Polybotos. According to the 10th-century Arab geographers Qudama ibn Ja'far and Ibn al-Faqih, the Anatolic Theme, \\"the largest of the provinces of the Romans\\", fielded 15,000 men, and contained 34 fortresses. It and its military governor, or stratƒìgos, first attested in 690, ranked first in precedence among the theme governors. As such, the \\"stratƒìgos of the Anatolics\\" () was one of the highest in the Empire, and one of the few posts from which eunuchs were specifically barred. The holders of the post received an annual salary of 40 pounds of gold, and are attested as holding the senior court ranks of patrikios, anthypatos, and pr≈çtospatharios. In addition, they were the only ones to be appointed to the exceptional post of monostrategos (\\"single-general\\"), overall commander of the Asian land themes... History The exact date of the theme's establishment is unknown. Along with the other original themes, it was created sometime after the 640s as a military encampment area for the remnants of the old field armies of the East Roman army, which were withdrawn to Asia Minor in the face of the Muslim conquests. The Anatolic Theme was settled and took its name from the army of the East (Greek: , Anatolƒì)..; . The theme is attested for the first time in 669, while the army itself is mentioned, as the exercitus Orientalis, as late as an iussio of Justinian II in 687. Wars with the Arabs and the Turks During the wars with the Arabs in the 7th and 8th centuries, the Anatolic Theme‚Äîespecially Cappadocia, its easternmost region‚Äîwas frequently either a target of Arab invasions, or at the forefront of the Byzantine counter-raids into Arab territory, which began after the middle of the 8th century. The thematic capital, Amorium, was also a frequent target of the Arabs. It was attacked already in 644, captured in 646, and briefly occupied in 669. The Arabs reached it again in 708 and besieged it without success in 716, during their march on Constantinople.. The tide of the Arab attacks ebbed in the 740s, after the Byzantine victory at the Battle of Akroinon and the turmoil of the Third Fitna and the Abbasid Revolution, and under Emperor Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775), the Anatolics spearheaded the Byzantine campaigns into Arab-held territory. This in turn provoked the reaction of the Abbasid Caliphate, which in the quarter-century after 780 launched repeated invasions of Byzantine Asia Minor. Thus the Anatolics suffered a heavy defeat at Kopidnadon in 788, and Amorium was threatened again in 797. In the early years of the 9th century, Cappadocia was the focus of Arab attacks, which culminated in the great invasion of 806 led by Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786‚Äì809) himself, which took Heraclea Cybistra and several other forts. The Byzantine themes of Asia Minor in circa 842, showing the fragmentation of the large original themes into smaller circumscriptions. The late antique urban fabric suffered considerably from the Arab attacks and the concomitant decline of urbanization, but most of the cities in the interior of the theme, i.e. in Phrygia and Pisidia, survived, albeit in a reduced form. The cities of eastern Cappadocia (the former province of Cappadocia Secunda), however, which bordered the Caliphate, were practically destroyed, as was Antioch in Pisidia. The foundation of the new kleisourai along the eastern frontier, especially Cappadocia, in the 9th century, meant that Arab raids henceforth were absorbed there, and seldom reached the Anatolic Theme's territory. Apart from Caliph al-Mu'tasim's great invasion against Amorium in 838, attacks that penetrated into the Anatolics' territory are reported for the year 878, when the thematic troops successfully defended Mistheia, and again in 888, 894 and 897, always in the southeastern portion of the theme around Iconium. The 10th century was largely peaceful, with the exception of yet another sack of Amorium in 931 and a raid that reached Iconium in 963. The first Turkish attack on the theme is recorded in 1069, when the Turks attacked Iconium. Most of the province was overrun by the Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, with Iconium becoming the seat of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum in the 12th century.> The last appearance of the Anatolic Theme in the historical sources is in 1077, when its stratƒìgos, Nikephoros Botaneiates, proclaimed himself emperor (Nikephoros III, r. 1078‚Äì1081). The Byzantines managed to recover some of the western and northern portions of the theme in the subsequent decades under the Komnenian emperors, but the Anatolic Theme was never reconstituted. Rebellions solidus of Leo III the Isaurian and his son, Constantine V Directly facing the forces of the Caliphate during its first centuries of existence, and benefiting from its support of the Isaurian emperors, the Anatolic Theme was the most powerful and most prestigious of the themes. Its very power, however, also meant that it was a potential threat to the emperors: already in 669, the thematic army revolted and forced Constantine IV (r. 668‚Äì685) to re-install his brothers, Heraclius and Tiberius as his co-emperors, while in 695 a former stratƒìgos, Leontios (r. 695‚Äì698), usurped the throne from Justinian II (r. 685‚Äì695, 705‚Äì711), and in 717 the then stratƒìgos, Leo the Isaurian, became emperor (Leo III, r. 717‚Äì741) after deposing Theodosios III (r. 715‚Äì717). Henceforth, the Anatolics would be stalwart supporters of the Isaurians, including their iconoclastic policies, and in 742 Leo III's son and successor, Constantine V, found refuge and support in the theme against the usurper Artabasdos. The Anatolic Theme served as the base for several bids for the throne in later centuries as well: the failed revolt of Bardanes Tourkos in 803 was followed by the successful proclamation of Leo V the Armenian (r. 813‚Äì820) by the Anatolic troops in 813, and the large-scale rebellion of Thomas the Slav in 820‚Äì823. In the 10th century, however, the theme appears on the sidelines of the rebellions of the period. The next and last rebellion by a stratƒìgos of the Anatolics was that of Nikephoros Xiphias in 1022, against Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025).

The first Bah√° º√≠ in the Antipodes was Dorothea Spinney who had just arrived from New York in Auckland in 1912. Shortly thereafter there were two converts about 1913 ‚Äì Robert Felkin who had met  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in London in 1911 and moved to New Zealand in 1912 and is considered a Bah√° º√≠ by 1914There isn't a definite date Felkin is considered a Baha'i except before 1914 ‚Äì Arohanui, Introduction by Collis Featherstone. and Margaret Stevenson who first heard of the religion in 1911 and by her own testimony was a Bah√° º√≠ in 1913. After  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote the Tablets of the Divine Plan which mentions New Zealand the community grew quickly so that the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of the country was attempted in 1923 or 1924 and then succeeded in 1926. The Bah√° º√≠s of New Zealand elected their first independent National Spiritual Assembly in 1957. By 1963 there were four Assemblies, and 18 localities with smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s. The 2006 census reports about 2772 Bah√° º√≠s in some 45 local assemblies and about 20 smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s though the Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were some 7400 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005.  Beginnings  The first mention of events related to the history of the religion was a report in a Wellington newspaper in July 1846. These were reprints of an 1845 article in the London Times which relied on Muslim reactions to the new religion. In 1853 there was an event with caused great suffering on Bab√≠s ( who Bah√° º√≠s hold as a direct precursor akin to the relationship between John the Baptist and Jesus.) The Bab√≠s were blamed for an attempted assassination of the Shah of Persia. Recent scholarship has identified a fringe element distinct from all the major aspects of the religion, its community and leadership at the time.The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al Din Shah in 1852: Millennialism and Violence, by Moojan Momen, 23 March 2004 Nevertheless, coverage in newspapers at the time often echoed the Persian government's view blaming the Bab√≠s and Bab√≠s in large numbers were in fact executed as a result.* \\"English Extracts; Persia\\", New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian, p. 3 (near the bottom), 19 February 1853 * \\"Miscellany; How they punish treason in Persia\\", Daily Southern Cross, p. 4, (a bit up from the bottom), 22 February 1853 * \\"English Abstracts; Persia\\", New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian, p. 3, (near the middle), 19 March 1853 * \\"Miscellaneous; How they punish treason in Persia\\", New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian, p. 4, (near the bottom), 23 March 1853 * \\"English Extracts; Persian Heretics and Executioners\\", New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian, p. 3, (near the middle), 26 March 1853 * \\"Persian Heretics and Executioners\\", Otago Witness, p. 3, (from the top), 2 April 1853 Following this initial mention of incidents related to the religion there were several contacts between New Zealanders and Bah√° º√≠s at the beginning of the 20th century. New Zealander Wilhelmina Sherriff Bain may have met Sarah Jane Farmer, a notable Bah√° º√≠ in the United States, (see Green Acre) in 1904. Whoever her contact was, Bain authored a large detailed article in the Otago Witness published edition of 30 December 1908 about the religion. Other articles followed in 1909, 1911, and 1913. It is also known that letters were exchanged in 1910 between a Mildred Burdon of Geraldine and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Robert Felkin had met  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in London in 1911 and in 1912 moved to New Zealand where he helped found the Whare Ra.Edney, Ken. Dr. Robert William Felkim and the S.R.I.A.. From the website of the Felkin College of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, Napier, New Zealand. Retrieved 29 March 2007. Felkin wrote an article for a New Zealand publication which was published around then too. Meanwhile, Auckland resident Margaret Stevenson's sister living in the United Kingdom had sent her a copy of \\"The Christian Commonwealth\\" which had reported on  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s speech in London on 27 March 1911. In 1912 Stevenson rented a room to English Bah√° º√≠ Dorothea Spinney ‚Äì a traveling performer of Greek plays ‚Äì who had just arrived from New York via Auckland. Spinney's stay was probably brief as she is known to have been in New York in November 1912 and again in January 1913. Following learning from a Bah√° º√≠ first hand Stevenson decided to subscribed to Star of the West, an early major English publication of the religion, and officially accepted the religion in 1913. Though Felkin is more known for being involved with other interests, another early Bah√° º√≠, Maurice Chambers, counts Felkin as the Bah√° º√≠ through whom he learned of the religion and converted in 1914. Whoever converted first, there was at least one Bah√° º√≠ in New Zealand in 1912 and more shortly thereafter.  Growth of the community   ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916‚Äì1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention spreading the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in New Zealand and was written on 11 April 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 because of disruptions from World War I and the Spanish flu which strongly affected New Zealand and beyond. These tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on 4 April 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919. Chambers is known to have exchanged letters with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in 1919. Stevenson received a visit by Australian community founders John and Clara Hyde-Dunn in 1922 and again in 1923 and the New Zealand community quickly grew, including Stevenson's sisters Amy and Lilias. The community tried to form an Assembly without properly following procedure in 1923 or 1924. In 1924 Martha Root shared news that Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, had space to receive New Zealander Bah√° º√≠s undertaking pilgrimage. 1924 was also the year of the first pioneer from New Zealand when Nora Lee moved to Fiji from 1924 to about 1930. In 1925 Stevenson left with two other New Zealand converts as well as a contingent from Australia for a year-long trip on pilgrimage where they stayed some 19 days and then visited with the community of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the United Kingdom. The news journal Herald of the South was begun publishing for New Zealand and Australia during their voyage out of Auckland (transferred publishing to Adelaide Australia in 1931.) After receiving a compilation on forming Assemblies they then returned to New Zealand in December 1925. They also returned with some dust from the Tomb of Bah√° ºu'll√°h which was placed in New Zealand soil at Stevenson's home in a ceremony held on 14 February 1926. Later in 1926 the Bah√° º√≠s in Auckland were able to properly elect their first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly. In 1928 there were seven assemblies between New Zealand and Australia ‚Äì by 1939 the number of assemblies had reduced to 4 but the locations with Bah√° º√≠s increased to 17 and by 1940 the count of assemblies reached 19 while there were still 17 other locations with smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s. In 1931 Keith Ransom-Kehler also visited. In 1934 Bah√° º√≠s from Australia and New Zealand elected a regional National Assembly \\\\- there were three delegates from Auckland, three from Sydney and three from Adelaide. From 1934 to 1939 Stevenson served on the regional National Spiritual Assembly of Australia and New Zealand and then died shortly thereafter in 1941. In 1940 the community held its first season school. In 1947 Alvin and Gertrude Blum left the United States for New Zealand where they lived until 1953 when they pioneered and became Knights of Bah√° ºu'll√°h for the Solomon Islands. In 1948 the first person of MƒÅori descent to accept the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was Albert White, who was one quarter MƒÅori. In 1949 the first Persian Bah√° º√≠ pioneer, Manoochehr Ala ºi, arrived as a student at Massey College. In 1953 the first standing Hand of the Cause, the highest appointed position in the religion open to all, 'Al√≠-Akbar Fur√∫tan, visited New Zealand. In 1957 the New Zealand community held its first independent convention to elect its own National Spiritual Assembly with three delegates from Auckland and two each from Devonport, New Plymouth and Wellington. This convention elected the first National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand. In 1958 Hand of the Cause of God, Enoch Olinga visited the NgƒÅruawƒÅhia Marae and talked with elders and four years later, when Hand of the Cause of God, Dr Muhajir visited, Ephraim Te Paa, a Kaumatua (MƒÅori elder) from Ahipara converted to the religion. In 1963 with the election of the Universal House of Justice the Hands of the Cause updated and published a kind of census of the religion. At that time there were four assemblies -Auckland, Devonport, Hamilton, Wellington ‚Äì and 18 localities with smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s ‚Äì see maps. The story of one convert in 1964 includes her concern for her bi-racial children and despair at the bigotry of interracial marriage among the very minorities her children were members (she being Celt and married a MƒÅori) when she found this kind of marriage highly accepted among Bah√° º√≠s. The members of the National Assembly, who participated in the convention for the first election of the Universal House of Justice, were: Hugh Blundell, John Carr, Margaret Harnish, Linda Hight, Percy Leadley, Phyllis Milne, Jean Simmons, Douglas Weeks, and Terry Stirling. The New Zealand Bah√° º√≠ community came to the assistance of refugees in 1979 from the persecution of Bah√° º√≠s in Iran who were allowed to settle in New Zealand. Between 1987 and 1989, a further 142 Iranian Bah√° º√≠s settled in New Zealand.  Modern community  Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979, there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In the modern Bah√° º√≠ community of New Zealand the Bah√° º√≠s have multiplied their interests internally and externally. Aside from major themes there have also been individual work done in variety of topics ‚Äì for example post-traumatic stress syndrome. Additionally the community has continued to advocate with the New Zealand government to speak up on behalf of the persecuted Bah√° º√≠s in Iran.  Racism  In 1997 the Bah√° º√≠ community approached the Race Relations Conciliator with a project to honor the memory of Hedi Moani, an Iranian-born Bah√° º√≠ who worked to promote positive race relations. Discussions took place over many months and on 10 December 1998 (Human Rights Day), the Race Relations Office formally announced that Race Unity Day would be celebrated in New Zealand on 21 March each year. The first awards were in 2001. There are reviews of speeches in 2007, 2008, and 2009. National coverage of events with the police was affirmed in 2008. In addition to national-scale events various localities have had local competitions ‚Äì an example was the observance in Whangarei and Lower Hutt in 2009. In 2012 then 13-year-old Rima Shenoy submitted a video that won first place in the Race Unity Speech Awards of the New Zealand Police and the Bah√° º√≠s.  Development  As the Bah√° º√≠ community has grown in size and complexity it has also run into controversies and survived. In the 1980s there was a controversy about the status of women not being electable to the Universal House of Justice. In 1989 there was a controversy over the burial of a MƒÅori Bah√° º√≠, Pakaka Tawhai. Though the National Assembly had consulted with Tawhai's wife about burial, Pakaka's tribal family, the Ngati Porou, confronted the Bah√° º√≠s during the tangihanga, demanding to take his body back to Ruatoria. Ultimately they failed. Then member of the Universal House of Justice Peter Khan spoke at a conference in New Zealand in 2000, noting that the Universal House of Justice had received letters \\"written in distasteful language\\" from New Zealand ‚Äì he encouraged systematic education of children, application of a moral life, a serious study of the Covenant of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and study of the writings of Shoghi Effendi. Beyond controversies, the Bah√° º√≠s in New Zealand have broadened their interests both through individual initiatives and collective action. In 1991 an assembly was elected in the Kapiti Coast District. In 2000 two Bah√° º√≠ pioneers from New Zealand settled in Pitcairn Islands, one of the few nations on earth that had no Bah√° º√≠ presence. In 2006 Bah√° º√≠s helped dedicate the temporary Spiritual Centre at Middlemore Hospital. In 2007 Dunedin Bah√° º√≠s had been granted access to a community center. The Universal House of Justice called for a regional conference for the Bah√° º√≠s from New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Hawaii, Kiribati, New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu to be held in Auckland's Manukau City, on the sacred grounds of their marae, in 2008 and it came to pass in February 2009. The Bah√° º√≠ on Air television show is broadcast weekly on Auckland's Triangle TV which also covers the Cook Islands, American Samoa, and Adelaide, Australia. There has also been an independent documentary by a non-Bah√° º√≠ New Zealander exploring the religion in 2007. In 2011 Bah√° º√≠s participated in the community memorial for those who had died in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. It was mentioned in a review of spirituality in business in 2012. The community in Tauranga invited the Bah√° º√≠s to join their interfaith council.  Demographics  A 1999 report from the census bureau noted that of the citizens of New Zealand of Middle Eastern ethnicity, 4% were Bah√° º√≠ and 20% of the Bah√° º√≠s in New Zealand are members of some ethnic minority. The 1991 and 2006 New Zealand census reports about 2800 Bah√° º√≠s though the 1996 census listed just over 3100 Bah√° º√≠s. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 7400 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. There are more than 65 local Bah√° º√≠ communities around New Zealand, the large city communities have hundreds of members and assemblies, while some rural areas having groups of just two or three Bah√° º√≠s. About 46 are full-fledged assemblies. The religion was called a \\"mainstream religion\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. = Well known individuals = The Bah√°¬¥√≠ Association For the Arts and its publication Arts Dialogue has produced a lists of New Zealand Bah√° º√≠ artists, reviews of the shows and articles published dealing with New Zealand. The national assembly posted profiles of some Bah√° º√≠s in 2011. * Barry Crump was a writer of semi- autobiographical comic novels who travelled widely and became a Bah√° º√≠ about 1982. * Sheryl Davis works for a charitable trust focused on promoting economic development and tourism in the northern part of the country. * Russell Garcia ‚Äì Garcia is from Oakland, California and is a composer who has worked with major Hollywood artists and producers.Charmed Life: Shaynee Rainbolt Sings Russell Garcia Liner Notes ‚Äì This Bio Was approved by Russell Garcia and Gina Garcia in connection to their collaboration on Charmed Life: Shaynee Rainbolt SINGS Russell Garcia Garcia and his wife Gina have been members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith since 1955. In 1966 they set sail and ended up in the south Pacific when some musicians from Auckland, New Zealand invited Russell to do some live concerts, radio and television shows and to lecture at the various universities around the country on behalf of the New Zealand Broadcasting Commission and Music Trades Association. Russell, finished with his lectures and concerts and on advice of friends, drove up to the Bay of Islands in the north of North Island where they live. * Heather Simpson is a District Court judge, enrolled in the Bah√° º√≠ community in 1983. * Murray Robert Smith was a member of the New Zealand Parliament from 1972 to 1975.

At the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre, Murray served as Deputy Secretary General of the Bah√° º√≠ International Community, a role centred on developing the Bah√° º√≠ community's contributions to wider society.Bah√° º√≠ Institutions AND Global Governance An address given at the fiftieth anniversary celebrations of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of New Zealand, on 28 April 2007.

It opened with the theme park on June 7, 1990, and is a live show featuring at least three on- stage actors who comically instruct guests on Universal Pictures' legacy of horror movies. It was inspired by the former The Land of a Thousand Faces show at Universal Studios Hollywood. It is notable for being one of the two original attractions still in operation at Universal Studios Florida, the other being E.T. Adventure. Attraction summary=Queue The queue/pre- show area takes place inside a lobby within a recreation of the Pantages Theater. The lobby area includes multiple displays on Universal Horror films including Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Psycho, Jaws, The Thing, Van Helsing, Bride of Chucky, and An American Werewolf in London. The lobby also includes displays on the Universal Monsters, The Munsters and Universal Orlando Resort's Halloween Horror Nights. Multiple HD TV monitors display behind-the- scenes information of recent Universal Horror films including Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Van Helsing, King Kong and The Wolfman. After viewing the displays, guests line up and then enter the main theater. Main show Stage for the Universal's Horror Make-Up Show The show starts once everyone is seated. Then, one of the hosts, Alex Ross, (who can be either male or female) enters the stage and then tries to find his/her co-host, Mark James (or in the case of a female actor, Marty James). While Ross is looking around the stage for James, James appears entering the theater with a large knife dug into his heart. He mingles with audience members to \\"pull it out!\\" before \\"dying\\", and revealing to the audience that it is a fake. Sometimes, the actor/actress will ask for CPR instead. If they do not help, they suffer consequences later on. A montage of clips from the most gory scenes of Universal Horror films is then shown on screens hanging on the left and right sides of the theater. When the montage has ended, Ross and James explain that they need a volunteer. Ross picks the volunteer, who is always a foreign or older woman. Ross and James show her a pile of fake severed limbs which she piles up, discovering that one of them begins to move. Ross and James then use a fake knife which has a hook and a vat of fake blood which gives the appearance that it is cutting into one's skin on the woman. Before cutting the woman, Alex Ross will tell Mark James to talk to the kids. Depending on the actor/actress, they will either say \\"Don't drink beer for breakfast. Just because Mommy does it, doesn't mean it's okay. She only does that because she's stuck home alone with you all day. Well, till the cable guy comes by, then who knows.\\" and Alex Ross will interject and say a safety tip about the knives. If the actor/actress didn't say the previous line, they will immediately jump into saying \\"Also all the blades you see today are dull of course. Either that or they're made out of plastic, like The Kardashians. We never use sharp blades when doing special effects. Also, the people who set up the effects, when they aren't drinking, are very professional. So don't try this at home.\\" Alex will say to do it at your friend's house and then they will cut away at the woman. After the audience finds out it is fake, the woman returns to her seat. Some of the actors will walk around with one of the knives dug into their forehead and will usually crack on Walmart \\"Welcome to Walmart! Here's your cart!\\" in a funny voice. James then takes a fake heart out of a bucket and squirts fake blood (in this case, water ‚Äì which is usually cold) out at the audience. A short clip montage about Lon Chaney is then shown on the screens, with James describing his career, adding that \\"he didn't even reveal his secrets to his grandson, Dick\\". The montage goes on to describe Universal's make-up artist Jack Pierce, with Mark explaining how he created the designs for Universal's classic monsters including Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Wolfman, The Mummy, Bride of Frankenstein, and he usually adds to the list either Lady Gaga and Post Malone. After this, Alex Ross peeks behind the curtain and a car alarm goes off. Mark turns it off and asks what's going on. Alex picks on a kid in the front row and says that they threw a rock at the curtain. Mark messes with the kid and eventually tells the kid that \\"This ain't Disney World or the Magic Kingdom, I don't have to be nice to you here!\\" Afterwards, Mark asks what he was last talking about. Alex Ross mentions playtex. Depending on the actor, this next bit could go two ways. If you have one guy, he will show you what latex is and will also show you what playtex is. Others will just skip showing playtex, or may show playtex if it's in the drawer. A clip of creation of the make-up design for the title character in Universal's The Wolfman is then shown on the two screens in the theater. After that, Alex Ross says, \\"That's cool, tell us how you got to where you are.\\" Mark James explains how he got to where he is today and then mentions Rick Baker. They then list some of his movies he won an Oscar for and then another horror movie clip is shown from An American Werewolf in London. They ask the kids what movie it is (right at the beginning, before you see the 'wolf') and many will say E.T.. Mark James will say, \\"Right, there's E.T.! He's back and he's pissed!\\" After that, Alex will ask how the werewolf changing scene was done and they'll go over and show the change-o-heads and explain them. They'll usually crack on an audience member or talk about something related to them regarding the hair on the change-o-heads. Afterwards, a final clip is shown regarding how the transformation scenes in The Wolfman took place. For the finale, James reveals his secret horror movie effect; a motion capture vest which will control the movements of an animatronic named Eddie (who resembles \\"Scooby-Doo on steroids\\" as Mark James says). Mark James also mentions that he created Eddie to be the star of a children's show, the final episode of Dora the Explorer. He says that the motion capture vest is the same technology used to keep Ozzy Osbourne alive. When Ross refuses to wear the vest, the foreign/elderly woman volunteer from earlier in the show is chosen. After she controls the movements of Eddie with the vest, James takes a picture of her with Ross and the Eddie. However, right after James takes the picture, Eddie comes alive and chases James backstage. They are shown chasing each other with James ending it by sliding his bloody hand across the door window. When James recovers and comes back on-stage, he is bloody and bruised. He then hands the woman her picture, saying, \\"here's your freakin' picture\\". The show then concludes, and guests are required to exit from the right side of the theater. Post-show While exiting the theater, guests can view multiple pictures of Universal Horror movies hanging on the walls such as The Birds, Jurassic Park, and Psycho. They then exit into the Cyber Gear gift shop for the attraction Terminator 2: 3-D Battle Across Time. Previous versions Exterior of the show building The show and lobby featured numerous other reincarnations in the past. From 1990 until 1997, the lobby featured posters from old Universal Horror films and also had a live introduction from The Phantom of the Opera. The lobby was changed in 1997 to hold a video and various displays and props from The Lost World: Jurassic Park. In 2001, it was again re-vamped to hold displays and a video from The Mummy Returns. In 2004, the same refurbishment was done to add displays from Van Helsing. It was mostly recently re-vamped in 2008. The main show itself had some minor refurbishments in the past to fit the re-theming of the lobby. From 1990 until 2004, the main show would instead feature clips from Universal Horror films such as The Thing and An American Werewolf in London, and the woman would have her picture taken with The Phantom of the Opera. For the finale, James would step into a transportation device based on The Fly and would turn into the title character and then back into himself. He would then walk backstage with Ross, still having fly wings on his back. This version of the show was also introduced with a gunshot by James. It was slightly re-vamped in 1997 to instead have the woman get her picture taken with a dinosaur. In 2001, she and a person from her party would have their picture taken with The Mummy, and a clip about creation of the make-up effects from The Mummy Returns was also added. In 2004, the show was given a large re- vamping and was changed from this previous version. The lobby was again revamped in 2008, to include displays on various Universal Horror films up to Hellboy II: The Golden Army. In 2010, the show itself was again revamped to remove the Van Helsing clips which were replaced with clips from Universal's The Wolfman remake. In 2017, it was revamped to show clips from the recent \\"The Mummy\\" remake, replacing those from \\"The Wolfman\\". Inspirations The show itself was inspired by The Land of a Thousand Faces, a make-up show at Universal Studios Hollywood, which was opened in the park's Castle Theater in 1975 and was removed in 1980 and replaced by the Castle Dracula Live Show. It is possible that the Horror Make-Up Show may have been the inspiration for Halloween Horror Nights at the theme park, a Halloween event which has been run since 1991. During Halloween Horror Nights XI in 2001, the Horror Make-Up Show theater was used to house the show \\"Boogeymen\\", while in prior years, Horror Make-Up Show was run during the HHN event. 2002 incident In August 2002, a woman was pulled from the audience to participate in the show. After being frightened by one of the on-stage monsters, the woman fell off the stage in fear; she landed on the steps of the theater, breaking her leg. She was rushed to the hospital, and was released shortly afterwards without any further injuries.

In 2006 it had about 1,000,000 entries, and was expected to triple by 2009. The software was inspired by the September 11th terrorist attack on the United States of America. A memo that came out December 21, 2006 urged officials to put an aggressive plan into action to bring this database alive and current. In addition a committee was created to speed up the development of this database. since the development, local agencies can request access to this database, which will allow them to view federal, and other state police files. Many federal agencies contribute to this database which include the Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Prisons, ATF, and various other local agencies. This database also allows agencies to keep ownership of their files. Criticism The OneDOJ has run into some criticism. One person from the Civil Liberties Union said, \\"Raw police files or FBI reports can never be verified and can never be corrected.\\" Another concern is files and reports entered may have information on a person who hasn't been accused, arrested or charged. Security Concerns Many civil liberty organizations are concerned that the database is a privacy threat. The database includes information about suspects in federal cases, that local agencies get full access to. Another security concern was brought up, because false information could be entered into the database, possibly diminishing the persons record, or giving the police a false lead Officials say that all the information that is in the OneDOJ is already in another database that has a chance of being leaked, and the database is just making it easier for local agencies to come together to solve a crime.

In October 2009, APG II was superseded by the APG III system.Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (2009). An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 161(2): 105-121. In APG III, 11 of the genera listed above were placed in families, or else became families whose position within their orders was approximately or exactly known. The family Rafflesiaceae was placed in the order Malpighiales, close to Euphorbiaceae and possibly within it. Mitrastema became a monotypic family, Mitrastemonaceae. This family and Balanophoraceae were placed incertae sedis into orders, that is, their positions within these orders remained completely unknown. Metteniusa was found to belong to a supraordinal group known as the lamiids, which has not been satisfactorily divided into orders. Cynomorium was raised to familial status as Cynomoriaceae, and along with Apodanthaceae and Gumillea, remained unplaced in APG III. Five taxa were unplaced among the angiosperms in APG III because Nicobariodendron and Petenaea were added to the list. Leptaulus There is no apparent reason for the inclusion of Leptaulus in the list of unplaced taxa, other than the time lag between submission and publication. In 2001, in a phylogenetic study based on morphological and DNA data, Leptaulus was found to belong to a group of six genera that most authors now consider to be the family Cardiopteridaceae.Jesper K√•rehed. 2001. \\"Multiple origin of the tropical forest tree family Icacinaceae\\". American Journal of Botany 88(12):2259-2274. This was confirmed in a study of wood anatomy in 2008.Frederick Lens, Jesper K√•rehed, Pieter Baas, Steven Jansen, David Rabaey, Suzy Huysmans, Thomas Hamann, and Eric Smets. 2008. \\"The wood anatomy of the polyphyletic Icacinaceae s.l. and their relationships within asterids\\". Taxon 57(2):525-552. The genus is placed in the Cardiopteridaceae in the APG III system of 2009. Before 2001, Leptaulus and the rest of Cardiopteridaceae had usually been placed in a broadly circumscribed Icacinaceae, which turned out to be polyphyletic. Some botanists do not recognize Cardiopteridaceae as a family of six genera. Instead, they segregate Cardiopteris into a monogeneric Cardiopteridaceae sensu stricto and place the other five genera in the family Leptaulaceae.Timothy M.A. Utteridge and Richard K. Brummitt. 2007. \\"Leptaulaceae\\" pages 191-192. In: Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. Flowering Plant Families of the World. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007). The monophyly of Leptaulaceae has never been tested with molecular data. Pottingeria It had long been thought, at least by some, that the small Southeast Asian tree Pottingeria might belong in the order Celastrales.Herbert K. Airy-Shaw, David F. Cutler, and Siwert Nilsson. 1973. \\"Pottingeria, its taxonomic position, anatomy, and palynology\\". Kew Bulletin 28(1):97-104. In a phylogenetic study of that order in 2006, Pottingeria was found to be a member of the order, but not of any of its families. It was in an unresolved pentatomy consisting of Parnassiaceae, Pottingeria, Mortonia, the pair (Quetzalia + Zinowiewia), and the other genera of Celastraceae. When the APG III system was published in October 2009, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group expanded Celastraceae to include all members of the pentatomy mentioned above.Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards). Celastrales at Angiosperm Phylogeny Dipentodon Dipentodon has one species Dipentodon sinicus.Jinshuang Ma and Bruce Bartholomew. 2008. \\"Dipentodontaceae\\" pages 494-495. In: Zhengyi Wu, Peter H. Raven, and Deyuan Hong (editors). Flora of China volume 11. Science Press: Beijing, China; Missouri Botanical Garden Press: St. Louis, Missouri, USA. It is native to southern China, Burma, and northern India.Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. Flowering Plant Families of the World. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007). . In 2009, in a molecular phylogenetic study of the order Huerteales, it was shown that Dipentodon and Perrottetia belong together as the two genera of the family Dipentodontaceae.Andreas Worberg, Mac H. Alford, Dietmar Quandt, and Thomas Borsch. 2009. \\"Huerteales sister to Brassicales plus Malvales, and newly circumscribed to include Dipentodon, Gerrardina, Huertea, Perrottetia, and Tapiscia\\". Taxon 58(2):468-478. Medusandra and Soyauxia In 2009, in a molecular phylogenetic study of Malpighiales, Kenneth Wurdack and Charles Davis sampled five genera and one family that had been unplaced in APG II. They placed some of these for the first time and confirmed the previous placement of others with strong statistical support. In their outgroup, they included four genera from Saxifragales. These were Daphniphyllum, Medusandra, Soyauxia, and Peridiscus. In their phylogeny, Medusandra and Soyauxia formed a strongly supported clade with Peridiscus, a member of the family Peridiscaceae, the most basal clade in Saxifragales. Wurdack and Davis recommended that Medusandra and Soyauxia both be transferred to Peridiscaceae. Thus the monogeneric family Medusandraceae is subsumed into Peridiscaceae. Soyauxia had been found to be close to Peridiscus in another study two years before.Douglas E. Soltis, Joshua W. Clayton, Charles C. Davis, Matthew A. Gitzendanner, Martin Cheek, Vincent Savolainen, Andr√© M. Amorim, and Pamela S. Soltis. 2007. \\"Monophyly and relationships of the enigmatic family Peridiscaceae\\". Taxon 56(1):65-73. Wurdack and Davis also found that the family Rafflesiaceae and the genera Aneulophus, Centroplacus, and Trichostephanus belong in the order Malpighiales. Aneulophus Aneulophus consists of two species of woody plants from tropical West Africa.David J. Mabberley. 2008. Mabberley's Plant-Book third edition (2008). Cambridge University Press: UK. (see External links below). Wurdack and Davis found the traditional placement of Aneulophus in Erythroxylaceae to be correct. Its position within the family remains uncertain. Erythroxylaceae is a family of four genera. Erythroxylum has about 230 species. Nectaropetalum has eight species and Pinacopodium has two. No one has yet produced a molecular phylogeny of the family. Centroplacus Centroplacus has a single species, Centroplacus glaucinus, a tree from West Africa. It was found to be close to Bhesa, a genus that had only recently been removed from Celastrales. Bhesa was grouped with Centroplacus to become the second genus in Centroplacaceae. Bhesa consists of five species of trees from India and Malesia. Trichostephanus Trichostephanus has two species, both in tropical West Africa. It had usually been assigned to Achariaceae, but it was found to be deeply embedded in Samydaceae.Mac H. Alford. 2007. Samydaceae. Version 6 February 2007. At The Tree of Life Project. Many taxonomists do not recognize Samydaceae as a separate family from Salicaceae. Rafflesiaceae Several genera have been removed from Rafflesiaceae, so that it now consists of only three genera: Sapria, Rhizanthes, and Rafflesia. All of these are holoparasites and, as discussed below, finding their relationships by molecular phylogenetics has presented special challenges. Rafflesia and its relatives were the subject of several papers from 2004 to 2009, and as the world's largest flower, Rafflesia has attracted special interest. In 2009, Wurdack and Davis confirmed earlier work in which it was found that Rafflesiaceae is nested within Euphorbiaceae sensu stricto, a circumscription of Euphorbiaceae that excludes Phyllanthaceae, Picrodendraceae, Putranjivaceae, Pandaceae, and a few other very small groups that had been included in it until the 1990s.Charles C. Davis, Maribeth Latvis, Daniel L. Nickrent, Kenneth J. Wurdack, and David A. Baum. 2007. \\"Floral Gigantism in Rafflesiaceae\\". Science 315(5820):1812. In order to preserve Rafflesiaceae, Wurdack and Davis split Euphorbiaceae sensu stricto into Euphorbiaceae sensu strictissimo and Peraceae, a new family comprising Pera and four other genera. Parasites Four of the unplaced genera, and all three of the unplaced families of APG II consist of achlorophyllous holoparasites. In these, the chloroplast genes that are usually used in phylogenetic studies of angiosperms have become nonfunctional pseudogenes. If these evolve rapidly, they may be saturated with repeated mutations at the same site and consequently not be useful for phylogenetic reconstruction. The relationships of some parasitic taxa have been elucidated in studies of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences. But these sequences sometimes produce artifactual topologies in the phylogenetic tree, because horizontal gene transfer often occurs between parasites and their hosts.Daniel L. Nickrent, Albert Blarer, Yin-Long Qiu, Romina Vidal-Russell, and Frank E. Anderson. 2004. \\"Phylogenetic inference in Rafflesiales: the influence of rate heterogeneity and horizontal gene transfer\\". BMC Evolutionary Biology 4:40. Bdallophyton and Cytinus The parasitic genera Bdallophyton and Cytinus have been found to be closely related and have been placed together as the family Cytinaceae. On the basis of mitochondrial DNA, Cytinaceae has been placed in Malvales, as sister to Muntingiaceae.Daniel L. Nickrent. 2007. \\"Cytinaceae are sister to Muntingiaceae (Malvales)\\". Taxon 56(4):1129-1135. Mitrastemon The parasitic family Mitrastemonaceae has one genus, known either as Mitrastemon or Mitrastema. The genus name and the corresponding family name have been a source of much confusion.Mitrastemonaceae at Parasitic Plant Connection website A phylogeny based on mitochondrial genes places Mitrastemon in the order Ericales, but this result had only 76% maximum likelihood bootstrap support.Todd J. Barkman, Joel R. McNeal, Seok-Hong Lim, Gwen Coat, Henrietta B. Croom, Nelson D. Young, and Claude W. de Pamphilis. 2007. \\"Mitochondrial DNA suggests at least 11 origins of parasitism in angiosperms and reveals genomic chimerism in parasitic plants\\". BMC Evolutionary Biology 7:248. Hoplestigma Hoplestigma consists of two species of African trees, notable for their large leaves, up to 55 cm long and 25 cm wide.Richard K. Brummitt and Martin R. Cheek. 2007. \\"Hoplestigmataceae\\" page 167. In: Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. Flowering Plant Families of the World. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007). It is usually placed by itself in the family Hoplestigmataceae which is thought to be related to Boraginaceae.Joan W. Nowicke and James S. Miller. 1989. \\"Pollen morphology and the relationships of Hoplestigmataceae\\". Taxon 38(1):12-16. In 2014, a phylogeny of Boraginaceae was published in a scientific journal called Cladistics.Maximilian Weigend, Federico Luebert, Marc Gottschling, Thomas L.P. Couvreur, Hartmut H. Hilger and James S. Miller. 2014. \\"From capsules to nutlets ‚Äî phylogenetic relationships in the Boraginales\\". Cladistics 30(5):508-518. . By comparing the DNA sequences of selected genes, the authors of that study showed that Hoplestigma is related to members of Boraginaceae subfamily Cordioideae, and they recommended that Hoplestigma be placed in that subfamily. Other authors have suggested that, while Hoplestigma is the closest relative of Cordioideae, it should perhaps not be placed within it.Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards), Missouri Botanical Garden. Angiosperm Phylogeny. Metteniusa Metteniusa consists of seven species of trees in Central America and northwestern South America. Ever since Hermann Karsten proposed the name Metteniusaceae in 1859, some authors have placed Metteniusa by itself, in that family.Gustavo Lozano-Contreras and Nubia B. de Lozano. 1988. \\"Metteniusaceae\\". Monograph 11. In: Polidoro Pinto and Gustavo Lozano- Contreras. (editors). \\"Flora de Colombia\\". Instituto de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Nacional de Colombia: Bogota, Colombia. Most authors, however, placed it in Icacinaceae until that family was shown to be polyphyletic in 2001. In 2007, in a comparison of DNA sequences for three genes, it was found that Metteniusa is one of the basal clades of the lamiids. The authors recommended that the family Metteniusaceae be recognized.Favio Gonzalez, Julio Betancur, Olivier Maurin, John V. Freudenstein, and Mark W. Chase. 2007. \\"Metteniusaceae: an early-diverging family in the lamiid clade\\". Taxon 56(3):795-800. Nothing is yet known about relationships among the groups of basal lamiids. The groups in this polytomy include the order Garryales, the families Icacinaceae, Oncothecaceae, and Metteniusaceae, as well as some unplaced genera, including Apodytes, Emmotum, and Cassinopsis. No phylogenetic study has focused on the lamiids, but phylogenies have been inferred for the asterids, a group composed of Cornales, Ericales, the lamiids, and the campanulids.Dirk C. Albach, Pamela S. Soltis, Douglas E. Soltis, and Richard G. Olmstead. 2001. \\"Phylogenetic analysis of Asterids based on sequences of four genes\\".

For a long time, Cynomorium was usually included in this family, but it is now known to be unrelated. In 2005, Balanophoraceae was shown to be in the order Santalales, but its position within that order has not been determined.Daniel L. Nickrent, Joshua P. Der, and Frank E. Anderson. 2005. \\"Discovery of the photosynthetic relatives of the \\"Maltese Mushroom\\" Cynomorium\\". BMC Evolutionary Biology 5:38. Two researchers in Taiwan announced on the internet in 2009 that they have results supporting the placement of Balanophoraceae in Santalales.Huei-Jiun Su and Jer-Ming Hu. \\"The phylogenetic relationships of Balanophoraceae and related Santalales inferred from floral B homeotic genes and nuclear 18S rDNA sequences\\". no date. no publisher. They have yet to publish anything in a scientific journal. Cynomorium Many names have been published in Cynomorium,Cynomorium at International Plant Names Index but there are probably only two species.Cynomorium At: List of Genera It is not closely related to anything else, so it is placed in the monogeneric family Cynomoriaceae. Attempts to find its closest relatives have demonstrated with special clarity that molecular phylogenetics is not a sure-fire, problem-free method of determining systematic relationships. One study placed it in Saxifragales, but not at any particular position within that order. Doubts have been expressed about the results of this study. Another study placed Cynomorium in Rosales based on analysis of the two invert repeat regions of the chloroplast genome, which evolve at one fifth the rate of the two single copy regions.Zhi-Hong Zhang, Chun-Qi Li, and Jianhua Li. 2009. \\"Phylogenetic placement of Cynomorium in Rosales inferred from sequences of the invert repeat region of the chloroplast genome\\".

A 2007 article on Simaroubaceae contains a list of the genera in the family. Gumillea is not on that list, but the authors do not provide a list or section on excluded genera.Joshua W.

It is worth noting that on their plate for Gumillea, Ruiz and Pav√≥n showed 11 ovules or immature seeds that had been extracted from a 2-locular ovary. But the ovary in Picramnia has (sometimes 2), usually 3 to 4 locules and there are always two ovules in each locule. It might be possible to determine the affinities of Gumillea if DNA could be extracted from the existing specimen. DNA has been successfully amplified from specimens of similar age.Katarina Andreasen, Mariette Manktelow, and Sylvain G.

He flew 212 combat missions and was shot down near the end of the war. He was so badly burned that he was given next to no chance to live. Surviving, he returned to full flight status, flying the SR-71 Blackbird. Major Shul completed a 20-year career in the Air Force. He has written four books on aviation and runs a photo studio in Marysville, California.http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/brian_shul.htm Biography Brian Shul was born in Quantico, Virginia, in 1948. He graduated from Radford High School in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1966 and from East Carolina University in 1970 with a degree in history. That same year he joined the Air Force and attended pilot training at Reese AFB in Texas. Vietnam war Shul served as a Foreign Air Advisor in the Vietnam War, flying 212 close air support missions in conjunction with Air America. Near the end of hostilities in 1973, his T-28 aircraft was shot down in the vicinity of the Cambodian border. Unable to eject from the aircraft, Shul was forced to crash land into the jungle. Surviving the initial impact of the crash, he suffered severe burns in the ensuing fireball. Crawling from the burning wreckage and surviving in hostile territory with extensive wounds for more than a day, he was able to find a secure location to camouflage and hide himself. Enemy patrols were still close and looking for him, with soldiers walking to within a few yards distance, although he was unsure of his judgement and thought they were hallucinations. The rescue mission did not start immediately due to his precise location being unknown in addition to having a high number of enemy soldiers nearby and heavy jungle cover overhead. Using a combination of resources, the general area he was in was later identified and it was confirmed that no body was present at the crash site. Upon activating his radio and confirming his identity and his general location, an aerial search was initiated. Shul did not know his precise location, but he did know the approximate grid he was located within, so the search continued until his exact location was determined by him being able to see American aircraft. The only practical way to recover the injured Shul would be by helicopter; and as it would likely be under fire from the enemy, Air Force Special Operations Command Pararescue teams were selected for the operation. Although the original plan was to extract Shul quietly without the enemy noticing, the operation quickly turned into an openly hostile mission. Nearby enemy patrols were driven back by the rescue teams using small arms, while larger groups of enemies or search parties were handled with heavy weapon outfitted operators or operators acting as forward air control. Once Shul was located, the team provided immediate medical treatment to ensure that the extraction would not result in further wounds or make his existing wounds worse. Medical treatment continued aboard the evacuation helicopter and at a nearby American base. No American casualties occurred in the operation. Once he arrived at the military hospital in Okinawa, doctors believed he would not survive his burns. Following two months of intensive care, he flew to the Institute of Surgical Research at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. During the following year, he underwent 15 major operations. Physicians told him he'd never fly again. Months of physical therapy followed, enabling Shul to eventually pass a flight physical and return to active flying duty. Post Vietnam Two days after being released from the hospital, Shul was back flying Air Force fighter jet aircraft. He went on to fly the A-7D, and was then selected to be a part of the first operational A-10 squadron at Myrtle Beach, SC, where he was on the first A-10 air show demonstration team. After a tour as an A-10 Instructor Pilot at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, he went on to instruct at the Air Force's Fighter Lead-In School as the Chief of Air-to-Ground Academics. As a final assignment in his career, Shul volunteered for and was selected to fly the SR-71. This assignment required an astronaut-type physical just to qualify, and Shul passed with no waivers. Shul's comeback story, from lying near dead in the jungle of Southeast Asia to later flying the world's fastest, highest flying jet, has been the subject of numerous magazine articles. Shul also made an Air Force safety video titled \\"Sierra Hotel\\" (with the title referring to the phonetic alphabet code for the military aviator slang expletive \\"Shit Hot\\") where he described his crash ordeal in explicit detail in order to motivate other USAF pilots to be more safety conscious and teaching them how to better survive such incidents. After 20 years and 5000 hours in fighter jets, Shul retired from the Air Force in 1990 and went on to pursue his writing and photographic interests. In addition to running his own photo studio in northern California, he has authored seven books on flying and flight photography. His first two books (Sled Driver: Flying The World's Fastest Jet and The Untouchables) are about flying the SR-71 Blackbird and give the reader a first-hand account of being in the cockpit of the world's fastest jet. Shul's third and fourth books are about America's air demonstration teams, the Navy Blue Angels, in Blue Angels: A Portrait of Gold, and the Air Force Thunderbirds, in Summer Thunder and contain aerial images which take the reader into the dynamic formations of these world-famous teams. In 1997, Shul released his fifth book, Eagle Eyes : Action Photography from the Cutting Edge, which is a collection of his in-flight photos. He has also released special, revised editions of both Sled Driver and The Untouchables. Shul has spoken at numerous functions nationwide on his experiences.http://www.wvi.com/~sr71webmaster/brian_shul.htm Shul has also been honored as an Outstanding Alumnus from East Carolina University. He owns Gallery One, a photo studio in northern California, and divides his time between writing, photography, public speaking, and backpacking in the high Sierra.https://galleryonepublishing.com Shul has a legendary story of the SR-71 being the end of a ground speed check over radio one-upmanship with the smug pilot of an F/A-18 Hornet.

The new company entered administration in 2011, and 15 branches were acquired by Poundstretcher.  History  At the end of 2008 Woolworths Plc, the parent company of the Woolworths stores, was in financial trouble, and went into administration at the beginning of 2009. All of the Woolworths high street stores in Britain were then closed. During the demise of the company, Tony Page, former commercial director at Woolworths, together with former UBS banker Gareth Thomas, put together plans to establish a new general retailer to fill the gap on the High Street left by the demise of Woolworths. A team was recruited, including Andy Latham, former Woolworths' Head of Store Concessions and Development. Latham later announced that he was starting Alworths (the store being named after Latham's initials) using funding from a wealthy relative. Page and Thomas announced that they were consulting their lawyers on courses of action against Latham. The first Alworths store opened in Didcot on 5 November 2009, 100 years to the day after the original opening of the first British Woolworths store. Over the following 12 months, the number of Alworths stores increased to 18. On 1 March 2011, Andy Latham resigned as a director of the board. Latham set up a new company called Retail Acquisitions Ltd, with the same registered office as Alworths, prompting speculation that a pre-pack administration was being contemplated. On Monday 28 March 2011 Alworths was placed into administration, with many stores no longer selling music, games or even pick n mix. A policy of no returns came into effect. By 25 April at least five stores had closed, including all the company's shops in Scotland. On 5 May 2011, it was announced that the entire Alworths business had been bought by Poundstretcher who were acquiring 15 Alworths branches. Those not acquired were Llandudno and Evesham, but the Evesham store was acquired by Poundland., while the Llandudno store became Sainsbury's Local Another in Amersham had already closed in 2010.  Legal action  In October 2009 it was announced that Latham had secured funding from a family member for a new company which would not involve Page or Thomas. Page said that as a result, he and Thomas were talking to their lawyers. In the end, Page and Thomas did not pursue legal action as the business did not succeed. In addition to legal action threatened by Page and Thomas, on 30 October 2009, it was announced that Woolworths brand owner Shop Direct had written to Alworths to demand that it cease from \\"using a name and a product mix and trading off the back of the goodwill of the Woolworths business\\". Shop Direct subsequently decided against legal action.  Stores  An Alworths storefront in place of a previous Woolworths installation, April 2010 Alworths' store openings were: * Didcot in Oxfordshire on 5 November 2009 (relocated August 2010) * Warminster in Wiltshire on 20 November 2009 * Amersham in Buckinghamshire on 12 November 2009 (not taken over) * Evesham in Worcestershire on 19 November 2009 (not taken over, but instead taken over by Poundland.) * Wokingham in Berkshire on 26 November 2009 * Cosham in Hampshire on 12 February 2010 * New Milton in Hampshire on 21 May 2010 * Cupar in Fife on 16 June 2010 * Forfar in Angus on 18 June 2010 * Alloa in Clackmannanshire on 21 July 2010 * Llandudno in Conwy on 13 August 2010 (not taken over) * Tiverton in Devon on 25 August 2010 * Swadlincote in Derbyshire on 8 September 2010http://www.thisisbusiness-eastmidlands.co.uk/derbyshire/Woolies- reopened/article-2557427-detail/article.html * Newhaven in East Sussex on 10 September 2010 * Hertford in Hertfordshire on 22 September 2010 * Newark in Nottinghamshire on 23 November 2010 * Maidenhead in Berkshire on 26 November 2010 * Bellshill in Lanarkshire on 27 November 2010 Other locations mentioned as possible were Lanark in Lanarkshire, and Faversham, Kent. The Didcot store opened on the 100th anniversary of the opening of the first Woolworths store in Britain, in the former Woolworths premises in Didcot, which had closed exactly eleven months earlier; many of the staff were former employees of Woolworths. At the Didcot opening, it was announced that a further 21 Alworths stores would open over the next year, including two others in Oxfordshire and 7 in Scotland. The Alloa branch, the tenth store to be opened (the third in Scotland), was the first not to be located in an old Woolworths store. The original Didcot branch closed on 8 August 2010 and the re-located branch, in the same shopping centre, opened on 14 August 2010. Amersham in Buckinghamshire closed on 12 September 2010. In early August 2010, Alworths store in Didcot closed and moved to a smaller store after the landlord refused to renew the one-year lease. The landlord initially hoped that Marks & Spencer (M&S;) would take over the store; however, in the end Curry's took over the lease as the store did not meet M&S;'s specifications. In the middle of August 2010, the landlord of another Alworths store in Amersham also refused to renew their one-year lease; however this time Alworths were unable to find another suitable premises in which to relocate which meant they had to leave the town. As of September 2014, this store is now a Waitrose. After the company entered administration, the Evesham store closed, and did not reopen after the purchase of the company by Poundstrecher. That point marked the closure of the first three stores that Alworths had opened. On 7 March 2011 the Llandudno branch was closed by the landlords for non-payment of rent; this store had been open for less than a year, and was already having a \\"closing down\\" sale.

It was founded in 1998 by Gitta Martl and her brother Albert Kugler in Linz, Austria.  History  Many Romani people and Sinti did not possess any documents after World War II. As they were not able to read nor to write, it was difficult for them to solve these buerocratic issues alone by visiting the responsible offices. The Ketani Association represented these interests for this minority living in Austria over centuries. One of the associations‚Äô tasks was to support and to look after its members by helping out with applications, search of accommodation or education. Furthermore, the Ketani Association looks after Romani refugees, mostly coming from the former Yugoslavia, who suffer from postwar-consequences. It represents the interests of Sinti and Romani people in public through interviews, radio broadcasts, television recordings, writing articles about specific topics i.e. the fate of Romani women in Upper Austria. Another field of tasks is taking care of camping places in the surrounding and especially consultation and conception of surrounding campsites for Sinti and Romani people, i.e. at Braunau in cooperation with mayor Gerhard Skiba. In 2006 the association produced the movie Ketani hei√üt miteinander. Sintiwirklichkeiten statt Zigeunerklischees von Ludwig Laher. Besides many cultural project which take place annually, the members of the association give lectures about Sinti and Romani people in Austria and report from own experiences of being part of the minority. An important point is the organization and participation at commemoration events for victims of the National Socialist Regime, for example Maxglan, Mauthausen and Lackenbach. In 2005 the soccer team ‚ÄúKetani Kickers‚Äù was founded. The Ketani Association design a radio broadcast monthly on Radio FRO in Linz. In these broadcasts interesting personalities are introduced, Romani and Sinti music is played and they talk about current happenings and projects of Ketani Association. In the last broadcast under the moderator Josef Gaffl, Gitta Martl and her daughter Nicole read from the book: ‚ÄúWe should not have existed‚Äù. The book was published at ‚ÄúGeschichte der Heimat; Franz Steinmassl‚Äù. It is the very first book about the history of Sinti published in Austria. In 2008 the book was translated in Japanese by Martin Kaneko.

Note the chain-grate automatic stoker (left) The Stirling boiler is an early form of water-tube boiler, used to generate steam in large land-based stationary plants. Although widely used around 1900, it has now fallen from favour and is rarely seen.  Design  Typical four-drum form Brick enclosure of a Stirling boiler in Queensland, Australia, originally fired on sugarcane bagasse. Chimney is to the right. Stirling boilers are one of the larger arrangements for a water-tube boiler: acceptable for stationary use, but impractical for mobile use, except for large ships with modest power requirements. They consist of a large brick-built chamber with a sinuous gas path through it, passing over near-vertical water-tubes that zig-zag between multiple steam drums and water drums. They are amongst the older, \\"large-tube\\" designs of water-tube boilers, having water-tubes that are around 3¬º inches (83 mm) in diameter. The tubes are arranged in near-vertical banks between a number of cylindrical, horizontal steam drums (above) and water drums (below). The number of drums varies, and the Stirling designs are categorized into 3-, 4- and 5-drum boilers. The number of tube banks is one less than this, i.e. 2, 3 or 4 banks. Gas flow from the furnace passes through each bank in turn. Partial baffles of firebrick tiles are laid on each bank, so as to force the gases to flow first up, and then down through each bank. Unusually, much of the gas flow is along the tubes' axis, rather than across them. All circulation, both up and down, is through the heating tubes and there are no separate external downcomers. The steam drums and, (in a 5-drum boiler) the water drums, are however linked by short horizontal pipes and these form part of the circulation circuit. The tubes themselves are seamless-drawn steel and mostly straight, with gently curved ends. The setting of the boiler is a large brick-built enclosure, but the steam drums are suspended from a separate girder framework inside this, so as to allow for expansion with heat. The tubes, and the water drums in turn, are hung from the steam drums, again to allow free expansion without straining the tube ends. Owing to their curved ends the water-tubes may enter the drums radially, allowing easy sealing, but this was also a feature considered, according to the fashion of the time, to be important on account of expansion. Stirling boilers may be made in very large sizes. It is usual for a standard design to be used, but in varying widths, according to need.  Superheaters  Where a superheater is fitted, it is installed as straight or hairpin tubes in the upper part of the boiler between the first two steam drums. The baffles direct the gas-flow through this area first, so it may reach the highest temperature.  Fuels  A wide range of fuels may be burned, aided by a large grate area that may easily be increased further, should a poor-quality fuel require it. The original boilers were developed to burn coal, but they have been used since to burn many sorts of wood or plant waste. A chain-fed automatic stoker may also be fitted, where a heavy firing rate is required. The three-drum form is also used as a heat- recovery boiler, using the exhaust gases from steelworks or other industrial processes.  Circulation  As the gas flow passes through each tube bank in turn, the later banks are at a significantly lower temperature. This encourages an \\"extremely efficient\\" circulation by the thermosyphon effect. Water level is maintained with the steam drums approximately half-full, so the tubes operate in the \\"drowned\\" state with their upper ends permanently submerged. Flow in the first bank is upwards as the tubes are heated, encouraged by their almost vertical position. Cooler water in the later water- tubes descends. Circulation is completed by the link pipes between the steam drums. Circulation is more active in the earlier, hotter circuits. In the four-drum form, circulation within the middle bank may be split between a descending circuit with the first bank and an ascending circuit with the following bank. = Feedwater = Feedwater is supplied to the final steam drum and distributed via an internal trough. The cold feedwater descends slowly through the last tube bank and into the last water drum. Any precipitable deposits (colloquially, \\"mud\\") will emerge from solution in this circuit and accumulate in the final water drum. This keeps them away from the more active early tube banks, reducing the problems and inefficiencies of scale build-up within the major heating tubes. Since the final water drum may also be used to catch the \\"mud\\" (i.e. a \\"mud collector\\"), it is sometimes known as a \\"mud drum\\".  Advantages  There are three advantages to the Stirling design: * Owing to the multiple passes through the tube banks and the careful arrangement of circulation and feedwater, the boiler is generally quite efficient. * The grate area may easily be varied without affecting the design of the water circuit. This allows the use of large grates for burning low-grade fuels, such as waste and refuse. Where an industrial process both required process steam and also generated combustible waste products, the Stirling boiler could use one to generate the other. This was commonly done in sugar refining, burning bagasse, or in paper pulp mills burning bark waste. The Stirling boiler was also used before World War II to burn domestic waste in cities, the steam then being used for power generation. (Emissions controls in later years made this burning of 'uncontrolled' waste impractical). * Finally, internal access to components is good for cleaning and maintenance. In particular, it is possible to replace individual water-tubes, without needing to dismantle an entire bank.  Disadvantages  * The boiler is physically large for its power. * Use of large diameter tubes restricts its ability to deal with high pressures, as other designs were beginning to do around this time. A working pressure of 150psi was adequate for driving a compound steam engine, but inefficient for a steam turbine. * The arrangement of tubes encouraged efficiency in the boiler, but not superheater temperature. Again, as developments moved away from piston engines in favour of turbines, this became a significant limitation.  Variations  Small three-drum form, furnace to the right Although broadly similar, variations with different numbers of tube banks are produced.  Three-drum or 'V' form  This simpler form is mainly used for low powers, or for heat-recovery from other furnace gases.  Four-drum or 'B' form  This is the main form of the boiler and gives efficient results with economical construction. The marine version of the boiler is also of this form.  Five-drum or 'W' form  This is a more complex form, which uses an extra tube bank to gain efficiency. It is most popular for large installations, such as power stations, or where efficiency is most needed so as to gain the maximum heating from a limited fuel capacity.  Marine Stirling boilers  Although generally a land-based boiler, the four-drum form was also used as a marine boiler, to power large ships. The brick-built setting was replaced with a box-like steel housing, lined with firebrick. The water-tube diameter was reduced to between . To avoid problems with the water levels shifting as the ship rolls, the water drums were arranged crosswise to the hull and provided with internal baffles.

Early life and career Paschal was born in County Cavan, Ireland. During his early life, he learned the Carpenter trade via an apprenticeship program. After emigrating to the United States, Paschal joined Local Union 608 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America in November 1957. Paschal McGuinness lives in Spring Lake NJ and Myrtle Beach, SC. Local 608 Tenure United Brotherhood of Carpenters Local Union 608 was organized in 1911, and dissolved in 2010. After working as a Carpenter and Superintendent for a number of years, Paschal was appointed Business Agent by Local 608 President, John O'Connor in the 1970s. Paschal eventually took over the role of Business Manager after Big John O'Connor moved to the NYC District Council of Carpenters. Eventually, when the District Council of Carpenters was coming out of trusteeship, Paschal ran against Big John O'Connor and won in 1984, a position he held until 1991. This effectively forced O'Connor to retire. Paschal held the position of President of the New York City District Council of Carpenters as well as President of Local Union 608. After having a RICO suit filed against him and the council, Paschal agreed to a Consent Decree with the US Government. Paschal was elected to office of Second Vice President in the United Brotherhood of Carpenters in Washington DC. The Consent Decree is still in effect with a Federal Judge and an Independent Investigator overseeing the operations of the NYC District Council, and its affiliated Local Unions. Local 608 Dissolved After years of trying to root out corruption, and having 5 Presidents (and other officers) in a 1-year period, the President of the United Brotherhood of Carpenter's, decided to dissolve Local Union 608 on December 14, 2010. From its beginnings in 1918, the Local served a mostly Irish community of carpenters, and is no more. NYC District Council Paschal was the managing trustee of the NYC District Council of Carpenters Benefit Funds when it purchased and renovated the new headquarters building at 395 Hudson Street in NYC at a cost that exceeded $120 million despite a $73 million appraisal.

History The Armeniac Theme was one of the four original themes, established sometime in the mid-7th century out of the territory of Lesser Armenia (also known as \\"Armenia Minor\\"). Although the mention of a \\"George, tourmarchƒìs of the Armeniacs\\" in 629, during the Persian campaigns of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610‚Äì641),. may suggest the existence of the theme at such an early date, the first unambiguous reference to it in literary sources occurs during the revolt of its general, Saborios, in 667/668.. It is next mentioned on a seal of 717/718.: \\"The inscriptions on the seals of the warehouses in the beginning of the 8th c. took the following forms: \\"the warehouse of Koloneia and Kamacha\\" (702-704), \\"of Koloneia, Kamacha and Armenia IV\\" (713-715), which finally became \\"of Koloneia and all the provinces of the Christ-loving Armeniakon\\" (717/8).\\" [Ragia, in footnote #78, is citing .] Together with the other themes, it was created from the remnants of one of the field armies of the old East Roman army following the disastrous defeats suffered during the first wave of the Muslim conquests, a process probably complete by the late 640s.. Thus, the army of the magister militum per Armeniae (the \\"Armeniacs\\") was withdrawn and settled in the areas of Pontus, Paphlagonia and Cappadocia, giving its name to the region.. The Byzantine themes of Asia Minor in circa 842, showing the fragmentation of the large original themes into smaller circumscriptions. The theme's capital was at Amaseia, and it was governed by a stratƒìgos, who ranked, together with the stratƒìgoi of the Anatolic and Thracesian themes, in the first tier of stratƒìgoi, drawing an annual salary of 40 gold pounds. In the 9th century, it fielded some 9,000 men and encompassed 17 fortresses. Its size and strategic importance on the Byzantine Empire's north-eastern frontier with the Muslims made its governor a powerful figure, and the theme's forces participated in several revolts in the 8th century. Consequently, in the 9th century it was broken up: the smaller provinces of Charsianon and Cappadocia were formed, first as kleisourai and later as full themes, along the border in the south and east, while in circa 819, the coastal themes of Paphlagonia and Chaldia were split off, followed later by the area of Koloneia (first under a doux, by 863 under a full strategos), leaving a rump Armeniac theme encompassing the western Pontus.; . The theme remained in Byzantine hands until the late 11th century. In 1073, however, following the disastrous Battle of Manzikert, Frankish mercenaries under Roussel de Bailleul seized control and governed the region for several months, until Byzantine authority was restored by emperor Alexios Komnenos.. Shortly after, the region was overrun by the Seljuk Turks, with only a few coastal forts holding out. The Komnenian emperors managed to recover the coastal regions for the Empire, but the Armeniac theme was not restored.

The company provides service, rentals, and consulting services. Kaeser Compressors, Inc. is a US affiliate of Kaeser Kompressoren headquartered in Coburg, Germany. History Carl Kaeser, Sr. founded the Kaeser organization as an engineering workshop that produced car and engine parts in 1919. Soon after, the factory was reconditioning engines, producing gears and building special purpose machines for the local glass industry. It wasn‚Äôt until the post-war need for compressed air in the rebuilding of Germany that the company began manufacturing and developing air compressors. The company grew rapidly after turning out its first reciprocating compressor in 1948, and by 1960 had outgrown its facility of 38 years and moved to a new location in Coburg, Germany. Under the leadership of Carl Kaeser, Jr., Kaeser engineers developed a rotary screw compressor that featured the \\"Sigma Profile\\" air-end in the early 1970s. The first compressor to incorporate the Sigma Profile was delivered in 1975. Now represented in every major industrialized country in the world, Kaeser established its first subsidiary in Switzerland by the late 1970s. The US subsidiary is the largest. Reiner Mueller started the US subsidiary in Fredericksburg, VA in 1982. Fredericksburg is near to several transport centers, and remains home to the US headquarters. The site includes a facility. Reiner Mueller retired in December 2008, and his son Frank assumed leadership in January 2009. Carl Kaeser, Jr., who started with Kaeser Kompressoren in 1937, worked until the day he died in 2009. Thomas Kaeser assumed leadership of Kaeser Kompressoren after his father, Carl, died at the age of 95. Kaeser‚Äôs manufacturing facilities in Europe consist of a group headquarters in Coburg, Germany that produces rotary screw, reciprocating, and portable compressors, and a plant in Gera, Germany that produces refrigeration dryers and rotary blowers. Also, the company has a sheet metal plant near Coburg in Sonnefeld. Sigma Profile Rotors When developing the Sigma Profile in the nineteen seventies, the Kaeser engineering team was faced with overcoming the disadvantages that previous screw designs presented to the market. Those previous designs included an energy-consuming symmetrical profile, and an asymmetric design introduced in 1962 that was an improvement over the symmetrical design but still consumed more energy than a reciprocating compressor. Kaeser engineers introduced the Sigma Profile with a five-to-six lobe asymmetrical design. The design required closer tolerances between the rotors and the housing, resulting in fewer air back-flow losses. Kaeser‚Äôs design philosophy remains to develop larger, slower running air-ends. Air-ends turning at slower speeds deliver more compressed air for the same drive power (up to 20% more efficient than conventional screw designs). Oil flooding at the point of compression provides cleaning, lubrication and cooling, which contributes to air-end efficiency. Sigma Profile air-ends are now found in a range of compressors from . Kaeser continues to refine and improve the air-end design up to 1000 hp. Production Kaeser's screw compressor rotors and air-end castings are created in climate-controlled environments. Precision milling machines mill the screw compressor rotors to fine tolerances, and CNC machining centers with pallet changing systems allow for 24-hour automatic machining of the air-end castings. A 3D coordinate-measuring machine automatically checks the critical dimensions of the air-end casing. CNC profile grinders finish the rotors to micrometre tolerances following solution hardening of the milled rotors within controlled atmosphere heat treating ovens.

Though he has never received any formal art training, he is internationally recognised as one of Australia's best wildlife artists. His art is collected both in Australia and internationally alike. www.paulmargocsy.com.au  Personal life  Margocsy was born in Melbourne in August 1945, and loved to draw from an early age. When he left school, he began window dressing at Myer in Melbourne, and was called for 2 years' conscript service in 1966, serving one year overseas in the army.http://www.jennypihanfineart.com.au/content.asp?p=artists%7CPaul%20Margocsy He went to England in 1971, and spent three years there travelling and working before returning to Australia and marrying in 1974. The same year, he began painting murals for children's nurseries. By 1978, he had made painting wildlife his specialty, and joined the \\"Wildlife Art Society of Australia\\" a few years later.http://www.artseymour.com.au/index.php?pr=Paul_Margocsy After research into ornithology, and through his own self-taught efforts and experimentation, he began to develop the skills he is admired for today. Margocsy and his wife have a son and daughter.  Art Style  Margocsy is renowned for the exceptional detail he paints in. He is often described as a fine painter, whose technical skill and artistry shine through in every piece he creates. His paintings are so lifelike that people have said that the viewer sees the bird, rather than the painting. Margocsy depicts an incredible amount of charm and personality in his subjects, along with the exquisite detail he is known for. Often, his paintings come with a whimsical \\"song like\\" name, that adds to the character of the painting itself.  Career  Since he first became engrossed in wildlife art in 1978, Margocsy has staged many exhibitions, and won many awards. Some of his achievements include: * Best Painting at the Wildlife Art Society of Australia exhibition (1986) * Best Watercolour exhibit at the Wildlife Art Society of Australia exhibition (1987) * Included in a book that presented 70 of the best living, traditional realist artists in Australia (1990) * Commissioned by Australia Post for a stamp issue of waterbirds (1991) * Staged a successful exhibition in London (1991) * A featured artist at Omell Galleries in London (1992‚Äì1993) * Best Painting at the Wildlife Art Society of Australia exhibition (1994) * Commissioned by the United Nations for an endangered species series released in Vienna (1994) * Paul released a book of his art to coincide with a solo show at the Landmarks Gallery in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (1994) * Successful solo exhibitions in Osaka, Japan (1996‚Äì1997) * Exhibitions at the prestigious Raffles Hotel in Singapore (1996 and 1998) * Paul has been chosen twice to exhibit at the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum \\"Birds in Art\\" show in the United States, as one of only 80 artists (from over 3500 entries) to be selected to tour for a year each.

The term is used to more clearly distinguish the target of inference from the function to obtain this parameter (i.e., the estimator) and the specific value obtained from a given data set (i.e., the estimate). For instance, a normally distributed random variable X has two variables, its mean \\\\mu and variance \\\\sigma^{2}. The variance estimator, s^{2} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\left. \\\\left( x_{i} - \\\\bar{x} \\\\right)^{2} \\\\right/ (n-1), yields an estimate of 7 for a data set x = \\\\left{ 2, 3, 7 \\\\right}; then s^{2} is called an estimator of \\\\sigma^{2}, and \\\\sigma^{2} is called the estimand.  Overview  An estimand is closely linked to the purpose or objective of an analysis. It describes what is to be estimated based on the question of interest. This is in contrast to an estimator, which defines the specific rule according to which the estimand is to be estimated. While the estimand will often be free of the specific assumptions e.g. regarding missing data, such assumption will typically have to be made when defining the specific estimator. For this reason, it is logical to conduct sensitivity analyses using different estimators for the same estimand, in order to test the robustness of inference to different assumptions.  Example  If our question of interest is whether instituting an intervention such as a vaccination campaign in a defined population in a country would reduce the number of deaths in that population in that country, then our estimand will be some measure of risk reduction (e.g. it could be a hazard ratio, or a risk ratio over one year) that would describe the effect of starting a vaccination campaign. We may have data from a clinical trial available to estimate the estimand. In judging the effect on the population level, we will have to reflect that some people may refuse to be vaccinated so that excluding those in the clinical trial from the analysis, who refused to be vaccinated may be inappropriate. Furthermore, we may not know the survival status of all those who were vaccinated, so that assumptions will have to be made in this regard in order to define an estimator. One possible estimator for obtaining a specific estimate might be a hazard ratio based on a survival analysis that assumes a particular survival distribution conducted on all subjects to whom the intervention was offered, treating those who were lost to follow-up to be right-censored under random censorship. It might be that the trial population differs from the population, on which the vaccination campaign would be conducted, in which case this might also have to be taken into account. An alternative estimator used in a sensitivity analysis might assume that people, who were not followed for their vital status to the end of the trial, may be more likely to have died by a certain amount.  ICH Interest  On October 22, 2014, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) produced a final concept paper titled Choosing Appropriate Estimands and Defining Sensitivity Analyses in Clinical Trials as an addendum to their E9 guidance. On 16 October 2017 ICH announced that it had published the draft addendum on defining appropriate estimands for a clinical trial/sensitivity analyses for consultation. The final addendum to the ICH E9 guidance was released on November 20, 2019. By providing a structured framework for translating the objectives of a clinical trial to a matching trial design, conduct and analysis ICH aims to improve discussions between pharmaceutical companies and regulators authorities on drug development programs. The ultimate goal is to make sure that clinical trials provide clearly defined information on the effects of the studied medicines.

This building used to be the palace of the Counts of Santiago de Calimaya, who were the descendants of one of the conquistadors with Cort√©s. The house was extensively remodeled to much the appearance that it has today and remained in the family until 1960, when the Mexico City government acquired it from them in order to found the Museum that is found there today. The museum contains a number of elements of the old palace as well as 26 rooms dedicated to the history and development of Mexico City from Aztec times to the present. It also contains a library and the studios of painter Joaqu√≠n Clausell, who lived here in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The building was completed in 1779 and the descendants of the counts lived in it until 1960. The architect that completed the palace was Francisco Antonio de Guerrero y Torres. Palace of the Counts of Santiago de Calimaya Frontal view of the courtyard from the upper floor. After the Conquest, Hern√°n Cort√©s divided land in Mexico City around the Zocalo among his fellow Spanish conquerors as a reward for their loyalty. This particular site was awarded to Juan Gutierrez Altamirano. Fernando Altamirano y Velasco, descendant of Juan Gutierrez Altamirano, inherited the structure in the early 17th century. He eventually gained the title of the first Count of Santiago de Calimaya by decree from Philip II of Spain in 1616. He and subsequent Counts had great influence over the decisions of viceroys and bishops. These Counts were also known for their stylish dress and high living standards. The palace was built in the 17th century, replacing the older structures here, in order to show the family's new socioeconomic station. However, not long after this, the family's fortunes began to decline until Juan Lorenzo Altamirano Velasco y Flores, Count of Santiago de Calimaya had his property put into official receivership. At this time, the viceregal government decided to renovate the deteriorated palace in 1777, giving the work to Francisco Antonio Guerrero y Torres, putting a lien on the building's rental income. The Aztec serpent's head that serves and the building's impressive cornerstone was probably uncovered during these renovations. Cost of remodeling the house was 130,000 pesos. During this time, the palace chapel was added, built between 1778 and 1779. At that time, it was common to attend Mass everyday but at the same time upper-class women were generally not permitted to walk on the streets to go to church. Many large mansions and palaces, therefore, had their own chapels with their own sacristies. These families would have private Masses said in their homes. Until the end of the 19th century, the house was part of one of the main commercial centers of the city. Like many other mansions, the family rented space on the ground floor to merchants and rooms inside as living quarters. However, by the end of the 19th century, this area slowly ceased to be an area for the wealthy. More of the house was rented and adapted to lower-class tenants. The family tried to keep the upper part of the house for itself, but economic realities eventually forced them out of the house altogether to rent it entirely as tenements. Description of the palace Stairway (sideways) During the colonial period, this palace was considered one of the most sumptuous in New Spain. The structure covers 2,762 m2, has a masonry foundation, thick masonry walls, and the facade covered in tezontle. The main entrance and portal are done in cantera, a grayish-white stone, as well as the central balcony. There are also friezes on the facade done in basalt. The Baroque portal rests on four clawed feet and mascarons. It also has cannon- shaped gargoyles, which could be fired, but only with permission of city authorities. The look that survives today is the result of remodeling work done in the late 18th century and was one of the last major Baroque projects in Mexico. One of the building's most distinctive elements is the previously- mentioned Aztec serpent's head, which was probably uncovered during this work. It is thought that the head may have come from the Templo Mayor and was placed as the cornerstone of the original house that was owned by . Inside, the house has two floors with two courtyards, which was common with houses of Mexican nobility. The family's coat-of-arms adorn the arches of the main courtyard. One distinctive element of the palace is the fountain in the shape of a shell located in the main courtyard. Its deteriorated condition and the fact that there is little space between it and the windows near it suggest that it dates back to before the 18th-century remodeling. The focus of the fountain is a Nereid playing a guitar. It is possible that the marine motif refers to the sea voyages the Counts made to places like the Philippines. left The house had its own chapel, but only fragments of the facade remain in the structure today. One room that survives nearly intact is the music room. In the 19th century, music was one of the activities that the upper-class engaged in on a daily basis. European composers such as Franz Schubert, Chopin, Beethoven and Liszt were preferred but music by Mexican composers such as Tom√°s Le√≥n, Aniceto Ortega and Melesio Morales could be played as well. Music rooms were considered important during that time period to show the culture of the family. The main stairwell is located in the main courtyard opposite the nereid fountain. The dogs that adorn the banister of the main stairwell and the mascarons over the main doorway have an Oriental look to them, which was not common in such residences. Partly because of this, it has been speculated that the wood and the labor used to create parts of the house were of Philippine origin. However, both the work and the wood are native to Mexico, although the wood is not very common. Museum of Mexico City From the end of the 19th century and through most of the 20th century, this part of Mexico City suffered a severe decline. This house was adapted to rent space to lower- class tenants and by end of the 1950s had become tenements, in spite of the fact that it had been declared a national monument in 1931. In 1960, the Mexico City government acquired the building from the descendants of the Counts of Santiago de Calimaya in 1960. The City decided to convert this building into a museum. It hired architect Pedro Ramirez Vazques to remodel it, converting the old rooms into exhibition halls. In 1964, the Museum of Mexico City was inaugurated, focusing on what Mexico City was and what Mexico City hoped to be. However, by 1992, the Museum was in disarray. The museum closed and there were plans to convert it into lodging for guests of the city, but this never came to pass. In 1997, the Museum was reorganized and reopened dedicated to exhibitions about Mexico City's past, present and future, working in cooperation with the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a, the Museo de Arte Moderno the Museo de Virreinato and the Galer√≠a de Historia. One of the temporary exhibit rooms It has 26 rooms covering the evolution of Mexico City from Aztec times to the present. The permanent collection is divided into the following periods of time: the pre-Hispanic period, the colonial period (16th to 18th century), the 19th century and the 20th century. The pre-Hispanic room, decorated by the painter Ana Ugalde and others, contains objects such as metates (flat stones for grinding corn), jars, bowls, urns, incense burners as well as Aztec codices, maps and other objects showing the everyday life of people in the Mexican highlands of this time period. The colonial-era, 19th and 20th century rooms also contain everyday items from these time periods such as furniture, desks, tables, vases, and jars as well as arts such as sculptures and paintings. Part of Clausell's studio The studio of Campeche painter Joaqu√≠n Clausell occupies several rooms in the upper part of the house. He lived there as the husband of Angela Cervantes, a descendant of the Counts of Santiago de Calimaya. Clausell received visitors in these rooms such as Gerardo Murillo (Dr. Atl), Diego Rivera, Carlos Pellicer, Salvador Novo and Julio Ruelas. The rooms contain 1,300 sketches by the artist including portraits of famous people, images of Christ, angels and animals and mythological scenes. These works show influences from the Impressionism and Symbolism movements. The collection of works by Clausell include foreshortened figures that the artist made simply to clean his brushes. Clausell's works are on display here due to an agreement between the Museum and the Museo Nacional de Arte, where every two months, works by this artists are circulated between the two museums. The Jaime Torres Bodet Library contains approximately 10,000 volumes, mostly dealing with topics related to Mexico City. Its collection came from several sources including the 19th century newspaper collection, maps of the city from the city council reserve as well as original copies of laws passed by the city council. It also contains a large collection of books about the history of the city. There are also temporary exhibits, educational programs for children and adults, a room devoted to the river system in the Valley of Mexico, a bookstore, and guided tours. One of the events recently held here was called \\"Beats & Bits,\\" which traced the origins of electronic music from the beginnings of the 20th century to the present. Another event was an exposition of Mexican wrestling (lucha libre) featuring photographs, costumes and other objects related to this spectacle. In 1999, then-mayor of Mexico City, Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas Sol√≥rzano, gave the keys of the city to Pope John Paul II here.

On this press he produced amateur magazines, The Lilliputian and The Meanderer. His father was keen to support his hobby and supplied him with a large quantity of type. During the Great Depression he sold his press, later recalling, \\"I cut printing out of my heart... and decided to grow up completely.\\"PLA 4.7 It was not until the late 1950s that Lewis began printing again, when he decided to demonstrate the craft to daughters Elizabeth and Miranda, using material produced by them. The Keepsake Press was founded in the garden shed soon after, with the intention of publishing both established and un-established writers and artists. Its commercial policy was equally reach-me-down, the sales 'office' being \\"confined to some ring binders and a pile of filing boxes\\". Since print-runs were limited, most impressions were sold out within 18 months or less.Lewis, Roy (1975) The Practice of Parlour Printing considered as a Specific against Insomnia and like Disorders...illustrated by a Retrospect of the activities of the Keepsake Press... (Keepsake) The press' association with Edward Lowbury, whom Lewis had known at university, was particularly close.The poet discussed their association during the interview titled \\"Craftsmanship in Versification\\" in Wolfgang Goertschacher's Contemporary Views of the Little Magazine Scene, Poetry Salzburg 2000, pp.549‚Äì551 Lowbury's Metamorphoses (1958) was the first non-family production from the press, followed by eight more by him of which the last, First Light, was printed in 1990, two years after the press had officially ceased business. The following is a check list of these: *Metamorphoses, 1958, 16pp, 80 copies *New Poems, 1965, 180 signed copies *Figures of Eight, with drawings by Bryan Brooke, 1969, 22pp, 150 copies *Two Confessions, with a linocut by Elizabeth Lewis (the printer's daughter), No. 8 in the Keepsake Poems series, 1973, 4pp, 180 copies ‚Äì 12 signed by poet and artist *Poetry and Paradox: an essay with 19 relevant poems, 1976, 32pp, 250 copies in three different bindings: *A Letter from Masada, with drawings by Miriam Sachs, 1982, 12pp, 200 copies: *Birmingham!

The production of Metamorphoses helped him master a large Columbian press that printed four pages at a time. In 1976 he went to night school in order to learn monotype and so was able to produce the ambitious large work represented by Poetry and Paradox.Lewis, Roy (1993). Edward Lowbury and the Keepsake Press in Physic Meet and Metaphysic, University of Salzburg, Austria. pp. 13‚Äì15 Previously his largest book had been the 24-page anthology Moments of Truth containing short poems by 19 high-profile poets of the day: George Barker, Martin Bell, John Betjeman, Edwin Brock, Robert Conquest, Gavin Ewart, Roy Fuller, Thom Gunn, Bernard Gutteridge, Francis Hope, Ted Hughes, Edward Lowbury, Kathleen Nott, Peter Porter, Peter Redgrove, James Reeves, Peter Russell, David Wevill and Hugo Williams. Published in 1965, twelve copies were given each poet and the remaining 100 were offered for sale. Not all the work was by contemporary authors. There was a holograph Robert Burns poem, a translation of poems by Hans Christian Andersen and a very limited edition of Oscar Wilde's The Harlot's House. This involved the press in its boldest experiment of all, which was achieved with the help of the Happy Dragons' Press. The artist Daphne Lord provided drawings which Julius Stafford-Baker of Happy Dragons then made into lino cuts. A special process was used to create silhouettes by blowing aerosol paint through the stencils in five colours, including gold and silver metallics. About 50 copies were produced as Christmas gifts for 1967. The Birmingham Connection The connection with Edward Lowbury also brought in other contributions to the press. Principally he was responsible for the Parables of his late father-in- law, Andrew Young (1985). A selection of the author's mini-sermons originally published anonymously in his parish magazine, it ran into two editions of 200 copies each. Seven of the 16 pages had wood engravings by Joan Hassall, illustrator of several of Young's books, including the Collected Poems of 1950 and 1960. Keepsake's little work was a celebratory accompaniment to The Poetical Works of Andrew Young which appeared that same year, edited by Lowbury and his wife Alison and, again, illustrated by Joan Hassall. Other artists introduced to the press by Lowbury included Kenneth Lindley, who provided the woodcuts for Birmingham! Birmingham!, and Bryan Brooke, who illustrated Figures of Eight. The latter was a medical colleague that Lowbury had got to know while he was working at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Lowbury was himself a distinguished medical specialist and had been living in the city since 1949. Lewis' former connection with Birmingham formed another bond and lay behind the choice of other items printed by the press. Looking over Lowbury's manuscripts while on a visit, Lewis noticed two or three poems about the city and persuaded him to write more to form the collection Birmingham! Birmingham! Even before that, however, Lewis had printed Cannon Hill Park (1969) about another city location, in this case consisting of three ballads with music and design by Don Collis. Yet one more Birmingham connection surfaces in Robert Leach's Cats Free and Familiar (1974), whose author had been Head of English at Great Barr Comprehensive School and was then on the way to make a local name for himself in theatre. Association with the Happy Dragons' Press Roy Lewis left his printing equipment and metal type to Julius Stafford-Baker of the Happy Dragons' Press, a friend and printer who had assisted with a number of the Keepsake Poems. The press also 'inherited' editor Shirley Toulson from Keepsake and under her guidance began a programme of poetry publishing closely related to the Keepsake Poems.\\"History of the Happy Dragons' Press\\" See also * Happy Dragons' Press * Private press * Roy Lewis References Category:Small press publishing companies Category:Companies disestablished in 1996 ","title":"Keepsake Press"},{"id":"24533178","text":"Nicholas Thompson is an American technology journalist. He is the editor in chief of Wired and formerly the editor of Newyorker.com. Thompson is a contributor for CBS News and regularly appears on CBS This Morning and CBSN.  Early life and education  Thompson's high school was Phillips Academy, Andover. In 1997, he graduated from Stanford University Phi Beta Kappa and with honors. He earned a double major in earth systems and political science, while also completing a third degree in economics. He was also a Harry S. Truman Scholar, a former fellow of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation, and vice president of the student government.  Career  After college, Thompson traveled to Africa, where he was kidnapped in Morocco by drug dealers ‚Äúimmediately upon landing.‚Äù He has said this led to his first published story, a piece in The Washington Post titled \\"Continental Drift.\\" After coming back to America, Thompson worked as a freelance journalist and as a street musician in New York City, frequently performing on the 14th Street L train platform at Sixth Avenue. He was then hired at Penguin Computing, a Linux hardware company in San Francisco, but he made the transition back to journalism when he was hired as an editor of the Washington Monthly in 1999. He worked there for two years under Charles Peters and Paul Glastris. His most prominent story was a piece that exposed fraud in the U.S. News & World Report college rankings. Following another stint as a freelance reporter in Africa, he was hired as a senior editor at Legal Affairs. In 2005, he joined Wired as a senior editor. During that time, he assigned and edited the feature story, \\"The Great Escape,\\" which was the basis for the Oscar-winning film Argo. He also edited \\"Vanish\\" by writer Evan Ratliff. The two turned the story into an interactive digital manhunt, with Ratliff disappearing and Thompson helping readers on Twitter as they tried to track him down. Afterwards, Thompson and Ratliff, along with Jefferson Rabb, co-founded Atavist, a multimedia magazine and software company. They sold it in 2018 to WordPress. In 2010, Thompson was hired as a senior editor at The New Yorker. From 2012 to 2017, Thompson served as the editor of Newyorker.com, where he oversaw and managed the magazine's website. In that time, the number of monthly readers increased seven-fold. He also led the redesign and re-platforming of the site, the launch of The New Yorker Today app, and the introduction of a metered paywall. \\"What we're trying to do is make a website that is to the Internet what the magazine is to all other magazines,\\" Thompson told Politico at the time of the website's relaunch in 2014. By the time the metered paywall was introduced months later, new subscription sign-ups were 85 percent higher than they had been the previous January. Thompson also wrote for the magazine, most notably a piece on his long friendship with Joseph Stalin's daughter. In 2017, Thompson returned to Wired as its fifth editor-in-chief. ‚ÄúNick‚Äôs return to Wired, combined with his impeccable journalistic skills, will give the Wired team a tremendous advantage in covering the world of technology,‚Äù Cond√© Nast's Anna Wintour said at the time of the announcement. Under his leadership, Wired has launched a successful paywall and an AMP stories edition. It has also been nominated for the National Magazine Awards in design and feature writing. Thompson has also taken an evolved approach to the magazine's editorial mission, which once centered on unwavering optimism. ‚ÄúThe job isn‚Äôt to champion, the job is to be as smart as you can be about [tech companies] and praise them when they do things that are right and hold them to account when they do things that are wrong,‚Äù he has said, ‚ÄúThe role of Wired has shifted, and it‚Äôs shifted in a way that‚Äôs a little complicated for our audience.‚Äù In October 2018, Wired celebrated its 25th anniversary with a four-day festival and summit in San Francisco, as well as a VIP dinner hosted by Thompson and Anna Wintour. As editor-in-chief, Thompson has also continued writing and reporting. In February 2018, Thompson co-wrote Wireds cover story \\"Inside the Two Years that Shook Facebook‚Äîand the World,\\" an 11,000-word investigation based on reporting with more than fifty current and former Facebook employees. Fortune described the piece as, \\"a stellar example of the sort of long-form journalism that no summaries or clickbait teases or listicles can replace, the kind of substantive analysis and storytelling that make democracy and capitalism function.‚Äù Thompson is also the author of a book, The Hawk and the Dove: Paul Nitze, George Kennan, and the History of the Cold War, which was published in 2009. It tells the story of the Cold War through the relationship and rivalry of Kennan, the author of the Long Telegram, and Nitze, one of America's top arms negotiators, who was also Thompson's grandfather. The Washington Post called the book ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù and The New York Times described it as ‚Äúbrimming with fascinating revelations.‚Äù He has also authored features about Instagram's machine learning, the rising tensions between the US and China over artificial intelligence, and the ways in which technology helped him run a faster marathon at age 43. In 2018, he was named one of LinkedIn's top voices alongside Richard Branson, Melinda Gates, and Justin Trudeau. Personal life Before becoming a journalist, Thompson released three albums of acoustic guitar music and co-wrote a book about comparative economic development in West Africa and Southeast Asia.

Zivie: Le temple du Deir Chelouit, Cairo, IFAO, 1992.) is an ancient Egyptian temple to Isis from the Greco-Roman period. It stands on the West bank of the Nile at Luxor, 1 km from Malkata and about 4 km south of Medinet Habu. Today all that remains of the temple is its small main building and ruins of the propylon, along with its brick enclosure wall and the well. The temple precinct had an area of 74√ó51 metres; the temple itself is much smaller, with an area of 13√ó16 m.Dieter Arnold, Sabine H. Gardiner, Nigel Strudwick, Helen Strudwick: Encyclopedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B. Tauris, 2003, , Its entrance faces south. The outer walls do not have much decoration but on the inside the reliefs are well preserved. The shrine is surrounded by a corridor from which side chapels and a wabet (place of cleansing) open; also the stairs lead to the roof from this corridor. On the southern side of the outer wall some stone blocks from earlier buildings had been reused, judging from the reliefs on them most of them appear to be from Medinet Habu. The propylon is located 60 meters east from the temple, and is lavishly decorated on all sides. The importance of the Isis temple of Deir el- Shelwit is because Graeco-Roman era religious buildings are rare in this area, and this is the only one not associated with the Theban Triad but with Isis. History According to inscriptions on the propylon, construction of the Isis temple started around the beginning of 1st century CE. No earlier building is known to have stood on this site. According to one theory the temple's construction started under the reign of Nectanebo II and reached its finished form during the Greek-Roman era. Excavation The temple was first examined by Karl Richard Lepsius in the mid-19th century, but he did not make a detailed description of it. A French expedition led by Christiane Zivie studied the inscriptions on the propylon and published their studies in 1992. Between 1971 and 1979 archaeologists from the Waseda University of Japan worked on the site, they cleared the enclosure wall and the enclosed precinct from debris and excavated the temple's well which was filled with pottery shreds. Thirty-two strata of fillings were detected in the well, up to the point of 4 meters under ground level, where water made further excavation impossible. Remains found in the well prove that the well (and the temple itself) was already abandoned and used as a trash deposit by the Coptic era. Decoration The reliefs of the temple are dated to the Greek-Roman era and are similar to the ones in Dendera and Philae. On the walls of the temple and the pylon the cartouches of Hadrianus, Antoninus Pius, Galba, Otho, Vespasianus and Julius Caesar can be seen. On the reused blocks built into the outer walls of the temple, reliefs stylistically dated to the New Kingdom can be seen.

He served as Minister of Agriculture between 2009 and 2011, and as President of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies from 2011 to 2015. Early life and career Dom√≠nguez was born in the Buenos Aires Province town of Chacabuco, located in the heart of the Pampas and the Argentine maize belt.Asociaci√≥n de Promoci√≥n Agraria Chacabuco His grandparents were smallholders, and made artisanal honey, jams, and cheeses. His mother, N√©lida Olivetto, raised young Juli√°n as a single mother, and worked at the grade school he attended. He enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires and entered Law School, though without ultimately earning a degree. He married Claudia Moreno, with whom he had four children and adopted a fifth. Dom√≠nguez entered public service in 1989 as head of the board of advisors of the Buenos Aires Province Social Security Institute. He later joined the national Ministry of Health under President Carlos Menem as chief youth policy advisor, and in 1993, was named chief policy advisor to Interior Minister (Home Secretary) Carlos Ruckauf.Linkedin: Juli√°n Dom√≠nguez In 2013, he finished his degree in law at the University of Buenos Aires. Political career=Local and provincial politics He returned to Chacabuco in 1994 and was elected Mayor the following year on the ruling Justicialist Party (Peronist) ticket. Dom√≠nguez was elected to the Lower House of Congress in 1999, but forfeited his seat following an offer for the post of provincial Public Works Minister by Ruckauf, who had been elected Governor of Buenos Aires. He was influential in the governor's 2001 decision to rescind the province's water service concession granted several years earlier to Azurix, a local Enron subsidiary. The precipitous resignation of President Fernando de la R√∫a at the end of 2001 and his eventual replacement by a leading Peronist figure, Eduardo Duhalde, brought Dom√≠nguez to the Casa Rosada as the President's Assistant Chief of Staff. He served mainly in a parliamentary liaison capacity in this post, and the election of N√©stor Kirchner to the Presidency in 2003 took Dom√≠nguez to an important Defense Ministry post, where he served as liaison between the Argentine Military and the remaining, civilian arms of the Argentine Government.Argentine Ministry of Defense: Secretary of Military Affairs He was elected to the Buenos Aires Province Legislature in 2003, and his work with Ruckauf and Duhalde, both former governors who still wielded influence in the provincial capital, helped result in Dom√≠nguez's prompt election as the body's Justicialist Party caucus Whip. He became prominent in the Judiciary Committee, becoming its Chairman and the Vice President of the Lower House itself following his reelection in 2007. Minister of Agriculture and later work Dom√≠nguez following his swearing-in as Minister of Agriculture in 2009. Juli√°n Dom√≠nguez as President of the Chamber of Deputies. Fallout from the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector over a proposed rise in export tariffs led to a number of changes in the executive branch, including the creation that year of a Production Ministry and, on September 30, 2009, the reinstatement of the Agriculture Secretariat as a (cabinet-level) ministry, a prominence the post had not enjoyed since 1981. Supported by Presidential Chief of Staff An√≠bal Fern√°ndez, Dom√≠nguez was tapped for the post and sworn in on October 1. Pending, however, were improvements in strained relations between the center-left administration of President Cristina Kirchner and (among others) nation's important agrarian sector, whose leading figures approved of her decision to reinstate the Agriculture Ministry, but expressed skepticism at the appointment to the post of a legislator with no farming experience, and who had recently supported a hike in provincial farm income taxes. Dom√≠nguez's tenure saw the federal government regain the initiative to some extent vis-√†-vis the agrarian sector. The contentious entity regulating agricultural subsidies, ONCCA, was dissolved in 2011; and the proposed return to a Federal Grain Board (such as the one prevailing in Argentina between 1935 and the creation of ONCCA in 1996), as well as the revival of the Federal Agrarian Council of provincial officials dealing with the sector, succeeded in dividing the powerful agrarian lobby round table, the Mesa de Enlace. Elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 2011, he was named president of the body on December 6.

She is often quoted in news articles about positive psychology and happiness.https://abcnews.go.com/m/screen?id=4115033&pid;=26 In the book The Only Self-Help Book You'll Ever Need, a criticism of self-help books, Lyubomirsky's The How of Happiness is praised as a self-help book that has claims backed by empirical data. Lyubomirsky is also an associate editor of the Journal of Positive Psychology.  Education  Originally from Russia, Lyubomirsky received her B.A. from Harvard University and her Ph.D. in Social/Personality Psychology from Stanford University.  Awards  Lyubomirsky has been honored with a John Templeton Foundation grant, a Science of Generosity grant, a Templeton Positive Psychology Prize, and a million- dollar grant (with Ken Sheldon) from the National Institute of Mental Health.  The How of Happiness  Breakdown of sources of happiness, according to The How of Happiness Published in 2008 by Penguin Press, the book has been translated into 22 languages. The premise of The How of Happiness is (1) that happiness is worth striving for, and (2) that 50 percent of a given human's long-term happiness level is genetically determined (based on twin studies),Sonja Lyubomirsky, David Schkade and Kennon M. Sheldon, \\"Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change,\\" Review of General Psychology, Vol. 9, No. 2, 111‚Äì131, 2005 10 percent is affected by life circumstances and situation, and a remaining 40 percent of happiness is subject to self control that can make a difference.http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594201486,00.htmlhttp://www.pe.com/localnews/highereducation/stories/PE_News_Local_D_happy19.3d48c86.html The strategies offered in the book are designed to target the 40 percent of happiness that is subject to manipulation. The How of Happiness has spawned an iPhone application called Live Happy, produced by Signal Patterns. Lyubomirsky is on the company's scientific advisory board. The How of Happiness has also spawned a song called The How of Happiness Book Tune, which acts as a mnemonic aid to help readers remember the content within the book. The book was mentioned in various magazines and newspaper articles, and also led to Lyubomirsky's appearing in multiple TV and radio shows, and feature documentaries in North America, South America, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.  The Myths of Happiness  In her second book, ‚ÄúThe Myths of Happiness‚Äù , published by Penguin Press, Sonja Lyubomirsky, drawing from research studies of hers and from all around the world, examines why the major life events that should make a person happy don‚Äôt, and that what shouldn‚Äôt make us happy often does. What she reveals is that these misconceptions about the impact of such events are one of the main threats to a person's long-term well-being. Happiness set point Lyubomirsky has proposed that people's happiness level is 50% due to genetic inheritance, which means people can only move their happiness up and down from a 'happiness set point'. Hedonic adaptation supports this view.

The Lupaca lived for many centuries near Lake Titicaca in Peru and their lands possibly extended into Bolivia. The Lupacas and other Aymara peoples formed powerful kingdoms after the collapse of the Tiwanaku Empire in the 11th century. In the mid 15th century they were conquered by the Inca Empire and in the 1530s came under the control of the Spanish Empire. The residence of the pre-Inca kings of Lupaca was probably what is today the archaeological site of Cutimbo. The capital of the Inca province was Chucuito, presently a village of the same name where the archaeological site of Inca Uyu is located. Cutimbo was likely the residence of the Lupaca kings in pre-Inca times.Hyslop, John (1977), \\"Chulpas of the Lupaca zone of the Peruvian High Plateau\\", Journal of Field Archaeology, Vol 4, No. 2, p. 150. Downloaded from JSTOR. A photo of present-day Chucuito on Lake Titicaca which was the capital of the Inca province inhabited mostly by the Lupaca. History The Lupaca occupied seven urban centers, all of them present day cities and villages in the Puno region of Peru: Chucuito, Acora, Ilave, Juli, Pomata, Yunguyo and Zepita.Salles, Esteal Cristina and Noejovich, Hector Omar (2016), \\"El Reino Lupaqa: Articulation entre Tierras Altas y Bajas,\\" Dialogo Andino, No. 49, p. 73. The Lupaca were incorporated into the growing Inca Empire by the emperor Pachacuti (reigned 1438-1471). During the reign of Topa Inca Yupanqui (1471-1493), the Inca crushed a revolt by the Lupaca and their northern neighbors, the Colla.Hemming, John (1970), The Conquest of the Incas, New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., pp. 242-243 In the 16th century, the Incas conducted a census of the Chucuito province and recorded it on a Quipu that was interpreted for the Spanish. The total number of households in Chucuito was 20,080 of which 15,778 were Aymara. 4.129 were Uru, and 173 were mitma. This implies a population of about 100,000 people in total.Murra, John V. (1968), \\"An Aymara Kingdom in 1567\\", Ethnohistory, Vol. 15, No. 2, p. 116. Downloaded from JSTOR. The Lupaca had little contact with the Spanish until 1538, when the Lupaca and Colla went to war. The Cholla appealed for help from the Spanish in Cuzco and Hernando Pizarro led an army southward and defeated the Lupaca at the southern tip of Lake Titicaca where the Desaguadero River flows from the lake. The battle went poorly for the Spanish for a time and Pizarro nearly drowned trying to cross the river, but was rescued by Paullu Inca, the Inca emperor installed by the Spanish.Hemming, pp. 242-244 Despite the defeat, Lupaca continued to be rich and powerful. A Spaniard, Garci Diez de San Miguel, visited and wrote of the Lupaca in 1567. There were at the time 16 Dominican priests and a few Spanish merchants and officials in the Lupaca kingdom, but the people of Lupaca had not yet been subjected to the encomienda by which Spaniards were granted large estates and control over indigenous peoples.Murra, pp 118-119 Like the Incas and many other Andean peoples, the Lupaca were divided into two moieties each with its leader. The \\"Alassa\\" or upper moiety was headed by Qari and the lower moiety, the \\"Massaa\\" was headed by Kusi. Each of them directly controlled many of the people and much of the land in the kingdom, but other wealthy Lupaca also incited the envy of the Spanish chronicler. The Lupaca seemed \\"extraordinarily wealthy.\\"Murra, pp. 117-120 The vertical archipelago The Lupaca lived on the Altiplano, a high cold plateau dotted with mountains. Lake Titicaca is at an altitude of ; freezes occur every month of the year.Weatherbase: Puno, Peru Only about two percent of land in the Andean highlands is arable. A few crops -- potatoes, oca, olluco, and quinoa‚Äîcan be grown in favored locations with techniques such as terracing, raised beds, and Waru Waru to moderate the cold temperatures. The wealth of the Lupaca was their herds of llamas and alpacas which grazed the barren uplands up to the snowline at about .McEwan, Gordon F. (2006), The Incas: New Perspectives, New York: W. W. Norton & Co., pp. 19-23 Anthropologist John V. Murra used the Lupaca as his exemplar of what he called the \\"vertical archipelago. The Lupaca and other high-altitude Andean people countered the limited potential for agriculture in their homeland by establishing colonies at lower and warmer elevations both westward toward the Pacific Ocean in the Chiribaya cultural area and eastward toward the Amazon River basin. The western colonies, located about distant, were located in irrigated desert valleys in the Moquegua Region and provided agricultural products such as maize, cotton, and chili peppers to the Lupaca living on the Altiplano. The eastern colonies provided coca and a variety of tropical forest products. Communication with these outlying colonies was maintained via llama caravans. Sovereignty over non-contiguous areas appears to have been a characteristic of Andean kingdoms. The long distance control of the colonies by the Lupaca implies a safe environment for transport and travel.Murra, pp. 121-125 Details of Murra's theory have been challenged, especially Murra's view that the vertical archipelago was a long-standing characteristic of highland peoples. Anthropologist Mary Van Buren suggests that the vertical archipelago as described by Murra operated only during the late Inca and early Spanish eras and further speculates that the establishment of colonies at lower elevations by the Lupaca and other highland peoples was motivated more by production of luxury goods rather than being a critical source of food for the entire highland population.Van Buren, Mary (1996), \\"Rethinking the Vertical Archipelago: Ethnicity, Exchange, and History in the South Central Andes\\", American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol 98, No. 2, pp. 338-351 Fate of the Lupaca The Lupaca kingdom disappeared from Spanish records around the end of the 16th century and its people became submerged in the generalized Aymara population. The Spanish had increasingly asserted control over the Lupacas and other highland kingdoms, eroded the authority and influence of their traditional leaders, forced Aymaras to work in the silver mines of Potos√≠, to resettle in \\"reductions\\", and appropriated much of the former Lupaca land, especially the lowland agricultural areas of the vertical archipelago. Adding to these factors were recurrent epidemics of European diseases which took a heavy demographic toll of the Andean indigenous people.Stern, Steve J.

History Denain Airport began as a pre-World War II airport in France, most likely with a grass runway and several support buildings and a hangar. serving the nearby city of Prouvy and surrounding region. German use during World War II It was seized by the Germans in late May 1940 during the early part of the Battle of France. In July 1940 the Luftwaffe stationed Erprobungsgruppe 210, a Messerschmitt Bf 110C/D heavy fighter/bomber unit was stationed at the airport, taking part in the Battle of Britain that summer. Later the unit switched to attacks on British shipping. In February 1941, the unit was re-equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109Es, flying bomber escort missions. Jagdgeschwader 51, another Bf 109E unit briefly used the airport in October 1940. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 In addition, a reconnaissance unit, Aufkl√§rungsgruppe 12 was assigned to Denain in October 1940 with Henschel Hs 126 twin-seat light observation planes. The unit stayed until May 1941. It appears that the Luftwaffe moved out of Denain in 1941 and the airfield was left unused. In 1943, the Germans laid a 1600m all-weather concrete runway at the airport, aligned northeast-southwest (06/24). A taxiway and a significant number of aircraft dispersal pads, maintenance shops, hangars and other support facilities were also built. Presumably this was due to the fortification of the Pas-de-Calais, being believed by the Germans that when the Americans and British tried to land in France to open a Second Front, the airfield would have a key role in the defense of France. After the construction of a military airfield at Denain, the airfield was reactivated by the Luftwaffe, stationing Jagdgeschwader 3, a day fighter-interceptor unit assigned to the \\"Defense of the Reich\\" campaign against the American Eighth Air Force heavy bombers attacking targets in Occupied Europe and Germany. In response to the interceptor attacks, Denain was attacked by USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) American use Denain Airport was cleared of German forces by Allied ground forces about 11 September 1944 during the Northern France Campaign. Almost immediately, the United States Army Air Forces IX Engineering Command 862d Engineer Aviation Battalion cleared the airport of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft. Pierced Steel Planking was laid down on the bomb damaged runway in order to make it serviceable and available for operational use. The airport immediately became a combat supply and casualty evacuation airfield, designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-83\\" about 14 September, also being known as \\"Denain/Prouvy Airfield\\".Johnson, David C.

A small cadre of personnel were assigned to the field, still largely in ruins due to the B-26 Marauder and fighter strafing/bombing runs on the field. In January 1945, the 833d Engineer Aviation Battalion moved back to Denain and improved the facilities enough to support combat units. The Ninth Air Force 323d Bombardment Group, moved in with B-26 Marauder medium bombers in February, remaining until 15 May 1945.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . Royal Air Force use It is known that Denain was used by the Royal Air Force, as it was assigned ALG \\"B-74\\". The RAF's use of the base has not been determined. After being used for a brief time as a storage depot for excess aircraft after the war ended by Air Technical Service Command, the Americans turned the airfield back over to French authorities on 25 June 1945. Postwar and modern use In French control after the war, the airport sat abandoned for several years. There was much unexploded ordnance at the site which needed to be removed, as well as the wreckage of German and American aircraft. Many of the buildings at the base were destroyed by the war, and although some had been repaired by the American combat engineers, most were in ruins. It was uneconomical to repair the prewar airport, and as a result the facility was demolished, with the French Army sending in unexploded ordnance teams to remove the dangerous munitions. Reconstruction of the airport included an entirely new asphalt runway, aligned 11/29, along with appropriate taxiways, ramp space and new infrastructure buildings on the north-west side of the airfield. Today the airport is a modern, well-equipped facility. The wartime air base is still evident with the 5500' concrete NE/SW runway remaining, complete with patched bomb craters and expansion joints allowing grass to grow between the concrete pads. The taxiway is the only wartime structures of the base that still exists, mostly as a single land concrete access road.

Indo-Roman relations began during the reign of Augustus (16 January 27 BCE ‚Äì 19 August 14 CE), the first emperor of the Roman Empire. The presence of Romans in the Scythia and India and the relations between these regions during the period of the Roman Empire are poorly documented. Before the conquests of Alexander in India, there are no surviving accounts by contemporaries or near-contemporaries, so modern understanding depends on more abundant literary, numismatic, and archaeological evidence, mainly relating to the trade between them. Early contacts Kushan ring with portraits of Septimus Severus and Julia Domna, a testimony to Indo-Roman relations. Indo-Roman relations were built on trade. Roman trade in the India began with overland caravans and later by direct maritime trade following the conquest of Egypt by Augustus in 30 BCE. According to Strabo (II.5.12), not long after Augustus took control of Egypt, while Gallus was Prefect of Egypt (26‚Äì24 BCE), up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to modern-day India: Augustus maintained the Ptolemaic Red Sea ports and the picket service from the Red Sea to the Nile, whence goods could be carried downstream to the ports of Pelusium and Alexandria. He also replaced the Ptolemaic patrol fleet on the Red Sea to keep piracy in check. He received embassies from Indian kings in 26 and 20 BCE and, although little specific is known about them, as Carey puts it: \\"These missions were certainly intended for something more than an exchange of empty compliments.\\"Carey (1954), p. 496. By the time of Augustus, if not before, a sea-captain named Hippalus had \\"discovered\\" (or, rather, brought news to the West of) the relatively safe and punctual contact over the open sea to India by leaving from Aden on the summer monsoon and returning on the anti-trade winds of winter. This would be made safer and more convenient by the Roman sack of Aden in a naval raid c. 1 BCE.Carey (1954), pp. 567. Cassius Dio (d. sometime after 229 CE) in his Hist. Rom. 54.9 wrote: > Many embassies came to him (Augustus), and the Indians having previously > proclaimed a treaty of alliance, concluded it now with the presentation, > among other gifts, of tigers, animals which the Romans, and, if I mistake > not, the Greeks as well, saw for the first time. . . .Majumdar (1960), pp. > 451‚Äì452.

The author of the Periplus lists ports from Barbarikon at the mouth of the Indus in the west near modern Karachi in Pakistan, right around the southern tip of the Indian peninsula and north as far as the mouth of the Ganges near modern Kolkata (Calcutta). In contrast to the wealth of information on some of the west coast ports, the author gives no political information on the ports up the east coast of India,Casson (1989), p. 47. perhaps indicating that he had not personally visited them. In fact the text seems to imply that western vessels normally did not travel beyond the tip of Indian peninsula, probably leaving onward trade to local boats as the passage between India and the northern tip of Palaisimundu or Taproban√™ (Sri Lanka) was very shallow for trans-oceanic vessels, while the route around the island was longCasson (1989), pp. 24, 83, 89. and may have forced skippers to pass another season in the region before the winds were right for the return to Egypt. Pliny's accounts Indian art also found its way into Italy: in 1938 the Pompeii Lakshmi was found in the ruins of Pompeii (destroyed in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE). Gaius Plinius Secundus (23‚Äì79 CE), generally known as Pliny the Elder, writing c. 77 CE, left probably the most important account of India and its trade with Rome that has survived in Classical literature. He gives quite a lot of detail about India, albeit not all accurate, but his observations do more than just outline the bare bones of history, and help give us some picture of how intimately Indian culture and trade was becoming known: > \\"Coral is as highly valued among the Indians as Indian pearls. It is also > found in the Red Sea, but there it is darker in colour. The most prized is > found in the Gallic Gulf around the Stoechades Islands, in the Sicilian Gulf > around the Aeolian Islands, and around Drepanum. . . . Coral-berries are no > less valued by Indian men than specimen Indian pearls by Roman ladies. > Indian soothsayers and seers believe that coral is potent as a charm for > warding off dangers. Accordingly they delight in its beauty and religious > power. Before this became known, the Gauls used to decorate their swords, > shields and helmets with coral. Now it is very scarce because of the price > it commands, and is rarely seen in its natural habitat.\\" Pliny. Natural > History (77 CE) (XXXII, chaps. 21, 23).Healy (1991), p. 281. Although his estimate of the value of Rome's trade to the East at some 100 million sesterces annually (Pliny, NH, VI, 26, 6 & NH, XII, 41, 2) has often been thought to be an exaggeration but, if it is interpreted as referring to the total value of the trade rather than as coinage, it becomes quite believable: > \\"For example, just one documented consignment from Muziris (Chera kingdom, > modern-day South India) to Alexandria consisted of 700-1,700 pounds of nard > (an aromatic balsam), over 4,700 pounds of ivory and almost 790 pounds of > textiles. This has been calculated as worth a total value of 131 talents, > enough to purchase 2,400 acres of the best farmland in Egypt. When it is > borne in mind that an average Roman cargo ship would have held about 150 > such consignments, Pliny's figure becomes entirely plausible. With such > staggering profits it is little wonder that the Roman government in Egypt > encouraged ‚Äì and profited by! ‚Äì the trade: a 25 per cent tax on all goods > from India was levied by the Romans at the Red Sea port of Leuce Come.\\"Ball > (2000), p. 123. Trajan After the Roman Emperor Trajan defeated the Dacians and annexed the Nabataean Arabs centered in Petra c. 105 CE, he returned to Rome where: > \\"...ever so many embassies came to him from various barbarians, including > the Sindi [people of the Indus Valley, Present day (Pakistan). And he gave > spectacles on one hundred and twenty-three days, in the course of which some > eleven thousand animals, both wild and tame, were slain, and ten thousand > gladiators fought.\\"Dio Cassius, Roman History Bk. 68 Trajan later defeated Parthia and, sailing down the Tigris River (115‚Äì16), reached the northern shores of the Persian Gulf.Carey (1954), p. 646. \\"Roman troops had beaten the might of Parthia from the field and had reached the Persian Gulf; and their victorious Imperator, Trajan, had dreamed of repeating Alexander's march to the northwestern subcontinent, only to acquiesce in giving up the project on account of his age.\\"Narain (1968), p. 233. Later references Muziris, near the southern tip of India, in the Peutinger Table. The Peutinger Table, a medieval copy of a 4th or early 5th century map of the world, shows a \\"Temple to Augustus\\" at Muziris, one of the main ports for trade to the Roman Empire on the southwest coast of India.Ball (2000), p. 123 This and evidence of agreements for loans between agents, one of whom most likely lived in Muziris, and a rather oblique reference in the Periplus, all seem to point to a settlement of Roman subjects living in the region.Casson (1989), p. 24. Embassies are recorded as arriving from the \\"Indians of the East\\" at the court of Constantine the Great (c. 272‚Äì337): > \\"Ambassadors from the Indians of the East brought presents . . . . which > they presented to the king (Constantine the Great) as an acknowledgment that > his sovereignty extended to their ocean. They told him, too, how Princes of > India had dedicated pictures and statues in his honour in token that they > had recognised him as their autocrat and king.\\" Eusebius of Caesarea (c. > 263‚Äì339) De Vita Constant. IV. 50.Majumdar (1960), p. 453. More embassies are mentioned from \\"the Indian nations\\" in 361 CE: > \\"Embassies from all quarters flocked to him (the Emperor Julian in 361 > A.D.), the Indian nations vying with emulous zeal in sending their foremost > men with presents, as far as from the Divi (Maldives) and the Serendivi > (Cylonese)[sic].\\" Ammianus Marcellinus. History XXII.vii.10.Majumdar (1960), > p. 452. Finally, Johannes Malala or John Malalas (c. 491‚Äì578), p. 477, records that, in 530 CE, \\"an ambassador of the Indians was sent to Constantinople.\\" Archaeological record Roman piece of pottery from Arezzo in Italy, found at Virampatnam, Arikamedu (1st century CE). The best archeological record of Roman presence can be found in southern India, specifically at Arikamedu. Arikamedu was a Tamil fishing village which was formerly a major Chola port dedicated to bead making and trading with Roman traders. It flourished for centuries until the Romans left in the 5th century CE. Various Roman artifacts, such as a large number of amphorae bearing the mark of Roman potter schools VIBII, CAMURI and ITTA, have been found at the site, supporting the view on a huge ancient trade between Rome and the ancient Tamil country of present day south India. Another place full of archeological records is Muziris, in the Kerala region. Muziris was a major centre of trade in Tamilakkam between the Chera Empire and the Roman Empire. Large hoards of coins and innumerable shards of amphorae found in the town of Pattanam have elicited recent archeological interest in finding a probable location of this port city.BBC News: Search for Muziris Numismatic record Numerous hoards of Roman gold coins from the time of Augustus and emperors of the 1st and 2nd centuries CE have been uncovered in India, predominantly, but not exclusively, from southern India. Attention may be drawn to the large number of Roman aurei and denarii of Augustus to Nero spanning approximately 120 years, found all along the route from about Mangalore through the Muziris area and around the southern tip of India to the south eastern Indian ports. Under the rule of Augustus, (63 BCE‚ÄìCE 14) the silver content of the denarius fell to 3.9 grams. It remained at nearly this weight until the time of Nero (CE 37‚Äì68).George Menachery, 'Kodungallur...' (1987, repr. 2000)http://www.indianchristianity.com/html/Books.htm This would also indicate that the land route from the West coast to the East coast via the Palghat pass in the Western Ghats was much more popular than the risky or circuitous sea route rounding the Cape or Sri Lanka.George Menachery, 'Kodungallur...'

Beban began as a child performer in San Francisco, California, and became a well-known vaudevillian and stage actor in the 1890s and 1900s. He was best known for his portrayal of Italian immigrant characters, including his starring roles in the play The Sign of the Rose and the 1915 silent film classic The Italian. Though strongly associated with his Italian immigrant roles, Beban was born in San Francisco, could not speak a word of Italian and was the son of parents from Dalmatia (in modern-day Croatia) and Ireland. Early years Beban was born in San Francisco, California in 1873. He grew up on San Francisco's Telegraph Hill and was one of four sons of Rocco Beban, a Dalmatian immigrant, and Johanna Dugan, from County Cork, Ireland. At age eight, he began a stage career singing with the Reed and Emerson Minstrels. His talent as a singer led to the young Beban acquiring the nickname \\"The Boy Baritone\\". He then acted in juvenile roles for the California Theater stock company in San Francisco. Broadway and vaudeville At age 22, Beban began a career as a Broadway theater actor in New York. He appeared in several musical comedies and performed with Weber & Fields and with Marie Cahill. Beban's stage credits include Parrot and Monkey Time (1896), a minstrel feature at Sam T. Jack's Theater; A Modern Venus (1898), a burlesque playing at Sam T. Jack's Theater; A Trip to Buffalo (1902); Nancy Brown (1903); Fantana (1905); Moonshine (1905‚Äì06), a production of the Marie Cahill company; About Town (1906), a musical comedy by the Lew Fields All Star Company about life in Paris; The Great Decide (1906); The Girl Behind the Counter (1907‚Äì1908); The American Idea (1908), a musical comedy by George M. Cohan; Hokey-pokey (1912); and Anna Held's All Star Variete Jubilee (1913‚Äì1914). George M. Cohan wrote'The American Idea for Beban to play the lead role of Pierre Souchet (and Trixie Friganza as the co-star). Beban had previously played French characters in Marie Cahill's production Ben Bolt, and in Lew Fields' About Town. In 1907, the Chicago Tribune wrote the following about Beban's French character: \\"The best work of the entire entertainment is accomplished by George Beban as the excitable Frenchman ... The actor makes this Count Boti a veritable Frenchman, every intonation and inflection, every motion, look, and gesture being exact.\\" For many years, Beban was typecast as a French character actor. Beban later recalled, \\"No one will ever know what an awful time I had to get away from French character. I had to live, and for French character parts I could name my own salary, but for anything else I wasn‚Äôt worth as much as a chorus man.\\" No longer wishing to play parts that cast him as \\"a Sunday comic supplement,\\" Beban begged to be given serious parts where he could portray a more rounded human being. \\"The Sign of the Rose\\" Beban as depicted in a 1910 newspaper article Eventually, Beban escaped the French characters by taking on a different ethnic caricature ‚Äì the Italian immigrant. He studied the language and mannerisms of the Italian immigrants by spending weeks observing Italian workers building a tunnel between Manhattan and New Jersey. He even purchased clothes from the workers that he later used for his character in The Sign of the Rose. In an earlier interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Beban said he had developed some ability to imitate Italian speech as a boy teasing and stealing fruit from local Italian gardeners and grape growers. The study paid off with Beban's release of a vaudeville sketch in which he played the part of an Italian laborer mourning the death of his child. The sketch was written by Beban and was called The Sign of the Rose. It grew from a vaudeville sketch into a full- length play and was eventually made into a feature film. In 1911, The New York Times wrote that the story was \\"generally lacking in plausibility\\" and having \\"much that is conventional and machine made.\\" However, the Times found the play to be \\"a very good character study indeed\\"‚Äîat least while Beban was on the stage. The Times called the play \\"an excellent vehicle for Mr. Beban, who has long been regarded as a clever delineator of Italian roles.\\" The reviewer said of Beban's performance: \\"Here he portrays very beautifully the simplicity, gentleness, sweetness, and, when occasion arises, the native ferocity of the ignorant but wellmeaning foreigner, who is conscious of the obstacles which he confronts on account of his poverty, and the contempt and suspicion under which he labors because of the crimes of evildoers of his own nationality.\\" In 1910, the Los Angeles Times published a lengthy feature story on Beban in which it wrote: > \\"George Beban is probably the only American actor who has consecrated his > individual efforts to the portrayal of a certain type. Beban says he is > going to play, and continue to play, 'The Italian in America.' ... Just at > present Beban's talents are finding abundant expression in 'The Sign of the > Rose,' a remarkable Orpheum headliner, in which, as Pietro Massena, this > character actor delineates the loves and sorrows of a poor Italian > emigrant.\\" When The Sign of the Rose played in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, The Milwaukee Sentinel wrote: \\"It is a beautiful piece of character depiction, and throughout, from the first entrance to the last curtain call, Mr. Beban never steps from the picture, never mars the imaginative creation he has formed. The grip is there, and the sketch is one of the best in the vaudeville field today.\\" While touring with The Sign of the Rose, Beban spoke of the contributions of the Italian in civilization and noted: > \\"The swarming port of Naples courses him out to us every day, its traffic > lines beating like a great throbbing artery of life. In the main he is poor > and despised, and sometimes, though not as often as the sensationalists of > the police courts would have us believe, he is rejected. But even at his > worst he contains a fund of humanity which it is almost impossible to > duplicate in any other people as a whole. His passions are so manifest that > they are the very essence of the theatre. He loves intensely, he adopts > children, he is fiery in his friendships and hates alike, and his > experiences in getting Americanized furnish a far greater fund of comedy > than the wearisome peanut-stand mirth to which the 'scene-in-one' artists > have accustomed us.\\" Owing to the success of \\"The Sign of the Rose,\\" Beban was cast for most of the next decade in Italian character roles. In 1917, Beban revealed to a reporter the irony that he could not speak a word of Italian. Beban explained: > \\"I understand the tongue when it is spoken ‚Äì I couldn't be associated with > it for so many years and not recognize and translate it ‚Äì but I have never > attempted to talk it myself. ... To portray the type of Italian that I do > all one needs is knowledge of the actions, mannerisms, etc., of the > character. Not knowing the language, from the viewpoint that the Italian > speaks it, I am thus able to make my characterization more understandable to > the American audience. In other words, I Americanize him for the United > States consumption ‚Äì stage purposes.\\" George Beban in The Italian (1915) \\"The Italian\\" In 1915, Beban made his debut in the motion picture business as the lead actor in Thomas H. Ince's production, The Italian. In the film, Beban played the role of Pietro \\"Beppo\\" Donnetti, an Italian gondolier who comes to the United States to make his fortune but instead winds up working as a shoeshiner and experiencing tragedy while living with his wife and child in a tenement on New York's Lower East Side. The Italian proved to be a popular and critical success. Grace Kingsley in the Los Angeles Times praised Beban‚Äôs work: > \\"There are possibilities in the role of Pietro, in 'The Italian' ... that a > less clever character artist than George Beban might overlook ... The story > is full of human interest, requiring a full understanding of the character, > and Beban by look and gesture is at all times in fullest sympathy with the > difficult role.\\" A newspaper in Indiana also praised Beban's performance: > \\"George Beban, who has the difficult role of Pietro Donnetti, gives a piece > of character work that is truly marvelous. This artist has developed mimicry > to its highest form of expression. His mobile countenance mirrored every > emotion so perfectly, each varying mood was portrayed so truly, that it was > hard to believe that this man was naught but a pantomimist. The upward > glance when the heart was bitten again by the fangs of emotion, the > hysterical joy of the Latin nature when in high spirits, all these phrases > were delineated by this artist in a way that moved and thrilled.\\" Historical accounts, following the film's release on DVD, have also been kind to Beban. In 2008, The New York Times praised Beban's \\"powerful lead performance\\" which it described as follows: > \\"The audience is drawn to identify with Beppo, even though he remains in > many respects an appalling ethnic caricature: dark, brooding, vengeful. That > Barker [the director] and Beban are able to create so much sympathy for > Beppo, despite their own, occasionally quite obvious condescension to the > character, is a mark of emerging maturity in the movie business; no longer > are films dealing in one-dimensional 'types.'\\" A reviewer for the publication Bright Sights wrote: \\"Projecting overwhelming grief, Beban reveals some hefty acting chops.\\" A review in DVD Talk concluded that Beban's performance was able to overcome the film's melodramatic premise: \\"Beppo is a delightful character ... His rage after being robbed was another standout moment. The camera does a very tight closeup ... and his anger and fear are almost palatable.\\" Motion pictures Hearts of Men (1919) Beban's second feature, also released in 1915, was The Alien, a film version of his long-running play, The Sign of the Rose. In the decade after the release of The Italian and The Alien, Beban played the leading role in a number of Hollywood motion pictures, including Lost in Transit, The Land of the Free, Jules of the Strong Heart, One More American, Hearts of Men, The Greatest Love of All, One in a Million, and The Loves of Ricardo. In addition to acting, Beban also worked as a director, producer and writer on such films as The Loves of Ricardo (actor, writer, director, editor and producer), The Greatest Love of All (actor, story, director and producer), and One Man in a Million (actor, story and director). In May 1921, the City of Los Angeles threw a parade in honor of Beban. Beban's train was greeted at the Southern Pacific station, and he was taken to a waiting automobile filled with roses. A long line of decorated cars formed a parade to Los Angeles City Hall, where Mayor Meredith P. Snyder presented Beban with a huge floral key to the city. The events were part of the celebration for the opening of Beban's latest film, One in a Million. Family Beban was married to Edith MacBride, a stage actress who appeared with Beban in Moonshine (1905‚Äì06), About Town (1906), The Girl Behind the Counter (1907‚Äì08), The American Idea (1908), and Anna Held‚Äôs All Star Variete Jubilee (1913‚Äì14). They also appeared together in the 1915 motion picture The Alien. Their son, George Beban, Jr., was born in 1914 and performed as a child actor with his father in the films One in a Million (1921), Hearts of Men (1919), and The Alien (1915). In December 1926, Beban's wife died in New York. Later years and death Following the death of his wife, Beban retired from the motion picture business. In his retirement, he built a large home in Playa del Rey, Los Angeles, California. In 1927, Beban began assisting aspiring actors to break into the motion picture business. He described his goal in an interview with the Los Angeles Times: > \\"There is no agony so poignant as the feeling that one has the spark of > genius with no opportunity to satisfy that ambition that goes with it. I > know, because I have had my own struggles. The stage and screen have been > good to me. I have accumulated all the money I need, for a few years at > least, and I am going to devote at least a year of my life to helping young > men and women of talent who are denied the chance to display it.\\" In 1928, Beban died from injuries sustained when he was thrown from a horse while on vacation at the June Lodge dude ranch in Big Pine, California.

Gordon was portrayed in the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers by Ben Caplan. He was featured in the 2010 book A Company of Heroes: Personal Memories about the Real Band of Brothers and the Legacy They Left Us. Youth Walter Scott \\"Smokey\\" Gordon was born in Jackson, Mississippi. He enrolled at Millsaps College around 1940, attending there for 2 years.WWII Army Enlistment Records: on-line NARA Archival Database Due to colorblindness and flat feet, the Marines and the Navy had rejected him, so he joined the Army. Gordon enlisted on 10 August 1942 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as his father told him that 'if you enlist down south, you will train up north and vice versa'.p.94, Brotherton He faked his way through the eye test and successfully enlisted. Military service Gordon's basic training was at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. His airborne training began in August 1942 at Camp Toccoa, Georgia under Herbert Sobel. Gordon's nickname 'Smokey' came from his tobacco-chewing habit during his time with Easy Company. During training, Gordon found that he needed more water than others, therefore in the field he began carrying extra Hershey's bars as a way to gain access to his comrades' canteens.p.95, Brotherton Gordon and Paul Rogers loved composing poems to tease their comrades that had experienced some kind of mishap, and the victims would often explode in anger to their delight.p.63, Winters Gordon had served with Easy Company as a machine gunner. He jumped into Normandy in the early morning hours of 6 June 1944 and landed on a farm. He found other unit members shortly after. One week later, on 13 June, he was wounded in the arm and shoulder at Carentan, France. In the hospital, different groups of military upper brass visited the wounded soldiers and pinned Purple Hearts on the men's pillows. Gordon received his, but he unpinned and hid it, so when the next group came, they would give him another Purple Heart. After a while, Gordon had several medals.p.96, Brotherton Gordon spent 8 weeks in the hospital and returned to Easy Company. Darrell \\"Shifty\\" Powers recalled one time Gordon gave his last cigarette to Talbert, but charged him a dime for a match.p.41, Winters When Gordon found out that Talbert was disqualified from receiving Purple Heart for a wound received when Tab was mistakenly bayoneted by another Easy Company trooper, he put together a makeshift ceremony with Paul Rogers and gave Talbert one of his extra Purple Hearts. They also wrote the poem The Night of the Bayonet for the incident. In September 1944, he jumped in the failed mission of Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands. Smokey also fought in Bastogne, Belgium in December 1944. Major Richard D. Winters remembered seeing Gordon sitting on the edge of his foxhole behind his light machine gun, his head wrapped in a large towel with his helmet on top. Winters did not recognize Gordon at first, and was struck knowing that it was him. He thought \\"Damn! Gordon's matured! He's a man!\\"p.178, Winters On Christmas Eve, Gordon was shot by a German sniper, with the bullet penetrating one shoulder, traveling through his body and exiting the shoulder on the other side, which paralyzed him. He was evacuated from the front lines on 27 December when Patton's Third Army penetrated the German lines and marched into Bastogne.p.180, Winters In the process of recovery, Gordon was hospitalized for six months. Later years In spring 1945, Gordon was sent back to the States and to Lawson General Hospital. One day when he was recuperating, a doctor named Dr. Stadium turned to the nurse and said, \\"Keep an eye on this one, he's goldbricking.\\" Gordon was infuriated, and only later he realized that the doctor was trying to rile him up to help reconnect nerves and keep a fighting spirit in him. He remained in touch with Dr. Stadium for years after the war.p.97, Brotherton The Army decided not to release Gordon, although he was improving, possibly because they might have to pay Gordon for a full disability if they released him at that point. Gordon was discharged from the Army with a 90% disability after his father threatened to \\"drive him down to the US Capitol Building, march him down onto the Senate floor, strip him down to his skivvies and let someone besides the Army make a determination.\\"p.98, Brotherton Gordon eventually fully regained all bodily movements but would suffer from severe back pain for the remainder of his life. People who did not know of his condition would always give him big hugs and pats on the back and knowledgeable ones could always tell it caused him extreme pain but he would never show the person any sign that it bothered him at all.Ambrose, p.293. Gordon later moved to Lafayette, Louisiana, where he became employed as an independent oil and gas lease broker. In 1946, he and others began organizing Easy Company reunions.Winters, p.258. In 1951, he married Elizabeth Ball Ludeau and the couple had five children including one son and 4 daughters. Gordon was a faithful Episcopalian, but stopped being so after his beloved twin sister Cleta died in her early thirties of breast cancer.p.93, Brotherton Gordon died in Pass Christian, Mississippi after suffering a stroke in his sleep. He is survived by his own five children including his eldest born, Walter S. Gordon III and his 5 grandchildren: Bonnie Gordon, Alison Gordon, Cherie Goff, Charles Goff and Shelby Gordon.

In their eighth year under head coach Bo Schembechler, the Wolverines finished the season with a 10‚Äì2 record, won the Big Ten Conference championship, and played in the 1977 Rose Bowl. The Wolverines outscored their opponents 432 to 95 and ranked first in the country in total offense (448.1 yards per game), scoring offense (38.7 points per game), and scoring defense (7.2 points per game). In the final AP and UPI Polls, Michigan was ranked #3. Highlights of the season included a 51‚Äì0 victory over Stanford in which three Michigan running backs rushed for over 100 yards. Michigan's 70‚Äì14 victory over Navy was the worst defeat in the history of the Naval Academy's football program. Michigan spent most of the season ranked #1 in the polls, but a 16‚Äì14 loss to Purdue in the ninth game of the season dropped the Wolverines out of the top spot. In the final game of the regular season, Michigan defeated Ohio State, 22‚Äì0, to win the Big Ten championship. The game marked the first time the Buckeyes had been held scoreless since 1964. In the 1977 Rose Bowl, Michigan lost to USC, 14‚Äì6, as the Wolverines completed only four passes and were held to 155 rushing yards. On offense, senior running back Rob Lytle was selected as the team's most valuable player, finished third in voting for the Heisman Trophy, and led the Wolverines with 1,469 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns. Lytle finished the season as Michigan's all-time career rushing leader with 3,307 rushing yards gained from 1974 to 1976. Quarterback Rick Leach passed for 973 yards and 13 touchdowns and rushed for another 638 yards and 10 touchdowns.(To retrieve team statistics, enter the applicable year in the \\"Enter Year\\" box under the heading \\"Games & Totals by Season.\\" Press \\"Display Season.\\" At the next prompt, click the icon for \\"Display Season Totals\\".) His 13 touchdown passes tied a team record set by Bob Chappuis in 1947. Harlan Huckleby added 912 rushing yards, and wing back Jim Smith caught 26 passes for 714 yards and six touchdowns. Lytle, Smith, offensive right guard Mark Donahue, and offensive right tackle Bill Dufek were selected as first-team All-Americans. On defense, Calvin O'Neal started all 12 games at middle linebacker, led the team with 139 tackles, and was a consensus first-team All-American. Nine Michigan players were selected as first-team All-Big Ten Conference players. Twenty-one players from the 1976 team went on to play in the National Football League, and another (Rick Leach) was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the 1979 NFL Draft, but opted instead to play Major League Baseball.

Michigan scored two points on a safety on the second play from scrimmage as Wisconsin running back Mike Morgan fumbled the handoff on a reverse play and the ball rolled out of the end zone. Harlan Huckleby then extended the lead to 9-0 with a 56-yard touchdown run on Michigan's third play from scrimmage. Michigan led the game 23‚Äì0 at the end of the first quarter and held on for a 40-27 win. Michigan's offense was led by tailback Harlan Huckleby who rushed for 131 yards and three touchdowns on 19 carries. Rick Leach completed six of eight passes for 105 yards and two touchdowns. Leach also rushed for 84 yards on nine carries. Wing back Jim Smith scored two touchdowns and netted 174 yards in the game, including gains on kickoff and punt returns, receptions, and reverse plays. Team captain Rob Lytle gained 76 yards on 16 attempts, but also fumbled three times. Mike Kenn and Gerry Szara were credited with leading an offensive line that \\"completely controlled the line of scrimmage.\\" Defensively, the game was a disappointment for Michigan. Wisconsin's 27 points was the most allowed by a Michigan team since 1969, and Wisconsin's 426 yards of offense was the most allowed by Michigan since before Bo Schembechler took over as head coach. After the game, Schembechler told the press: \\"Twenty seven points that's what we usually give up in the first half of the season. I wasn't happy with the movement, I wasn't happy with the pursuit, I wasn't happy with the tackling, I wasn't happy with the playing of the ball in the secondary and I wasn't happy with the heat we put on the passer.\\" In the AP Poll released after the game, Michigan was ranked #1 with Ohio State at #2. Michigan's move to #1 was aided by upsets of Alabama and Texas and a tie between Nebraska and LSU. Week 2: Stanford President Ford receives a football jersey during visit to campus in September 1976 On September 18, 1976, Michigan played Stanford at Michigan Stadium. Michigan and Stanford had played to a 19-19 tie in 1975, and the Associated Press picked the rematch as its \\"Upset Special of the Week\\", predicting a Stanford win by a 24-20 score. Instead, Michigan defeated Stanford by a score of 51‚Äì0.(To retrieve team statistics, enter the applicable year in the \\"Enter Year\\" box under the heading \\"Games & Totals by Season.\\" Press \\"Display Season.\\" At the next prompt, click the box for \\"Stanford\\" and then click icon for \\"Display Chosen Game Stats\\".) Three Michigan running backs rushed for at least 100 yards in the game. Harlan Huckleby led the group with 160 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. Russell Davis added 115 yards and two touchdowns on seven carries, including an 85-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Rob Lytle had 101 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries. Rick Leach completed only two of eight passes for 15 yards, but added 70 rushing yards and a touchdown on seven carries. One of Leach's completions went three yards to tight end Gene Johnson for a touchdown in the third quarter. In total, the Wolverines gained 531 rushing yards against the Cardinal. On defense, Michigan intercepted three Stanford passes. Calvin O'Neal led the team with 11 total tackles. Place-kicker Bob Wood converted on six of seven extra point attempts and kicked a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter. The game marked the first time a Stanford team had been shut out since 1967. On the Wednesday before the Stanford game, the #1-ranked Michigan team received a visit from President Gerald Ford. Ford, who was the most valuable player of the 1934 Michigan Wolverines football team, spent time with team during a practice session and later ate with the team. Ford noted, \\"They're an awful lot bigger today. Not only are they bigger but they're better.\\" Split end Curt Stephenson later recalled the dinner: > \\"A tray appeared with a big New York steak in front of the President. . . . > What happened next is kind of a blur. President Ford started to choke and > the secret service started to circle the table. I don't know why, but in one > immediate action, I reached back and gave him a good whack on the back. A > hunk of beef flew out and across the table. The President turned to me and > said, 'Thanks'. . . . From that point on, there were about six agents who > were giving me eagle eyes.\\" Later that day, Ford formally opened his reelection campaign with a speech to a boisterous crowd of 14,000 at Crisler Arena. Week 3: Navy On September 25, 1976, Michigan faced Navy at Michigan Stadium. Two days before the game, the schools' most famous alumni (Gerald Ford of Michigan and Jimmy Carter of the Naval Academy) faced off in a presidential debate. The Associated Press reported that a survey of registered voters gave Ford a slight edge over Carter in the debate, but noted that things were \\"not expected to be that close\\" when the two schools met on the football field. In fact, Michigan defeated Navy by a 70-14 score. The game marked the worst defeat in the history of the Naval Academy's football program. The point total was also the highest by a Michigan team since an 85-0 win over the University of Chicago in 1939. Navy took an early lead on a touchdown by quarterback John Kurowski and led 14-12 halfway through the second quarter. Michigan tied the score with its second safety of the second quarter and outscored 49-0 in the second half to put the game out of reach. Quarterback Rick Leach completed 8 of 12 passes for 179 yards and led the scoring with two rushing touchdowns and two passing touchdowns. A total of nine players scored for the Wolverines. On offense, touchdowns were scored by Leach, Rob Lytle, Lawrence Reid, Kevin King, Stacy Johson, Jim Smith, and Gene Johnson.

Week 4: Wake Forest On October 2, 1976, Michigan faced the Wake Forest Demon Deacons in the team's fourth consecutive home game at Michigan Stadium. In the week before the game, Wake Forest head coach Chuck Mills noted that he had heard that Bear Bryant endorsed Gerald Ford and joked, \\"I'm withholding my endorsement until after the Michigan game to see what kind of hosts they are.\\" The Wolverines shut out the Demon Deacons by a score of 31-0.

Commenting on Leach's passing, one sportswriter noted: \\"[W]hen the Wolverines are rolling up a shutout, and 340 yards rushing, hardly anybody notices the passing. Maybe that's a good thing. ... [Leach] was wild high, and wild low, but in games like these it really doesn't matter.\\" Bo Schembechler told the press after the game: \\"You people like passing and there it is. That's how we keep the score down.\\" Week 5: Michigan State On October 9, 1976, Michigan played its cross-state rival Michigan State in the annual battle for the Paul Bunyan Trophy. The Wolverines had won six straight games with the last victory for the Spartans dating back to 1969.

Michigan was heavily favored and had not lost a game to Purdue since 1966. The Boilermakers came into the game with a 3-4 record, but proceeded to stun the college football world with a 16-14 upset victory over the Wolverines. It was the first time Michigan had lost to a Big Ten Conference team other than Ohio State since its loss to Michigan State in 1969. Michigan took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter on an eight-yard touchdown run by Rick Leach. Leach's score was set up by linebacker Jerry Vogele's recovery of a fumble at the Michigan 42-yard line. Purdue's Scott Dierking responded with two touchdown runs, one each in the first and second quarters. Purdue held a 13-7 lead at halftime. Early in the third quarter, Michigan drove to Purdue's one-yard line, but Leach fumbled and the ball was turned over to Purdue. Later in the third quarter, Leach threw a 64-yard touchdown pass to Jim Smith, and Bob Wood kicked the extra point to give Michigan a 14-13 lead. On the next drive, Jerry Zuver intercepted a pass to stop a Purdue drive at Michigan's 22-yard line. However, Rob Lytle fumbled on the next drive, and Purdue recovered the ball at its own 29-yard line. Purdue drove to the Michigan six-yard line.

Purdue rushed for 251 yards in the game, including 162 yards by Dierking. After the game, Bo Schembechler told reporters, \\"It hurts a lot. We don't accept it. . . . We shouldn't accept it . . . because we should have won. No defeat is good. we got down there at the end and we should have scored. But when you depend on winning on a forward pass or a field goal, you're in trouble.\\" In a post-game account, the UPI dubbed Purdue the \\"Spoilermakers\\", noting that Purdue had upset a #1 ranked Notre Dame team in 1974 before upsetting #1 ranked Michigan. Four days before the Wolverines lost to Purdue, the team's most famous alumnus lost the 1976 presidential election to Jimmy Carter. After losing a close election, Ford harkened back to his days as a football player, \\"We lost, in the last quarter.\\" Week 10: Illinois Rob Lytle After the loss to Purdue, Michigan returned to Ann Arbor and played Illinois on November 13, 1976. Prior to the game, Associated Press writer Fred Rothenberg noted that Illinois was in the unenviable position of playing Michigan on the heels of the Purdue game. Rothenberg wrote: \\"The University of Michigan and its most famous alumnus both lost their No. 1 positions last week. President Ford immediately went on vacation; the Wolverines went back to work. Pity poor Illinois.\\" Michigan defeated the Illini by a score of 38-7.(To retrieve team statistics, enter the applicable year in the \\"Enter Year\\" box under the heading \\"Games & Totals by Season.\\" Press \\"Display Season.\\" At the next prompt, click the box for \\"Illinois\\" and then click icon for \\"Display Chosen Game Stats\\".) Rob Lytle rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries and scored three touchdowns, a five-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter and a pair of touchdown runs in the third quarter. With his rushing yards against Illinois, Lytle became Michigan's all-time career rushing leader. Lytle totaled 3,085 career rushing yards after the Illinois game, surpassing Billy Taylor's school record by 13 yards. Rick Leach rushed for 65 yards and completed 9 of 15 passes for 151 yards and two touchdowns. With Illinois putting seven or eight men on the line at times, no Michigan player was able to rush for 100 yards in the game. Accordingly, Michigan opened up the passing attack. Bo Schembechler said after the game, \\"When they put that many people on the line of scrimmage, you have to throw the ball over their heads.\\" In addition to the touchdown pass to Lytle, Leach connected with tight end Mark Shmerge in the second quarter for a seven-yard touchdown pass. Jim Smith also caught six passes for 127 yards. Leach's two touchdown passes gave him 13 for the season, tying the Michigan record set in 1947 by Bob Chappuis. After the game, Illinois coach Bob Blackman said, \\"Leach is not just a good quarterback, he is a great quarterback. We knew he could run the option, but he can also pass the ball.\\" On defense, Michigan held Illinois to 101 rushing yards and 79 passing yards. Calvin O'Neal also intercepted a Kurt Steger pass late in the second quarter to set up Michigan's third touchdown of the half. Dom Tedesco also intercepted a Steger pass to set up Michigan's fifth touchdown in the third quarter. Tackle Greg Morton led the team with 15 tackles in the game. Michigan concluded its home schedule with an average of 103,159 spectators per game, setting a new record for college football attendance. The prior record had been set by Michigan in 1975 with an average attendance of 98,449. Week 11: at Ohio State In the final game of the regular season, Michigan (ranked #4) traveled to Columbus, Ohio, for its annual rivalry game with Ohio State (ranked #8). Each team entered the game with one loss on its record, but Ohio State was undefeated in conference play. For the eighth time in nine years, the winner of the game would become the Big Ten Conference champion and earn the conference's berth in the Rose Bowl. The Wolverines had not beaten the Buckeyes since 1971, and Bo Schembechler had not won a game in Ohio Stadium. Stories ran about Schembechler being jinxed or hexed at Ohio Stadium, but Schembechler rejected the notion: \\"I don't look at it as a jinx.\\" On learning that his team was favored by 5-1/2 points, Schembechler said, \\"Being the favorite doesn't put any points on the board.\\" Michigan defeated Ohio State by a 22-0 score. The game drew a record crowd of 88,250 to Ohio Stadium and was broadcast to a national television audience. The game was the worst home loss for Ohio State since 1967, and it snapped Ohio State's streak of 122 games without being shut out. The last time an Ohio State team had been shut out was Michigan's 10-0 victory in 1964. After a scoreless first half, Russell Davis scored two touchdowns for Michigan in the third quarter. Davis tallied 83 yards on 24 carries. After Davis's second touchdown, holder Jerry Zuver ran for a two-point conversion. Rob Lytle rushed for 165 yards on 29 carries, including a touchdown in the fourth quarter. Rick Leach completed none of his six passes and threw an interception. Bob Wood converted on both of his extra point kicks.(To retrieve team statistics, enter the applicable year in the \\"Enter Year\\" box under the heading \\"Games & Totals by Season.\\" Press \\"Display Season.\\" At the next prompt, click the box for \\"Ohio State\\" and then click icon for \\"Display Chosen Game Stats\\".) On defense, the Wolverines became the first team to hold the Buckeyes scoreless since 1964. They held Ohio State to 173 yards of total offense, including 101 rushing yards and only five pass receptions. Defensive tackle Greg Morton led the team with 14 tackles, and Jim Pickens and Jerry Zuver each had an interception. Late in the second quarter, with the game still scoreless, Ohio State drove the ball to the Michigan 10-yard line when Pickens intercepted a pass in the end zone. After the game, Woody Hayes cited Pickens' interception as a turning point: \\"The interception at the end of the first half was a costly error on our part. It was my call all the way, and it was just a bad call. If we had scored then, it might have affected the second half outcome.\\" Michigan ended the season ranked first in the country in total offense (448.1 yards per game), scoring offense (38.7 points per game), and scoring defense (7.2 points per game). Rose Bowl The Rose Bowl With its victory over Ohio State, Michigan advanced to play the USC Trojans in the 1977 Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. Michigan came into the game ranked #2 in the AP Poll and #3 in the UPI coaches poll. USC was ranked #3 by the AP and #2 by the UPI. Michigan lost to the Trojans, 14-6. In the first quarter, neither team scored, and USC's Heisman Trophy runner-up Ricky Bell was injured and unable to return to the game. Michigan took a 6-0 lead on a one-yard touchdown run by Rob Lytle in the second quarter, but Bob Wood's extra point kick was blocked. The Trojans moved down field on the next drive, and quarterback Vince Evans put USC in the lead on a one-yard touchdown run with a minute-and-a-half left in the first half. Neither team scored in the third quarter, and freshman tailback Charles White scored USC's second touchdown with three minutes left in the game. White rushed for 122 yards in the game. Michigan's offense was held to 155 rushing yards and 76 passing yards. Rob Lytle gained 67 yards on 18 carries, and Russell Davis was limited to 39 yards on 10 carries. Rick Leach completed only 4 of 12 passes and was held to 34 rushing yards on 13 carries.(To retrieve team statistics, enter the applicable year in the \\"Enter Year\\" box under the heading \\"Games & Totals by Season.\\" Press \\"Display Season.\\" At the next prompt, click the box for \\"USC\\" and then click icon for \\"Display Chosen Game Stats\\".) Press coverage of the game focused on Michigan's conservative, run-oriented offense and USC's more versatile attack. Los Angeles Times columnist Jim Murray wrote: \\"Of course, it's possible Michigan doesn't know how to catch a pass. They never throw any, so may not know it's legal. The way they play the game you could hold it in a cave.\\" An Associated Press story noted: \\"It was the same old story. The Big Ten's Rose Bowl representative, a stick-to-the-ground team ... just couldn't cope with the versatility of its Pacific-8 Conference opponent.\\" Another writer noted that the Rose Bowl had become an annual \\"wake\\" for the Big 10: \\"It is rapidly becoming an annual event. Only the corpses are different.\\" Post-season Several Michigan players, led by Rob Lytle, received post- season honors and awards. Lytle, called \\"the greatest back I ever coached\\" by Bo Schembechler, was selected as a first-team All-American by both the AP, UPI, Walter Camp Foundation, American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Football News, and College Football News.(includes AP, UPI, and FWAA All- America teams and the AP and UPI Big Ten teams) In balloting for the Heisman Trophy, Lytle finished third with 35 first-place votes and 413 points, trailing Tony Dorsett (701 first-place votes, 2,357 points) and Ricky Bell (73 first-place votes, 1,346 points).

It is the largest county fair in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and the largest single attraction held annually in Snohomish County. Situated in Monroe, Washington, 35 miles northeast of Seattle and 12 miles east of Everett, the fairgrounds cover 193 acres with buildings and land valued at more than $50 million. The facilities are available for rent during the year, making the grounds a valuable community resource. A staff of 21 works year-round at the site and over 400 fair-time employees are hired each August. The Evergreen State Fairgrounds feature permanent facilities that are used year-round for Northwest horse shows, trade shows, swap meets, auto races and more. They are also home to the Gary Weikel Events Center (a 4,000 square foot multi-purpose building) and the Evergreen Speedway, the only NASCAR venue in Washington with a 7,000-seat covered grandstand. In addition the site hosts a clear-span sports arena that can seat 4,000, two RV areas with dump stations, and a variety of other permanent exhibition facilities. History The first agricultural show in Snohomish County was held in November 1874 by local farmers and tradesmen at the Blue Eagle Building in Snohomish. The Snohomish County Agricultural Society organized annual editions of the fair until 1878, sending exhibits to represent the county at a territorial fair in Olympia, but was unable to continue the event because of the ongoing national financial panic. Other fairs were held in Everett, the new county seat, Monroe, and Snohomish at various sites. The Snohomish County Fairgrounds was established in 1911 at a site on the west side of the city, but was only used by the county fair until 1916. The Snohomish County Fair moved to Granite Falls in 1922 and was later replaced by community fairs, named the Cavalcade of Valleys, in areas around Monroe during the Great Depression and World War II. The county fair was moved permanently to Monroe, opening at the modern-day fairgrounds on September 5, 1946, and renaming itself to the Evergreen State Fair in 1949. A 4,000-seat sports arena was completed in 1970, coinciding with a longer ten-day run for the fair. The fair has only been cancelled three times: during the 1918 influenza pandemic (lasting until 1921), World War II, and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

It premiered on the Fox network on September 30, 2009 and was written by series co-creator Ian Brennan and directed by John Scott. The episode features glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) recruiting former star April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), hoping to improve the club's chances in the wake of Rachel's (Lea Michele) defection to the school musical. Finn (Cory Monteith) flirts with Rachel in an attempt to convince her to return, and although Rachel is angry when she discovers Finn's girlfriend is pregnant, she ultimately rejoins the club. Special guest star Kristin Chenoweth played April, and performed on three of the episode's six musical tracks. Studio recordings of four of the songs performed in the episode were released as singles, available for digital download, and two appear on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1. The episode was watched by 7.32 million U.S. viewers. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, with Chenoweth's appearance and the performance of Queen cover \\"Somebody to Love\\" in particular receiving praise. Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal, Mike Hale of the New York Times and Denise Martin for the Los Angeles Times all deemed \\"Somebody to Love\\" the show's best musical number since the staging of Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believin' in the pilot episode. Plot With lead singer Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) no longer part of New Directions, the McKinley High glee club, director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) grows concerned about the club's forthcoming performance at Invitationals. He discovers that April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), a member of the club during his own high school days, never actually graduated, and convinces her to return to school in order to get her diploma and join the glee club. Having failed to achieve her Broadway dreams, April is now an alcoholic, and goes about winning the favor of the existing club members by unconventional means, including getting Kurt (Chris Colfer) drunk and teaching Mercedes (Amber Riley) and Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) to shoplift. After guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) warns Will that April is corrupting the students, Will asks April to become sober, and she vows to do so. Club member Finn (Cory Monteith) is concerned for his future, having been told by his girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron) that she is pregnant with his child. Emma suggests that instead of aiming to attend college on a football scholarship, Finn should utilize his musical talent. Believing Rachel's participation to be the glee club's only chance at success at Invitationals, Finn feigns romantic interest in Rachel and takes her on a date. Rachel, realizing she is unhappy performing in the school musical and excited over Finn's interest in her, returns to the glee club. Meanwhile, Kurt, Mercedes and Tina are informed of Quinn's pregnancy by Puck (Mark Salling), who pretends Finn fathered the child though he is the actual father. Finding out about Quinn, Rachel becomes furious with Finn and confronts him, asking if he is actually attracted to her at all. Finn insists the kiss they shared was honest, but Rachel is unconvinced and defects from glee club once again, returning to the school musical, where she is given full artistic control. At Invitationals, a drunk April, accompanied by the glee club, performs Carrie Underwood's \\"Last Name\\" for a packed auditorium and receives the standing ovation she always dreamed of. Because she had performed drunk, Will tells April during intermission that she is no longer in the glee club. She accepts, telling him that she has realized that it is the kids, not her, who are the ones that should get the spotlight. This leaves New Directions without a lead singer for their next number, but Rachel offers to go on in April's place‚Äîshe has quit the musical, and wants to rejoin the club‚Äîand they all perform Queen's \\"Somebody to Love\\". Production Chenoweth guest starred in the episode as former glee club member April Rhodes. April is an \\"alcoholic and bad influence on the glee club members\\", described by Chenoweth as someone who never graduated, but was \\"kind of the deal\\" in her high school glee club. She explained that April didn't become the \\"big star\\" everyone expected her to, and so is brought back by Will to become part of the glee club again. Chenoweth was previously acquainted with Glee creator Ryan Murphy, having appeared in his 2006 film Running with Scissors. Murphy commented that he loves writing for Chenoweth, and enjoyed pitching songs she had never sung before. She found singing in three different styles, as required by the role, to be \\"fun and challenging\\", and though she had never before sung \\"Maybe This Time\\", after singing it on Glee, she went on to use it in shows as her opening number. Chenoweth stated that she would love to return to Glee in the future, a sentiment shared by Murphy. She commented: \\"they are all working hard to figure out stories all the time. It'd be great for it to make sense for her to come back. This part is like nothing I've had the chance to do on TV.\\" It was confirmed in October 2009 that Chenoweth would reprise the role, which she did in \\"Home\\". Asked to explain Finn's actions in flirting with Rachel to entice her back into the glee club, Monteith explained: \\"Finn is not only strangely attracted to Rachel, but he respects what she chases after in her life. He's walking a thin line and trying to be somebody for everybody, and she's an example of someone truly following her dreams and that's attractive.\\" The episode features cover versions of \\"Don't Stop Believin' by Journey, \\"Maybe This Time\\" and \\"Cabaret\\" from Cabaret, \\"Alone\\" by Heart, \\"Last Name\\" by Carrie Underwood and \\"Somebody to Love\\" by Queen. Studio recordings of \\"Maybe This Time\\", \\"Alone\\", \\"Last Name\\" and \\"Somebody to Love\\" were released as singles, available for digital download. \\"Maybe This Time\\" charted at number 100 in Australia, and 88 in the US, \\"Alone\\" charted at number 94 in Australia, 58 in Canada and 51 in the US, and \\"Somebody to Love\\" charted at number 65 in Australia, 33 in Canada and 28 in the US. \\"Maybe This Time\\", \\"Alone\\" and \\"Somebody to Love\\" also feature on the album Glee: The Music, Volume 1. Reception Kristin Chenoweth was praised by critics for her performance as April Rhodes. The episode was watched by 7.32 million U.S. viewers and attained a 3.2/9 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. It was the most viewed episode of the season since its fall return with \\"Showmance\\". It was the twenty-sixth most watched show in Canada for the week of broadcast, with 1.45 million viewers. In the UK, the episode was watched by 1.89 million viewers (1.48 million on E4, and 410,000 on E4+1), becoming the most-watched show on cable for the week, as well as the most-watched episode of the series at the time. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Robert Bianco for USA Today wrote of Chenoweth's guest appearance: \\"Her presence may not make much sense, but that's probably all right. If it means hearing Chenoweth sing, we can put up with any explanation the show cares to offer.\\" Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal was equally positive regarding Chenoweth's role, praising her \\"powerful voice\\", \\"kittenish mien\\" and \\"commanding presence\\". Flandez deemed the performance of \\"Somebody to Love\\" the show's best number since \\"Don't Stop Believin debuted in the pilot episode. Mike Hale of the New York Times similarly stated that \\"The Rhodes Not Taken\\" was \\"the best episode musically since the pilot\\", calling the performance of \\"Somebody to Love\\" \\"truly rousing\\". TV Guide included the renditions of \\"Somebody To Love\\" and \\"Maybe This Time\\" in its list of Glee best performances so far. Jarett Wieselman for the New York Post called the episode: \\"the smartest, funniest, heart-warmingest, song-tastic-est episode of the show yet.\\" The Los Angeles Times Denise Martin also enjoyed the episode, writing: \\"I don't know how Glee keeps topping itself‚Äîit just does!\\" Martin too praised the performance of \\"Somebody to Love\\", writing: \\"Love or hate Queen, when New Directions sings it, it's magical. And it's the first time since 'Don't Stop Believin' that I got goosebumps. Something about kids singing songs, raising all those arms, makes everyone‚Äîcan't just be me!‚Äîgiddy and hopeful. They're not as technically skilled as [rival glee club] Vocal Adrenaline‚Äîyet‚Äîbut that only makes their underdog story more real.\\" Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly also called \\"The Rhodes Not Taken\\" the best episode of Glee so far, deeming all the musical numbers \\"fantastic\\". Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 8.5/10. He felt that Chenoweth was \\"terrific\\" as April, and that the character was a \\"hysterical creation\\". Goldman assessed that the episode \\"soared\\" musically, though felt that its resolution was \\"rushed\\" and \\"forced\\", suggesting that the series has yet to find the right balance between music, comedy and drama.

Before she finished college, she started work at Drexel Burnham Lambert as office manager from 1978 to 1985 for John Kissick in the Corporate Finance Department. She is married to Curt Mohl, whom she met when she was a cheerleader and he was a UCLA football player. They have three children. Red-Horse Native Productions Later, Red-Horse became the founder, president, and principal owner of Red-Horse Native Productions, Inc., a company specializing in motion picture and television production and Native American herbal skincare and hair care products. Naturally Native (1998) was filmed by Red-Horse Native Productions, and Red-Horse was writer, producer, co-director and lead actress for the film. The movie was funded by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation of Connecticut with financing from its Foxwoods Casino and premiered at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. Naturally Native received multiple festival awards and in 2007 Red-Horse Native Productions nationally distributed the film in Wal-Mart. Red-Horse followed with the World War II PBS/ITVS award winning documentary ‚ÄúTRUE WHISPERS: THE STORY OF THE NAVAJO CODE TALKERS‚Äù, produced with Gale Anne Hurd of Valhalla Entertainment. Red-Horse also produced/directed the ‚Äúprequel‚Äù follow up program, again with Hurd, CHOCTAW CODE TALKERS regarding the Code Talkers‚Äô involvement in World War I (Vision Maker Media/PBS). Over her career Red-Horse has produced/directed multiple Native American themed programs for public television including DIVERSITY IN THE DELTA, POP HUNTER‚ÄôS DEW DROP INN, WINDOWS ON MARS, LIVING VOICES and a 2012 cutting edge Native American cooking show featuring master chef Loretta Oden for FNX/PBS. As a writer Red-Horse penned the Emmy award winning MY INDIAN SUMMER (CBS) and AFI‚Äôs LOOKS INTO THE NIGHT in which she also starred as lead actress. Red-Horse is currently producing/directing (again in collaboration with Hurd for Vision Maker Media/PBS) the biographical documentary of Wilma Mankiller who served as the first female elected Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Red-Horse recently served as a co-curator for a comprehensive 100 year Native American film retrospective and national tour sponsored by the UCLA Film and Archive which toured the nation during 2014-2016. Native Nations and Red-Horse Financial Group In 1998 Red-Horse started a FINRA licensed securities Jersey City, New Jersey-based firm, Native Nations Securities, believed to be the first Native American owned investment banks. The firm provided financial services geared specifically to tribal finance, tribal economic development, and youth training programs. In 1999, in a desire to expand, Native Nations Securities identified for possible acquisition, a 96 year old New Jersey bond firm, Freeman Securities. In 2001 after nearly two years of due diligence, Ms. Red-Horse learned that a long-time employee of Freeman Securities had engaged in a series of fraudulent stock loan transactions prior to the acquisition, which were hidden on Freeman‚Äôs books and had been undisclosed to Red-Horse and the NASD auditors. Ms. Red-Horse and the other original directors of Native Nations Securities immediately reported these transactions to the U.S. Attorneys‚Äô Office, the Securities and Exchange Commission and NASD (now FINRA). With NASD approval, Red-Horse reversed the purchase agreement of Freeman Securities, then already known as Native Nations Securities. The purchase was reversed but some press continued to incorrectly associate Ms. Red-Horse with the subsequent SIPC payout and bankruptcy simply due to the premature name change from Freeman Securities. Red-Horse was never the target of any investigation relating to this matter. In 2004 Ms. Red-Horse moved her office to California and formed her own advisory corporation, Red-Horse Financial Group, Inc. clearing securities through Western International Securities. Since 2004 Red-Horse Financial Group, with Ms. Red-Horse at the helm, has closed several financing and advisory transactions for tribal clients establishing Red-Horse as a leading expert in the tribal finance space. In the course of her financial career, Red-Horse has structured, advised for and/or raised over $3 billion in capital for American Indian Tribal Nations. Philanthropy Red-Horse is the founder of both H.A.P.N. (the Hollywood Access Program for Natives) a non-profit training organization providing on the job mentorship to Native Americans in the film and television industry and ‚ÄúJesusize‚Äù a dance/exercise ministry serving urban women in rehabilitation residence at the Anne Douglas Center in downtown Los Angeles. In 2006, she and her family witnessed the severe living conditions of certain tribal members (mostly elders and children) located on a remote reservation in Northern Minnesota where unemployment exceeds 60%, the winter temperatures are extremely harsh and there is a general lack of basic services. As a response, Red-Horse and her family founded the White Earth Cass Lake Annual Short Term Mission Trip whereby mission teams repair and weatherproof trailers and homes, lead activities for the community children, host a family evening event and distribute elder gift bags every summer.

Since the MiG LMFS is not included in the Russia's state armament programme 2020‚Äì2027, UAC hopes that the export sales of MiG-35 and MiG-29 will be enough to help sustain the development of a new aircraft. It is reported that, with the US decision not to export F-35 stealth fighters to Turkey anymore, Turkish authorities may decide to acquire instead the Russian Su-57 with Russia sharing some of its technology to Turkey.

Early life Rahman Anwar Syed was born into a Muslim family of the village of Alawalpur, Punjab, British India, the eldest of seven children. His father, Major Dr. Abdul Majeed, was a doctor in the British Indian Army and a renowned malariologist. Given Dr. Majeed's frequent absence from home due to the demanding nature of his work, Dr. Syed became independent at an early age. The untimely loss of his mother added to the hardships of his childhood. Syed received his primary education at a local village school, sitting upon dirt mats outdoors in searing heat. It was after the harrowing 1947 Partition of India, when his family made the dangerous journey to the Pakistani city of Karachi, that Syed began to show his promise. There he gained admission to the renowned Dayaram Jethamal Science College, joining its University Officers Training Course and achieving success academically. Syed moved on to Lahore's prestigious Forman Christian College, where he developed a lasting interested in physical science and zoology. Syed was an avid sportsman, captaining Forman Christian College's football team and playing racquet sports. Throughout life he was a passionate fan of cricket. In the latter stages of his youth, Syed delved into acting, playing a lead role in the Pakistan Television drama, Lagan Apni Apni. Further education and career Rahman Anwar Syed‚Äôs first job, in 1962, was one teaching zoology at Gordon College, Rawalpindi, a post he held for six years. In 1968 he joined the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control and became involved in entomological research. His initial work with the institute involved the biological control of fruit flies, an endeavor especially important to Pakistan's agricultural sector. At this time he completed his formal education, being awarded a PhD from the University of Punjab in Lahore. Oil palm pollination research and discovery After his doctoral studies, Syed was posted by the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control to Sabah, Malaysia, where he gained a measure of notoriety for his work that led to the doing away of certain insecticides through the use of a virus to control palm leaf-eating nettle caterpillars. Leslie Davidson, then Chairman of Unilever oil palm plantations in Malaysia, hired Syed to investigate a hunch he had on the possibility of oil palm pollination being doable by insects rather than, as conventional wisdom had it, solely by wind or by hand. Syed's field and laboratory research in Cameroon yielded the conclusive discovery of the most efficient pollinator of the oil palm, the weevil species Elaeidobious kamerunicus. In 1979 he published his findings in the Bulletin of Entomological Research. The newly recognized African oil palm weevil, E. kamerunicus, was approved for importation and brought to the plantations of Malaysia in 1981. Its release was a great success, dramatically improving palm oil production, ending the costly and time-consuming practice of hand- pollination, and speeding plantation expansion, all with little to no negative biological impact. Later life and legacy For his contribution to the Sabah and Malaysia's economic and social wellbeing, the Malaysian state of Sabah bestowed upon Rahman Anwar Syed the honorary title of Datuk. In its first post-release year alone, E. kamerunicus was calculated to have increased Malaysian oil palm production by approximately US $370 million. The weevil has since been employed as chief pollinator of oil palms in all other parts of the world where it did not already exist, and its economic impact has continued to build exponentially over the years. Syed fathered four sons by his wife of fifty-one years. He remained active in entomology consulting and in business until his death, founding, owning, and chairing Nourbiz Pvt. Ltd., a Pakistani snack food company responsible for the well-known Korneez brand. He died at his home in Islamabad after a long battle with colorectal cancer.

Created from the imperial retinue army, the Opsikion was the largest and most prestigious of the early themes, being located closest to Constantinople. Involved in several revolts in the 8th century, it was split in three after ca. 750, and lost its former pre-eminence. It survived as a middle-tier theme until after the Fourth Crusade. History The Opsician theme was one of the first four themes, and has its origin in the praesental armies of the East Roman army. The term Opsikion derives from the Latin term Obsequium (\\"retinue\\"), which by the early 7th century came to refer to the units escorting the emperor on campaign.. It is possible that at an early stage, the Opsikion was garrisoned inside Constantinople itself.. In the 640s, however, following the disastrous defeats suffered during the first wave of the Muslim conquests, the remains of the field armies were withdrawn to Asia Minor and settled into large districts, called \\"themes\\" (themata).. Thus the Opsician theme was the area where the imperial Opsikion was settled, which encompassed all of north-western Asia Minor (Mysia, Bithynia, parts of Galatia, Lydia and Paphlagonia) from the Dardanelles to the Halys River, with Ancyra as its capital. The exact date of the theme's establishment is unknown; the earliest reference points to a creation as early as 626, but the first confirmed occurrence is in 680.... It is possible that it also initially included the area of Thrace, which seems to have been administered jointly with the Opsikion in the late 7th and early 8th centuries.. Signet ring of Leontios, patrikios and Count of the God-guarded imperial Opsikion The unique origin of the Opsikion was reflected in several aspects of the theme's organization. Thus the title of its commander was not stratƒìgos (œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒ∑Œ≥œåœÇ, \\"general\\") as with the other themes, but komƒìs (Œ∫œåŒºŒ∑œÇ, \\"count\\"), in full komƒìs tou basilikou Opsikiou (, \\"Count of the imperial Opsikion\\"). Furthermore, it was not divided into tourmai, but into domesticates formed from the elite corps of the old army, such as the Optimatoi and Boukellarioi, both terms dating back to the recruitment of Gothic foederati in the 4th‚Äì6th centuries.. Its prestige is further illustrated by the seals of its commanders, where it is called the \\"God-guarded imperial Opsikion\\" (; Latin: a Deo conservandum imperiale Obsequium). Being the theme closest to the imperial capital Constantinople and enjoying a position of pre-eminence among the other themes, the counts of the Opsikion were often tempted to revolt against the emperors. Already in 668, on the death of Emperor Constans II in Sicily, the count Mezezius staged an abortive coup.. Under the patrikios Barasbakourios, the Opsikion was the main power-base of Emperor Justinian II (r. 685‚Äì695 and 705‚Äì711). Justinian II also settled many Slavs captured in Thrace there, in an attempt to boost its military strength. Most of them, however, deserted to the Arabs on the first battle.. In 713, the Opsikian army rose up against Philippikos Bardanes (r. 711‚Äì713), the man who overthrew and murdered Justinian, and enthroned Anastasios II (r. 713‚Äì715), only to overthrow him too in 715 and install Theodosios III (r. 715‚Äì717) in his place.; . In 717, the Opsicians supported the rise of Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717‚Äì740) to the throne, but in 718, their count, the patrikios Isoes, rose up unsuccessfully against him. In 741‚Äì742, the kouropalatƒìs Artabasdos used the theme as a base for his brief usurpation of Emperor Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775). In 766, another count was blinded after a failed mutiny against the same emperor. The revolts of the Opsician theme against the Isaurian emperors were not only the result of its counts' ambition: the Opsicians were staunchly iconodule, and opposed to the iconoclast policies of the Isaurian dynasty.. As a result, Emperor Constantine V set out to weaken the theme's power by splitting off the new themes of the Boukellarioi and the Optimatoi... At the same time, the emperor recruited a new set of elite and staunchly iconoclast guard regiments, the tagmata.. Consequently, the reduced Opsikion was downgraded from a guard formation to an ordinary cavalry theme: its forces were divided into tourmai, and its count fell to the sixth place in the hierarchy of thematic governors and was even renamed to the \\"ordinary\\" title of stratƒìgos by the end of the 9th century.. In the 9th century, he is recorded as receiving an annual salary of 30 pounds of gold, and of commanding 6,000 men (down from an estimated 18,000 of the old Opsikion).. The thematic capital was moved to Nicaea. The 10th-century emperor Constantine Porphyrogennetos, in his De Thematibus, mentions further nine cities in the theme: Cotyaeum, Dorylaeum, Midaion, Apamea, Myrleia, Lampsacus, Parion, Cyzicus and Abydus. In the great Revolt of Thomas the Slav in the early 820s, the Opsikion remained loyal to Emperor Michael II (r. 820‚Äì829).. In 866, the Opsician stratƒìgos, George Peganes, rose up along with the Thracesian Theme against Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867‚Äì886), then the junior co-emperor of Michael III (r. 842‚Äì867), and in c. 930, Basil Chalkocheir revolted against Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920‚Äì944). Both revolts, however, were easily quelled, and are a far cry from the emperor-making revolts of the 8th century. The theme existed through the Komnenian period,. and was united with the Aegean theme sometime in the 12th century.. It apparently also survived after the Fourth Crusade into the Empire of Nicaea: George Akropolites records that in 1234, the Opsician theme fell under the \\"Italians\\" (Latin Empire).

It has about 879,000 inhabitants, and Erbil Governorate has a permanent population of 2,069,420 . \\"Human\\" settlement at Erbil may be dated back to the 5th millennium BC, which would make the city one of the oldest continuously inhabited areas in the world. At the heart of the city is the ancient Citadel of Erbil and Mudhafaria Minaret. The earliest historical reference to the region dates to the Third Dynasty of Ur of Sumer, when King Shulgi mentioned the city of Urbilum. The city was later conquered by the Assyrians. Erbil became an integral part of the kingdom of Assyria by the 21st century BC through to the end of the seventh century BC, after it was captured by the Gutians, and it was known in Assyrian annals variously as Urbilim, Arbela and Arba-ilu. Subsequent to this, it was part of the geopolitical province of Assyria under several empires in turn, including the Median Empire, the Achaemenid Empire (Achaemenid Assyria), Macedonian Empire, Seleucid Empire, Armenian Empire, Parthian Empire, Roman Assyria and Sasanian Empire (As≈çristƒÅn), as well as being the capital of the tributary state of Adiabene between the mid-second century BC and early second century AD. Following the Muslim conquest of Persia, it no longer remained a unitary region, and during the Middle Ages, the city came to be ruled by the Seljuk and Ottoman empires.Georges Roux ‚Äì Ancient Iraq Erbil's archaeological museum houses a large collection of pre-Islamic artefacts, particularly the art of Mesopotamia, and is a center for archaeological projects in the area. The city was designated as Arab Tourism Capital 2014 by the Arab Council of Tourism.Erbil named 2014 Arab Tourism Capital. Retrieved 30 January 2014\\"Erbil: Kurdish City, Arab Capital\\", Rudaw. Retrieved 30 January 2014 In July 2014, the Citadel of Arbil was inscribed as a World Heritage site. The city has an ethnically diverse population of Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians, Arabs and Armenians. It is equally religiously diverse, with believers of Sunni Islam, Shia Islam, Christianity, Yarsanism and Yazidism. Etymology The name Erbil was mentioned in Sumerian holy writings of third millennium BC as Urbilum, Urbelum or Urbillum, which appears to originate from Arbilum. Later, the Akkadians and Assyrians by a folk etymology rendered the name as arba'≈´ il≈´ to mean (four gods). The city became a centre for the worship of the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar. In classical times the city became known as Arbela (), from the Syriac form of the name. In Old Persian, the city was called ArbairƒÅ. Today, the modern Kurdish name of the city, Hewl√™r, appears to be a corruption of the name Arbel by a series of metatheses of consonants.

Today the Assyrian people, a Syriac-speaking community who claim descent from Akkadian speakers, endure as a minority in northern Iraq, north east Syria, south east Turkey and north west Iran, their population is estimated to be 3.3 million. The first mention of Erbil in literary sources comes from the archives of the East Semitic-speaking kingdom of Ebla. They record two journeys to Erbil (Irbilum) by a messenger from Ebla around 2300 BC. Erridupizir, king of the language isolate speaking kingdom of Gutium, captured the city in 2150 BC.Timeline ErbilCitadel.orq The Neo- Sumerian ruler of Ur, Amar-Sin, sacked Urbilum in his second year, c. 1975 BC. Erbil was an integral part of Assyria from around 2050 BC, becoming a relatively important city during the Old Assyrian Empire (1975‚Äì1750 BC), Middle Assyrian Empire (1365‚Äì1050 BC) and the Neo Assyrian Empire (935‚Äì605 BC), until the last of these empires fell between 612‚Äì599 BC. However, it remained part of Assyria under Persian, Greek, Parthian, Roman and Sassanid rule until the first half of the 7th century AD. Under the Median Empire, Cyaxares might have settled a number of people from the Ancient Iranian tribe of Sagartians in the Assyrian cities of Arbela and Arrapha (modern Kirkuk), probably as a reward for their help in the capture of Nineveh. According to Classical authors, the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great occupied Assyria in 547 BC and established it as an Achaemenid satrapy called in Old Persian AŒ∏urƒÅ (Athura), with Babylon as the capital.Yarshater, Ehsan (1993). The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 3. Cambridge University Press. p. 482. . \\"Of the four residences of the Achaemenids named by Herodotus‚ÄîEcbatana, Pasargadae or Persepolis, Susa and Babylon‚Äîthe last [situated in Iraq] was maintained as their most important capital, the fixed winter quarters, the central office of bureaucracy, exchanged only in the heat of summer for some cool spot in the highlands. Under the Seleucids and the Parthians the site of the Mesopotamian capital moved slightly to the north on the Tigris‚Äîto Seleucia and Ctesiphon. It is indeed symbolic that these new foundations were built from the bricks of ancient Babylon, just as later Baghdad, a little further upstream, was built out of the ruins of the Sassanian double city of Seleucia-Ctesiphon.\\" The Battle of Gaugamela, in which Alexander the Great defeated Darius III of Persia, took place in 331 BC approximately west of Erbil. After the battle, Darius managed to flee to the city. (Somewhat inaccurately, the confrontation is sometimes known as the \\"Battle of Arbela\\".) Subsequently, Arbela was part of Alexander's Empire. After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Arbela became part of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire. Erbil became part of the region disputed between Rome and Persia under the Sasanids.

Its populace then gradually converted from the Mesopotamian religion between the 1st and 4th centuries to Christianity‚Äîprimarily the Chaldean Catholic Church (and to a lesser degree to the Syriac Orthodox Church), with Pkidha traditionally becoming its first bishop around 104 AD. The ancient Mesopotamian religion did not die out entirely in the region until the 10th century AD. The metropolitanate of ·∏§adyab in Arbela (Syriac: Arbel) became a centre of eastern Syriac Christianity until late in the Middle Ages. Medieval history As many of the Assyrians who had converted to Christianity adopted Biblical (including Jewish) names, most of the early bishops had Eastern Aramaic or Jewish/Biblical names, which does not suggest that many of the early Christians in this city were converts from Judaism.Gillman, Ian and Hans- Joachim Klimkeit. Christians in Asia before 1500. (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1999) p. 33 It served as the seat of a Metropolitan of the Assyrian Church of the East. From the city's Christian period come many church fathers and well-known authors in Syriac. Following the Muslim conquest of Persia, the Sasanid province of Assuristan, of which Erbil made part of, was dissolved, and from the mid 7th century AD the region saw a gradual influx of Muslim peoples, predominantly Arabs, Kurds and Turkic peoples. The most notable Kurdish tribe in the region were the Hadhabani, of which several individuals also acted as governors for the city from the late 10th century until the 12th century when it was conquered by the Zengids and its governorship given to the Turkic Begtegenids, of whom the most notable was G√∂kb√∂ri, who retained the city during the Ayyubid era V.

When the Mongols invaded the Near East in the 13th century, they attacked Arbil for the first time in 1237. They plundered the lower town but had to retreat before an approaching Caliphate army and had to put off the capture of the citadel. After the fall of Baghdad to H√ºleg√º and the Mongols in 1258, the last Begtegenid ruler surrendered to the Mongols, claiming the Kurdish garrison of the city would follow suit; they refused this however, therefore the Mongols returned to Arbil and were able to capture the citadel after a siege lasting six months.J. von Hammer-Purgstall. 1842. Geschichte der Ilchane, das ist der Mongolen in Persien, Volume 1. P. 159-161. H√ºleg√º then appointed an Assyrian Christian governor to the town, and the Syriac Orthodox Church was allowed to build a church. As time passed, sustained persecutions of Christians, Jews and Buddhists throughout the Ilkhanate began in earnest in 1295 under the rule of O√Ørat amir Nauruz, which affected the indigenous Assyrian Christians greatly.Grousset, p. 379 This manifested early on in the reign of the Ilkhan Ghazan. In 1297, after Ghazan had felt strong enough to overcome Nauruz's influence, he put a stop to the persecutions. During the reign of the Ilkhan √ñljeit√º the Assyrian inhabitants retreated to the citadel to escape persecution. In the Spring of 1310, the Malek (governor) of the region attempted to seize it from them with the help of the Kurds. Despite the Turkic bishop Mar Yahballaha's best efforts to avert the impending doom, the citadel was at last taken after a siege by Ilkhanate troops and Kurdish tribesmen on 1 July 1310, and all the defenders were massacred, including many of the Assyrian inhabitants of the lower town.Grousset, p. 383 However, the city's Assyrian population remained numerically significant until the destruction of the city by the forces of Timur in 1397.Edwin Munsell Bliss, Turkey and the Armenian Atrocities, (Chicago 1896) p. 153 In the Middle Ages, Erbil was ruled successively by the Umayyads, the Abbasids, the Buwayhids, the Seljuks and then the Turkmen Begtegƒ´nid Emirs of Erbil (1131‚Äì1232), most notably G√∂kb√∂ri, one of Saladin's leading generals; they were in turn followed by the Ilkhanids, the Jalayirids, the Kara Koyunlu, the Timurids and the Ak Koyunlu. Erbil was the birthplace of the famous 12th and 13th century Kurdish historians and writers Ibn Khallikan and Ibn al-Mustawfi. After Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 Erbil came under Soran emirate In 18th century Baban Emirate took the city but it was retaken by Soran ruler Mir Muhammed Kor in 1822 The Soran emirate continued ruling over Erbil until it was taken by the Ottomans in 1851. Erbil became a part of the Musul Vilayet in Ottoman Empire for until World War I, when the Ottomans and their Kurdish and Turcoman allies were defeated by the British Empire. Modern history A postcard showing the city of Erbil in 1900 The modern town of Erbil stands on a tell topped by an Ottoman fort. During the Middle Ages, Erbil became a major trading center on the route between Baghdad and Mosul, a role which it still plays today with important road links to the outside world. Erbil Main Square Today, Erbil is both multi-ethnic and multi-religious, with the Kurds forming the largest ethnic group in the city, with smaller numbers of Arabs, Assyrians, Turcoman, Armenians, Yazidis, Shabaks, Circassians, Kawliya, Iranians and Mandeans also extant. Erbil is also home to a large population of refugees due to ongoing conflicts in Syria and in the rest of Iraq. In 2020, it was estimated that 450,000 refugees had settled in the Erbil metropolitan area since 2003, with many of them expected to remain. The parliament of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region was established in Erbil in 1970 after negotiations between the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by Mustafa Barzani, but was effectively controlled by Saddam Hussein until the Kurdish uprising at the end of the 1991 Gulf War. The legislature ceased to function effectively in the mid-1990s when fighting broke out between the two main Kurdish factions, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The city was captured by the KDP in 1996 with the assistance of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. The PUK then established an alternative Kurdish government in Sulaimaniyah. KDP claimed that on March 1996 PUK asked for Iran's help to fight KDP. Considering this as a foreign attack on Iraq's soil, the KDP asked Saddam Hussein for help. The Kurdish Parliament in Erbil reconvened after a peace agreement was signed between the Kurdish parties in 1997, but had no real power. The Kurdish government in Erbil had control only in the western and northern parts of the autonomous region. During the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, a United States special forces task force was headquartered just outside Erbil. The city was the scene of celebrations on 10 April 2003 after the fall of the Ba'ath regime. Erbil Clock Tower During the coalition forces occupation of Iraq, sporadic attacks hit Erbil. Parallel bomb attacks against Eid celebrations killed 109 people on 1 February 2004. Responsibility was claimed by the Ansar al-Sunnah, and stated to be in solidarity with Ansar al-Islam. A suicide bombing on 4 May 2005 killed 60 civilians and injured 150 more outside a police recruiting centre. The Erbil International Airport opened in the city in 2005. In 2015, the Assyrian Church of the East moved its seat from Chicago to Erbil. Transportation Erbil International Airport is one of Iraq's busiest airports and it is near the city. Services include direct flights to many domestic destinations such as Baghdad international airport. There are international flights from Erbil to many countries; such as the Netherlands, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Turkey, Jordan and many more flights elsewhere around the world. There are occasionally seasonal flights from Erbil international airport. Erbil International Airport was briefly closed to international commercial flights in September 2017 by the Iraqi government in retaliation for the Kurdish independence vote but reopened in March 2018. Another important form of transportation between Erbil and the surrounding areas is by bus. Among others, bus services offer connections to Turkey and Iran. A new bus terminal was opened in 2014. Erbil has a system of five ring roads encirling the city. Climate Erbil has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa), with long, extremely hot summers and mild winters. Summer months are extremely dry, with little to no precipitation occurring between June and September. Winters are usually wet and humid, with January being the wettest month. Culture=Citadel of Erbil The Citadel of Erbil is a tell or occupied mound in the historical heart of Erbil, rising between from the surrounding plain. The buildings on top of the tell stretch over a roughly oval area of occupying . It has been claimed that the site is the oldest continuously inhabited town in the world. The earliest evidence for occupation of the citadel mound dates to the 5th millennium BC and possibly earlier. It appears for the first time in historical sources during the Ur III period and gained particular importance during the Neo-Assyrian Empire (10th to 7th centuries BC) period. West of the citadel at Ary Kon quarter, a chamber tomb dating to the Neo-Assyrian Empire period has been excavated. During the Sassanian period and the Abbasid Caliphate, Erbil was an important centre for Assyrian Christianity and the Assyrians. After the Mongols captured the citadel in 1258, Erbil's importance began to decline. During the 20th century, the urban structure was significantly modified, as a result of which a number of houses and public buildings were destroyed. In 2007, the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) was established to oversee the restoration of the citadel. In the same year, all inhabitants, except one family, were evicted from the citadel as part of a large restoration project. Since then, archaeological research and restoration works have been carried out at and around the tell by various international teams and in co-operation with local specialists, and many areas remain off-limits to visitors due to the danger of unstable walls and infrastructure. The government plans to have 50 families live in the citadel once it is renovated. The only religious structure that currently survives in the citadel is the Mulla Afandi Mosque. When it was fully occupied, the citadel was divided in three districts or mahallas: from east to west the Serai, the Takya and the Topkhana. The Serai was occupied by notable families; the Takya district was named after the homes of dervishes, which are called takyas; and the Topkhana district housed craftsmen and farmers. Other sights to visit in the citadel include the bathing rooms (hammam) built in 1775 located near the mosque and the Textile Museum.'Erbil Citadel' Brochure, High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR). www.erbilcitadel.org Erbil citadel has been inscribed on the World Heritage List on 21 June 2014 .

Background and production After solid sales with their debut, Cartel's decision to record their second album on the MTV program Band in a Bubble in 2007 proved costly. Their self-titled follow up effort sold less than half the records of their debut, Chroma. Cartel was consequently released from its contract with Epic Records and left to find a new label.

In July 2008, the band's signing to the label was announced. Wind-up opted to sanction the band an extended period of time to record the album, since their previous works had been completed in less than a month.

Its name means \\"The Old Woman's Corner\\", a reference to a local legend about princess Curabanda whose lover Mixcoac, chief of a neighboring enemy tribe, who was thrown into the crater by her father Curabande, when he learned about their affair. She went on living on the side of the volcano, giving birth to a son. To be with its father, she threw her son into the volcano, too. She continued to live on the volcano and became a recluse living on the mountain, and was credited with powers of healing. Rinc√≥n de la Vieja stands above sea level, and its summit is the highest point in Rinc√≥n de la Vieja National Park. It erupted most recently in June 2020. The volcano has many fumaroles and hot springs on its slopes. It is formed by felsic lava. Rinc√≥n de la Vieja is one of six active Costa Rican volcanoes: the others are Po√°s, Iraz√∫, Miravalles, Arenal, and Turrialba. As of 2020, only Rincon de la Vieja, Turrialba and Poas are considered active. Geothermal energy Hot Spring in Rinc√≥n de la Vieja National Park, Costa Rica Detail of the volcano There are many hot pools and areas of bubbling mud in two areas on the slopes of the volcano, indicating substantial reserves of geothermal energy. Investigations have been carried out into the feasibility of tapping these reserves, and the volcano is estimated to have a generating potential of 140 megawatts. However, as the area is protected within a national park, drilling was limited to test wells until 2001.Huttrer G.W.

Previously, hikers could climb to the crater and guides experienced in wildlife, birdwatching, geology and other interests are available. As of September 22, 2011, access to the crater is no longer available due to the eruption of September 16 where volcanic ash and mud rose over from the regular crater lagoon.

He was included on both the 2009 mid-season and the 2009 preseason watchlist for the Butkus Award. He was the active Michigan Wolverines football career leader in tackles. In high school, he played running back on offense more regularly than linebacker on defense. He shared running duties as a sophomore and junior before becoming the starter as a senior at Catholic Central High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He established his school career rushing record of nearly 3,000 yards. As a senior, he scored a two- point conversion to give his school a one-point victory and a berth in the 2005 Michigan High School Athletic Association state championship game at Ford Field. He was also a member of a three-time state champion high school rugby team and was invited to try out with the United States national rugby union team. At Michigan, he redshirted as a true freshman. Then, as a redshirt freshman for the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team, he battled for the starting middle linebacker position and appeared to have lost the position early in the season. However, after an injury he became a regular starter. He concluded the season with thirteen and twelve tackle efforts against bitter rivals Michigan State and Ohio State, respectively. He started his redshirt sophomore season with a Big Ten Conference defensive player of the week, fifteen-tackle effort for the 2008 Michigan Wolverines football team. He finished the season as an honorable mention All-Big Ten Conference selection. Just after earning 2009 midseason Butkus Award watchlist recognition, he was removed from the starting lineup and saw limited action in the final four games. After his senior season in 2010, Ezeh declared for the 2011 NFL Draft, where he went undrafted. He later signed as an undrafted free agent with the Washington Redskins. High school As a youth, Ezeh was unable to play football because he was too big for the local leagues according to Grand Rapids area officials. As a sophomore running back for the 2003 Catholic Central Cougars football team, Ezeh had several 100-yard games as well as multiple touchdown games, even though he was not the primary weapon in the backfield. Ezeh was also a member of the Cougars rugby team that placed 11th at the 2004 United States High School Rugby National Championships. As a junior running back, he opened his football season with 170 yards on 18 carries. In the 2004 district championship game, he rushed for 88 yards in the first half, but was held to 5 in the second half as Catholic Central lost 33-20. Over the course of the season he compiled 907 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. Ezeh was recognized as a Detroit News Class B All-state honorable mention linebacker. He was also selected as Grand Rapids All-area honorable mention, according to The Grand Rapids Press. He also helped lead the 2005 rugby team to a State Championship threepeat. In 2005, Ezeh entered his senior season as the focal point of his school's running game and was rated as the seventh-best football prospect in the state of Michigan, according to The Detroit News. He was also invited to try out for the United States national rugby union team as an outside center. During the season, Ezeh was regularly among the leading rushers in the area. In the Division 4 state semifinal game, Ezeh returned a kickoff 80 yards for a touchdown and rushed for 136 yards on 24 carries. During the game, after Catholic Central scored on a quarterback sneak with 2:28 remaining, Ezeh scored on a two-point conversion to give his team a 35-34 victory. This led them to the 2005 MHSAA state championship game at Ford Field, which they lost 17-10 to Powers Catholic High School. By the end of the season, Ezeh had compiled a school record 2,914 career rushing yards, which included 33 touchdowns. During his senior year, he also occasionally played linebacker, recording 34 tackles (16 for a loss). Although, he missed part of the season with an ankle injury, he totaled 1,391 yards and 10 touchdowns on 217 carries and added seven pass receptions, including one touchdown, and he was recognized as a 2nd-team All-area running back. The Detroit News recognized him as their postseason number six blue chip prospect in the state, and he was selected to play in the Michigan High School Football Coaches Association's annual all-star game. In February 2006, he signed his letter of intent to play for Michigan, where it was unclear whether he would play fullback, tight end or linebacker. Michigan As expected, Ezeh, who had suffered a shoulder injury, redshirted his freshman year. Prior to his redshirt freshman season, he changed jersey numbers from 44 to 45 as he converted from fullback to linebacker. On May 22, 2007, he was charged with suspicion of operating a vehicle while intoxicated for an incident when his vehicle struck a utility pole on the same street on which he lives while his blood-alcohol content was 0.11% (the legal limit in Michigan is 0.08%). Ezeh pleaded not guilty, and the trial was scheduled for September 19 in the 15th District Court. The time of the accident was outside the permissible times for Ezeh's restricted driving license that resulted from a prior non-alcohol- related accident. On the football field, redshirt freshman Ezeh entered the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season for the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team in a three-way battle to replace NFL-bound David Harris at middle linebacker with redshirt junior John Thompson and junior college transfer Austin Panter, who had been named national junior college defensive player of the year. Harris also hailed from Grand Rapids and had worn the number 45. The week before the season opener, The Detroit News declared Ezeh the starter, however, the Ann Arbor News and Ezeh's hometown The Grand Rapids Press both stated that the race between Ezeh and Thompson was undecided heading into the game. In the aftermath of the September 1, opening game loss to two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers, more was made of the fact that both players had trouble playing the position than who had started the game. Ezeh started the first game, but lost his spot to Thompson in the next two. After three weeks of play, Thompson, who had been voted the hardest hitter on the team the previous two seasons, had established himself as the starter by ranking second on the team in tackles. However, although Thompson had stepped up to the role he was notable for having trouble with pass coverage. Ezeh accumulated no statistics in the third and fourth game, but recorded his first interception in the fifth game on September 29 against Northwestern on a deflected pass. Ezeh started that game because of an injury. The following week, he again started in place of the injured Thompson and recorded nine tackles against Eastern Michigan. He also forced a fumble and fielded one kickoff return. Even though Thompson recovered from his ankle injury after four weeks, Ezeh retained the starting job the remainder of the season for a total of ten starts. Thompson only recorded four tackles the rest of the year. On November 1, his lawyer stated that on August 29 Ezeh had pleaded guilty to an operating while visibly intoxicated charge, which is a serious misdemeanor but a lesser charge than the original operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and had sought alcohol counseling prior to his sentence. The plea resulted in a year's probation, three days in a work release program, a substantial payment covering fines, court costs and restitution. He committed to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving class. In the November 3 Paul Bunyan Trophy victory against Michigan State he recorded a season-high 13 tackles and two sacks. One of the sacks occurred on Michigan State's final series of downs in Michigan territory to help secure the 28-24 win. Ezeh recorded 12 tackles in the Michigan ‚Äì Ohio State rivalry game against Ohio State on November 17 to end the regular season. Obi Ezeh on September 5, 2009 After the graduation of Shawn Crable and Chris Graham there was again a notable battle for linebacker positions entering the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season for the 2008 Michigan Wolverines football team. Ezeh who had posted 68 tackles in 2007 was the leading returning tackler. As the only returning starting linebacker, Ezeh assumed the role of mentor. Ezeh won the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week award on September 1, 2008 for a game against the Utah Utes where he recorded 15 tackles and an interception. He also earned an ABC Player of the Game recognition. Ezeh also posted fifteen tackles in the October 4 game against the Illinois Fighting Illini, which earned him his second ABC Player of the Game award. He posted two other double digit tackle games, including a ten tackle effort in his second Paul Bunyan Trophy game. Ezeh finished the season seventh in the Big Ten in tackles. He was recognized as an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection by both the coaches and the media. He won the 2008 Roger Zatkoff Award as Michigan's top linebacker. Ezeh lines up Theo Riddick during 2009 Michigan-Notre Dame rivalry game. Ezeh entered the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season opener with the third most career starts (23) on the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team behind punter Zoltan Mesko (38) and offensive lineman Stephen Schilling (26). As a redshirt junior during the 2009 season for the Wolverines, Ezeh posted fourteen tackles against Michigan State bringing his three-game career total to 37 tackles against the Spartans. Ezeh had grown up in a neighborhood with many Michigan State fans who flew their Michigan State flags, and he once attended Michigan Football camp wearing a Michigan State shirt. He has been included on both the 2009 midseason and the 2009 preseason watchlist for the Butkus Award. The midseason list includes sixteen linebackers. Although he was added to the midseason Butkus watchlist in mid October, on October 31 he was removed from the starting lineup after starting 29 straight games. 2010 Wolverines vs. the 2010 Connecticut Huskies (including #32 Jordan Kovacs, #8 Jonas Mouton, #45 Ezeh, #68 Mike Martin and #88 Craig Roh During the 2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season he started the first six games for the 2010 Michigan Wolverines football team before losing the starting middle linebacker position to Kenny Demens. Ezeh's final regular start was against Michigan State on October 9, when he tied his season-high with nine tackles and boosted his career total against Michigan State to 46. When Jonas Mouton was unavailable for the Purdue game on November 13 due to a chest injury, Ezeh stepped in and recorded his first sack of the season as well as eight solo tackles. Professional career At his initial March 17, 2011 pro day, he posted modest numbers: 40-yard dash - 5.07 seconds; vertical jump and standing broad jump . However, after hiring a new trainer he posted better numbers at an April regional combine: 40-yard dash - 4.81 seconds; vertical jump and standing broad jump as well as a 4.81 time in the 20-yard shuttle. He went undrafted in the 2011 NFL Draft and in the first few days following the 2011 NFL lockout he went unsigned, before signing with the Washington Redskins as an undrafted free agent on July 31, 2011.

Molk previously played college football at the same position for University of Michigan, where he was a consensus All-American and won the 2011 Rimington Trophy as the best center in college football. He played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the Philadelphia Eagles, and the San Diego Chargers. Molk grew up in the Chicago area and played high school football at Lemont Township High School. He was named an All-State player by the Chicago Tribune and was selected to play in the first East-West All-America Football Game in January 2007. Molk enrolled at the University of Michigan in 2007. He missed portions of the 2008 and 2009 seasons with injury. As a redshirt junior in 2010, Molk was the cornerstone in an offensive line that helped Denard Robinson break the Big Ten Conference single-season record with 4,189 yards of total offense. Molk was recognized as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player at the end of the 2010 season. As a redshirt senior in 2011, Molk anchored a line that led the way for Denard Robinson and Fitzgerald Toussaint to become Michigan's first duo of 1,000-yard rushers since 1975. At the end of the 2011 season, he won the Rimington Trophy and was a consensus first-team All-American. Molk was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the seventh round of the 2012 NFL Draft. He appeared in 12 games, none as a starter, for the Chargers during the 2012 NFL season. High school Molk was once a Lemont Township High School freshman who could only bench press and squat . By the end of his junior year, he was one of the most highly recruited high school football players in the Chicago metropolitan area. By his senior season, he was a center who could bench press , squat and power clean . His high school gym closed at 5:00 PM and he had to go into town for extra workout time. He chose to be a center because, although he is too short to be a major Division I college football offensive guard or offensive tackle, he had the potential to be a successful center. He was actually discovered when a scout came to his school to watch a teammate. During the summer prior to his senior season, he made a verbal commitment to the University of Michigan, in part due to its business school, the Ross School of Business. At the end of his junior year he had received scholarship offers from ten schools, including six Big Ten Conference football programs. As a senior, Molk was selected to numerous All- area football teams by various organizations including The Star, Daily Southtown, and Prep Football Report selected by Tom Lemming. In addition, he was selected to the Chicago Tribune All-State team, and he was selected to play in the first East-West All-America Football Game sponsored by ESPN and MLS Sports in Orlando, Florida suburb Lake Buena Vista on January 6, 2007. Molk was also an honors student in his senior year of high school. College Michigan ‚Äì Notre Dame game. Molk attended the University of Michigan, where he played for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 2007 to 2011. Entering the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season, Molk was a serious contender to start in the season opener due to injuries for the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team. Upon the arrival of new head coach Rich Rodriguez in the spring prior to the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season, Molk was expected to be a starter for the 2008 Michigan Wolverines football team after redshirtting the prior year. He spent the summer after his redshirt season perfecting the shotgun formation snap. However, he endured a serious undisclosed illness that caused him to lose and found himself in a battle with redshirt junior David Moosman to be the starting center. As his struggles continued, it was revealed that he had mononucleosis. Despite his struggles, he was awarded the Iron Wolverine Award at the spring football awards in recognition of his superior conditioning based on a series of physical tests. As a result of injuries, both Moosman and Molk were in the starting lineup for the 2008 opener. Offensive line injuries continued to affect the lineup through the early part of the season with Molk (center), Moosman (right offensive guard) and Stephen Schilling (right offensive tackle) being the only players to start each of the first four games. Molk injured his toe at the end of the November 8, 2008 Battle for the Little Brown Jug against Minnesota, but he was fine the following week. As the young offense finished the season with a 3‚Äì9 record, it expected its entire starting offensive line to return the following season. In fact, considering injuries, the team returned a total of seven offensive linemen who started games. In Molk's second year of spring football he earned the sophomore award for toughness and work ethic during the Michigan spring football awards. By the end of the spring he was among the 44 centers on the 2009 Rimington Trophy spring watch list for the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season. He was also included on the watch list for the 2009 Lombardi Award. Molk suffered a broken foot in the third game of the season as the 2009 Wolverines pushed their record to 3‚Äì0 and had surgery two days later. He was expected to miss 4‚Äì6 weeks. After missing four games, he returned to practice. However, during the subsequent game against Penn State on October 24, he tore knee ligaments and was lost for the season as well as spring football. As a redshirt junior, he was selected to the 2010 preseason Rimington Trophy watchlist for the 2010 Michigan Wolverines football team and later a finalist after the regular season had concluded. That season Denard Robinson established numerous quarterback rushing records lining up behind and often running behind Molk. He broke Drew Brees' Big Ten single-season total offense record of 4,189 yards. Robinson fell 116 yards short of Tim Biakabutuka's Michigan school record of 1,818 rushing yards. However, he led the conference in both total offense and rushing yards per game. Following the Big Ten conference regular season, Molk was a first team All-conference selection by the coaches and second team member as selected by the media. He was also recognized by Sports Illustrated as an honorable mention All- American. Molk at center in the 2011 Michigan-Ohio State rivalry game As a fifth-year senior, he was selected to three preseason watchlists: the Outland Trophy list, which goes to the nation's top interior lineman; the Lombardi Award watch list, which is awarded to the nation's top lineman; and the Rimington Trophy watch list, which is awarded to the nation's top center. During the season, Michigan had two 1000-yard rushers (Robinson and Fitzgerald Toussaint) for the first time since the 1975 team. He earned the 2011 Big Ten Conference Rimington-Pace Offensive Lineman of the Year Award (the first year it was thus named) and was a repeat first team All-Big Ten Conference selection by the coaches and a second team selection by the media. The following week, he was named a finalist for the Rimington Trophy. A few days later, he was declared the Rimington Trophy winner. He was also first team All-American selection by AP, Football Writers Association of America, Scout.com, Sporting News and the Walter Camp Football Foundation, which resulted in him becoming a consensus All-American. He was a third team All- American selection by Yahoo! Sports and an honorable mention All-American selectee by Sports Illustrated and the Pro Football Weekly. Molk was invited to participate in the January 28, 2012 Senior Bowl, and he was an early invite to the February 22‚Äì28, 2012 NFL Scouting Combine. Professional career Molk was one of 54 offensive linemen, and the fourth-ranked center‚Äîbehind Peter Konz, Garth Gerhart, and Ben Jones‚Äî, that participated in the 2012 NFL Scouting Combine. However, he tore the peroneal longus tendon in his foot at the 2012 Sugar Bowl, and he had surgery on January 13. As a result, he was only able to participate in one Combine event. His 41 reps in the bench press ranked first among offensive linemen and second at the entire combine, behind only nose tackle Dontari Poe. Molk's total was most by a center and ranks fourth among offensive lineman since 2000, behind only Russell Bodine, Mitch Petrus and Scott Young, who were centers and offensive guards. San Diego Chargers He was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the seventh round of the 2012 NFL Draft with the 226th selection overall. He was one of three Michigan Wolverines and 41 Big Ten players drafted. On May 8, 2012, he signed a four-year contract. He played 12 games for the 2012 San Diego Chargers, mostly on special teams and as an extra lineman in short yardage situations, before being placed on injured reserve on December 4, 2012. Molk was one of 11 players released by the Chargers on August 31, 2013, during the last round of preseason roster cuts. Philadelphia Eagles On January 9, 2014, he signed a futures contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was placed on injured reserve with a torn bicep after the second game of the 2015 NFL season by the Eagles on September 14, 2015. Molk announced his retirement from the NFL on March 4, 2016.

He was included on the 2009 preseason watchlist for the Lombardi Award. He had previously been a two-time Associated Press first-team Class 3A All-state selection in Washington for the Bellevue High School Wolverines football team where he played on three state champion teams. Born and raised in Bellevue, Washington, Schilling grew up playing basketball until high school. In high school, he was a member of the three-time state champion team. He became a star offensive lineman who was a standout Seattle athlete as his high school won its third consecutive state championship in his junior year. He won numerous all-area and all-state honors as a junior and a senior and was highly touted on the national level. He was selected to play in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and as one of the nominees for Parade All-American Player of the Year. After being highly recruited by several top college football programs and narrowing his list to several Pacific-10 Conference football teams and University of Michigan, he decided to attend Michigan. At Michigan, he redshirted as a true Freshman and then started the following year. When the team transitioned from head coach Lloyd Carr to Rich Rodriguez during his redshirt sophomore season, he became one of the few experienced players to endure the change. He has since anchored the offensive line composed of less experienced players. He was honored as the 2008 Michigan Wolverines football team's best offensive lineman as a redshirt sophomore before being nationally recognized as a Lombardi Award watchlist candidate in 2009. He was selected as a 2009 and 2010 All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention. He was a 2010 Outland Trophy watch list candidate. He was drafted by the San Diego Chargers in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL Draft. He began his NFL career on the practice squad. He was activated prior to week 8 of the 2011 NFL Season (his rookie year), and played in several subsequent games for the team. He has also played for the Seattle Seahawks. He announced his retirement on April 2, 2015. High school When Schilling was young, he was too large to play organized football with kids his own age because Bellevue's youth leagues were regulated by weight-age limits, which caused him to take up basketball instead. Schilling says that his true love was basketball and that he would probably not have experimented with football, but the coach of the basketball team resigned right before his freshman season. During the summer prior to his freshman year, Schilling first visited the Bellevue High School weight room where he noticed the intensity and camaraderie. He eventually became a three-year starter for the football team. As a sophomore, Schilling was part of the Bellevue championship football team whose season extended long enough to interfere with him participating in the early part of the basketball season as a sophomore. The championship, which came as a result of a ten-game winning streak to close the season, made the Bellevue Wolverines three-time Class 3A state champions. On September 4, 2004, as a junior, he helped Bellevue end the high school football record 151-game winning streak by De La Salle High School in front of 24,987 at the second annual Emerald City Kickoff Classic at Qwest Field by a 39‚Äì20 score. Early in his junior season, he got his first scholarship offer from the University of Washington. The Schilling, who wore #52 in high school, played on both the offensive line and defensive line. Prior to the state championship game he was named to the All-area football team by The Seattle Times. He helped his 13‚Äì0 team become the first school from the state of Washington to win five state championships in 2004. For the championship week effort Schilling, who played offensive tackle, was selected as The Seattle Times' Class 3A male athlete of the week. During the season, Schilling was known for his training habits. At the end of the football season, he was selected to All-State teams both by the Associated Press and The Seattle Times. During his junior basketball season, he was a solid contributor to team scoring and rebounding. He averaged 10.6 points/game during his junior season. At the end of his junior year he was named the number 25 football prospect in the nation and the number three offensive tackle by Rivals.com. In July prior to his senior season, he was included in a Reebok Western All-American list in Sports Illustrated. Early in his senior season, running a Wing T offense, Bellevue again defeated a highly regarded California high school in a game at Qwest Field. On September 16, 2009, they defeated the Long Beach Polytechnic High School, who had been ranked number three by the USA Today. At the end of September, he left a game in the second quarter with what was thought to be a separated shoulder. He spent the following three weeks on the sidelines with a sore shoulder. In his October 28 return, Bellevue snapped their 30-game winning streak. During the first ten games of the season, Bellevue averaged 11 yards per rush. In the eleventh game, the team lost in the state quarterfinals. Schilling ended his career having played for three state champions. Schilling was one of sixteen nominees for the Parade All-America High School Player of the Year award. He was selected to the local all-star teams by both The Seattle Times and Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He repeated as an Associated Press Class 3A All-state selection. Schilling was selected to play in the January 7, 2006 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. Although he was highly regarded as a tackle, he started at right guard for the west during the game. He became a Parade All-American. Schilling did not play basketball during his senior year to avoid the risk of injury. Although he was highly recruited during the season, he decided not to make his decision until after the season ended. He scheduled visits with the Cal Bears and USC Trojans and anticipated visits with the Michigan Wolverines and Washington Huskies. Those were the four schools he was seriously considering. He eventually changed his visit dates, but the final four contenders remained ths same. By the time he was to make his final decision he had 20 scholarship offers. In his final week of consideration, he eliminated USC from contention and had home visits from the other three finalists during the week. He made his final selection in what has become a traditional recruit announcement technique by using the schools' caps in front of his extended family, including his mother who is named Joanne and a sister. He also has an Aunt Lydia Schilling. College 2007 Michigan Wolverines huddle with Mario Manningham (86), Ryan Mallett (15), Mike Hart (20), Jake Long (77, behind Hart), Adrian Arrington (16), Mike Massey (83), Justin Boren (65), Carson Butler (85), and Schilling (partially in view on right) (52). Schilling did not arrive in Ann Arbor, Michigan in time for 2006 spring practice like some of his classmates. Just prior to the 2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season opener for the 2006 Michigan Wolverines football team, Schilling was diagnosed with mononucleosis. This caused him to miss several weeks of practice. In late October, he decided to redshirt and have a second shoulder surgery after having missed weeks of practice and lost much weight. As part of his transition from a Wing T offense that rarely passed, Schilling had to work on improving his pass blocking. 2009 Michigan Wolverines against Ohio State during the November 21 Michigan ‚Äì Ohio State rivalry game. He earned the starting right tackle position in a battle with Mark Ortmann and Perry Dorrestein at the start of the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season for the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team. He was the starter on September 1 during the opening game loss to two-time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers. After starting the first five games at right tackle, Schilling moved to right guard for two games (Eastern Michigan and Purdue) as a result of injuries to some of his other teammates. He was expected to start a third game at right guard, but he was returned to right tackle. During practice, he had to spend time at both positions after the injuries. Although he did not start at guard until the sixth game, he played guard in the opener after Jeremy Ciulla got injured. Although, he had to stretch beyond his past experiences and natural position, he was able to seek fifth-year seniors Jake Long and Adam Kraus as mentors. The 2007 rivalry game against Ohio State was a prime example of his lack of experience with pass blocking. He had difficulties pass blocking against Vernon Gholston, who posted three quarterback sacks. Schilling takes the coin toss as captain of the 2010 Michigan Wolverines football team With the departure of Mike Hart, Mario Manningham, Adrian Arrington, Jake Long, Chad Henne, and Adam Kraus to the National Football League and Justin Boren's defection from the team, the 2008 Michigan Wolverines football team entered the season for new head coach Rich Rodriguez with only three returning offensive starters: Schilling, tight end Carson Butler and fullback Mark Moundros. Backup quarterback Ryan Mallett transferred and two senior offensive linemen (Jeremy Ciulla and Alex Mitchell) declined to use their fifth years of eligibility. Schilling was virtually the only returning offensive lineman with any experience. Aside from Schilling, the projected opening game starting offensive line had a total of three career starts. Offensive line injuries continued to affect the lineup through the early part of the season with David Molk (center), David Moosman (right guard) and Schilling (right tackle) being the only players to start each of the first four games. Even Schilling was a bit injured, causing him to be handled delicately during practice. In the first five games, the team used four different starting offensive line combinations due to injuries. For much of the season, Rodriguez' offense started six freshmen. By the seventh game the line returned to full strength and used the opening day lineup. In the week before the last game of the season against Ohio State, Schilling injured his knee in practice. As a result, he did not play in the final game. Nonetheless, he was honored by the team at the end of the season as the team's best offensive lineman. The young offense had all but one of its starters returning for the following season. As a fourth-year junior, Schilling entered the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season opener with the second most career starts (26) on the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team behind punter Zoltan Mesko (38). He switched to left guard from right tackle in 2009. In the Ohio State game, he was notable for losing a shoe during the game and trying to play without it. He was recognized as an honorable mention 2009 All-Big Ten Conference selection by both the coaches and the media. As a fifth-year senior, Stephen Schilling was watchlisted for the Outland Trophy award for lineman. He was also, elected co-captain and participated in a season long fanmail program where he responded to Michigan fan questions made by email and on Facebook every Friday. Following the Big Ten Conference season, he was selected as an honorable mention All-Conference selection by both the coaches and the media. Following the season, he participated in the 2011 Senior Bowl. During Schilling's senior season, Denard Robinson had a record-setting season on offense: he broke Drew Brees' Big Ten single-season total offense record of 4,189 yards. Robinson fell 116 yards short of Tim Biakabutuka's Michigan school record of 1,818 rushing yards. However, he led the conference in both total offense and rushing yards per game.

Wade is the twin brother of Alanis Morissette, whom he names as \\"one of the biggest influences in my life\\";\\"Wade Imre Morissette on MySpace Music\\". MySpace. they have an older brother, Chad. Music Wade took to music at an early age, studying piano as a child and guitar and djembe in his teens. During a trip to India, he encountered devotional yoga and chanting, and decided to combine his interests in yoga and music, to create his own blend of indie rock/pop music with Sanskrit and English chants. In 2004, Wade was asked to be an ambassador for Lululemon, the popular yoga-inspired athletic apparel company. At the same time, he had self-released his debut album, Sargam Scales of Music. This turned into a world tour to promote both his album and the clothing line with the company signing on as a sponsor. The Lululemon Yoga Pilgrimage kicked off in 2005 and took Wade to Tokyo, Hong Kong and 32 cities in North America and continued on through early 2006 with stops in Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico. In late 2006, Nettwerk Music Group CEO and yoga enthusiast Terry McBride signed Wade to the label's Nutone Music division. Wade has since released his second and third albums, Strong as Diamonds: Om Vajra Kaya Namaha, in 2007 and Maha Moha ‚Äì The Great Delusion in 2008. During live performances, Wade often begins with bliss dance and ends with a kirtan. Wade, on guitar and harmonium, sings out a phrase; the audience responds until the musicians and audience mesh. Yoga, Reiki and other Wade has been practicing and teaching yoga since 1995. He has completed Iyengar, Classical Ashtanga and Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga teacher training. He has studied Vinyasa, Viniyoga, Anusara and Kriya yoga, as well as zazen, Vedic chanting, and active movement and sound meditations with some of the best-known teachers in Canada, North America, and India. He is also a Reiki master, certified Phoenix Rising yoga therapist, and Viniyoga Therapist. He leads teacher trainings, workshops, retreats, and music-dance evenings internationally. Writing and speaking Wade has had features published in the Yoga Journal and Maclean's Magazine. His work also includes the book Transformative Yoga: Five Keys to Unlocking Inner Bliss (2009), which he co-authored with his twin Alanis Morissette.

Daniel Lessmann (January 18, 1794 in Soldin, Neumark ‚Äì Sept. 2, 1831 between Kropstadt and Wittenberg) was a German historian and poet. Born to Jewish parents, he attended Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium and went on to study medicine in Berlin. His studies were put on hold in 1813 when he joined the volunteers against Napoleon. He was wounded at the Battle of Lutzen (May 2, 1813), recovered, and remained in service until the end of the war. After the war he continued his medical studies and became a private tutor in Vienna in 1820, then in Verona in 1823. He settled in Berlin in 1824 to devote himself to freelance writing and contributed to the more important literary journals of the Restoration period. He also converted to Christianity during the same period.Ludwig Geiger : Le√ümann, Daniel in General German Biography (ADB). Volume 18, Duncker & Humblot, Leipzig 1883, p. 453 f, via WikiSource His work consisted of historical essays, short stories, poetry, and scenes of life in the southern countries he had visited. A collection of poems were published in Berlin in 1824 under the title, ‚ÄúAmathusia‚Äù. His literary work was influenced by Heinrich Heine, whom he became acquainted with and whose letters to Moses Moser frequently mention the aspiring writer. Lessmann took part in various literary circles and was a witty storyteller. His prose work include ‚ÄúLouise von Halling,‚Äù 1827, which was read by Goethe, and ‚ÄúDie Heidemuhle,‚Äù published several years after his death. His translations of ‚ÄúThe Nun of Monza‚Äù by Gioachino Rossini and ‚ÄúThe Betrothed‚Äù by Alessandro Manzoni were major contributions to the introduction of modern Italian literature to Germany. He also wrote several volumes of history, some of which are only found in manuscript form. In the seven years of his publishing career (1824‚Äì1830) Lessmann became deeply depressed as his aspirations of becoming a great literary figure were dulled by a disappointed public. In 1824 Lessmann converted to Christianity. According to a letter from Moser to Heine, Lessmann converted so that he might realize his hopes of literary success. The conversion did nothing to boost his literary career and his situation seemed hopeless. In 1831, on a walk from Berlin to Leipzig and Dresden with a new manuscript, trying to find a publisher, Lessmann hanged himself.

It is manufactured by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation Third Academy.Gromley et al.: page 101 Description The YJ-83 uses microprocessors and a strapdown inertial reference unit (IRU); these are more compact than the equivalent electronics used in the YJ-8 and the export C-802, allowing the YJ-83 to have a 180-km range at Mach 0.9. The missile is powered by the Chinese CTJ-2 turbojet, and carries 190-kg high- explosive fragmentation warhead. Terminal guidance is by an active radar. The YJ-83K, the air-launched variant, has a range of 200 km. This data may be for an improved YJ-83A; the original YJ-83 may have shorter range, at 120 km and 130 km for the surface- and air-launched versions, respectively. The YJ-83KH has an electro-optical seeker, and may receive course corrections by remote link.Gromley et al.: page 102 The YJ-83 entered service with the People's Liberation Army Navy in 1998-1999 and has equipped a large number of its surface warships.

The C-802A and C-802AK are the export surface- and air-launched variants. The C-802A has a range of . Confusion between the YJ-82, C-802 and \\"C-803\\" The US military considers the C-802 and C-802A as parts of the YJ-83 family. The C-802 precedes the closely related YJ-83; strictly speaking, only the C-802A is the export development of the YJ-83. The C-802 is sometimes and erroneously considered the export version of the YJ-82; the two are separate developments. A prospective \\"C-803\\" was erroneously promulgated as the export version of the YJ-83 by enthusiasts in the late-1990s. As yet, no such missile exists. Operational history News reports indicate that this was the missile used on 14 July 2006, in the 2006 Lebanon War when Hezbollah fired two missiles at Israeli warships. One missile hit the corvette INS Hanit, causing significant damage and four fatalities. Iran, the reported supplier of the missile to Hezbollah, refused to formally confirm or deny the claim. The Hanit suffered severe damage, but stayed afloat, got itself out of the line of fire, and made the rest of the journey back to Ashdod for repairs on its own. The Israeli ship possessed sophisticated multi-layered missile defense capability: a Phalanx CIWS gun, Barak 1 anti-missile missiles, Chaff and ECM. These should have been able to prevent an anti-ship missile attack such as the YJ-82, but according to the Israeli military, these were intentionally disabled at the time of the alleged missile hit due to: * Lack of intelligence indicating Hezbollah possessed such a missile. * Presence of many Israeli Air Force aircraft conducting operations in the vicinity of the ship which might have accidentally set off the ship's anti-missile/aerial threats system, with the danger of shooting down a friendly aircraft. However, the ship has an (optionally installed, especially during wartime) Identification friend or foe interrogator system to prevent attacking friendly aircraft. On 9 October 2016, the United States Navy guided- missile destroyer USS Mason (DDG-87) reported coming under attack in the Red Sea by cruise missiles fired from territory in Yemen controlled by the Houthi group. The missiles appeared similar to one fired from Yemen a week earlier that damaged HSV Swift, a leased transport ship under the control of the United Arab Emirates, who are supporting the Yemeni government in a civil war against the Houthis. Analysis of the damage caused by that missile led experts to believe it was a C-802. None of the missiles fired at USS Mason hit their targets; U.S. authorities claimed that defensive countermeasures were used, including firing defensive missiles.

The missile can be air-launched by the H-6 bomber and fired from a vertical launch system of the Type 055 destroyer according to Chinese expert Li Li on Chinese television. The YJ-100 will have an onboard radar and is potentially a counter to the American Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). Development The development of the CJ-10 could have potentially benefited significantly from Chinese acquisition of NATO and Soviet missile technology in the 1990s, notably the Kh-55 (purchased from Ukraine), and the Tomahawk missiles (that were unexploded and purchased from Iraq, Pakistan, and Serbia). The detailed production engineering data packages of the Kh-55 LACM were bought from Ukraine in 2001. A 1995 Russian document suggested a complete production facility had been transferred to Shanghai, for the development of a nuclear-armed cruise missile. Originally it was thought that this was based on the 300 km-range Raduga Kh-15 (AS-16 'Kickback'), but it now appears that it was the Kh-55 that was transferred to China. Jane's Information Group reported the CJ-10 was tested 2004. An August 2012 report by Jane's indicated that a shipborne variance of the missile may have been tested on Bi Sheng, a Chinese weapons trial ship.

In 1956, the Mansfield Independent School District was segregated and still sent its black children to separate, run down facilities, despite the Brown v. Board of Education court decision in 1954. Three students brought a suit with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It became the first school district in the state ordered by a federal court to desegregate. The school board approved the measure and allowed Mansfield High School to desegregate. Although other districts in Texas desegregated quietly that fall, the mayor and police chief of Mansfield did not approve of this measure. When school started on August 30, 1956, they joined over 300 whites in front of Mansfield High School. Their goal was to prevent the enrollment of the three black students. The town turned into complete turmoil as three black effigies were hanged as part of the demonstration. Texas Governor Allan Shivers was a noted segregationist and used the power of his office to resist implementation of Brown v. Board of Education. Shivers dispatched Texas Rangers to prevent integration, led by Captain Jay Banks, who, in addition to threatening to arrest Black students, refused to take down an effigy of a Black man hanging by a noose at the entrance of Mansfield High School. Shivers then authorized the Mansfield Independent School District to send its Black students to Fort Worth, Texas. By doing this the school district had effectively ignored a federal court order for integration. After the transfer of the Black students to Fort Worth, the demonstrations soon ended and order was restored. It was this success that in 1957 inspired Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus to attempt a similar ordeal in Little Rock, Arkansas. Later that year, Texas passed more segregation laws that delayed integration even further. Facing the lack of federal funds, the Mansfield Independent School District quietly desegregated in 1965. The decade long defiance of a federal school integration order was one of the longest in the nation during that period. In June 2020, a statue modeled after Texas Ranger Captain Jay Banks, called One Riot, One Ranger, was removed from Dallas Love Field. It was first dedicated in 1961, 5 years after the Mansfield School Desegregation Incident.

In 2016 the company was acquired by Siemens Digital Industries Software.https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/our- story/newsroom/siemens-press-release/43811 Origins Analysis and Design Application Company (adapco) was founded in New York in 1980 as an engineering consultancy company focusing on Finite Element Method analysis. In 1987, adapco invested in and began to collaborate with Computational Dynamics, a start-up company formed by members of a CFD research group at Imperial College London. Eventually the two companies began to jointly trade under the name CD- adapco. In their 2009 annual user conference, CD-adapco announced that the company had grown 22% in 2008, and they expected similar results in 2009. Professional Engineering Magazine described this as \\"recession-proof performance\\" and went on to point out that this success is especially noteworthy considering that many of the company's customers are in the automotive industry, a sector of the economy that was, at the time, suffering record low sales levels. During the financial downturn of 2009, CD-adapco launched their \\"No Engineer Left Behind\\" program, which provided free STAR- CCM+ licenses and training for displaced and unemployed engineers. In April 2016, Siemens acquired CD-adapco for US$970 million. Products A screenshot of a fluid-flow analysis being conducted in STAR-CCM+ STAR-CD CD- adapco's legacy CFD package, STAR-CD, was praised by Renault automotive design engineers as a \\"world class design package\\". Nearly 75% of the points won during the 2005 Formula One season were awarded to drivers of cars that were designed with STAR-CD. STAR-CCM+ (see also Simcenter STAR-CCM+) In 2004, CD-adapco opted to shift their attention from improving STAR-CD to completely rewriting their computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithms and tools. The company gambled that in the end, starting from a \\"blank slate\\" with a group of experts would produce a better result than continuing to work improvements into their old products In early 2004, the company introduced this new product, STAR-CCM+, the \\"CCM\\" standing for \\"computational continuum mechanics\\". The application employs a client-server architecture, to allow users to solve problems from a lightweight computer, such as a laptop, while the computationally expensive math is done on a remote machine. This substantially reduces the need for expensive desktop computers‚Äîa requirement of some other similar packages Even in periods of major economic downturn, few customers cut back on annual licenses. CD-adapco has speculated that their product's success has been partially because their application was designed from the start to simultaneously solve fluid flow and heat transfer problems. Competing products often consist of separate solvers coupled together, which requires that both be kept in agreement; a time-consuming complication that degrades accuracy. STAR-CAD STAR-CAD is a range of PLM-embedded tools that allows engineers to perform CFD analysis from within their company's chosen CAD environment. STAR-CAD integrates with Catia, Pro/Engineer, SolidWorks and NX. Fuel Cells In a partnership with the United States Department of Energy, CD-adapco developed an expert system to model and analyze solid oxide fuel cells Technology finite volume cells using CD- adapco's polyhedral mesher Meshing of Computational Domain The first \\"official release\\" of STAR-CCM+ included the world's first commercially available polyhedral meshing algorithm. The use of a polyhedral mesh has proven to be more accurate for fluid-flow problems than a hexahedral or tetrahedral mesh of a similar size (number of cells), but is considerably more difficult to create. Automatic Surface Repair Included in STAR-CCM+ is a tool called a \\"surface wrapper\\", which \\"shrink wraps\\" a user's CAD geometry, filling any holes, overlaps or cracks. The company says that this feature cuts geometry preparation time down from days to minutes.

He served as the Chief Pathologist at the Abu Kabir Institute of Forensic Medicine between 1988 and possibly as late as 2005.Cole, 2007, p. 99. Hiss has also served as part of the faculty for the Terrorism and Medicine Program at the Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) at IDC Herzliya and in the Department of Pathology for the Sackler Faculty of Medicine at Tel Aviv University. As director of the Institute at Abu Kabir, the only place in Israel authorized to conduct autopsies in cases of unnatural death, Hiss conducted the autopsies of and authored the pathology reports for notable figures, including Yitzhak Rabin and Rachel Corrie, among others. His position as director was a subject of controversy. He was dismissed from this position after the legal system took up some of the charges against him. Investigations of the newspaper Al-Ahram, revealed that Hiss had removed organs, bones and other tissues from corpses, against the expressed wishes of family, and had sold many of the organs he removed to medical institutions and universities. He remained the chief pathologist of the Institute and regained his position as director before being dismissed by the Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman on Oct 15 2012. Early life and education Yehuda Hiss was born in Poland shortly after the end of World War II. His family immigrated to Israel when he was ten years old. He studied medicine in Israel, Italy, Austria, Britain and the United States. Medical career Hiss became the director and chief pathologist at Abu Kabir in 1988. As director of the Institute, Hiss was involved with high- profile cases. Hiss performed the autopsy on Yitzhak Rabin after his 1995 assassination; his report was challenged in March 1999 by a group of Israeli academics.Israel National News, 26 September 2005, Infamous Chief Pathologist to Once Again Evade Punishment In May 2003, he confirmed the identification of the body that washed ashore the beaches of Tel Aviv to be that of Omar Sharif, the accomplice of Asif Hanif, who carried out the Mike's Place suicide bombing the month previous. Hiss told Haaretz that Sharif's DNA was matched to samples provided by two British detectives and the cause of death was determined to be drowning. He also performed the autopsy on Rachel Corrie. A piece featuring Hiss that appeared in The New York Times in February 2004 noted Hiss played a \\"unique role\\" in the response network that Israel had to developed to deal with the more than 100 suicide bombings it had experienced over the three years previous. All the dead from such attacks are brought to the Forensic Institute, and Hiss had been present to attend to, \\"the dismembered victims and shattered victims,\\" in all but one attack. The same article mentions the controversy surrounding Hiss as follows: > \\"While the forensic center is praised for its work after bombings, Dr. Hiss > has been involved in controversies related to other cases, including > allegations that the institute removed organs from corpses without > permission from the families. The issue is enormously sensitive because of > Judaism's emphasis on burying the whole body. Government inquiries have not > resulted in any charges against Dr. Hiss. But in December the Israeli > attorney general recommended disciplinary action. The issue is still under > consideration, and no sanctions have been imposed so far.\\" In January 2006, following the carrying out of an autopsy that was ordered by the Israeli courts for a Haredi woman found murdered in her apartment, a riot by dozens of Haredim took place inside the institute where Hiss worked. According to Dr. Benny Davidson, the manager of the institute, \\"Even in the institute's darkest days, there wasn't an event this big. They wrecked the entire hall, broke expensive equipment, and destroyed (institute director) Yehuda Hiss' room. The public reaction to the articles on the pathological institute was an abandonment of Hiss.\\"  Controversy According to Rebecca Dube in the Forward, allegations that Hiss and his lab were taking organs from corpses without permission and using them for research or selling them to medical schools were substantiated by the Israeli government. In 1998, after Alistair Sinclair, a Scottish tourist apprehended on suspicion of dealing drugs, died in a holding cell at Ben Gurion International Airport, apparently having hanged himself. After an autopsy overseen by Hiss, the body was returned to his family; a second autopsy performed by pathologists at the University of Glasgow found that the heart and a small bone at the base of his tongue were missing. Jonathan Rosenblum reported that the missing bone from his neck was considered necessary to confirming that he had hanged himself as stated, and that the Sinclair family believed his heart had been used for transplant. The scandal was publicized by media in Israel and Scotland after the family sued. Rosenblum, writing in The Jerusalem Post in October 2000 cited a 12-page investigative report in November 1999 by the local Tel Aviv newspaper Ha'ir claiming that medical students at Abu Kabir under Hiss' direction were allowed to practice on bodies sent there for autopsy, and body parts were transferred for transplant without permission from the families. In January 2001, Yediot Aharonot claimed the institute headed by Hiss had been involved in \\"organ sales\\" of body parts to universities and medical schools for research and training, citing evidence including the \\"price listings\\" for body parts. Israel's Ministry of Health convened a committee to investigate the claims which found that Hiss had been involved for years in the sale of illegally removed body parts to medical schools. Hiss was never charged with any crime, but was forced to step down from running the state morgue in 2004. According to Rebecca Dube, \\"the final straw, apparently, was when the body of a youth killed in a road accident was gnawed upon by a rat in Hiss's lab.\\" Every body that ended up in Hiss' morgue, whether Israeli or Palestinian, was fair game for organ harvesting. Hiss ceased being the director of the institute in 2005 when allegations of a trade in organs resurfaced. After Hiss admitted to having removed parts from 125 bodies without authorization, and following a plea bargain with the State of Israel, Israel's attorney-general, decided not to press criminal charges. Hiss was given only a reprimand and continued to hold his position as chief pathologist at Abu Kabir and eventually regained his position as director.http://www.health.gov.il/english/forensic.htm Jonathan Cook writing in Al-Ahram Weekly in 2009 recalls Hiss' history in connection with the Aftonbladet allegations.

The NCAN is partnered with the Women-Church Convergence, which promotes \\"diverse feminist, faith-filled voices.\\" The organization is known for its opposition to the Catholic Church hierarchy, including Pope Francis, as well as its positions on abortion, homosexuality, and women clerics. The actual size of the organization is disputed.  History  NCAN was founded by Margaret Traxler in 1969. In 1963, Margaret Traxler joined a group of priests and sisters marching for civil rights in Selma, Alabama. This led to her involvement with the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice, and thus her creation of the NCAN. NCAN received notice when Sisters Traxler, Donna Quinn, Ann Patrick Ware, and Deborah Barrett appeared, in 1982, on the Phil Donahue Show opposing legislation that limited abortion.  NCAN - Feminism  The NCAN has long advanced the idea that women should be fully welcomed into the church including the priesthood. In 1972, the organization published a ‚ÄúDeclaration of Independence for Women,‚Äù a document which outlined a five-year plan to achieve gender equality within and outside the Church. This declaration advocated for full equality for women, reformation of the economic and power systems, and simple living. In this document, members made a connection between slavery and the oppression of women in the Catholic Church: ‚ÄúJust as today we are appalled that organized religion once approved slavery, so within a few years will the present oppression of women in churches be recognized as immoral.‚Äù Additionally, the declaration requested broad-based research programs in human sexuality to encourage fair judgement on the behavior of the human family, and called upon women to refrain from economic assistance to churches until 1976. The NCAN also declared its support for the 2018 Women's Marches around the world and their contradiction of the \\"vulgar words\\" used by President Trump.  NCAN - Abortion & Contraceptives  The NCAN's position on the issues of abortion, homosexuality, and women clerics have put it at odds with the U.S. Roman Catholic Bishops and official Church teaching. The NCAN is most well-known for their strong support of Reproductive Justice, or the right of a woman to choose what is best for her own body, including the use of contraceptives and abortions, if needed. In fact, the NCAN was extremely upset after other Catholic groups began challenging the Affordable Care Act by refusing insurance coverage for contraceptives for women. The NCAN believes that this violates the inherent rights and equality given to all men and women of this nation. The NCAN even announced their support of the Obamacare Contraception Access during his presidency. After the pope declared that priests could forgive women who have had abortions as long as they admitted to sinning, the group of American nuns realized there was a lot to be done in order to \\"make women equal members of the Catholic Church.\\" While the NCAN acknowledged the attempts of pope to act in a pastoral manner and soften his stance on the issue, many women within the church did not find these comments satisfactory and felt as though their right to autonomy was still not recognized by the Church. The nuns argued that \\"sperm from males was responsible for these unplanned pregnancies.\\" Many other Catholic activism groups, such Catholics for Choice, joined the NCAN and spoke out against the pope as well. A member of the NCAN, Sister Donna Quinn, spoke out against the priest after these comments were made, saying that ‚ÄúI think he gets it within the Vatican sense and about the hierarchy, but he still won‚Äôt let women have full membership with the Catholic tradition. Women still don‚Äôt have full membership.‚Äù Sister Donna Quinn, the coordinator of the NCAN, has been known for \\"escorting women through a gauntlet of protesters\\" at abortion clinics. Quinn calls herself \\"a feminist and an activist and proud of it.\\" Sister Mary Ann Cunningham of Denver, a NCAN board member, says they are an alternative to the church hierarchy's positions on public issues. The organization supports the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.  NCAN - The LGBT Community  The NCAN is also known for the support of the LGBT community and their acceptance into the church. Involved in the relationship between the church and the LGBT community for over forty-seven years, Sister Jeannine Gramick reaffirms the NCAN's support of LGBT people because of the presumptions that nuns are strict and repressive, especially in terms of social issues like these. Sister Jeannine Gramick shares that she \\"wish[es] the image of nuns as compassionate and justice-seeking people would replace the old and idiotic image of nuns that still gets repeated.\\" She even wrote an essay, entitled the National Catholic Reporter's \\"Global Sister's Report,\\" that draws attention to these social justice issues and their relationship to the nuns of the Catholic Church. Gramick reveals that \\"Catholic nuns have been LGBT people‚Äôs strongest supporters among institutional church people.\\" Sister Gramick and many other members of the NCAN participated in the \\"Fortnight for Freedom\\" campaign and protest (see below) during 2012 to try to convince people that our nation's political freedom was under attack. Sister Gramick explains that, \\"we want our church leaders to be pastoral leaders particularly concerned with the poor and the vulnerable, the gay and lesbian community, women and the equal rights of all people rather than the partisan politics they seem to be playing.\\" However, their stance on these issues has caused controversy among Christian people over the many years that the NCAN has been in place.

When launched on 2 May 1969 by Princess Anne it was the largest vessel to have been built in Britain at that time. The ship was designed to carry crude oil from the Persian Gulf, and its large design was a result of the Suez Crisis, which had resulted in the closing of the Suez Canal. The ship was single-hulled and was designed with relatively limited knowledge of the behaviours of such large structures at sea, being generally a straightforward scaling-up of a smaller design. It was also built to a fixed-price contract at a time when rampant inflation was occurring in Britain. This led to many attempts to cut costs; Swan Hunter ultimately made a loss on the contract. Final cost of the ship was ¬£6.5 million. Unfortunately the ship was plagued with problems both with its fittings and more seriously, with cracking of the hull under stress. It needed many repairs in its short working lifetime and this, together with fears of a major spill, prompted its retirement in 1982 after only 12 years in service. The ship was broken up at Kaohsiung, Taiwan. A similar fate befell its sister ship, the Esso Hibernia, also built on Tyneside and launched in 1970.

It is a special case of the more general J_1-J_2 model, with J_1=2J_2. The model is named after Indian physicists Chanchal Kumar Majumdar and Dipan Ghosh. The Majumdar‚ÄìGhosh model is notable because its ground states (lowest energy quantum states) can be found exactly and written in a simple form, making it a useful starting point for understanding more complex spin models and phases. Definition The Majumdar‚ÄìGhosh model is defined by the following Hamiltonian: :\\\\hat H = J \\\\sum_{j =1}^{N} \\\\vec{S}_j \\\\cdot \\\\vec{S}_{j+1} + \\\\frac{J}{2} \\\\sum_{j =1}^{N} \\\\vec{S}_j \\\\cdot\\\\vec{S}_{j+2} where the S vector is a quantum spin operator with quantum number S = 1/2. Other conventions for the coefficients may be taken in the literature, but the most important fact is that the ratio of first-neighbor to second-neighbor couplings is 2 to 1\\\\. As a result of this ratio, it is possible to express the Hamiltonian (shifted by an overall constant) equivalently in the form :\\\\hat H = \\\\frac{J}{4} \\\\sum_{j =1}^{N} (\\\\vec{S}_{j-1}+\\\\vec{S}_j+ \\\\vec{S}_{j+1})^2 The summed quantity is none other than the quadratic Casimir operator for representation of the spin algebra on the three consecutive sites j-1, j, j+1 , which in turn can be decomposed into a direct sum of spin 1/2 and 3/2 representations. It has the eigenvalues \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\frac{1}{2}+1) =3/4 for the spin 1/2 subspace and \\\\frac{3}{2}(\\\\frac{3}{2}+1) =15/4 for the spin 3/2 subspace. Ground states It has been shown that the Majumdar‚ÄìGhosh model has two minimum energy states, or ground states, namely the states in which neighboring pairs of spins form singlet configurations. The wavefunction for each ground state is a product of these singlet pairs. This explains why there must be at least two ground states with the same energy, since one may be obtained from the other by merely shifting, or translating, the system by one lattice spacing. Furthermore, it has been shown that these (and linear combinations of them) are the unique ground states. File:Majumdar-ghosh gs.png Generalizations The Majumdar‚ÄìGhosh model is one of a small handful of realistic quantum spin models that may be solved exactly. Moreover, its ground states are simple examples of what are known as valence-bond solids (VBS). Thus the Majumdar‚ÄìGhosh model is related to another famous spin model, the AKLT model, whose ground state is the unique one dimensional spin one (S=1) valence-bond solid. The Majumdar‚ÄìGhosh model is also a useful example of the Lieb‚ÄìSchultz‚ÄìMattis theorem which roughly states that an infinite, one dimensional, half-odd-integer spin system must either have no energy spacing (or gap) between its ground and excited states or else have more than one ground state. The Majumdar‚ÄìGhosh model has a gap and falls under the second case. The isotropy of the model is actually not important to the fact that it has an exactly dimerised ground state. For example, \\\\hat H = J \\\\sum_{j =1}^{N} ({X}_j{X}_{j+1}+{Y}_j{Y}_{j+1} + \\\\delta{Z}_j{Z}_{j+1}) + \\\\frac{J}{2} \\\\sum_{j =1}^{N} ({X}_j{X}_{j+2}+{Y}_j{Y}_{j+2} + \\\\delta{Z}_j{Z}_{j+2}) also has the same aforementioned exactly dimerised ground state for all real \\\\delta >-1/2.

Campbell House is a historic Gothic Revival style log and wood frame home located in Grand Forks, North Dakota. It is significant for its association with Thomas D. Campbell, who became the largest wheat farmer in the United States. It is part of the Myra Museum and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1879 for Thomas D. Campbell, the house consists of the original 1879 log cabin enclosed within a later Gothic Revival wood frame addition, which is dated to ca. 1881-1900, with an overall L-shaped floor plan. The home has gabled roofs and clapboard siding. The main facade and south gables are distinguished by lace bargeboards, and the west gable contains a pointed window. A porch extends across the west facade and is supported by turned posts and bentwood arches. It is the only building remaining from the Campbell family's pioneer farmstead. The interior of the house serves as a museum, and is fitted out with turn of the 20th century furnishings befitting a family residence. The chinked log walls and hand-hewn loft joists of the original 1879 log cabin are exposed from within. At the time of its construction the Campbell house was south of the tiny settlement of Grand Forks; it was one of a string of pioneer homes along the Red River, with no other buildings in its immediate area. Associated with the First Dakota Boom and the pre-railroad (pre-1880) era, it is a significant example of the architecture of this period. Log structures were popular at this time due to the expense of hauling cut lumber down the river from the railhead in Fargo. The practice of constructing a fairly simple log home, to be supplanted or engulfed later on by a more substantial structure, appears to have been fairly common to the area at this time. The house is notable for being the only Gothic Revival farmhouse in Grand Forks and one of only a few houses of this style in North Dakota's Red River Valley region, and at the time of its enlargement was one of the finer homes in the area. The Campbell family Thomas D. and Almira Richards Campbell, immigrants from Scotland and Canada, began their lives in the Red River Valley with a small farm. This grew to include of excellent crop land by 1898. By the turn of the 20th century Mr. Campbell had become a prominent real estate man in the city. The log portion of the home was the birthplace of General Thomas D. Campbell (1882‚Äì1966), who was known as the \\"Wheat King\\" and owned large tracts of land in Montana and New Mexico. Gen. Campbell was at one time the nation's largest wheat producer, and served in both World War I and World War II. During the latter he developed a napalm firebomb used widely in the Pacific Theater.

It was the largest landslide in a built-up area in New Zealand's history, resulting in the destruction of 69 houses ‚Äì around one sixth of the suburb ‚Äì but no fatalities.\\"New Zealand disasters\\", Christchurch City Libraries website. Retrieved 1 October 2009. Geography The suburb of Abbotsford sits on the slopes of a hill in the southwest of Dunedin, separated from the main urban area by open semi-rural land. The larger suburb of Green Island sits on gentler slopes immediately to the south. Between the two lies the valley of the Kaikorai Stream and its tributary, Miller Stream. At the time of the slippage, Abbotsford was within Green Island Borough. Much of the northeastern end of Abbotsford's residential area was built on unstable ground. Schist bedrock is covered with a thick layer of mudstone, with a top coating of sand and clay-rich Cenozoic alluvial soil. This type of surface becomes slick during even moderate rainfall.\\"Abbotsford Landslide\\". Retrieved 1 October 2009. Landslides of this type of material have been relatively widespread within the Greater Dunedin area throughout both recent prehistory and historical times.Bishop, D.G., and Turnbull, I.M. (compilers) (1996). Geology of the Dunedin Area. Lower Hutt, NZ: Institute of Geological & Nuclear Sciences. . p. 33. The land was also sloping, and quarrying and the construction of the nearby Dunedin Southern Motorway during the 1960s and early 1970s may have further affected the land's stability. The event was non- seismic, the increased rainfall over the previous decade was the trigger and the slope gave way due to the clay seams that formed parallel to bedding. The clay seams formed due to flexural slip. Background There have been numerous smaller historical slips at Abbotsford, notably during the construction of the Dunedin-Mosgiel rail line in 1914. Despite this and a 1951 University of Otago report which stated that the land was unsuitable for building , the area was chosen as viable for residential subdivision. During subdivision, extra watercourses were built to handle excess rain runoff, but these proved insufficient to handle heavy downfalls. Christie Street, which runs up Abbotsford hill in the east of the suburb had existed before World War II, but the subdivision of land around it began in earnest only from 1953.Stuart, I. A. (1979) Landslide! The Abbotsford disaster. Dunedin: Allied Press. Several houses needed to be demolished because of slippage caused during the construction of the Dunedin Southern Motorway in 1966 and 1968. From 1968, cracks started appearing in houses in Christie Street, with evidence of subsidence and earth movement becoming more common in the following years. In November 1978, water mains ruptured in Christie Street, and in May 1979 the Green Island Borough Council had to replace drains which had separated by as much as half a metre. This was followed by further breaks in both water and sewerage pipes during June. Between 1 July and 16 July, four houses were evacuated; six more were to become empty before the end of the month. During July, Cabinet ministers Bill Young and Derek Quigley visited the area, but Prime Minister Robert Muldoon refused to call a state of civil emergency or allow the Earthquake and War Damage Commission to pay full compensation on damaged or destroyed houses. By mid-July, the land was moving at close to 25 millimetres (one inch) per day. The chance of a major slip was discussed, but it was felt that there would be considerable warning before this happened, and as such residents were not officially evacuated (although several left their homes of their own volition). Heavy rain during late July led to an increase in the rate of slippage, and non-residents were barred from visiting the area. By early August the rate of slippage had increased to over one metre per day. More houses were evacuated during this time. At the instigation of Green Island mayor Vic Crimp, a state of civil emergency was finally declared starting at 8 am on 6 August and the area was partially evacuated. Plans were drawn up on 7 August for the complete evacuation of the area, though this had not been completed by the time the slip occurred. The hill gives way At around 9.07 pm on 8 August, Abbotsford hill gave way. In all, some of land ‚Äì nearly half of it residential ‚Äì moved a distance of down the hill in a mere 15 minutes. This land included most of the eastern side of Christie Street, most parts of Mitchell and Edward Streets east of Christie Street, the short Gordon Street, and the cul-de-sac, Charles Street. A large area of open land belonging to the Orchard Sun Club was also part of the slip. Sixty-nine houses were destroyed, either directly in the slip or later for safety reasons. At the foot of the hill, much of Miller Park sports ground and neighbouring Armstrong Lane were inundated. The slip involved some 5 million cubic metres of sand and colluvium up to 40 metres in thickness. A wide rift up to in depth was left at the head of the slip.Civil Defence report Hundreds of people were left homeless, though ‚Äì largely through good luck ‚Äì no lives were lost and the worst injuries were very minor.Healey, Kathleen. (1990) The Green and the Gold, Vol. II: The story of greater Green Island, 1970‚Äì1989. Dunedin: Green Island Borough Council. pp. 25‚Äì32. . Some residents only had seconds to leave their homes, and a group of seventeen residents had to be rescued from a small moving island of solid land. Aftermath Bulldozers flattening land in front of a subsided house The state of civil emergency continued until 18 August. Total damage was estimated at $NZ 10‚Äì13 million,. Some houses survived the slide relatively intact and were moved to new locations. A Commission of Inquiry into the reasons for the slip sat for 58 days and produced its report in November 1980. The Commission concluded that the area had a geological predisposition to slippage, with potentially unstable weak clay layers, rich in montmorillonite clay. The situation was aggravated by the removal of sand from the toe of the hill at a quarry (Harrison's Pit) and during construction of both the residential area and motorway. Though not directly referred to in the Commission's findings, it is possible that a minor earthquake in the area in 1974 also contributed to the slide. The landslip led to changes in building and subdivision practices in New Zealand, with geological assessment of the land now common prior to the approval of any land development.Proceedings Sixth International Congress, International Association of Engineering Geology, 6‚Äì10 August 1990, Amsterdam, Netherlands, , (Google Books ‚Äì retrieved 1 October 2009) Land cover and landslip insurance regulations were also substantially rewritten in 1984 as a direct result of the Abbotsford landslip. Much of the land which suffered slippage has since been landscaped into parkland, with stands of trees added to help stabilise the earth.

Other cities were deliberately destroyed by the German forces. One of the most famous of these planned destructions was the razing of Warsaw, the capital of Poland. While extensively damaged by the failed Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Warsaw Uprising, the city later underwent a planned demolition by German forces under order from Adolf Hitler and high officials within the Nazi government.

smock mill in Norg, Drenthe, the Netherlands. It was built in 1878 and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 30785. (Click on \\"Technische gegevens\\" to view.) History Noordenveld was built in 1878 for Willem Stevens. The millwright was J Rietsma of Zeijerveld. In 1899, the mill came into the possession of Geert Stevens, brother of Willem. It passed to his nephew Jannes Stevens in 1930. He hired the mill out, firstly to Roelof Bosman, then Jente Venema, the Enting brothers and finally to a Co-operative Society. In 1946, four new sails were fitted by millwright Dijk of Leek. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) The mill had been reduced to working on two sails by this date. Photographs show that the mill was equipped with Patent sails at one time. In 1962, the Nijhof family of Haren, Groningen bought the mill and restored it. The base was used a living accommodation until 1973 when a new house was built adjoining the mill. During this time the condition of the mill deteriorated and it was no longer in working order. The mill was restored in 1990 but by then nearby trees were robbing the mill of wind. They were cut down in 1998. In that year, the mill was sold to Jan Doorenbos. A new entrance was made to the mill so that visitors did not have to enter though the house. In 2002 the mill was equipped with two pairs of millstones, restoring it to its pre-1962 condition. Description Noordenveld is what the Dutch describe as an \\"achtkante stellingmolen\\". It is a two-storey smock mill on a three-storey brick base. The stage is at second-floor level, above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common sails have a span of are carried in a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by Fabrikaat Muinck-Keizer of Martenshoek, Groningen in 1904. The windshaft was originally cast solid and had to be bored through to take Patent sails at a later date, this was probably the work of a millwright called Rolde. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel, which has 55 cogs. The brake wheel drives the wallower (30 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft the great spur wheel, which has 86 cogs, drives the diameter Cullen millstones and the French Burr millstones via lantern pinion stone nuts which have 27 staves each.

Vincent's work focuses on memoirs, politics and current events. Vincent's best-known solo work is Same Kind of Different as Me: A Modern-Day Slave, an International Art Dealer, and the Unlikely Woman Who Bound Them Together. The tale of a friendship between a wealthy Texan and a black homeless man has been on the New York Times Best Seller list since October 2008. She co-wrote Sarah Palin's 2009 memoir, Going Rogue: An American Life. In 2010, Vincent wrote, with Todd Burpo, Heaven Is for Real: A Little Boy's Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back, the story of the four- year-old son of a Nebraska pastor who during emergency surgery visits heaven. Vincent, a U.S. Navy veteran, spent 11 years as an investigative reporter and feature writer for WORLD magazine, a conservative Christian newsweekly. She has lectured on writing at the World Journalism Institute, and at The King's College in New York City.

Testing The field portion of the Soldier Integrated Protective Ensemble (SIPE) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) was conducted at Fort Benning, Georgia, from September through November 1992. Individual task performance-data were collected by the Test and Experimentation Command (TEXCOM) Close Combat Test Directorate, and collective task performance data were assessed by personnel from the U.S. Army Infantry School (USAIS). Soldier impressions on and suggestions for the SIPE equipment were collected. As a technical advisory service to the SIPE ATD, U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI) personnel collected this data. The SIPE, configured as a head-to-toe individual fighting system, demonstrated considerable potential for enhanced soldier capabilities and operational effectiveness. However, the equipment, only prototype in nature, affected test soldier performance and attitude. The enhanced communications capability and thermal sight on the rifle, as well as some items of clothing, were deemed very acceptable; other items were rejected or insufficiently tested. Further testing would be beneficial.SIPE: The Soldiers' Perspective Psychological effect This system will increase lethality, mobility, survivability, command and control and overall protection of the troops. This environmental chamber study compared physiological responses of volunteers exercising in MOPP 0, MOPP 1, and MOPP 4 with equivalent SIPE configurations, including SIPE 4 with and without ambient air microclimate cooling (MCC). Responses to all uniforms were compared over 100 minutes of continuous treadmill walking at 30.0 deg C, 50% rh. Responses to MOPP 4 and SIPE 4 with no cooling were also compared over 100 minutes at 18.5 deg C, 50% rh. Responses to MOPP 4 and SIPE 4 MCC were compared over four hours of intermittent work-rest cycles at 30.0 deg C, .50% rh. There were no differences between MOPP 0 and SIPE 0, MOPP 1 and SIPE 1, and MOPP 4 and SIPE 4 with no cooling (in both environments) . Core temperature, skin temperature, heat storage, and heart rate were lower in SIPE 4 MCC than in MOPP 4; while evaporative cooling was greater in SIPE 4 MCC than in MOPP 4. Three volunteers completed the 4-hour tests in SIPE 4 MCC with similar advantageous trends apparent from the cooling. It is concluded that the SIPE clothing did not increase thermal strain compared to equivalent MOPP levels, and MCC, (although increasing uniform weight by approximately 10 kg) reduced thermal strain at 30.0 deg Celsius.

Feces contains a relatively small amount of metabolic waste products such as bacterially altered bilirubin, and dead epithelial cells from the lining of the gut. Feces is discharged through the anus or cloaca during defecation. Feces can be used as fertilizer or soil conditioner in agriculture. It can also be burned as fuel or dried and used for construction. Some medicinal uses have been found. In the case of human feces, fecal transplants or fecal bacteriotherapy are in use. Urine and feces together are called excreta. Skatole is the principal compound responsible for the unpleasant smell of feces. Characteristics File:BearApplePoop.JPGBear scat File:Mixedplasticbearpoo.jpgBear scat showing consumption of bin bags File:Kasuar fg1.jpgThe cassowary disperses plant seeds via its feces File:Earthworm faeces.jpgEarthworm feces aids in provision of minerals and plant nutrients in an accessible form The distinctive odor of feces is due to skatole, and thiols (sulfur-containing compounds), as well as amines and carboxylic acids. Skatole is produced from tryptophan via indoleacetic acid. Decarboxylation gives skatole. The perceived bad odor of feces has been hypothesized to be a deterrent for humans, as consuming or touching it may result in sickness or infection. Physiology Feces is discharged through the anus or cloaca during defecation. This process requires pressures that may reach in humans and in penguins. The forces required to expel the feces is generated through muscular contractions and a build-up of gases inside the gut, prompting the sphincter to relieve the pressure and to release the feces. Ecology After an animal has digested eaten material, the remains of that material are discharged from its body as waste. Although it is lower in energy than the food from which it is derived, feces may retain a large amount of energy, often 50% of that of the original food. This means that of all food eaten, a significant amount of energy remains for the decomposers of ecosystems. Many organisms feed on feces, from bacteria to fungi to insects such as dung beetles, who can sense odors from long distances. Some may specialize in feces, while others may eat other foods. Feces serves not only as a basic food, but also as a supplement to the usual diet of some animals. This process is known as coprophagia, and occurs in various animal species such as young elephants eating the feces of their mothers to gain essential gut flora, or by other animals such as dogs, rabbits, and monkeys. Feces and urine, which reflect ultraviolet light, are important to raptors such as kestrels, who can see the near ultraviolet and thus find their prey by their middens and territorial markers. Seeds also may be found in feces. Animals who eat fruit are known as frugivores. An advantage for a plant in having fruit is that animals will eat the fruit and unknowingly disperse the seed in doing so. This mode of seed dispersal is highly successful, as seeds dispersed around the base of a plant are unlikely to succeed and often are subject to heavy predation. Provided the seed can withstand the pathway through the digestive system, it is not only likely to be far away from the parent plant, but is even provided with its own fertilizer. Organisms that subsist on dead organic matter or detritus are known as detritivores, and play an important role in ecosystems by recycling organic matter back into a simpler form that plants and other autotrophs may absorb once again. This cycling of matter is known as the biogeochemical cycle. To maintain nutrients in soil it is therefore important that feces returns to the area from which they came, which is not always the case in human society where food may be transported from rural areas to urban populations and then feces disposed of into a river or sea. Human feces Depending on the individual and the circumstances, human beings may defecate several times a day, every day, or once every two or three days. Extensive hardening of the feces that interrupts this routine for several days or more is called constipation. The appearance of human fecal matter varies according to diet and health. Normally it is semisolid, with a mucus coating. A combination of bile and bilirubin, which comes from dead red blood cells, gives feces the typical brown color. After the meconium, the first stool expelled, a newborn's feces contains only bile, which gives it a yellow-green color. Breast feeding babies expel soft, pale yellowish, and not quite malodorous matter; but once the baby begins to eat, and the body starts expelling bilirubin from dead red blood cells, its matter acquires the familiar brown color. At different times in their life, human beings will expel feces of different colors and textures. A stool that passes rapidly through the intestines will look greenish; lack of bilirubin will make the stool look like clay.  Uses of animal feces =Fertilizer The feces of animals, e.g. guano and manure often are used as fertilizer. Energy  Dry animal dung is burned and used as a fuel source in many countries around the world. Some animal feces, especially that of camel, bison, and cattle, is a source of fuel when dried. Animals such as the giant panda and zebra possess gut bacteria capable of producing biofuel. The bacterium in quesion, Brocadia anammoxidans, can be used to synthesize the rocket fuel hydrazine.  Coprolites and paleofeces  A coprolite is fossilized feces and is classified as a trace fossil. In paleontology they give evidence about the diet of an animal. They were first described by William Buckland in 1829. Prior to this they were known as \\"fossil fir cones\\" and \\"bezoar stones\\". They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms. Coprolites may range in size from a few millimetres to more than 60 centimetres. Palaeofeces is ancient human feces, often found as part of archaeological excavations or surveys. Intact feces of ancient people may be found in caves in arid climates and in other locations with suitable preservation conditions. These are studied to determine the diet and health of the people who produced them through the analysis of seeds, small bones, and parasite eggs found inside. This feces may contain information about the person excreting the material as well as information about the material. They also may be analyzed chemically for more in-depth information on the individual who excreted them, using lipid analysis and ancient DNA analysis. The success rate of usable DNA extraction is relatively high in paleofeces, making it more reliable than skeletal DNA retrieval. The reason this analysis is possible at all is due to the digestive system not being entirely efficient, in the sense that not everything that passes through the digestive system is destroyed. Not all of the surviving material is recognizable, but some of it is. Generally, this material is the best indicator archaeologists can use to determine ancient diets, as no other part of the archaeological record is so direct an indicator. A process that preserves feces in a way that they may be analyzed later is called the Maillard reaction. This reaction creates a casing of sugar that preserves the feces from the elements. To extract and analyze the information contained within, researchers generally have to freeze the feces and grind it up into powder for analysis. Other uses Pet waste station at government building Animal dung occasionally is used as a cement to make adobe mudbrick huts, or even in throwing sports such as cow pat throwing or camel dung throwing contests. Kopi luwak (pronounced ), or civet coffee, is coffee made from coffee berries that have been eaten by and passed through the digestive tract of the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). Giant pandas provide fertilizer for the world's most expensive green tea. In Malaysia, tea is made from the droppings of stick insects fed on guava leaves. In northern Thailand, elephants are used to digest coffee beans in order to make Black Ivory coffee, which is among the world's most expensive coffees. Dog feces was used in the tanning process of leather during the Victorian era. Collected dog feces, known as \\"pure\\", \\"puer\\", or \\"pewer\\", n., 6 was mixed with water to form a substance known as \\"bate\\". Enzymes in the dog feces helped to relax the fibrous structure of the hide before the final stages of tanning. Elephants, hippos, koalas and pandas are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from eating the feces of their mothers to digest vegetation. In India, cow dung and cow urine are major ingredients of the traditional Hindu drink Panchagavya. Politician Shankarbhai Vegad said in 2015, \\"I am witness to it, cow dung and urine are a 100 per cent cure for cancer\\".  Terminology  Cyclosia papilionaris consuming bird droppings Feces is the scientific terminology, while the term stool is also commonly used in medical contexts. Outside of scientific contexts, these terms are less common, with the most common layman's term being poo (or poop in North American English). The term shit is also in common use, although is widely considered vulgar or offensive. There are many other terms, see below.  Etymology  The word faeces is the plural of the Latin word faex meaning \\"dregs\\". In most English- language usage, there is no singular form, making the word a plurale tantum; out of various major dictionaries, only one enters variation from plural agreement. Synonyms \\"Feces\\" is used more in biology and medicine than in other fields (reflecting science's tradition of classical Latin and New Latin) *In hunting and tracking, terms such as dung, scat, spoor, and droppings normally are used to refer to non-human animal feces *In husbandry and farming, manure is common. *Stool is a common term in reference to human feces. For example, in medicine, to diagnose the presence or absence of a medical condition, a stool sample sometimes is requested for testing purposes. *The term bowel movement(s) (with each movement a defecation event) is also common in health care. There are many synonyms in informal registers for feces, just like there are for urine. Many are euphemismistic, colloquial, or both; some are profane (such as shit), whereas most belong chiefly to child- directed speech (such as poo or poop) or to crude humor (such as crap, dump, load and turd.). Horse feces  Feces of animals  The feces of animals often have special names, for example: *Non-human animals **As bulk material - dung **Individually - droppings *Cattle **Bulk material - cow dung **Individual droppings - cow pats, meadow muffins, etc. *Deer (and formerly other quarry animals) - fewmets * Wild carnivores - scat *Otter - spraint *Birds (individual) - droppings (also include urine as white crystals of uric acid) *Seabirds or bats (large accumulations) - guano *Herbivorous insects, such as caterpillars and leaf beetles - frass *Earthworms, lugworms etc. - worm castings (feces extruded at ground surface) *Feces when used as fertilizer (usually mixed with animal bedding and urine) - manure *Horses - horse manure, roadapple (before motor vehicles became common, horse droppings were a big part of the rubbish communities needed to clean off roads)  Society and culture  Sign ordering owners to clean up after pets, Houston, Texas, 2011 Feelings of disgust In all human cultures, feces elicits varying degrees of disgust in adults. Children under two years typically have no disgust response to it, suggesting it is culturally derived.

He currently plays for FC Liefering. Austrian striker Mario Konrad made his way into professional football after spells as a youth player at both hometown club SK Rapid Vienna and VFB Stuttgart. In 2001, he signed a professional contract with SC Schwarz-Wei√ü Bregenz, a club in Austria's regional divisions based on Lake Constance. After a successful three years in Bregenz, Konrad agreed to terms with Styrian outfit Kapfenberger SV who were at the time in the second tier of Austrian football. Another move followed just 12 months later as Konrad enjoyed a two-year stay at the much more renowned LASK Linz. A short stint in Germany with SpVgg Unterhaching ensued, before Konrad made the short trip south back to his native Austria to play for another Vorarlberg side SCR Altach. At the start of the 2009/10 season, Konrad made a surprise move to Austria's biggest and best supported club SK Rapid Vienna, scoring his first goal for the Green & Whites against SK Austria K√§rnten. Konrad struggled during his time at the Gerhard Hanappi Stadium and after having failed to convince during his 15 appearances was subsequently banished to train with the reserves. Having failed to ship him out in the close season, Rapid kept Konrad's registration throughout the 2010/2011 season, in which he failed to make an appearance. At the end of the season Konrad finally found an escape route in the shape of regional league outfit SV Horn, with whom he achieved promotion to the second tier in his first season. Despite having enjoyed moderate success at Horn, Konrad made the surprise move to FC Liefering, a reserve side/feeder club for FC Red Bull Salzburg.

Libertad was a more militant anarchist, urging individuals to rebel, instead of the more common idea of a social revolution. L'Anarchie was against Anarcho-syndicalism and the traditional anarchism of Kropotkin or Bakunin, believing in the act of rebelling as individuals rather than the utopian egalitarian society most Anarcho- Syndicalists fight for. √âmile Armand said in an interview that \\"[Libertad] knew of Stirner and Nietzsche. One was not concerned with a future society always promised and which never came; the economic and social point of view was put to the side.

After being elected assistant general secretary of the Caledonian Union in 1977, he contested the East constituency in the elections that year and was elected to the Territorial Assembly, and was re-elected in 1979 when the party ran as part of the Independence Front. Following the assassination of Pierre Declercq on 19 September 1981, Machoro became the party's general secretary. He and other separatist militants went to Libya. The Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) was formed in September 1984 as a replacement for the Independence Front, boycotting the elections in November. On 1 December Jean-Marie Tjibaou declared the formation of a provisional government of Kanak Socialist Republic, with Machoro as Minister of Security. As a result, he became the leader of the independents' armed forces. He disarmed the gendarmes of Thio, and gained control over the village without violence. On 11 January 1985 he killed Yves Tual, the son of a European stockbreeder. These events triggered a series of nighttime rebellions.

It explores the dark side of London's underworld and the international pharmaceutical industry.  Plot  Adam Kindred is a recently divorced climatologist who has moved back to England. After attending an interview for a Senior Research Fellowship position at Imperial College, London, he goes into an Italian restaurant in Chelsea and briefly encounters Dr Philip Wang, who accidentally leaves a file behind. Adam takes it to Wang's hotel, only to discover that Wang has been murdered and still has the knife in his body. Before Wang dies, he asks Adam to remove it and so Adam becomes incriminated in his murder. Adam is tailed by the murderer Jonjo to his hotel and only narrowly escapes, but he sees Jonjo's face. Deciding to take refuge, he shelters in a small enclosed patch of gardens on London's Embankment to give himself time to think. He decides to go underground, cutting up all his cards and removing anything that could identify him. He soon leads the life of a down-and-out, searching in rubbish bins for food and only venturing out at night. In the meantime, he decides to try to find out from the file in his possession why Wang was murdered and if there is any connection to Calenture-Deutz, the pharmaceutical company Wang was working for. Calenture-Deutz is a company set up by Ingram Fryzer who is another of the novel's protagonists. Ingram is married with three children and is about to reap large profits from the introduction of a new anti-asthma drug, Zembla-4, that is just about to be launched onto the market after its clinical trials supervised by Dr Wang. To speed up the search for the killer, the company offers a ¬£100,000 reward. Adam decides to visit St Botolph's hospital to find out what Wang was working on. After leaving the hospital he loses his way and is viciously mugged near the Shaftsbury estate [a sink estate] in Rotherhithe, and is helped by Mhouse, a prostitute, who gives him the address of the Church of John Christ. He decides to visit the church to get a decent meal and meets others there who are in the same dire situation. Meanwhile, Ingram is having his own troubles - Alfredo Rilke is a major shareholder in his company and he wants to launch Zembla-4 against Ingram's wishes, since he considers it too early. It turns out, unbeknown to Ingram, that Rilke has arranged for Jonjo, the man who killed Philip Wang, to find Adam and the missing file which is vital to Rilke since it contains evidence that is damaging to the new drug. Adam continues his life as a beggar, doing very well posing as a partially sighted man to obtain money from sympathetic people. Meanwhile, Jonjo is getting closer to him. His enquiries lead him to the Shaftsbury estate and he pays to find out where Adam is. He learns where Adam was dropped off by Mhouse and her friend, Mohammed, and waits for Adam at his Embankment hideaway. Adam recognises him from the earlier encounter and decides to rent a room with Mhouse and her young son, Ly-on, paying Mhouse for sex from his begging money. His life becomes more stable until, one evening whilst walking hand in hand with Ly-on, he passes Jonjo who does not recognise him with his beard. Adam tells Mhouse he has to leave for Scotland and shacks up with Vladimir, who he met at the Church of John Christ. When he finds Vlad dead the next day, Adam decides to take on Vlad's fake identity as Primo Belem and his new job as a hospital porter at Bethnal & Bow. He gets a transfer to St Botolph's, where he is able to establish why there are problems with the Zembla-4 drug. Ingram Fryzer realizes that there is something strange about the drug but decides to fit in with Rilke's plans, knowing that he will financially benefit from them. However, he suspects that there is a plot to unseat him. In the meantime, Adam has decided on a plan for attacking Calenture-Deutz following the death of Mhouse at the hands of Jonjo. He also meets Rita, a policewoman, whilst identifying Mhouse's body, and starts to see more of her. He puts his scheme into place and, as a result, Fryzer's comfortable life starts to collapse around him, particularly after a shareholder's meeting and the sale of shares by his selfish, weak brother-in- law, Ivo Lord Redcastle, who is a director on the company's board. Bad news starts to surround Zembla-4 and Rilke eventually informs Ingram that his proposed takeover of Calenture-Deutz is now off. Ingram has also been feeling strangely ill and it turns out he has a brain tumour that requires an operation. Jonjo, having failed to find Kindred, is sacked from his position as a 'security consultant' and is forced to leave the country after realizing that he will be made the fall guy for Philip Wang's murder and that killers are now after him. And Adam Kindred, happily involved with Rita and Ly-on, wonders whether he should retain his identity of Primo Belem or tell Rita the truth and assume his former life as Adam Kindred.

The Aleutian Arc is a large volcanic arc in the U.S. state of Alaska. It consists of a number of active and dormant volcanoes that have formed as a result of subduction along the Aleutian Trench. Although taking its name from the Aleutian Islands, this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Aleutian Arc extends through the Alaska Peninsula following the Aleutian Range to the Aleutian Islands. The Aleutian Arc reflects subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate. It extends from the Kamchatka Peninsula in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east. Unimak Pass at the southwestern end of the Alaska Peninsula marks the eastward transition from an intra- oceanic in the west to a continental arc in the east. Due to the arcuate geometry of the trench, the relative velocity vector changes from almost trench-normal in the Gulf of Alaska to almost trench-parallel in the west.

Bernabei was also a close friend and associate of five-time Prime Minister and important Christian Democrat Amintore Fanfani.Cavazza, Fabio Luca, ‚ÄôItaly: from Party Occupation to Party Partition‚Äô, in Smith, Anthony and Ortmark, √Öke eds., Television and political life: studies in six European countries, pp. 76‚Äì114 (Macmillan, 1979). Career with RAI In 1961, Fanfani appointed Bernabei to be the Director General of Radio Audizioni Italiane (RAI), where he remained until 1974. He took over RAI in the midst of an Italian Constitutional Court decision, renewing RAI's monopoly over television broadcasting. During his tenure as Director General, he furthered the tight grasp that the Christian Democratic party held over the broadcaster. His aim was to entertain and educate all viewers, while creating larger public support for the Christian Democracy.Padovani, Cinzia, A Fatal Attraction: Public Television and Politics in Italy (Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2005). Opponents charged Bernabei and RAI with being too intertwined with the governing party. In order to create a seemingly more balanced RAI and to appease these opponents, Bernabei began to hire journalists with ties to other parties. This was merely a symbolic gesture, as he largely ignored the ideas of these new employees and stuck to his own agenda. Bernabei's strategy greatly increased the size of RAI, but ultimately backfired for two reasons: RAI became full of political enemies and RAI's Christian Democrats split into competing groups. As a result of his hiring policies, he began to lose his once strong control over the broadcaster, and by the time he left in 1974, RAI was in need of reform. Despite all this, Bernabei's leadership is often regretted as a form of entertainment inspired by pedagogical principles, which has been missing hitherto in the Italian television.http://www.tvblog.it/post/5844/ettore- bernabei-il-censore-della-rai Post-RAI Career From 1974 to 1991 Bernabei was the managing director and chairman of Italstat. In 1991, with a group of Italian entrepreneurs he started the television production company Lux Vide, which is famous for series such as The Bible and Jesus. Since February 2007, he has served on the advisory board for T-Systems Italia SpA. He died on 13 August 2016.

It was developed during the 1950s and used for the four- story window in the lobby of the California Masonic Memorial Temple on San Francisco's Nob Hill, which has become the artist's largest and best-known work. The technique was developed as a natural progression of Norman's interest in the use of both natural and man-made materials. On a trip to Europe in the 1940s Norman learnt about the \\"German Mastic\\" technique and first encountered epoxy. The endomosaic technique was later developed and used while designing the window displays for the Bergdorf Goodman luxury goods department store in New York City. After Norman's move back to California, the technique was used to create a mural at Casa Munras Hospital in Monterey, California. It was this mural which attracted the attention of the Masonic Temple's architect Albert Roller. Roller invited Norman to design the large window which would be placed over the entrance to the building. The endomosaic technique incorporates naturally coloured materials like seashells and stones mixed in with coloured glass and acrylic as well as fabric, grass, earth, and glass powder. The materials are sandwiched between thin panes of clear plastic or glass which are then soldered together and hung in a window frame. Since its use in the 1950s, the technique has gone out of fashion with Norman himself moving on to use different techniques as his career developed.

Artistic style and career  Created from bronze, fiberglass, plastic, and resin, Amery's mixed media works reflect her view of what man is doing to the world and to the environment. Her sculptures and paintings have been interpreted as both figurative and abstract. Amery addresses the breakdown of society, overpopulation, pollution, greed and violence. Amery's works complement each other and create a forced tension not easily overlooked. Amery wants \\"like a spider, to coax [her] audience into a trap where they are forced to interact with thoughts and feelings they may not want to address.\\" Amery's works are emblematic of her Anglo-Iranian life and the various Iranian, Islamic and Eastern influences. Amery has a studio in Chelsea London and exhibitions of her work including shows at the Royal Society of British women sculptors, Cleveland's Dorman Museum, London's Orangery and at various museums in Iran. She also has auctioned her work off at Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions. Sources As of 2009-10-01, this article uses content from SHENDA AMERY.

It is measured by perfect order fulfillment and demonstrates the degree to which a supplier is able to serve its customers within the promised delivery time. Following the nomenclature of the DR-DP- Matrix, three main approaches to measure DR can be distinguished: :*DR_{T}^{V} (=CLIP) :*DR_{D}^{S} :*DR_{T}^{S} :Type of measurement: volume (V)/singular(S) :Type of view: on time (T)/ delivery (D) Volume/on time (=CLIP)=Formula If (Demand_{p,c} + Backlog_{p-1,c}>0) :DR_{T}^{V} = min(\\\\frac{Delivered_{p,c} + Predelivery_{p-1,c}}{Demand_{p,c} + Backlog_{p-1,c}}, 1) Note: In the case that supplier notifies the appropriate partner in the supply chain that a promised delivery date/quantity cannot be met which is called delivery early warning (DEW), the sum of DEW issued to reduce the commit for a certain week is added in the denominator. Else :NULL Demand: Suppliers confirmed quantity; c: Product identifier; p: Time period e.g. a day, a week, a month ...

Joachim II ( or Hektor; 13 January 1505 ‚Äì 3 January 1571) was a Prince-elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1535‚Äì1571), the sixth member of the House of Hohenzollern. Joachim II was the eldest son of Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg and his wife Elizabeth of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. He received the cognomen Hector after the Trojan prince and warrior for his qualities and prowess. Biography Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg, painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder Joachim II was born in C√∂lln. His father, Joachim I Nestor, made Joachim Hector sign an inheritance contract in which he promised to remain Roman Catholic. This was intended in part to assist Joachim Nestor's younger brother, the Archbishop-Elector Albert of Mainz. Albert had borrowed huge amounts from the banking house of Fugger in order to pay the Holy See for his elevation to the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt and for a dispensation permitting him to hold both the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and Archbishopric of Mainz. Joachim Nestor, who had co-financed this accumulation of offices, agreed to let Albert recover these costs by the sale of indulgences to his subjects. Joachim's neighbor, Elector John Frederick I of Saxony, forbade the sale of indulgences, because Albert had outbid his candidate for the see of Mainz, but also on principle, being persuaded by his subject Martin Luther. Thus repayment of the debt to the Fugger depended on the sale of indulgences to Catholic believers in Brandenburg. However, had Joachim Hector not agreed to this, he would likely have been passed over in the line of inheritance. His first marriage was to Magdalena of Saxony from the ducal Albertine line of the House of Wettin. She died in 1534. In 1535 he married Hedwig, daughter of King Sigismund I the Old of Poland. As the Jagiellon dynasty was Catholic, Joachim II promised Sigismund that he would not make Hedwig change her religious affiliation. With the deaths of his father Joachim Nestor (1535) and father- in-law Sigismund (1548), Joachim turned gradually to the Protestant Reformation. On 1 November 1539, he received Communion under both kinds in Spandau's St. Nicholas' Church, an act that indicated a degree of sympathy with the new religious ideas. However, Joachim did not explicitly adopt Lutheranism until 1555, to avoid open confrontation with his ally, Emperor Charles V. Prior to this, Joachim promulgated a conservative church order that was Lutheran in doctrine, but retained many traditional religious institutions and observances, such as the episcopate, much of the Mass in Latin, religious plays and feast days. In early 1539, at the diet of princes of imperial immediacy (F√ºrstentag) of the Holy Roman Empire in Frankfurt upon Main, Lutheran spokesman Philipp Melanchthon revealed to the gathered princes (among them Joachim) that the anti-Jewish pogroms of 1510 in Brandenburg had been based on a feigned host desecration. This pogrom had resulted in the expulsion of the Jews from Brandenburg. The Jewish advocate Josel von Rosheim, who was also in attendance, pleaded privately with Joachim to allow the Jews to settle in the Brandenburg again. Joachim acceded to this request on 25 June 1539.Eugen Wolbe, Geschichte der Juden in Berlin und in der Mark Brandenburg, Berlin: Kedem, 1937, p. 64. His wife Hedwig's mother Barbara Z√°polya was a sister of John Z√°polya, who had claimed the vacant throne of Hungary after King Louis II was killed in battle against the Ottoman Empire in 1526. However, Joachim supported Ferdinand of Habsburg, who also claimed the crown and challenged the Turkish invaders. In 1542 Joachim assisted Ferdinand against the Ottomans at the Siege of Buda (1541). He commanded an army of Austrian, Hungarian, German, Bohemian, Italian, and Dalmatian troops, but the Elector was not a seasoned warrior and eventually beat a retreat.History of Hungary 1526‚Äì1686, Zsigmond Pach and √Ågnes R. V√°rkonyi (eds.), Budapest: Akad√©mia Publisher, 1985. He was defeated again by the Ottomans in the Siege of Pest in 1542. In 1545 Joachim held a gala double wedding celebration for his two children, John George and Barbara. They were married to Sophie and George, both children of the Piast Duke Frederick II of Liegnitz in Silesia. Joachim was a brother-in-law of King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland. In 1569, he paid Sigismund for a deed of enfeoffment which made Joachim and his issue heirs to Ducal Prussia in case of the extinction of the Prussian Hohenzollern line. In 1571, Joachim died in the K√∂penick Palace, which he had built in 1558.

A total of 51 2-car train sets were built by GEC Alsthom from about 1990 to 1993, for a total of 102 cars. They entered service in 1996 as the first trains on the newly opened Metro system. They are part of the VAL family of automated, driverless rubber-tired metros developed by the French company Matra. Each four-car train is formed by two coupled two-car trainsets. Any two sets can be coupled and their numbers do not need to be consecutive, unlike heavy-capacity trains. Within a year of revenue operations, Matra terminated the service contract, removing all maintenance crew. They filed and won a complaint against the Taipei City Government over contract compensation delay. The VAL 256 trains remained in service for twelve more years, serviced by TRTC engineers and Academia Sinica researchers.Taipei Metro ‚Äì Approaches and strategies in managing an extensive and diverse rail framework, Richard C.L.

When the Muzha/Wenshan line was extended into Neihu in June 2003, Bombardier Transportation was contracted to replace the Matra-based system with its own, computerized CITYFLO 650 CBTC system, and overhauling the older Matra cars to function under the new system. This took place over a period of 17 months and all 51 sets returned to service in December 2010. Bombardier's contract also involved supplying 101 newly built vehicles to expand the existing fleet. Integration of the Bombardier-built cars with the Matra-built cars led to multiple system malfunctions and failures along the Wenshan and Neihu Lines. The VAL 256 cars are also used by O'Hare International Airport's Airport Transit System, albeit with the majority of the seats removed since the system's primary purpose is to move passengers between terminals as well as provide access to the economy parking lots, rental car facility, and the Metra station.

At labor conventions, she was sometimes the only female delegate, and was partly responsible for the mandatory listing of ingredients on food labels. Smith was also a magazine editor, active in gaining recognition of women inventors. Early life Charlotte Smith was born Charlotte Odlum in or near the village of Waddington in upstate New York, in 1840. She was the oldest child of Irish immigrants, Richard Odlum and his wife Catherine. Richard is listed as \\"engaged in agriculture\\" in the 1840 census. After a difficult childhood (three siblings dying as infants, father soon absent, mother supporting Charlotte and her three surviving brothers by keeping boarders, frequent moves interrupting her education), she became the head of the household after Richard's death in the mid-1850s. During this period the Odlums traveled to New Orleans, then to New York City, Boston, Detroit, Cleveland, and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. These journeys were made partly in search of medical care for Catherine Odlum, who was suffering from a diseased tooth. Before she was twenty, Charlotte was running her own shop in St. Louis, Missouri, while her mother ran a boardinghouse. In 1860 Charlotte, her mother and two of her brothers traveled to Cuba, returning to New Orleans from Havana on March 21, 1861, the same day Louisiana ratified the Confederate Constitution. When Charlotte's brother David enlisted under-age in the Civil War, the family tried to bring him back, but were trapped in occupied Memphis, Tennessee for the rest of the conflict. David, serving under the name \\"Charles Rogers\\" in the 8th Missouri Volunteer Infantry, disappeared after the Battle of Shiloh; it was never known whether he had been killed, captured or had deserted. Charlotte, however, ran the Union blockade across the Ohio River, and evidently made thousands of dollars doing so. At the same time, she and her mother were providing milk, butter, and nursing services to Union soldiers in Memphis. On April 4, 1864, the Odlums' house in Memphis was torn down by Union troops to clear an artillery firing path. After the war, the family went to Mobile, Alabama, where Charlotte opened an enormously profitable dry goods store, and Catherine ran multiple boardinghouses. Here, Charlotte met and eventually married Edward Smith, an Irish-born merchant. The marriage failed, and almost immediately after the birth of her second son, Charlotte moved to Chicago. The bookstore she started there was destroyed by the Great Fire of 1871, and she fled with her children to St. Louis, where she published a book on the Fire, and was soon doing newspaper work. Editor By 1873, with another Catholic businesswoman, Mary Nolan, she started her first magazine, the Inland Monthly. This publication was noteworthy in several ways: edited by a woman, but not a women's magazine, containing unusual amounts of science but virtually nothing about suffrage, and aiming with fiction, poetry, and essays at educated readers in general. It ran until 1878, when Smith sold it for a large sum and headed for Washington, D.C. Lobbyist for working women While in St. Louis, Smith had been awakened to the woes of the poor, including underpaid workers. She also saw the economic disadvantages of women in particular, and began calling for equal pay for equal work. She became particularly interested in the problems of prostitutes and women inventors, and resolved to try to advance their causes at the nation's capital. Swiftly obtaining the ear of Senator Henry W. Blair of New Hampshire, partly by her undercover research into working conditions for women and girls, she became a formidable lobbyist for her causes. She also founded a union of female federal clerks, called the Women's Nation Industrial League, brought it into the Knights of Labor, and spoke at labor conventions, sometimes as the only female delegate. In 1886 she founded her second periodical, the Working Woman. This was far more radical, and less successful, than the Inland Monthly. Very few issues survive. On May 19, 1885, Charlotte Smith's brother, Robert Emmet Odlum, a swimming instructor, decided to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge to prove that it was possible; he died in the attempt. Charlotte visited New York on May 28 and spoke to Coroner William H. Kennedy, who denied responsibility for removing Odlum's heart and liver.\\"The Public \\"I\\": A VERY BAD IDEA\\" thepublici.blogspot.com (Retrieved on July 1, 2011) In 1896 the Women's Rescue League, presided by Smith, passed a resolution denouncing \\"bicycle riding by young women because [it produces] immoral suggestions and imprudent associations both in language and dress which have a tendency to make women not only unwomanly, but immodest as well\\". By the early 1890s Charlotte Smith was already credited with gaining or helping to gain passage of more than fifty bills through Congress, as well as gathering data used in Senator Blair's Committee on Education and Labor, and becoming the foremost authority on working conditions for women and girls. Notable among her successful causes were Chinese Exclusion legislation and laws against the adulteration of foods, cosmetics, and medicines. She was partly responsible for the listing of ingredients on product labels. Female inventors Smith also became involved in the fight to win more of a role for women in the great World's Columbian Exposition of 1892-3. Specifically, she fought for more recognition of Queen Isabella's enabling role in Christopher Columbus's discoveries, and for women inventors. In 1892 she founded a third periodical, the Woman InventorThe Women Inventor, https://archive.org/details/Womaninventor1Smit which ran for 2 issues, and crusaded for a permanent exhibition of women's inventive work in Washington, D.C. Her major achievement for women inventors, however, was persuading the United States Patent Office to issue a list of all female holders of U.S. patents to that date (1883).Women inventors to whom patents have been granted by the United States government, 1790 to July 1, 1888 [and Appendix no. 1-2, July 1, 1888 to March 1, 1895], In addition to working through legislatures and organizations, Charlotte Smith also took direct action, personally helping many poor women and \\"underdogs,\\" and providing housing for poor working girls with her own money. During these years (1880s - early 1890s), she was one of the best-known women in America, with hundreds of articles appearing about her in The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Boston Globe, and smaller newspapers as far away as Montana and Hawaii. The last chapter of Smith's life took place in Boston, Massachusetts, where she continued to work for her main cause, the welfare and advancement of working women, in the legislatures of Massachusetts and Maryland, as well as in Congress. Her fame diminished in her last years, and when she died in Boston in 1917, she was buried in a pauper's grave. Page 11 of the Tuesday, Dec. 4, 1917 edition of the Boston Herald carried an obituary for Charlotte Smith stating the ‚Äúchampion of the working girl and indefatigable crusader against vice and everything else she has found amiss in the world about her, died from pneumonia late last night at the City Hospital. She was 65 years old. She was taken to the hospital last Friday [Nov. 30, 1917] from her home, 36 Oak street, [in Boston‚Äôs] south end.\\" References Other sources  * *Tejera, P. (2018).

Supergeometry is part and parcel of many classical and quantum field theories involving odd fields, e.g., SUSY field theory, BRST theory, or supergravity. Supergeometry is formulated in terms of \\\\mathbb Z_2-graded modules and sheaves over \\\\mathbb Z_2-graded commutative algebras (supercommutative algebras). In particular, superconnections are defined as Koszul connections on these modules and sheaves. However, supergeometry is not particular noncommutative geometry because of a different definition of a graded derivation. Graded manifolds and supermanifolds also are phrased in terms of sheaves of graded commutative algebras. Graded manifolds are characterized by sheaves on smooth manifolds, while supermanifolds are constructed by gluing of sheaves of supervector spaces. There are different types of supermanifolds. These are smooth supermanifolds (H^\\\\infty-, G^\\\\infty-, GH^\\\\infty-supermanifolds), G-supermanifolds, and DeWitt supermanifolds. In particular, supervector bundles and principal superbundles are considered in the category of G-supermanifolds. Definitions of principal superbundles and principal superconnections straightforwardly follow that of smooth principal bundles and principal connections. Principal graded bundles also are considered in the category of graded manifolds. There is a different class of Quillen‚ÄìNe'eman superbundles and superconnections. These superconnections have been applied to computing the Chern character in K-theory, noncommutative geometry, and BRST formalism.

Biography = Australia: 1962‚Äì1966  Ritchie Yorke was born in 1944 in Brisbane, Australia. He began writing a weekly music column called Teen Topics for the Queensland edition of TV Week magazine in July 1962. From March 1964 to March 1965 he continued writing articles, relocating to work as a publicity and news reader at a radio station in Tamworth before returning to Brisbane to act as public relations director at 4KQ. It was during his time on radio in Tamworth that Yorke was delivered a copy of \\"Fingertips Pt. 2\\" by Little Stevie Wonder, a 12 year old blind boy. Impressed, Yorke played the song on his weekend show but was promptly told by higher-ups not to play this kind of music. In protest, the following week Yorke set up in his studio and managed to play \\"Fingertips Pt. 2\\" eight times in a row before he was removed from the studio and quickly fired. This caused Yorke's relocation to Brisbane to continue writing and making travel plans for the future.  United Kingdom: 1966‚Äì1967  In 1966, Ritchie left Australia for London, England. From May to November of that year, Ivan Dayman appointed him the international operations director of Sunshine Records. He prepared record deals for, and managed Australian pop star Normie Rowe prior to his arrival in England. In December 1966, Yorke began working for Island Records as an international promotion manager for the Spencer Davis Group. He was tasked with promoting the band outside of England in support of their record \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\". At this time, Yorke's first book was published, Lowdown on the English Pop Scene, foreword by Spencer Davis. A few months later Stevie Winwood left the Spencer Davis group to form a new band called Traffic, the managerial position of which was offered to Yorke, who declined, choosing instead to embark on a continental tour  Canada: 1967‚Äì1973  Yorke arrived in Canada in 1967, settling in Toronto. He found work with the Toronto Telegram before being appointed the first full- time rock writer for Canada's national newspaper, The Globe and Mail. He also became the Canadian editor of Billboard magazine from 1970 to 1980 and Rolling Stone magazine from 1969 to 1970. He also began contributing features to NME magazine. In late 1969, Yorke assisted John Lennon with the coordination and execution of John Lennon and Yoko Ono‚Äôs War Is Over! peace campaign. As well as helping to plan the Montreal bed-in from which Lennon‚Äôs peace anthem \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" emerged, and the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival, he was one of many volunteers who assisted in plastering the posters all over Toronto. Yorke also carried the posters alongside rock musician and friend Ronnie Hawkins in a 52,000 mile world tour as the Lennons‚Äô official peace envoy. This five week tour even had them carry and display the posters illegally across the Chinese border near Hong Kong where they were stopped by Red Guards and solemnly warned they would be shot if they did not leave.Express, N. M. (1970, 1970 Feb 14). Craziest Pop Pic Of Week? New Musical Express (Archive: 1952‚Äì2000), 15. Accessed via ProQuest, through the Entertainment Industry Magazine Archive During this time, Yorke also produced Edward Bear's first album Bearings under the pseudonym \\"Tuft\\". He also appears on the Bad Manors album by Crowbar, credited with playing the anvil on \\"Prince Of Peace\\" and tambourine on \\"Oh What A Feeling‚Äù. Yorke was partly responsible for the introduction of the Canadian Content legislation that was instated in 1971, acting as a major advocate of the policy from a music industry point of view. He testified both to the adequacy of Canada's music supply as well as the necessity of radio support to create a viable Canadian music industry. Later in 1971 he published the book Axes, Chops & Hot Licks, the first book to cover Canadian music culture and the development of the Canadian content laws, as well as the first book to be devoted entirely to any music scene outside of the United States or England. Later that year Yorke was named Canadian Journalist of the Year at the Juno Music Awards in Toronto.Billboard, (1972, Mar 18). General news: Ritchie Yorke gets Can.'s Juno award. Billboard (Archive: 1963‚Äì2000), 84, 3. Available here The following year, Yorke assisted in organising the Maple Music Junket in which numerous continental writers, radio and TV programmers and editors and filmmakers were invited to observe five concerts in Montreal and Toronto (two of the concerts were in French).  London-Canada: 1973‚Äì1986  In 1973, Yorke cut back on his assorted journalism and broadcasting activities to focus more heavily on books. Having befriended Led Zeppelin years earlier, he moved to London to work on their first official biography. He returned to Toronto in 1974, after serving on the Committee of Honour at the 8th Montreux International Jazz and Blues Festival. In 1975, he published his next book, Into the Music: The Van Morrison Biography. Early in 1976 he released the widely acclaimed book The History of Rock ‚Äôn‚Äô Roll to coincide with the CHUM produced documentary of the same name he had been working on, as well as publishing The Led Zeppelin Biography.  Australia: 1986‚Äì2017 In 1986, Yorke returned to his hometown of Brisbane, Australia to resume broadcasting and journalism. He worked as an announcer and producer for ABC Radio from 1987‚Äì1989 and wrote for Brisbane's Sunday Mail until 2007. During this time he also continued to work with Yoko Ono on various projects including her six disc Onobox collection. https://eprints.qut.edu.au/122547/1/Hamish_Hill_Thesis.pdfIn 1991, he edited and re-released his Led Zeppelin book, this time titled Led Zeppelin: The Definitive Biography. In 2013 he married his third wife Minnie, and in 2015 he published his most recent book, detailing his relationship with John Lennon and his involvement in the peace campaign titled Christ You Know It Ain‚Äôt Easy: John and Yoko‚Äôs Battle for Peace with a foreword by Yoko Ono. Ritchie Yorke died in hospital in Brisbane on 6 February 2017, from complications of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \\"Ritchie Yorke, Brisbane music writer, dies at 73\\", The Courier Mail, 7 February 2017  Journalism career: overview  Amongst the many publications he contributed to, Yorke was the Canadian Editor of Rolling Stone (1969‚Äì70), Canadian Editor of Billboard (1970‚Äì80), and was the Senior Music Writer for the Brisbane Sunday Mail for 20 years (1987‚Äì2007).

Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. The reported diameter of exosomes is between 30 and 100 nm, which is larger than LDL, but much smaller than for example, red blood cells. Exosomes are either released from the cell when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane or they are released directly from the plasma membrane. It is becoming increasingly clear that exosomes have specialized functions and play a key role in, for example, coagulation, intercellular signaling, and waste management. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the clinical applications of exosomes. Exosomes can potentially be used for prognosis, therapy, and biomarkers for health and disease. Bioinformatics analysis of exosomes Exosomes contain RNA, proteins, lipids and metabolites that is reflective of the cell type of origin. As exosomes contain numerous proteins, RNA and lipids, large scale analysis including proteomics and transcriptomics is often performed. Currently, to analyse these data, non-commercial tools such as FunRich can be used to identify over-represented groups of molecules.

History and building In 1993, one year before the withdrawal of American troops from the city, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation's then-director, Thomas Krens, was approached with the idea of a Berlin branch of the museum by Richard C. Holbrooke, then the American ambassador to Germany. The museum opened in November 1997, only one month after the opening of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.Cowell, Alan. \\"New U. S. Sector in Berlin: Little Guggenheim Branch\\", The New York Times, November 7, 1997, accessed February 2, 2011 The modest Berlin gallery occupied a corner of the ground floor of the Deutsche Bank building, a sandstone building constructed in 1920. The exhibition space consisted of a single gallery that was 50 meters long, 8 meters wide, and 6 meters high. Gluckman designed the gallery in a minimalist style. After 15 years of operation, Deutsche Guggenheim closed in February 2013. Two months later, Deutsche Bank re-opened the site as the Deutsche Bank KunstHalle, to show collaborative contemporary art projects with independent curators, international partner museums and cultural institutions, as well as exhibitions of works from the Deutsche Bank's art collection.\\"Deutsche Bank KunstHalle opens in Berlin\\", ArtMag, March, 2013, accessed January 21, 2016 Under the patronage of the Italian Ministry of Culture, in 2016 Deutsche Bank received from pptArt the Corporate Art Award for the best \\"Corporate Collection\\". Exhibitions Funded entirely by the Deutsche Bank, the gallery had four exhibitions each year, complemented by educational programming.\\"Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin\\" , Berlin.de, accessed March 13, 2012 Its first exhibition, in 1997, was titled Robert Delaunay: Visions of Paris. Its primary purpose, however, was to commission important new works by contemporary artists that would then enter the Guggenheim collection. At least once a year, one artist was commissioned to create a new work specifically for the exhibition space. The commissions included paintings by James Rosenquist and Jeff Koons, photos by Hiroshi Sugimoto, John Baldessari and Jeff Wall, sculptures by Rachel Whiteread and large-scale installations by Gerhard Richter, Hanne Darboven, Lawrence Weiner, Phoebe Washburn, Gabriel Orozco and Anish Kapoor. Based on a recommendation by Deutsche Bank‚Äôs Global Art Advisory Council, from 2010 to 2012, the bank each year honored a young artist who was featured in a large solo exhibition at the Deutsche Guggenheim. The museum's last exhibition, from November 2012 to February 2013 included still lives by Pablo Picasso and Paul C√©zanne, landscapes by Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet, abstract paintings by Franz Marc and Wassily Kandinsky and sculptures by Edgar Degas, Alexander Calder and Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. Titled \\"Visions of Modernity\\" and also featuring the work of Delaunay, the exhibition was intended to provide a \\"bookend to the Deutsche Guggenheim's very first exhibition\\".

Despite several puddles, a dark look and a generally unpleasant looking location, the band plays, and is obviously enjoying themselves. During the second verse, a man can be seen taking pills. As the band performs, a crowd begins to formulate. But each of them is distracted by something. Some are distracted by mobile phones, some are eating, and some are using portable games consoles.

Background Following a successful European tour, A Sunny Day in Glasgow's Ben Daniels began plans for work on a new album. He rented a large dance studio in New Jersey for recording, where he and bandmate Josh Meakim began experimenting with sounds and setting up microphones. Prior to the start of formal work on the album, however, several members exited the band under varying circumstances, including Brice Hickey, who had \\"very seriously\\" broken his legs in an accident while loading equipment into his car on the day that recording was set to begin; Lauren Daniels, who left in order to care for Hickey, her then-boyfriend; and Robin Daniels, who wished to pursue her studies. The band was subsequently reduced to Ben Daniels and Josh Meakim. Annie Fredrickson later joined the band, and the trio of Daniels, Meakim, and Fredrickson helmed the album's recording. Ashes Grammar was recorded from September to December 2008. The expansive recording environment of the dance studio allowed Ben Daniels the freedom to experiment with different acoustics. He has cited Alvin Lucier's I Am Sitting in a Room as an influence on the recording process. Following the departures of Lauren and Robin Daniels, vocal duties on Ashes Grammar were shared by Meakim and Fredrickson. Fredrickson's friend Beverly Science also performed additional vocals on the album.

Historically the post was in the Diocese of Lincoln, then from 1837 in the Diocese of Ely, England. On 13 April 1914, the archdeaconry became a part of the diocese of St Albans. The present holder of the office is Dave Middlebrook, collated Archdeacon on 30 March 2019. Seal The 12/13th c. brass seal-matrix of the Archdeacon of Bedford was found in South Lincolnshire in 2003 by a metal detectorist, in almost perfect condition. It displays a legend in Latin: SIGILLUM ARCHIDIACONI BEDEFORDI(A)E (\\"Seal of the Archdeacon of Bedford\\"). Of two heraldic shields, that shown at dexter displays the arms of Cantilupe (modern): Gules, three leopard's faces jessant-de-lys or, as used by Saint Thomas de Cantilupe (d.1282), Bishop of Hereford, and later adopted as the arms of the See of Hereford. The reason for the use of the Cantilupe arms on the seal is unclear, the surviving (but incomplete) list of Archdeacons of Bedford does not include a member of the Cantilupe family.https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/106913 The office of Archdeacon of Bedford had no connection with the See of Hereford and is known to have been under the control of the See of Lincoln, hence a possible reason for the location the object was found in. The Cantilupe family were feudal barons of Eaton (Bray) in Bedfordshire and were seated (amongst many other places) at Eaton Castle, near Dunstable, not too far from the town of Bedford. A junior branch (see Baron Cantilupe) was seated at Greasley Castle in Nottingham and at Withcall in Lincolnshire, in which county they were prominent. Nicholas de Cantilupe, 3rd Baron Cantilupe (c.1301‚Äì1355) of Greasley founded the Cantilupe Chantry in Lincoln Cathedral and was buried in the Cathedral where survives his mutilated recumbent effigy. However the armorials of the Greasley branch include a fess vair, not shown on the seal.For a discussion on the seal of the Archdeacon of Bedford and its possible relation to the Cantilupe family see: M Julian-Jones, Thesis on de Cantilupe and Corbet families, 2015, Online Research @Cardiff (ORCA), Cardiff University The style of the seal with the gothic architectural elements date it to the 13/14th. centuries.

The Baloch are predominantly Muslim, with the vast majority belonging to the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, but there is also tiny proportion of Shia in Balochistan. Approximately 20-25% of the Baloch population live in Iran. Estimates of the Iranian Baloch population range from 1.5-2 million to as many as 4 million.

They are also spread in other countries of the world, such as the Persian Gulf states and Europe. In Iran, the Baloch are divided into two groups: the Makrani and the Sarhadi. The cities such as Iranshahr, Chabahar, Nikshahr, Sarbaz, and Saravan are known as the Makran region, while Zahedan and Khash are known as the Sarhad region.

As in all Plasmodium species, P. vaughani has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are birds.  Taxonomy  The parasite was first described by Novy & MacNeal in 1904.  Subspecies  *Plasmodium vaughani merulae Corradetti and Scanga 1972 *Plasmodium vaughani tenue Laveran and Marullaz 1914 *Plasmodium vaughani vaughani Novy and MacNeal 1904  Description  The length of the asexual cycle is 24 hours. Trophozoites: Ring forms are unusual. The trophozoite is usually irregular in outline. The nucleus is small and there may be a single clear outgrowth of the cytoplasm. One or two small pigment granules may be seen. These forms are found in mature and polychromatic erythrocytes. Schizonts: These are usually found in a polar or sub polar position within the host cell but may be found anywhere within the cell. They are found in mature or polychromatic erthrocytes. Mature forms measure 2.3 to 5.4 micrometres in width and 1.5 to 4.4 micrometres in length. They are irregular in shape but tend to be round or ovoid. Within each schizont are 4-8 merozoites. These are usually arranged in a fan like fashion but may occur at random. A transparent globule may be present along with one to three pigment granules. The host nucleus is not normally displaced. Gametocytes: The macro- and microgametocytes are very similar except for size in this species. They are elongated, possess 2-24 (usually 10) pigment granules which may be found in clumps and are usually found in mature erythrocytes. The nucleus is pale, compact and central in position. The gametocyte usually lies along the host cell nucleus but young gametoctyes may adhere to the host cell membrane. The host nucleus is not normally displaced. They are 8.0 to 13.7 micrometres in length and 1.2 to 2.8 micrometres in width. Asexual replication appears to occur in three ways: (1) by repeated binary fission of the chromatin with eventual splitting of the cytoplasm (2) by the splitting of an elongate parasite into merozoites having a bead-like arrangement (3) by the similar breaking-up of a ring-shaped form with a resulting ring of merozoites  Distribution  P. vaughani has been reported from regions across the globe, with the exception of Australia. Hosts The type host of P. vaughani is Turdus migratorius. However, various other birds can be infected by P. vaughani, including the canary which has been used as an experimental host in studies. Different strains of P. vaughani develop in different mosquitoes. Most P. vaughani do not develop in most Aedes, Anopheles, or Culex mosquitoes; however, specific strains of P. vaughani have been described that replicate in Culiseta morsitans and Culex pipiens. Additional known hosts for this species include the warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), the blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), the goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis), the blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), the yellow warbler (Setophaga petechia), the robin (Erithacus rubecula), junco (Junco hyemalis hyemalis), the red-billed leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea), the bullfinch (Loxigilla violacea), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), the weaver (Ploceus cucullatus), the grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), the canary (Serinus canaria), the blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), the pigeon (Spilopelia senegalensis), eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), starling (Sturnus vulgaris) black-faced grassquit (Tiaris bicolor), white-eyed thrush (Turdus jamaicensis), the blackbird (Turdus merula) and American sparrows (Zonotrichia species).  Role in disease  Naturally and experimentally infected birds do not appear to show signs of illness from infection with P. vaughani.

It chronicles the events of an average family and has been running since 1970. Since 1999, the gags are made by Studio Kruis. Origins The original line- up of the family consisted of Jack, Jacky and their daughters Karlijn and Catootje. A baby-son, Gertje, was introduced in 1993. They also have pets; Lotje, a male dog with a feminine name and a red cat called Edgar. They were later joined by Loedertje, a Siamese cat whose name closely translates as bitch and a white pony named Fury. Other recurring characters are Catootje's best friend Joe, Jacky's cousin Hanna (a single mother by choice), grandad Gerrit and Moeps Pepernoot. The main characters are modelled after Kruis' own family and pets, except for Jack who in turn inspired his creator. The early gags were originally written for its precursor Gregor and published from December 12, 1970 onwards. Over 60 volumes have been released since 1971. The comic moved with the times, proving that no subject was too weird to be discussed by the family, particularly emancipation. The characters never grew older; actually, some of them dropped a few years in age since the comic was taken over by Studio Kruis. Characters=The family *Jack: began as a traditional-conservative father working nine to five at an oil company. He could've been a successful businessman like his unseen brother Gijs but ultimately chose not to. Jack became a part-time househusband pursuing other interests like writing a book. *Jacky: began as a traditional housewife, but soon discovered feminism, yoga and - unsuccessfully - vegan food. She formed a political party for women and won a seat at the local elections. It was during this period that Jacky altered her trademark bowler-shaped haircut till the comic's 40th anniversary. After the birth of Gertje she stepped down from politics to become a part-time journalist. *Karlijn: eldest daughter, is in her graduation-year. She used to be an avid vegetarian with matching soapbox politics, now she's a modern teenager concerned about her reputation at school. Karlijn was involved in short-lived and somewhat controversial relationships, Thomas being the last. *Catootje: youngest daughter and the main protagonist. She has a close relationship with Joe whom she refers to as her fiance. At dinner she tends to turn down any food that isn't meat and potatoes. Friends, relatives and others *Grandad (Gerrit): Jack's father, a conservative man who never understood why his son gave up on business; he used to dismiss him as an inferior version of Gijs. All seemed to be forgiven with the birth of Gertje, the third male in line at last. Though stuck in his old ways (smoking cigars for instance) he loves his grandchildren, particularly Catootje whom he entertains and educates with reworked fairytales and wartime-stories. Gerrit is close friends with the widowed Moeps Pepernoot, namesake of a distinct character by Kruis. *Grandma Stien: Jacky's mother, moved to the US after a failed marriage. During visits - including the birth of her grandson - she befriended Grandad. Her adopted American accent didn't go on unnoticed on Catootje. *Hanna: Jacky's feminist cousin, first appeared in the final stage of her pregnancy. She gave birth to a daughter who was to be named Emmeline Germaine Hedy after forefighters of women's emancipation. Instead Jack had the baby registered as Sientje in tribute of his grand-aunt, an unsung heroine in feminism. Hanna returned for annual sleepovers and assisted Jacky - back in touch with her own feminist beliefs - in founding the women's party. Upon her return from an extended break (apparently caused by the birth of Gertje), Hanna signed in at an online gay-dating agency. *Harold: rich boy living with his divorced father. Initially showing off his muscles and expensive presents he was fierce competition for Joe. They soon became friends to the extent that they're excluding Catootje from boys-only events. Pets *Edgar: red cat, apparently named after Edgar Allan Poe. As a comic relief he sits on the sofa giving the right look at the right time. During his solo-performances he appears to be a great philosopher. *Lotje: male dog with a feminine name. He used to relate to the wolf and the fox, but after reading Karlijn's French dictionary he started to believe that he was Napoleon, Diego Maradona, Saint Nicholas or King Willem IV. Meanwhile, Lotje took a keen but unrequited interest in Josephine, Stien's dog. *Loedertje: Siamese stray-cat who debuted by entering through the sewerage. It took time for the other pets to grow accustomed to her as they once were framed for plundering the fridge. Not having any maternal instincts she had no problem seeing her six kittens (fathered by different cats) sold. *Fury: white pony, given to Catootje by a befriended farmer after the family traded the big city for the countryside. His dislike of getting washed or being subjected to the art of horseback riding causes Catootje and Jack's no end of grief. Consequently, his role diminished and unlike the other characters he did grow older. *Anne-Marie: transgender bulldog given to Joe by the family. *Mops: Moeps' dog, hesitant to admit that she's a bulldog in case it puts people off.

The song reflects the disillusion, anxiety and homesickness of these emigrants. During the Second World War, this song became an anthem for those civilians who were evacuated from The Rock. The song's popularity was maintained thereafter as Spanish sovereignty claims over Gibraltar during the 1960s leading to the eventual closure of the land frontier, resulting in complete isolation from the hinterland, gave rise to an increase in patriotic fervour. Current use Ll√©vame Donde Nac√≠ is now one of many patriotic songs sung by crowds at big public events such as political demonstrations and cultural events. The most notable being the Gibraltar National Day when it is sung by a school choir outside the City Hall every 10 September before the Mayor reads the National Day Declaration.National Day Events - Wednesday 10 September 2008 It is also the tune played by the chimes of the clock situated atop Watergate House at Grand Casemates Square on the hour. Lyrics=Spanish (original) Ll√©vame donde nac√≠, Que a tu lado quiero estar. No hay un sitio para m√≠, Como mi buen Gibraltar. S√≥lo donde vi la luz, Tengo puesta mi ilusi√≥n. Ll√©vame, quiero morir, Junto a aqu√©l, para mi gran Pe√±√≥n. La L√≠nea y el Campamento, Algeciras y mucho m√°s, Los domina por su altura, El Pe√±√≥n de Gibraltar. Aunque Am√©rica es muy grande, Y tiene mucho que ver, Yo quiero a mi Pe√±oncito, Aqu√©l que me dio a m√≠ el ser. English (translation) Take me back to my birthplace For I want by your side to be. There's nowhere I'd rather be Than by my dear Gibraltar. Nowhere but where I was born Have I set all my hopes. Take me there - I want to die By the side of my great Rock. La L√≠nea and Campamento, Algeciras and further beyond Are o'er- towered by the height Of the Rock of Gibraltar.

Tasks are prepared by its community of problem setters or are taken from previous programming contests. SPOJ allows advanced users to organize contests under their own rules and also includes a forum where programmers can discuss how to solve a particular problem. Apart from the English language, SPOJ also offers its content in Polish, Portuguese and Vietnamese languages. The solution to problems can be submitted in over 40 programming languages, including esoteric ones, via the Sphere Engine. It is run by the Polish company Sphere Research Labs. The website is considered both an automated evaluator of user-submitted programs as well as an online learning platform to help people understand and solve computational tasks. It also allows students to compare paradigms and approaches with a wide variety of languages.  History  This system was originally created to apply an online judge in the teaching of students. It basically focused on the students and lecturers of universities and members of a wider programming community, interested in algorithms and programming contests. Aims It aimed at different users for different purposes such as: * For young people and beginner programmers to develop understanding of algorithms. * The students of universities are given a chance to do their homework, honestly, thoroughly and without cheating. * ACM contest pros can solve tasks without being cramped by the restraints of too few programming languages or an inconvenient user interface. * Enthusiasts of functional or object oriented programming can solve contest problems in their favorite language. * Any persons willing to share an interesting task with the rest of the SPOJ community can do so nearly automatically (one mail to the admins requesting problem-setter's privileges is enough), * Any person, wishing to organize a programming contest, with nearly any rules they may decide upon, may do so at any time they choose, without the help of system administrators.  Problem categories  The archived problems in SPOJ are divided in 5 categories: * Classical: These are binary scored problems. Either Accepted or Wrong answer * Challenge: These allow users to submit worse or better solutions. There are no definite answers to a particular problem * Partial: These are similar to challenge problems but with an educational purpose * Tutorial: Like classical problems but easier, these are for educational purposes - for example involving a widely known algorithm * Riddle: Problems which contains puzzles There may be limitations on submissions to make a problem more challenging. This includes the availability of languages (e.g. only esoteric languages) and computation time.  Judging = Clusters  Submissions are judged on one cluster: *Cube (Intel Xeon E3-1200 v5): The site states that \\"this new cluster consists of modern and fast Intel Xeon E3-1220 v5 CPUs. On Cube your submissions will run from 30 to 50 times faster than on Pyramid so you can expect that if you test your solution at home then it will have similar execution time on SPOJ. On this cluster memory limit for submissions is 1536 MB.\\" The Pyramid cluster has been deactivated. Programs are checked either by comparison to a known correct answer or by running a dedicated judging code, unique to each problem. This is increasingly necessary when there may be multiple answers in more complex problems. By using a computer, the marking is consistent, fair and can measure efficiency in real time, in comparison to human judging. To ensure that the system runs effectively, the Linux commands RLIMIT_CPU stops poorly designed tests from affecting others. The chroot() system call applies restrictions to the running of programs by using file system sandboxes: the sleep() command, for example, is not permitted, as it would reduce the available memory. The accessible, free and objective nature of the website allow students to gain logical and design experience based on previous successes. However, the system doesn't evaluate code quality, documentation or other more subjective characteristics which may be more important for real world applications. After being submitted, a user is told whether the code produced an error while running or compiling; the time limit was exceeded; the wrong answer was output or was correct. Challenge problems' answers are accompanied by a score (see below).  Scoring  The scores are given based on the category in which problems are divided. *Classical: The score for one problem is \\\\tfrac{80}{40+\\\\mathrm{number_of_people_who_have_solved_it}} points. *Challenge: The score has two criteria as follows: **for a top score in any challenge: 3 points, **for any lower score in a challenge: (user's score relative to the top score) points. *Partial: 0 points *Tutorial: 0 points *Riddle: 0 points Scores for the 'challenge' category are typically the size of the submission in bytes, though may different. For example, it may be the number of correct decimal places of the constant œÄ. Note: SPOJ frequently change the formulae used for calculating the scores  Programming contests  SPOJ is used as a platform for a wide array of competitions, from local to international level and from short 1 hour problems to year-long leagues. Participants typically speak different languages so site ensures a more level playing field, as well as reducing the work load of the organisers.  Criticism  Users of online judge systems have little incentive for documentation and creating well-structured code, possibly making them less prepared for more typical applications of computing outside of competitions. Results of a study conducted at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology suggest that deadlines given in university situations, including bonus and penalty points depending on when an assignment is handed in, tend to be harsh on students who are not well organised, even if the same code is submitted. This has mixed motivational effects on students, encouraging some to keep up with deadlines, while demotivating others. The same study indicates that use of online judge systems lead to a reduction in communication between students and staff. However, in the case of staff with high teaching load, this reduction may allow staff to devote more of their time to students with difficulties, eliminating administrative overheads related to grading and time spent on discussions with students who do not need assistance. Languages SPOJ supports about 60 languages in which the users can submit their solutions. They are: Ada, Assembler, AWK, Bash, Brainfuck, C, C++ and C99 strict, C#, Clojure, Common Lisp, D, Doc(no testing), Erlang, Fortran, F#, Go, Haskell, Icon, Intercal, Jar, Java, JavaScript, Lisp, Lua, Nemerle, Nice, Node.js, OCaml, Pascal, Pdf, Perl, PHP, Pike, PostScript, Prolog, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Scheme, sed, Smalltalk, Tcl, Tecs, Text, and Whitespace.

The concept can be considered an ecological application of economic conversion, which was developed in the 1980s when anti-war activists sought to build a coalition with military workers and give them a stake in the peace economy. Climate goals and global climate change agreements set standards for a clean economy. In the process, sectors such as energy, manufacturing, agriculture, and forestry, which employ millions of workers, must restructure. There is a concern that periods of economic structural change in the past have left ordinary workers, their families, and communities to bear the costs of the transition to new ways of producing wealth, leading to unemployment, poverty, and exclusion for the working class, in contrast to business owners who are able to afford the transition. Just Transition addresses this concern by promoting sustainable actions that help workers. Uniting social and climate justice by means of a Just Transition means to comply with demands for fairness for coal workers in coal-dependent developing regions who lack employment opportunities beyond coal; fairness for workers in emerging economies that demand their share of the ‚Äúindustrialisation dividend‚Äù; fairness for those having to leave their homes as sea levels rise and engulf coastal regions and islands as a consequence of climate change; fairness for populations affected by the air pollution and broader environmental impacts of coal use etc. For example, the Green New Deal outlines goals to protect the climate, and a Just Transition framework outlines strategies to accomplish these goals while protecting workers. It has been endorsed internationally by governments in different arenas, including the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s 2015 \\"Guidelines on a Just Transition towards environmentally-sustainable economies and societies for all,\\" the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)'s Paris Agreement, and the Katowice Climate Conference (COP24)'s 2018 Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration. Policies For trade unions, the term Just Transition describes the transition towards a climate‚Äêresilient and low‚Äêcarbon economy that maximizes the benefits of climate action while minimizing hardships for workers and their communities. According to the International Trade Union Confederation, needs relevant to a Just Transition will vary in different countries, though overarching policies that are countries need to enact exist, including: * Sound investments in low‚Äêemission and job-rich sectors and technologies. These investments must be undertaken through due consultation with all those affected, respecting human and labour rights, and Decent Work principles. * Social dialogue and democratic consultation of social partners (trade unions and employers) and other stakeholders (i.e. communities). * Research and early assessment of the social and employment impacts of climate policies. Training and skills development, which are key to support the deployment of new technologies and foster industrial change. *Social protection, along with active labour market policies. * Local economic diversification plans that support decent work and provide community stability during the transition. Communities should not be left on their own to manage the impacts of the transition as this will not lead to a fair distribution of costs and benefits. Definition and evolution The term 'just transition' was first coined by North American unions in the 1990s to describe a support system for workers unemployed due to environmental protection policies. One early proponent was Tony Mazzocchi: The term's further evolution is described in an article published by the International Journal on Labour Research: Broadening use In the past years, a number of organizations have deployed the concept of a Just Transition with respect to environmental and/or climate justice. As unions began to insert the concept of just transition into UNFCCC negotiations and the climate change movement, just transition has evolved into a deliberate push for a transition to both environmentally and socially sustainable employment opportunities and economies. Sometimes refer quite closely to the labor component of a Just Transition, while others ignore it. In the latter case, \\"just\\" simply refers to the necessity of protecting the environment as a public good from private industries that degrade its long term health. The term \\"just\\" has also been applied to concerns about ending war and building a peacetime economy. The concept of Just Transition in moving towards a low‚Äêcarbon and climate‚Äêresilient economy has later, in particular by trade unions, been used also in relation to digitalization. A just transition from coal is supported by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  Examples by sectors = Coal industry  As part of a just transition areas where coal mines and other carbon intensive production have historically been a major or even the sole source of employment and economic activity, opportunities for retraining and the attraction of new jobs to these areas is needed.  Accomplishments  Just transition being discussed at COP22 In 2015, the ILO published its ‚ÄúGuidelines for a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies for all,‚Äù including guiding principles for a just transition such as the need for strong social consensus and social dialogue, and the importances of fostering international cooperation. The guidelines build upon the ILO‚Äôs Decent Work Agenda‚Äôs four pillars of social dialogue, social protection, workers‚Äô rights, and employment, highlighting the role of workers, employers, and the government as the main active partners in ensuring just transition. This document calls on international governments to integrate just transition principles into methods for reaching the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, increase access to labor market data, encourage collaboration between relevant national ministries, etcetera. In April 2015, the Rockefeller Family Fund and the Appalachian Funders Network formed the Just Transition Fund to help communities impacted by the changing coal sector take advantage of President Obama‚Äôs POWER Initiative. Through direct investments and direct technical assistance, the Fund‚Äôs grants have helped direct almost $24 million of federal funds toward just transition projects. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France, or COP 21, unions and just transition advocates convinced the Parties to include language regarding just transition and the creation of decent work in the Paris Agreement‚Äôs preamble. At the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, or COP 24, the Heads of State and Government adopted the Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration, highlighting the importance of just transition as mentioned in the Paris Agreement, the ILO's Guidelines, and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Declaration encourages all relevant United Nations agencies to implement proceed with its implementation and consider the issue of just transition when drafting and implementing parties' Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs.

A variety of comparative genome analysis published since 2008, however, found that falcons are part of a clade of birds called Australaves, which also includes seriemas, parrots and passerines. Within Australaves falcons are more closely to the parrot-passerine clade (Psittacopasserae), which together they form the clade Eufalconimorphae. The hawks and vultures occupy a basal branch in the clade Afroaves in their own clade Accipitrimorphae, closer to owls and woodpeckers. The fossil record of Falconiformes sensu stricto is poorly documented. The only stem-falcon that has mostly complete remains is Masillaraptor parvunguis, while the other taxa Stintonornis mitchelli and Parvulivenator watteli are known from fragmentary remains.

He was assassinated in New York City by his political opponents.  Preceding events  Ghevont Tourian was born 1 January 1879 in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire. Before his appointment to New York in 1931, Tourian was archbishop of Smyrna, Vicar Patriarch of Constantinople, and later a prelate in Greece, Bulgaria, and in Manchester, United Kingdom. The incident that resulted in a plot to assassinate the archbishop took place on 1 July 1933, in a pavilion for the celebration of Armenian Day at the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. Archbishop Tourian, upon his arrival to deliver an invocation, ordered the removal of the red, blue, and orange Tricolor of the First Republic of Armenia (1918‚Äì20) from the stage before he would step out on it.Alexander, Ben. \\"Contested Memories, Divided Diaspora: Armenian Americans, the Thousand-day Republic, and the Polarized Response to an Archbishop‚Äôs Murder\\" Journal of American Ethnic History 27.1 From the archbishop's point of view, appearing beside this flag would provoke the wrath of Armenia's Soviet government, which was a serious concern, since the church's ultimate seat of spiritual authority lay in the Holy See at Etchmiadzin, within the borders of Soviet Armenia, and the Catholicos of All Armenians felt bound to keep peace with Soviet authorities. However the members of the nationalist Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF), known as Dashnaks, for whom the flag was a sacred symbol of the Armenian nation, took this as an act of treason. Tourian was soon attacked by five ARF members in Worcester, Massachusetts. Two of the attackers were convicted.\\"Beaten at church picnic; Archbishop Was Attacked by Gang in Westboro, Mass\\" New York Times (December 25, 1933) After this incident Tourian hired a bodyguard.  Murder  Holy Cross Church at 580 West 187th Street in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City was the scene of Tourian's assassination The conflict climaxed on December 24, 1933, when several men attacked Tourian in the Church of the Holy Cross, in Washington Heights, Manhattan, at the start of the Christmas Eve service. Tourian‚Äôs constant bodyguard, Kossof Gargodian, was sitting in the back of the church certain that there would be no assault upon Tourian in a holy place, on the day before Christmas. However, when the archbishop passed at the end of the procession the fifth row of pews from the rear, he was suddenly surrounded by a group of men in such a fashion as to hide the actions of their companions. Two of the assailants stabbed Tourian with large butcher knives, and once the archbishop fell, the attackers scattered and mixed with the crowd. Two of the assailants were seized by the parishioners, beaten, and subsequently handed over to the police.\\"Slain in 187th st. church; Assassins Swarm About Armenian Prelate and Stab Him\\" New York Times (December 25, 1933) The police soon apprehended the other seven assailants, who were all ARF members.

Leylegian and Sarkisian were sentenced to death, but Governor of New York Herbert Lehman commuted the death sentences to life imprisonment \\"on account of most unusual circumstances in this case\\".\\"Lehman spares lives of Tourian's slayers; gives life imprisonment to pair convicted of killing Armenian primate\\" New York Times (April 10, 1935) The other seven were given prison terms of varying lengths, from 10 to 20 years.\\"Nine found guilty in church murder; Two Convicted of Murder and Seven of Manslaughter in Armenian Prelate's Death\\" New York Times (July 14, 1934)\\"Tourian slayers condemned to die; Seven Others, Convicted in the Killing of Archbishop, Get Long Prison Terms\\" New York Times (July 25, 1934)  Aftermath  After the killing, American Armenian followers of the Armenian Apostolic Church became split between local churches affiliated with the Catholicosate of All Armenians (Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin), located at the time in Soviet Armenia, and those affiliated with the Catholicosate of Cilicia, in Antelias, near Beirut, Lebanon, though the liturgy has stayed the same. Individual congregations became either entirely Dashnak or anti-Dashnak in their membership, with forcible expulsions and violent fights in some instances. For decades to come, Armenians of the Dashnak persuasion would hold the nine Dashnak defendants to be innocent scapegoats and Archbishop Tourian to be a traitor to his nation, while non-Dashnak Armenians would consider the nine suspects and the entire Dashnak party responsible for the crime. At present there are two Armenian church structures in the United States: the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, which is divided into the Eastern and Western Dioceses of the Armenian Church of America; and the Holy See of Cilicia, which is divided into the Eastern and Western Prelacies of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America.

When the boat capsized, 45 tourists died, most of them from Delhi and Kolkata. A total of 82 people were on the boat. The boat's helmsman, Victor Samuel, and another crew member were arrested on 5 October.  Details  The fibreglass double-decker sight-seeing boat Jala Kanyaka, operated by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC), made daily sight-seeing trips in the Mullaperiyar reservoir in Idukki. The boat was first commissioned on 17 August 2009. The boat set off from a landing at 4:30 p.m. and capsized away, at approximately 5 p.m. on 30 September 2009. It capsized in one of the deepest parts of the reservoir, in an area around deep. Several survivors swam to safety.  Rescue  thumb The surrounding area has wild animals, including elephants, and is within the Periyar Tiger Reserve. By 8 p.m, a rescue team recovered 26 bodies, and two survivors. Initial rescue operations were completed by local government officials and the public before the state and federal government crews arrived. None of the initial rescue boats had divers, however a team of divers from the Indian Navy was assigned to help the rescue operation 5‚Äì6 hours later. A team of 40-50 navy divers were rushed to the spot from the Southern Naval Command at Kochi. On 3 October, the search for bodies was still ongoing. Four bodies were noted as missing until 3 October, when three were recovered by Navy divers: four-and-a-half-year-old Aishwarya and her mother Senthilkumari, from Bangalore, and Apoorva, 16, from Hyderabad. A Navy helicopter spotted the body of Aishwarya first, and her mother was found nearby. The final missing passenger, Apoorva's 19-year-old brother Abhilash, was discovered on the evening of 3 October by an underwater camera, but bad weather delayed its retrieval until the following day. This bought the final death-toll to 45. Their parents, scientists at the Defence Research Organisation, survived the accident. Twenty people, mostly on the upper deck, were rescued by boats sent by KTDC, the Forest Department, and Tamil Nadu Public Works Department. Both State and National government acted, asking defence establishments in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram to launch rescue attempts. Navy divers from Kochi were forced to travel overland after their helicopter, sent to locate the victims, was turned back by bad weather. Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, the Home and Tourism Minister of Kerala, and N. K. Premachandran, the minister for Water Resources, arrived in Thekkady late at night, and they coordinated rescue operations according to press reports.  Investigations  Boat passengers Originally, KTDC claimed that there were 74 passengers, but police findings showed 87 passengers; some confusion in the numbers was caused by some survivors leaving the scene without reporting to the police. The fatalities consist mostly of women, mainly from outside Kerala. The dead included people from Tamil Nadu, Delhi and West Bengal; more than 50 belonged to a group from Karnataka, who had come in a tourist bus to Thekkady as part of a tour to Kerala. Preliminary reports stated that the accident occurred when a large number of passengers rushed to one side of the boat to see a herd of bison which emerged from the forest. The sudden movement caused the boat to capsize, and all of the passengers were thrown into the water. Later, this initial report was challenged when some of the rescued tourists reported structural problems with the boat, saying that it was tilted throughout the trip, for about 30 minutes. Then at one point the boat took a sharp turn, overturned and capsized. The boat was owned and operated by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation. The government has been blamed for not privatizing these boats, for not enforcing safety precautions and for not having efficient disaster recovery plans. The crew of the boat, driver and helper escaped the incident. The passengers were not provided a life jacket before the trip, and there were no lifeguards. The Pioneer newspaper of Delhi reported \\"widespread complaints\\" against both Kerala Government and KTDC \\"trying to absolve themselves of the guilt by putting the entire blame on the boat employees.\\" The Crime Branch‚Äôs probe report blamed the incident on a combination of driver negligence and overloading.  Aftermath  Jalakanyaka kept on shore (as of 2013 June 2) On 2 October, it was announced that the government would pay the expenses for sending the bodies of the deceased to their home states and that 5 lakhs Rs. would be provided to the next kin of each of the dead in the accident. The Government of Kerala ordered a judicial inquiry into the boat tragedy. Questioned at the scene on Monday, 5 October, helmsman Victor Samuel (alias Betty) attributed the incident to the sudden movement of tourists, but fellow crew member Aneesh (also written Anish) pointed out the overloading of the upper deck. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the boat was overloaded, with 12 more than its capacity of 75. The Crime Branch determined that when Samuel \\"suddenly turned the boat to the right, after the tourists sighted the wild animals\\", it had contributed to the incident. Superintendent of Police (Crime Branch) PA Wilson said that \\"the unwarranted act of driver Victor Samuel [...] swerving the boat while at high speed caused the tragedy\\". The Crime Branch did not make a final report, pending further questioning of survivors, but Samuel and Aneesh were arrested, to be taken before the Magistrate Court at Peerumade. Sameul has been charged with \\"causing death unintentionally.\\" Also under consideration was the possibility raised by reports that the boat listed to one side due to a structural imbalance. The police stated that the Jalakanyaka, which was recovered and brought to the dock in Thekkady, \\"had inherent problems\\". A careful forensic examination was scheduled to begin.  Criticism  Oommen Chandy, Leader of Opposition in the Kerala Assembly, criticized the ongoing Crime Branch probe, alleging an attempt to make the steersman a scapegoat. \\"an attempt is on to put the blame and responsibility of the accident on the steersman,\\" Chandy said. Chandy told reporters that, instead of a judicial probe, the government should appoint an expert committee headed by a judicial officer. He urged Chairman Cherian Philip to consider quitting his post. \\"Instead of supervising the rescue operations at Thekkady, Philip chose to be part of' Human Chain', a political function of CPI-M,\\" he said. The Decclan Herald said that the accident was \\"a result of sheer negligence\\", and the Express Buzz said it was \\"faulty from the start\\", with excess passengers on unsecured plastic chairs. Other criticisms include (1) lack of disaster recovery planning and procedures for all departments; and (2) refusal to privatize and insure tourist boats with proper government oversight.  Subsequent safety concerns At a meeting on 5 October, state Tourism Minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan announced several new safety measures: safety checks for tourist boats, mandatory life jackets for those under 15 and for those over 15 who do not supply a valid reason, lifeguards and rescue boats in proportion to the number of passengers.

Classic Period A substantial quantity of Middle Classic and Late Classic ceramics were found in mixed deposits at Bilbao. Postclassic Period Although Postclassic remains are found close to the surface in various parts of the Cotzumalhuapa Nuclear Zone, Bilbao has a residential compound that is the only major structure dating to this period within the Zone. Modern history The land containing the archaeological remains was cleared in 1860 by Pedro de Anda, a local civic official, to establish a coffee plantation by the name of Finca Peor es Nada. In 1890 Finca Bilbao was formed from the merging of Finca Peor es Nada with another plot of land. The plantation was renamed to Finca Las Ilusiones in 1957.Kelly 1996, pp. 220-221.

Adolph Bastian of the Royal Museum in Berlin visited the site in 1876 and entered into a contract with Pedro de Anda to explore the remains. At this time Carl H. Berendt was hired to move the finest monuments to the Royal Museum in 1877. The monuments were shipped from Puerto San Jos√© on the Pacific coast, where one of the monuments was lost overboard. The rest arrived in Berlin in 1883 and totalled 31 in all, including some well-preserved stelae depicting ballplayers.Kelly 1996, p. 221. In 1884 engineer Albert Napp mapped the site, his original map being lost for more than a century before being found in 1994 in Berlin.Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, p. 216. The site The architectural remains consist of earth mounds covered by sugarcane plantations. The sculptural style of the site differs from that of the Classic Maya and may represent the vanguard of the Nahua- speaking Pipil who migrated from central Mexico and settled the Pacific coastal plain of Guatemala and El Salvador in the Postclassic Period.Sharer 2000, pp. 483-484. The Mexican influence evident at Bilbao may not have arrived directly but could instead have been transmitted via a neighbouring polity such as groups from the Tiquisate or La Gomera areas of the Guatemalan Pacific coastal region.Rubio 1994, p. 91. When first discovered the site was covered in forest, this was cleared for coffee plantations that have since been replaced with sugarcane.Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, p. 214. Archaeological investigations were carried out by Lee A. Parsons and S. F. de Borhegyi. Parsons has suggested that Bilbao was a colony founded during the Middle Classic (c. 400-550) by the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico, with El Taj√≠n as an intermediary, and that it became independent between AD 550 and 700.Adams 1996, p. 227. However, archaeologist Marion Popenoe de Hatch has since redated the site to the Late Classic period.Adams 1996, p. 228. Bilbao's architecture is buried under a thick layer of volcanic soil to an extent that only the largest structures can be distinguished as mounds.Chinchilla 2002, p. 430. The core of Bilbao is formed by a series of platforms that descend gradually to the south. These platforms do not have any surviving evidence of boundary walls and appear to have been open and accessible. The monumental architecture of Bilbao may have served as an elite residential compound and a place of worship.Chinchilla Mazariegos 1998, p. 514. Chinchilla Mazariegos 2003. The Monument Plaza contained the majority of the site's sculpture, including Monuments 1 through to 8, a group of stelae now in Berlin.Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, pp. 214-215. The Plaza was externally accessible via ramps and stairways. Group A lies immediately to the west of the Monument Plaza and contains 6 structures.Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, p. 222. Group B is immediately to the north of Group A and contains 4 structures. Group C is immediately north of Group B and possesses 3 structures. Group D is immediately north of Group C and contains 4 structures. Groups A to D are all bordered on the east side by the Canilla River. Causeways Bilbao is connected to other sites in the Cotzumalhuapa Nuclear Zone by a system of stone-paved avenues, reinforcing the interpretation of the Zone as an articulated urban centre. There are three major causeways: The Gavarrete Causeway is long and links Bilbao with El Ba√∫l. It was the main avenue of the city and varied between wide. The causeway is named after Guatemalan historian Juan Gavarrete.Chinchilla 2003. The Berendt Causeway is an extension of the Gavarrete Causeway that links Bilbao with El Castillo, it is long. The Habel Causeway is long and links El Castillo with Gol√≥n, only from Bilbao itself. Sculpture Monument 19 at Bilbao.Rubio 1994, p. 89. 58 monuments were listed by Parsons at Bilbao, but only 3 remain in situ in Bilbao's Monument Plaza. Even before the extraction of the majority of the sculptures in the 19th century, many had already been damaged by locals who quarried them as a source of construction material.Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, p. 215. The remaining boulder sculptures of Bilbao lie among the earth mounds of the site's ceremonial centre; they include two sculptures of the central Mexican deity Tlaloc carved into a boulder by a stream. A significant amount of the architecture and relief sculpture at the site features ballgame imagery.Cohodas 1991, p. 282. Ballgame reliefs at Bilbao feature blossoming and fruiting plants symbolic of agricultural fertility.Gillespie 1991, p. 319. Stelae at Bilbao depict ballplayers with disembodied heads and various sculptures depict dismembered body parts.Gillespie 1991, pp. 322, 334. Sculptures of dismembered limbs are carved in the round and show the bones protruding.Parsons 1991, p. 204. Well-preserved examples of Late Preclassic potbelly sculptures have been found at Bilbao. These are boulders carved to represent obese human figures and are found at many sites along the Pacific coast.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 245. Monument 1 dates to the Classic Period. It depicts a ballplayer wielding a knife in one hand and a severed head in the other. This figure stands on a dismembered human torso lacking limbs and head. Around the main figure are four smaller figures, also carrying severed heads.Gillespie 1991, pp. 334-5. It was originally found in the Monument Plaza but was removed to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin.Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, pp. 214-216. Monument 2 was located in the Monument Plaza and was removed to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Monument 3 in the Ethnological Museum of Berlin Monument 3 depicts a larger ballplayer figure and a smaller death god, both of whom are wearing ballgame yokes, standing in front of a temple. The ballplayer is offering a human heart to the sun.Rubio 1994, p. 93. Miller 2001, p. 101. The monument was found in the Monument Plaza but was removed to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Monument 4 depicts a shaman whose tongue is in the form of a knife.Rubio 1994, p. 95. It was located in the Monument Plaza and was removed to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Monument 5, Monument 6, Monument 7 and Monument 8 were all from the Monument Plaza and were removed to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. Monument 16 is one of the few sculptures to remain at the site, being located in a sugarcane field. Monument 17 was lost overboard when it was being loaded onto a ship for transport to Berlin. The sculpture was one of a pair and depicted a vulture devouring a human torso. Only the tip of one wing survived and is stored in the museum warehouse. Monument 18 is a large sculptured stela that is roughly rectangular in shape and has a raised border. It depicts three standing figures. The left-most figure faces the other two on its right. Between the left figure and the central figure is a rectangular object sprouting crab claws at the bottom. There is a circle containing the head of a monkey at the top of the sculpture. Monument 18 has been dated to the Classic period. Monument 18 was located on the west side of Mound 4 of Group B.Chinchilla Mazariegos 1997, pp. 222, 224. Monument 19 depicts three figures, the principal individual wears an elaborate headdress with a Xiuhcoatl (\\"turquoise/fire serpent\\") plume. He appears to be offering aid to a less fortunate person.Rubio 1994, pp. 88-89. Figure seated on a throne on Monument 21 Monument 21 is a basalt boulder in a sugarcane field. The boulder has an artificially flattened upper surface bearing a bas-relief sculpture. The carved face has a 35¬∞ slope and measures . The sculpture depicts three main figures. The central figure is the largest and faces towards a second figure seated on a throne. The third figure is behind the central figure, it is smaller and holds a hand puppet. The scene is filled out with twisting vines that sprout cocoa pods bearing human faces. Other details of the monument include birds, snakes and a butterfly with a human head. Monument 21 has been dated to the Classic period. Monument 21 is located east of Mound 2, in the centre of Group B.Rubio 1994, p. 88. The decoration on the skirt of one of the figures may be the face of the central Mexican deity Xipe Totec. Monument 24 was moved to the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a y Etnolog√≠a in Guatemala City. Monument 46 is a potbelly sculpture.McInnis Thompson & Valdez 2008, p. 25. Monument 47 is a potbelly sculpture. Monument 58 is a potbelly sculpture. When it was excavated by Parsons it was found lying on its side with its head resting upon the lowest step of a stairway with Monument 59 (a throne or altar) upside down on top of it. The potbelly sculpture may originally have sat upon the throne. Alternatively, it may have been set at the base of the stairway with the throne at the top.McInnis Thompson & Valdez 2008, pp. 13, 24. Monument 59 is a stone altar or throne with four legs. It was found resting inverted on top of Monument 58, a potbelly sculpture, at the bottom of a stairway. It may originally have supported this potbelly monument.p. 24. Gol√≥n Gol√≥n is an important area within the Cotzumalhuapa Nuclear Zone, located from Bilbao and connected to the same system of paved causeways. Gol√≥n is an area that contains further monumental sculpture.

It was first published in 1995 by Piccadilly Press Ltd.  Plot = Plot introduction  Chelsea Gee is the fifteen-year-old daughter of famous reporter and agony aunt Ginny Gee. Her father is unemployed and loves to cook exotic food. Her brother, Warwick, is leaving to Indonesia to help save the trees and her sister, Geneva, studies in Chicago. Chelsea is ashamed of her mother, because she is overweight and lacks fashion sense. Laura Turnbull's parents are divorced. Her dad lives with his girlfriend \\"Bestial\\" Betsy, and her kids Sonia and Daryl. Laura lives with her mum in a little house. Ruth's going out with Melvyn, who Laura hates. She thinks that her parents should live together. Jemma Farrant's mother is very old-fashioned. She thinks her daughter should wear hand-knitted jumpers with little bears on it to school. Jemma is not allowed to have a boyfriend or wear make-up. Jon Joseph has a talent for art, but his father wants him to study law at Cambridge. His mum is not surprised, because she likes painting too, but she cannot understand why her son wants to go to Lee Hill instead of Bellborough Court. Sumitha Barenji's father thinks that his daughter should have long hair, no make-up and no boyfriend. Sumitha is unhappy and she wants her dad to change. Luckily, her mum is on daughter's side.  Plot summary  Laura calls into Ginny Gee's agony aunt radio show under a false name and complains about her divorced parents and her mother's new boyfriend. Ginny recognises Laura's voice and feels uncomfortable, as she is friends with Laura's mother. Laura's father also hears the show, and wonders about his daughter's happiness. Meanwhile, Jon argues with his father about his choice of career. Jon leaves on his bike, but accidentally collides with Laura. At first they argue, but they soon realise they are getting along well. Sumitha's father forbids her to go to a party, but she goes to Laura's for a sleepover and they sneak out together. Chelsea dances with Rob, and Sumitha with Jon, which irritates Laura. After the party Laura and Sumitha argue about Jon. Few weeks later, there is a parents' meeting at school. Then the holidays start and girls are going abroad with their parents (except Jemma, who is going to Paris with teachers and some students from Lee Hill). But before leaving Leehampton, parents organise a party at the Gees'.  Characters  *Chelsea Gee ‚Äì Laura's best friend.

The rules are laid out in ISO standard ISO/IEC 13211ISO/IEC 13211: Information technology -- Programming languages -- Prolog. International Organization for Standardization, Geneva. although there are differences in the Prolog implementations.  Data types  Prolog is dynamically typed. It has a single data type, the term, which has several subtypes: atoms, numbers, variables and compound terms. An atom is a general-purpose name with no inherent meaning. It is composed of a sequence of characters that is parsed by the Prolog reader as a single unit. Atoms are usually bare words in Prolog code, written with no special syntax. However, atoms containing spaces or certain other special characters must be surrounded by single quotes. Atoms beginning with a capital letter must also be quoted, to distinguish them from variables. The empty list, written \`[]\`, is also an atom. Other examples of atoms include \`x\`, \`blue\`, \`'Taco'\`, and \`'some atom'\`. Numbers can be floats or integers. Many Prolog implementations also provide unbounded integers and rational numbers. Variables are denoted by a string consisting of letters, numbers and underscore characters, and beginning with an upper-case letter or underscore. Variables closely resemble variables in logic in that they are placeholders for arbitrary terms. A variable can become instantiated (bound to equal a specific term) via unification. A single underscore (\`_\`) denotes an anonymous variable and means \\"any term\\". Unlike other variables, the underscore does not represent the same value everywhere it occurs within a predicate definition. A compound term is composed of an atom called a \\"functor\\" and a number of \\"arguments\\", which are again terms. Compound terms are ordinarily written as a functor followed by a comma-separated list of argument terms, which is contained in parentheses. The number of arguments is called the term's arity. An atom can be regarded as a compound term with arity zero. Examples of compound terms are \`truck_year('Mazda', 1986)\` and \`'Person_Friends'(zelda,[tom,jim])\`. Compound terms with functors that are declared as operators can be written in prefix or infix notation. For example, the terms \`-(z)\`, \`+(a,b)\` and \`=(X,Y)\` can also be written as \`-z\`, \`a+b\` and \`X=Y\`, respectively. Users can declare arbitrary functors as operators with different precedences to allow for domain-specific notations. The notation f/n is commonly used to denote a term with functor f and arity n. Special cases of compound terms: * Lists are defined inductively: The atom \`[]\` is a list. A compound term with functor \`.\` (dot) and arity 2, whose second argument is a list, is itself a list. There exists special syntax for denoting lists: \`.(A, B)\` is equivalent to \`[AB]\`. For example, the list \`.(1, .(2, .(3, [])))\` can also be written as \`[1  [2  [3  [ \`, or even more compactly as \`[1,2,3]\`. * Strings: A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes is equivalent to a list of (numeric) character codes, generally in the local character encoding or Unicode if the system supports Unicode. Prolog programs Prolog programs describe relations, defined by means of clauses. Pure Prolog is restricted to Horn clauses, a Turing-complete subset of first- order predicate logic. There are two types of clauses: Facts and rules. A rule is of the form Head :- Body. and is read as \\"Head is true if Body is true\\". A rule's body consists of calls to predicates, which are called the rule's goals. The built-in predicate \`,/2\` (meaning a 2-arity operator with name \`,\`) denotes conjunction of goals, and \`;/2\` denotes disjunction. Conjunctions and disjunctions can only appear in the body, not in the head of a rule. Clauses with empty bodies are called facts. An example of a fact is: cat(tom). which is equivalent to the rule: cat(tom) :- true. another example is: X is 3+2. and when you run it, the result will be X=5 Yes. The built-in predicate \`true/0\` is always true.  Evaluation  Execution of a Prolog program is initiated by the user's posting of a single goal, called the query. Logically, the Prolog engine tries to find a resolution refutation of the negated query. The resolution method used by Prolog is called SLD resolution. If the negated query can be refuted, it follows that the query, with the appropriate variable bindings in place, is a logical consequence of the program. In that case, all generated variable bindings are reported to the user, and the query is said to have succeeded. Operationally, Prolog's execution strategy can be thought of as a generalization of function calls in other languages, one difference being that multiple clause heads can match a given call. In that case, the system creates a choice-point, unifies the goal with the clause head of the first alternative, and continues with the goals of that first alternative. If any goal fails in the course of executing the program, all variable bindings that were made since the most recent choice-point was created are undone, and execution continues with the next alternative of that choice-point. This execution strategy is called chronological backtracking. For example: mother_child(trude, sally). father_child(tom, sally). father_child(tom, erica). father_child(mike, tom). sibling(X, Y) :- parent_child(Z, X), parent_child(Z, Y). parent_child(X, Y) :- father_child(X, Y). parent_child(X, Y) :- mother_child(X, Y). This results in the following query being evaluated as true: ?- sibling(sally, erica). Yes This is obtained as follows: Initially, the only matching clause-head for the query \`sibling(sally, erica)\` is the first one, so proving the query is equivalent to proving the body of that clause with the appropriate variable bindings in place, i.e., the conjunction \`(parent_child(Z,sally), parent_child(Z,erica))\`. The next goal to be proved is the leftmost one of this conjunction, i.e., \`parent_child(Z, sally)\`. Two clause heads match this goal. The system creates a choice-point and tries the first alternative, whose body is \`father_child(Z, sally)\`. This goal can be proved using the fact \`father_child(tom, sally)\`, so the binding \`Z = tom\` is generated, and the next goal to be proved is the second part of the above conjunction: \`parent_child(tom, erica)\`. Again, this can be proved by the corresponding fact. Since all goals could be proved, the query succeeds. Since the query contained no variables, no bindings are reported to the user. A query with variables, like: ?- father_child(Father, Child). enumerates all valid answers on backtracking. Notice that with the code as stated above, the query \`?- sibling(sally, sally).\` also succeeds. One would insert additional goals to describe the relevant restrictions, if desired.  Loops and recursion  Iterative algorithms can be implemented by means of recursive predicates. Prolog systems typically implement a well-known optimization technique called tail call optimization (TCO) for deterministic predicates exhibiting tail recursion or, more generally, tail calls: A clause's stack frame is discarded before performing a call in a tail position. Therefore, deterministic tail-recursive predicates are executed with constant stack space, like loops in other languages.  Cuts  A cut (\`!\`) inside a rule will prevent Prolog from backtracking any predicates behind the cut: predicate(X) :- one(X), !, two(X). will fail if the first-found value of \`X\` for which \`one(X)\` is true leads to \`two(X)\` being false.  Anonymous variables  Anonymous variables \`_\` are never bound to a value and can be used multiple times in a predicate. For instance searching a list for a given value: contains(V, []) :- false. contains(V, [V_]) :- true. contains(V, [_T]) :- contains(V, T).  Negation  The built-in Prolog predicate \`\\\\+/1\` provides negation as failure, which allows for non-monotonic reasoning. The goal \`\\\\+ illegal(X)\` in the rule legal(X) :- + illegal(X). is evaluated as follows: Prolog attempts to prove the \`illegal(X)\`. If a proof for that goal can be found, the original goal (i.e., \`\\\\+ illegal(X)\`) fails. If no proof can be found, the original goal succeeds. Therefore, the \`\\\\+/1\` prefix operator is called the \\"not provable\\" operator, since the query \`?- \\\\+ Goal.\` succeeds if Goal is not provable. This kind of negation is sound if its argument is \\"ground\\" (i.e. contains no variables). Soundness is lost if the argument contains variables. In particular, the query \`?- legal(X).\` can now not be used to enumerate all things that are legal.  Semantics  Under a declarative reading, the order of rules, and of goals within rules, is irrelevant since logical disjunction and conjunction are commutative. Procedurally, however, it is often important to take into account Prolog's execution strategy, either for efficiency reasons, or due to the semantics of impure built-in predicates for which the order of evaluation matters. Also, as Prolog interpreters try to unify clauses in the order they're provided, failing to give a correct ordering can lead to infinite recursion, as in: predicate1(X) :- predicate2(X,X). predicate2(X,Y) :- predicate1(X), X \\\\= Y. Given this ordering, any query of the form ?- predicate1(atom). will recur until the stack is exhausted. If, however, the last 3 lines were changed to: predicate2(X,Y) :- X \\\\= Y, predicate1(X). the same query would lead to a No. outcome in a very short time. Definite clause grammars There is a special notation called definite clause grammars (DCGs). A rule defined via \`-->/2\` instead of \`:-/2\` is expanded by the preprocessor (\`expand_term/2\`, a facility analogous to macros in other languages) according to a few straightforward rewriting rules, resulting in ordinary Prolog clauses. Most notably, the rewriting equips the predicate with two additional arguments, which can be used to implicitly thread state around, analogous to monads in other languages. DCGs are often used to write parsers or list generators, as they also provide a convenient interface to list differences. Parser example A larger example will show the potential of using Prolog in parsing. Given the sentence expressed in Backus‚ÄìNaur form: ::= ::=  ::= = ; ::=  ::=  ::= a  b ::= 0..9 ::= +  -  * This can be written in Prolog using DCGs, corresponding to a predictive parser with one token look-ahead: sentence(S) --> statement(S0), sentence_r(S0, S). sentence_r(S, S) --> []. sentence_r(S0, seq(S0, S)) --> statement(S1), sentence_r(S1, S). statement(assign(Id,E)) --> id(Id), [=], expression(E), [;]. expression(E) --> term(T), expression_r(T, E). expression_r(E, E) --> []. expression_r(E0, E) --> [+], term(T), expression_r(plus(E0,T), E). expression_r(E0, E) --> [-], term(T), expression_r(minus(E0, T), E). term(T) --> factor(F), term_r(F, T). term_r(T, T) --> []. term_r(T0, T) --> [*], factor(F), term_r(times(T0, F), T). factor(id(ID)) --> id(ID). factor(digit(D)) --> [D], { (number(D) ; var(D)), between(0, 9, D)}. id(a) --> [a]. id(b) --> [b]. This code defines a relation between a sentence (given as a list of tokens) and its abstract syntax tree (AST). Example query: ?- phrase(sentence(AST), [a,=,1,+,3,*,b,;,b,=,0,;]). AST = seq(assign(a, plus(digit(1), times(digit(3), id(b)))), assign(b, digit(0))) ; The AST is represented using Prolog terms and can be used to apply optimizations, to compile such expressions to machine-code, or to directly interpret such statements. As is typical for the relational nature of predicates, these definitions can be used both to parse and generate sentences, and also to check whether a given tree corresponds to a given list of tokens. Using iterative deepening for fair enumeration, each arbitrary but fixed sentence and its corresponding AST will be generated eventually: ?- length(Tokens, _), phrase(sentence(AST), Tokens). Tokens = [a, =, a, (;)], AST = assign(a, id(a)) ; Tokens = [a, =, b, (;)], AST = assign(a, id(b)) etc.  See also  * Comparison of Prolog implementations  References  Category:Programming language syntax Category:Prolog programming language family ","title":"Prolog syntax and semantics"},{"id":"24537880","text":"Kalus is a village in West Azerbaijan Province, Iran.

The Light Eight was planned as a new entry model. It competed in the upper middle-class with makes like LaSalle, the smaller Buicks and Chryslers, and the top-of-the offerings from Studebaker, Hudson, and Nash. The marketing objective was to add a new market segment for Packard during the depression. Packard did not use yearly model changes in these years. A new series appeared when management felt that there were enough running changes made. Therefore, the Light Eight was introduced during January 1932, together with the new V-12 (called \\"Twin Six\\" in its first year to honor the pioneer Packard model built from 1915 to 1923). Standard Eights and Super Eights followed in June 1932. Technical Construction of the Light Eight followed the Packard tradition. It had a heavy frame with X-bracing, deep side members, and the usual rear-wheel drive. Wheelbase was . Power came from a straight eight engine with a compression ratio of 6:0, delivering . It had a vacuum-plate clutch and an angle set hypoid differential. Battery and toolboxes were mounted on the fenders. Full instrumentation was used. The car was distinguished by a grille that had the traditional ox-yoke shape, but also with a then fashionable \\"shovel\\" nose. Closed Light Eights had a quarter window layout that was not shared by other Packards. The Light Eight used the same engine as the Standard Eight, but was lighter - for the sedan vs. for the model 901 Standard Eight sedan. It was also a good performer for its day. Body styles The Light Eight series 900 was available in four body styles: Style # 553 4-door, 5-passenger Sedan Style # 558 2-door, 2/4-passenger Stationary (rumble seat) Coupe Style # 559 2-door, 2/4-passenger (rumble seat) Roadster Coupe Style # 563 2-door, 5-passenger Sedan Coupe (sometimes referred as a \\"Victoria\\" Coupe) Prices and options 1932 Packard 904 Deluxe 8 Coupe A Light Eight 4-door, 5-passenger Sedan was priced at USD $1,750, compared to $2,485 for a similar Standard Eight Sedan. The three other Light Eight body styles cost $1,795 each. Packard managed to sell 6,785 units of its new model. In comparison, 7,669 units of the Standard Eight were sold during the shorter model run, from 23 June 1932, until 5 January 1933. The automaker had lower profits from the Light Eight compared with the Standard Eight. Options for the Light Eight included Dual sided or rear-mounted spare wheels, sidemount cover(s), cigar lighter, a right-hand tail-light, luggage rack, full rear bumper, and fender park lights, the latter was priced at $65.00. Market position The Light Eight was intended as Packard's price leader at the entry level of the luxury car market. It was attractive to buyers, but it failed its main reason for existence, which was to lure away buyers from its rivals. Instead, it hurt sales of Packard's volume line, the Standard Eight. Amidst the Great Depression, many prospects for a Standard Eight ended buying a Light Eight. Although it offered not as much luxury, it had many features found in Packard's bigger model. It was powered by the same engine as the Standard Eight; it had a wheelbase that was only shorter - and its lower weight brought more performance. The Light Eight included Packard prestige at a much lower price. Packard learned its lesson quickly. There was no Light Eight for its 10th series (1933) line. It renamed the Standard Eight as simply the Eight and integrated a four-model subseries that was patterned after the Light Eight. Although the shovel nose was gone, the quarter window treatment remained, and the differential that was introduced with the Light Eight was now found in all Eights. This 1001 series was no longer available at low prices: they started at $2,150 for the sedan and went up to $2,250 for the roadster. The Light Eight brought the experience to Packard to build and market an upper middle- class model. In this sense, it is the predecessor for the automaker's second try into this market segment, the Packard One-Twenty, that was introduced in 1935.
