The River Yarrow flows through the village. History Croston was founded in the 7th century when St Aidan arrived at the riverside settlements. In the absence of a church, a cross was erected as a place of worship. The name is derived from the two Old English words 'cross' and 't≈´n' (town/homestead/village) and is unique to the village. The parish of Croston was formerly far larger than it is today. It included Chorley, Much Hoole, Rufford, Bretherton, Mawdesley, Tarleton, Hesketh Bank, Bispham, Walmer Bridge and Ulnes Walton. These became independent parishes as a result of a series of separations between 1642 and 1821. A charter granted by Edward I in 1283 permitted an annual medieval fair and market to be held on the village green. Pre-20th Century maps also depict a castle which is believed to have been of a wooden construction because there is no evidence of a stone structure. Croston is twinned with the French town of Azay le Rideau, just south west of Tours, France. Azay boasts a French Renaissance chateau, one of the famous chateaux of the Loire, and is a popular tourist hotspot. Landmarks Croston Hall was built by the De Trafford family and was the manor house to the village of Croston. The hall was demolished in the 1960s, but there is a new country house built on its site. The family were Roman Catholics, and employed Edward Welby Pugin to design a family chapel in the grounds of the house in 1857. It is a small building constructed of rock-faced sandstone and is in eclectic Gothic style. It was left to the people of Croston on the death of the last De Trafford in the 1960s. Croston used to have a large brick police station which has recently been refurbished. It was replaced by a smaller police station in the 1970s, which itself has now closed. Transport Croston railway station serves the village and is on the Ormskirk Branch Line, originally built & opened by the Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway (later taken over by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway) in 1849.CRL - Croston Community Rail Lancashire; Retrieved 22 November 2016 the rail link was reduced to single line working in 1970. Croston has bus connections to nearby Leyland, Chorley, Southport, and Preston. Education Bishop Rawstorne Church of England Academy is the secondary school based in the village. It has between 800 and 900 pupils from the ages of 11 to 16. The footballer Mark Bonner played professionally for a number of years at Blackpool. Andrew Sprake the bassist from the band Failsafe, who featured in an episode of Inbetweeners, also studied here. The DJ Dave Dawson also studied here. Dave makes the Mind the gap announcements on the Docklands Light Railway. Croston Old School, Croston, Lancashire Croston Old School is now a community resource centre. The building is a Grade II listed building which originates from 1660 but was substantially rebuilt in 1827, when the work was funded by subscriptions. Date stones commemorating both the original build and the rebuild are evident in the first-floor wall. It is located within the churchyard, in the centre of the village at the end of Church Street and next to the church building. Until 1999 the buildings were used as a school. Croston Old School Community Trust's grant from the National Lottery for ¬£481,062 has funded the majority of a scheme to create a community resource centre for Croston. The building provides: * A new home for Croston Pre-school * A large community space with meeting rooms * An exhibition area for local arts and heritage projects * A reference library and a reading room * Space for adult education Religion The parish church is dedicated to St Michael, and is a Grade II* listed building. It appears to be based on a 15th-century design, but was reworked in the 16th century, and altered in the 17th. A partial rebuilding took place in the 18th century, and it was substantially altered in the 19th century. It consists of a nave and chancel with north and south aisles, mostly built of red sandstone with stone tiles. Croston Old School is located within the Churchyard. A payment was made of farm rents amounting to ¬£50,000 per year collected in fixed proportions by the Rectors of Croston, Hoole, Chorley, Rufford, and Tarlton and which until at least 1910 was paid to the representatives of the Hon. Mrs. Dashwood whose ancestor had purchased the rights in the reign of Charles II. This income had been taken by Henry VIII from the Convent of Zion at the time of the Dissolution and sold. The funds taken were those used to fund religious houses. The Churchyard had been the site of Becconsall chapel until 1660, when the Reverend James Hyett built the school there. He had been appointed to his post by Charles I in 1625, but by 1662 he felt unable to conform to the Act of Uniformity and was ejected from the Church, he died the same year and in his will left an endowment to the school.

The property is located at the southernmost fringe of the Central Business District. The station was built in 1917, and was designed to handle both steam trains and steamships. The storage and maintenance facility was converted to its present condition in 1982, following the demolition of the former main terminal concourse building \\"headhouse\\" of the DL&W; Terminal in 1979. The lower level of the sheds are used to store the rail cars when they are not in use. The upper level is mostly empty space, consisting of the concrete troughs where tracks once stood and their platforms. However, some of it is used for offices, a train operators' lounge and storage. Numerous proposals for adaptive reuse of the unused portion of the upper level of the terminal sheds have been floated publicly by various parties, including: a casino, a farmers market and loft apartments, as well as an additional Metro Rail station with shops and commuter parking. In 1982, an addition was built on the east end of the terminal building, which has a modern rail maintenance shop for servicing the rail fleet. This addition also contains some administrative offices. History The terminal was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1917. The station was built for both boat and rail travel. Passengers arriving by boat entered the station from the south side entrance which faced the Buffalo River. The building was three stories high and built of brownstone. There were waiting rooms on the ground floor and on the second floor which were connected by a grand double staircase. The ground floor had one ticket office and checking counter with benches along the sides. The second waiting room was fitted with accommodations for about 200 persons. Off the waiting room was a women's parlor, furnished in soft brown with wicker furniture. There were rugs on the floor and a writing desk. On the other side of the stairs was a smoking room. The middle of the east side of the waiting room had the entrance to the train concourse. Also next to the waiting room was a newsstand, telegraph and parcel booths, and restaurant. On a mezzanine floor were the rooms for railroad employees, a waiting room for immigrants, and a room for railroad business mail. On the third floor were various offices, including those for the superintendent and the train dispatcher. The Construction of the Buffalo Skyway led to the destruction of the line north of the terminal where the skyway was placed. In 1963, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad merged with the Erie Railroad. The new resulting railroad known as the Erie Lackawanna Railroad or the \\"EL\\". Passenger services The DLW and later, the Erie Lackawanna, hosted trains of the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (\\"Nickel Plate Road\\"), thus serving as the eastern terminus of the latter company's trains. The Nickel Plate named night trains to Buffalo afforded the continuation of trips to the DLW's Hoboken Terminal via DLW trains.Lackawanna timetable, January 1, 1960, p. 2 http://streamlinermemories.info/Eastern/Lackawanna60TT.pdf Briefly, from the Nickel Plate's 1964 merger into the Norfolk & Western until the trains' termination in 1965, these trains were carried under the Norfolk & Western name. Passenger service in 1964: *Erie Lackawanna: **New York Mail (eastbound only night train, Buffalo-Hoboken) **Owl (westbound only night train, Hoboken- Buffalo) **Phoebe Snow (Buffalo-Hoboken) *Norfolk & Western: ***City of Chicago (westbound only night train, Buffalo-Chicago, picking up carriages from Phoebe Snow for continuous Hoboken-Chicago trip) / City of Cleveland (eastbound only night train, Chicago-Buffalo, connecting with the New York Mail for continuing to Hoboken) The EL abandoned the terminal soon after when in 1968 it ended the overnight Owl service from Hoboken to Buffalo and New York Mail heading back.'Official Guide of the Railways,' October 1967, Erie Lackawanna section, Table 1 After years of abandonment the head house of the terminal was demolished in 1979 in preparation for the installation of the Buffalo Metro Rail. Future With the redevelopment around the terminal of Canalside, LECOM Harborcenter, and KeyBank Center, plans have been floated to redevelop the building into a multi-model site with turning the upper level of the building into commercial space with a pedestrian bridge to KeyBank Center and its parking garage as well as a new metro rail station inside the building and public access to riverwalk. The plan, estimated to cost $42 Million and later approved by NFTA also includes docks on the Buffalo River.

In 1958 the party was divided on whether to participate in the 1959 Northern Rhodesian general election, in which only a minority of the black population was allowed to vote. The more radical Kaunda broke away, and formed the Zambia African National Congress, which was banned in 1959. The NRANC won a single seat in the elections. In the 1962 general elections the party won seven seats, becoming the third-largest faction in the Legislative Assembly and held the balance of power. Prior to the elections Nkumbula had made a secret electoral pact with the United Federal Party, but decided to form a government with the United National Independence Party. The party won ten seats in the 1964 general elections, and following independence, was renamed the Zambian African National Congress. Nkumbula ran for president in the 1968 general elections, finishing second to Kaunda with 18% of the vote. The party won 23 of the 110 seats in the National Assembly, remaining the main opposition party. In 1973 the party was banned,Zambia: Defunct parties EISA as the country became a one-party state.

It is one of New Zealand's most affluent suburbs, consistently ranked within the top three wealthiest, and is often billed as Auckland's \\"oldest suburb\\" since it dates from the earliest days of the European settlement of Auckland in 1841. It is characterised by its mix of tree lined streets with large estates; redeveloped industrial zones with Edwardian town houses and 1920s bay villas; and its hilly topography that allows for views of the port, the WaitematƒÅ Harbour, Rangitoto Island and the Auckland Domain. To its west lies the Auckland Domain, to the south Newmarket, and to the north the Ports of Auckland. Parnell Rise and Parnell Road make up the main road through Parnell. Parnell Rise leads to the central business district to the west; Parnell Road runs from Parnell Rise uphill to the top of the suburb, and then bends almost 90 degrees and continues towards Newmarket in the south-east. Parnell Road ends at the intersection of George and Sarawia Streets, where it becomes Broadway. Early European settlers knew Parnell Road as \\"Manukau Road\\" until well after the formation of Khyber Pass Road in 1845. History NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua occupied the Parnell area prior to European settlement. The Government acquired the area from NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua as part of a 3,000-acre land deal in 1840. Robert Tod purchased 3 acres from the Government on 1 September 1841. He quickly subdivided it into 36 sections, which he advertised for sale on 4 September 1841 as the \\"Village of Parnell\\". In the early 1830s Tod had supplied copies of the Bible to a Plymouth Brethren mission in Baghdad, one of whose members was John Vesey Parnell. Streets in the village of Parnell were named Groves, Cronin and Calman after other missionaries to Baghdad, Anthony Norris Groves, Edward Cronin and Erasmus Scott Calman. These were later renamed Eglon, Fox and Marston Streets. The Borough of Parnell, established in 1877, was amalgamated into the Auckland City Council area in 1913 or 1915. The Parnell Road Board administered the area before the Borough was established.Parnell, The Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Auckland Provincial District], pp. 509‚Äì515.

There were 3,021 households. There were 3,627 males and 3,933 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.92 males per female, with 756 people (10.0%) aged under 15 years, 2,145 (28.4%) aged 15 to 29, 3,597 (47.6%) aged 30 to 64, and 1,065 (14.1%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 77.2% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 4.8% MƒÅori, 2.1% Pacific peoples, 19.3% Asian, and 4.4% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 39.7%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 52.1% had no religion, 35.6% were Christian, and 6.8% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 3,384 (49.7%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 267 (3.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,702 (54.4%) people were employed full- time, 1,014 (14.9%) were part-time, and 219 (3.2%) were unemployed. Local government Parnell forms part of the ≈årƒÅkei Ward for council representation within Auckland City. Parliamentary representation Parnell forms part of the Epsom Electorate for parliamentary representation. Parnell represents approximately 20% of the population in the electorate. The Member of Parliament for Epsom, David Seymour, represents ACT New Zealand. Notable buildings and landmarks=Lower Parnell Road= * The Swan Hotel, 31‚Äì35 Parnell Rise ‚Äì constructed prior to 1856 and is one of the earliest timber public houses surviving in Auckland. Additions to the building date from the 1880s and were designed by Edward Bartley. This building originally stood directly on the foreshore. Historically this cove (now completely reclaimed) had been used by Maori to beach their waka; this usage continued after European settlement and part of the foreshore was demarcated as a Maori hostel (currently used by police Commercial Vehicle Safety Team [CVST] as a heavy vehicle weighbridge and compliance checkpoint). * Parnell Rail Bridge ‚Äì 19th century metal rail bridge on massive volcanic basalt rock piers. This structure allows the rail line to cross over Parnell Road without disrupting traffic. * Mayfair Apartments ‚Äì 1930s brick Neo-Georgian highrise apartment block. * Windsor Castle Hotel, 144 Parnell Road ‚Äì a hotel which dates from the 1850s. The hotel was remodelled in the 1880s after the architect R. MacKay Fripp was commissioned to convert the existing hotel into a larger pub; the existing facade was built during this conversion. * Former Heard Factory ‚Äì three storeyed art-deco style industrial building built for a confectionery manufacturer. * Heard Park ‚Äì this land was donated to the city in 1953 by the Heard family, the owners of Heards Candy, the adjacent large Art-Deco Heards building. * Church of St John the Baptist (Catholic), 204 Parnell Road ‚Äì this church was designed by Edward Mahoney and formally instituted by Bishop Pompallier in 1861; it is the only Catholic church in Parnell and the oldest Catholic church in the city. The Sisters of Mercy had a convent here and a Catholic primary school ran for a century, until it closed due to falling rolls in the 1950s. =Parnell Road= * Whitby Lodge, 330 Parnell Road ‚Äì erected by the early 1870s, Whitby Lodge is one of few surviving colonial dwellings in Auckland constructed of the local volcanic stone basalt. Possibly erected as early as 1848 or 1852. It is possible that Fraser erected a building on the site at the time of his purchase in 1864, or improved an existing structure. The roof beams are not supported by the masonry walls, suggesting this is an earlier wooden structure which was subsequently clad in stone. The building was occupied by the Consulate General of the Cook Islands as an Embassy from 1978 until 1 December 1994. * Hulme Court, 350 Parnell Road ‚Äì a stone-built, Regency-style house surrounded by trellised verandahs, was built in 1843 for Sir Fredrick Whitaker; it is the second oldest surviving house in Auckland, and the oldest documented dwelling still standing on its original site. In its early years, the house was occupied by a succession of notable people including George Selwyn, Governor Gore Browne, who used it as a temporary Government House in the 1850s, and Sir Francis Dillon Bell, who was the Minister of Native Affairs and an advisor to Governor Grey, and Colonel Hulme, who acted as commander of British Army troops in New Zealand, and after whom the house is named. * Former Parnell Public Library ‚Äì corner of Parnell Road and St Georges Bay Road. 1920s Neo-Classical building. =Saint Stephen's Corner= * The Anglican Cathedral, which stands at the top of the hill, is the most distinctive feature of Parnell. The cathedral serves as a replacement to the original St Mary's Cathedral, which was demolished in 1888 after standing for just 28 years. The building has two parts: the brick choir and body of the church date from about 1960 and represent a \\"modern\\" simplified version of Gothic. This closely resembles Guildford Cathedral, by Edward Maufe, completed in 1961. The massing of the forms, the detailing of the masonry and the smooth expanses of plain brick occur in both buildings. Over the transept entrance stands a bronze sculpture of the Archangel Michael defeating the Devil, very similar to the Epstein sculpture of the same subject on Coventry Cathedral (finished 1962). The front part of the church, built in the 1990s to the design of Professor Richard Toy and John Sinclair, recalls the new Coventry Cathedral built after World War II. It features large stained-glass windows, illuminated by the sunlight at certain times of the day. MƒÅori motifs and symbols appear in the newer part of the building, which awaits a large spire to finish the composition. * St Mary's Cathedral Church ‚Äì Next to this building stands the smaller St Mary's, a wooden neo-Gothic structure which dates from 1885 and served as the pro-cathedral after the demolition of the earlier St Mary's and until the building of the current cathedral. Designed by B.W Mountfort, it stood on the other side of Parnell Road until the 1980s. * Bishopscourt ‚Äì St Stephens Avenue. Also known as Selwyn Court, this is the residence of the Anglican Bishop of Auckland. This wooden gothic house, designed by Frederick Thatcher, has a chapel and an octagonal turret. Bishop Selwyn and his wife moved here in May 1865. * Neligan House ‚Äì St Stephens Avenue. Fine Arts & Crafts brick residence built for Bishop Neligan in 1908 by Noel Bamford & Hector Pierce. * St Stephens House ‚Äì St Stephens Avenue. Wooden Edwardian mansion, now used for Anglican social services. * The Old Deanery ‚Äì St Stephens Avenue ‚Äì A Frederick Thatcher- designed neo-Tudor house built from volcanic scoria rock, probably by Benjamin Strange. This is probably the birthplace of the novelist Hugh Walpole whose father was Dean of the Cathedral at the time. =Northern area of Parnell= St Stephen's Chapel * Tower House, 33 St Stephen's Avenue ‚Äì landmark brick mansion from 1904 with distinctive turret. The residence of A.E.T. Devore, Mayor of Auckland 1886‚Äì1889. * Parnell Rose Gardens Dove Myer Robinson Park, 85 to 87 Gladstone Road, Parnell ‚Äì this park was created in 1913 as Parnell Park ‚Äì (Parnell amalgamated with Auckland that year) largely as a result of the activities of Auckland Mayor Christopher Parr (later Sir James Parr). It was renamed in the 1970s to honour the popular and longest-serving mayor of Auckland, Sir Dove Myer Robinson. The park was created out of the gardens of several large estates which occupied the point in the late 19th century; primarily that of Sir John Logan Campbell and Justice Gillies; it enjoys expansive views of the WaitematƒÅ Harbour. This area consists of a number of different areas; the cottage style Nancy Stein Memorial Garden popular for wedding ceremonies; sweeping on down to Judges Bay and the salt water Parnell Baths. The Parnell Rose Garden is a major city attraction, containing beautifully maintained rose beds, and leads on to extended open spaces and areas with specimen trees. The park is also home to some remarkable native trees ‚Äì the oldest manuka and largest pohutukawa in Auckland. There are car parking facilities and artworks at the Fred Ambler Lookout, an open space that overlooks the container terminal. * Judges Bay ‚Äì so-called because in 1841 Judge Martin and Attorney General Swainson arrived in Auckland with houses in prefabricated sections. Swainson built on the west side and the Martins on the east of this bay. Known as Taurarua ‚Äòthe two ropes‚Äô it is thought that this name referred to the two administrators of British justice. From here Martin and his neighbour Swainson would commute to work in Auckland by rowboat; they employed MƒÅori boatmen who were supplied with uniforms. Lady Martin taught English to the local MƒÅori and late in her life wrote of her experiences in early colonial New Zealand. * St Stephens Church and graveyard ‚Äì important early Anglican Chapel and cemetery. * Parnell Swimming Pool ‚Äì 1950 modernist design by the office of the City Architect Tibor Donner. It owes much to the AA-trained architect, Ralph Wilkinson, who was then working in Donner's office. Ewen Wainscott was site architect. noted for murals by James Turkington The complex won an NZIA Gold Medal in 1957. See Home & Building June 1950. =Southern area of Parnell= * Kinder House ‚Äì scoria residence built for the Rev John Kinder (1819‚Äì1903)in 1857, of volcanic scoria rock by Benjamin Strange. Now a museum, Kinder House is open to the public weekdays from 11 am to 3 pm. There is a modest entry charge. Various booklets and postcards are on sale. www.kinder.org.nz/ * Ewelme Cottage ‚Äì the kauri- constructed Ewelme Cottage has a link with the Anglican community in Auckland, the dwelling designed and built by the Reverend Vicesimus Lush (1817‚Äì1882) and his wife Blanche in 1863‚Äì64. Ewelme Cottage, was extended 18 years after it was originally built; it remained in family hands until 1968 when it became part of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. * Jubilee Building ‚Äì The New Zealand Jubilee Institute for the Blind was founded in 1890 by John Abbott, merchant, who came to New Zealand in 1864. The Institute school had originally been established in an old boarding house in Parnell in 1889. A more permanent school was built in 1891 with money from a mayoralty fund set up to celebrate the Jubilee of Queen Victoria, resulting in the name \\"Jubilee Institute\\". This building burnt down in 1897. Between 1907 and 1909, handsome new brick buildings were built for the institute, designed by well-known architect Edward Bartley and built by W.Philcox and Sons. Additions in 1926 designed by Gummer and Ford provided for adult accommodation, a shop, workshops where the blind worked on various manufacturing projects, and a women's dormitory in 1927. The main building is now an Auckland City community centre and library, the subsidiary buildings are now used for a variety of purposes. During the early 1970s the suburb became rather dilapidated. Les Harvey, a local businessman, bought up several properties cheaply and created \\"Parnell Village\\", encouraging others to follow his lead. This revitalised the area as a week-end tourist shopping-destination. This involved Parnell re-inventing itself as a set of \\"Ye Olde Worlde Shoppes\\". As many other Victorian buildings underwent demolition in Auckland at the time, period materials became available cheaply, and the buildings of Parnell village emerged altered, extended and tarted up in a somewhat fanciful but fun ersatz Victorian style. Much of this restyling remains in evidence within Parnell Village and around the Parnell Road shopping area, partly because of the ongoing ownership of the Harvey family's company, City Construction. Along the upper part of Parnell Road stand a number of 19th century houses, most of them now used by law firms, accountancy firms, shops, and a few restaurants. The lower part of Parnell has a larger concentration of Edwardian retail buildings, including a number of fashionable boutiques, nightclubs and bars. The streets to each side of Parnell Road remain mainly residential in character, with some townhouses and apartments, especially towards St Georges Bay Road. At the bottom of Parnell Rise runs Beach Road, so called because it ran around the beach-front of the now-reclaimed Mechanics Bay and Official Bay. St Georges Bay disappeared at the same time. Here stands the former Auckland Railway Station, an impressive brick 1930 structure, designed by Gummer and Ford. The City Fathers relocated the Auckland train terminus here from the bottom of Queen Street in 1930. The building ceased to operate as a station in 2003 when Britomart Transport Centre became the new Auckland terminus at the former Queen Street site. Parks Parnell has several parks. * Dove-Myer Robinson Park, more commonly known as the Parnell Rose Garden ‚Äì this park was created in 1913 as Parnell Park. Parnell Park was created by combining land belonging to several large houses, one of which (the home of the Gillies family) which was retained as the tearooms. One of the other properties belonged to Sir John Logan Campbell whose house Killbryde was demolished in 1924. The park is distinguished by many mature trees which were planted by the previous private owners. The park was renamed for Sir Dove-Myer Robinson, the longest-serving mayor of Auckland, who served for 18 years. The Rose Gardens are popular for weddings and each year in November, the park is host to the Parnell Festival of Roses, which showcases New Zealand craft stalls, art exhibitions, music, strolling performers and thousands of roses. One portion of the garden is a collection of heritage roses collected by the late Nancy Steen. Nancy Steen Rose Garden The entrance to the park is a War Memorial built in the 1920s of volcanic basalt composed of three massive arches. The park enjoys views over the WaitematƒÅ Harbour; its grounds blend with those of the adjacent historic Anglican St Stephen's Chapel & graveyard, Judges Bay Reserve and Point Resolution Park with its Parnell Swimming Baths. * Point Resolution Park ‚Äì located above the Parnell Swimming Baths and includes a walkway across the railway line and Tamaki Drive to connect with the WaitematƒÅ Harbour. * Judges Bay Reserve Judges Bay and the adjacent Parnell Swimming Baths provide saltwater bathing. * St Stephen's Churchyard ‚Äì one of Auckland's oldest cemeteries and the location of a Selwyn Church. * Ayr Reserve ‚Äì an area of largely native bush accessible from Ayr Street. * Alberon Reserve ‚Äì an area of native bush accessible from Alberon Street and St Georges Bay Road. * Scarborough Reserve ‚Äì an area of Native bush accessible from Scarborough Terrace. * Heard Park ‚Äì located in the centre of Parnell Village. This land was donated to the city in 1953 by the Heard family, the owners of Heards Candy. The large Art-Deco Heards building is adjacent to the park, now no longer a working confectionery factory. * Fraser Park ‚Äì located at the western end of Parnell Road. This triangular piece of land was previously the location of Parnell School; its wooden school buildings were demolished in the 1950s. * Carlaw Park ‚Äì located in Parnell, was the home of rugby league football in Auckland from 1921 to 2002. * Auckland Domain ‚Äì arguably also part of Grafton, forms the westernmost edge of Parnell and houses extensive forest, the Auckland War Memorial Museum, and the Winter Gardens. Infrastructure Until 2017 Parnell never had a dedicated railway station. Parnell Railway Station was opened to the public in March 2017. It serves the Western and Southern Lines. It was built near the Mainline Steam Depot at the west of the Parnell commercial area, and north of the Parnell Tunnel, which has been located beneath the suburb since 1873. Education Parnell lies within easy reach of two universities (University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology) and of some significant State secondary schools: Auckland Grammar School, Epsom Girls' Grammar School, St Peter's College and Baradene College of the Sacred Heart.

It is located almost halfway between Glasgow (21 miles) and Edinburgh (29 miles). The town has a population of about 8,840. A local story has Shotts being named after the legendary giant highwayman Bertram de Shotts, though toponymists give the Anglo-Saxon (\\"steep slopes\\") as the real source of the name.Mackay, George (2002). Scottish Place Names Shotts is the home of the 2015 world champion pipe band, Shotts and Dykehead Caledonia Pipe Band. History Until 1457 Shotts was part of the Lanarkshire parish of Bothwell. Groome related that the pre-reformation church of Bertramshotts is mentioned in a Papal bull in 1476. The parish, one of the largest in Lowland Scotland, was sometimes called Shotts but officially it was known as Bertram Shotts. In 1831 the Duke of Hamilton owned most of the land. Shotts was known for its mining and ironworks. The Shotts Iron Company was first established in 1801 and provided employment for Shotts and the surrounding area for 150 years, and was eventually wound up in 1952. These were developed when transport by canal and railway became possible. By the late 1800s the ironworks had grown to the extent that the town slogan was \\"Shotts lights the world\\", as gas lamp standards made here were exported throughout the British Empire and beyond. In the years leading up to World War II there were 22 coal mines in the area, but Northfield Colliery, the last of these, closed in the 1960s. Geography Blaeu's map based on Pont's original \\"Glasgow and the county of Lanark\\" map c.1596 depicting Schots (Shotts), Falas (Fauldhouse), Torbrecks (Tarbrax), Allentoun (Allanton) etc. Shotts is south of the M8 in North Lanarkshire between Wishaw and Harthill. Historically the Shotts Iron Works were between Calderhead, source of the South Calder Water, and Stane. Shotts parish was originally made up of five villages: Dykehead , Calderside, Stane, Springhill and Torbothie; all growing up around the old coach roads between Glasgow and Edinburgh that expanded and merged during the 18th and 19th centuries following the growth in mining. =Knowhoble Hill= Knowhoble Hill, lying beside Teilling Burn, was the site of adwelling belonging to the Cleland (Clevland) family. Shotts Iron Works Shotts Calderhead- Erskine Parish Church Sport Hannah Park Shotts has a number of sports facilitated in the local community. Shotts Golf Club, an 18-hole course founded in 1895, is to the North-East of the town.

Often referred to as merely Operation Rooster, it was carried out on December 26 and 27, 1969. Participating forces including the Nahal Brigade's 50th battalion, the elite paratrooper reconnaissance unit Sayeret Tzanhanim, and the Israeli Air Force. Background The War of Attrition raged along the Suez Canal, as Egypt attempted to recapture the Sinai Peninsula, which Israel had occupied during the Six-Day War. Egypt had received a considerable amount of military equipment, including tanks, radar systems and weapons, from the Soviet Union. During the Six-Day War, Israel had captured some of these shipments of equipment, which had allowed it to gain a lot of intelligence on the weaknesses of the Egyptian air defense. As newer systems arrived in Egypt, Israel had an effort underway to learn how to deal with these. Reconnaissance missions showed that a P-12 radar system had been placed on the beach of Ras Gharib. An attempt to destroy it with an aerial strike was cancelled. Planning Planning of the mission started on December 24. It received approval from the IDF chain of command and training began on radar systems which had been captured during the Six-Day War. Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters were chosen to carry the radar to Israeli territory. Execution of the mission The mission was launched at 9 p.m. on December 26. A-4 Skyhawks and F-4 Phantoms began attacking Egyptian forces along the western bank of the Suez canal and Red Sea. Hidden by the noise of the attacking jets, three A√©rospatiale Super Frelons, carrying a force from the 35th Paratroopers Brigade, led by Lieutenant colonel Arie Sidon and his deputy Doron Rubin, made their way west towards their target. Making their approach carefully in order not to be spotted beforehand, the paratroopers overwhelmed the light security contingent at the radar installation and quickly took control of the site.Gal Perl Finkel, Capability and daring in the IDF, The Jerusalem Post, March 13, 2019. By 2 a.m., on December 27, when the paratroops had taken apart the radar station and prepared the various parts for the CH-53s, the two helicopters were called in from across the Red Sea. One CH-53 carried the communications caravan and the radar antenna, while the other took the heavier, four-ton radar itself.

Position in Indian Social Order The Azhvanchery Thamprakkals were also temporally, the rulers of Athavanad: The name Athavanad is believed to be derived from them or vice versa. Before abolition of the princely-order of government, The Azhvanchery Thamprakkal was considered as the supreme religious head of Kerala Brahmins.

In the famous work Brahmandapuranam, of poet Thunchath Ezhuthachan, Azhvanchery Thamprakkals had been mentioned with the title \\"Netranarayanan\\". Title and Privileges The title of Thamprakkal literally means Emperor (having originated from the Sanskrit Samrat and later corrupted into Thampran) came to be used to refer to the Brahmins of Azhvanchery Mana family. The story according to popular lore is that while returning from the coronation ceremony of Kulashekhara Perumal with the gift of a golden-cow, the Thamprakkal was stopped on the road by Pakkanar, a person of low caste. He claimed that it was the exclusive right of his castemen to take dead cows. The Thamprakkal, affronted, sprinkled water on the golden cow and brought it to life. The low caste man exclaimed \\"You are indeed a Thamprakkal\\" and since then the title has stayed with the family. The Thamprakkal had four privileges within the Hindu Social Order of Kerala. * Bhadrasthanam: The chief seat in any assembly * Sarvamanyam: Universal respectability * Brahma Samrajyam: Sovereignty over all Brahmins * Brahmavarchas: Highest authority in Vedic learning The opinion of the Azhvanchery Thamprakkal was considered supreme in deciding matters relating to religion, caste, society etc. Only the anointed head of the family received the title.

He later entered federal politics, serving as a Senator for Victoria (1929‚Äì1935) and briefly as a minister in the Lyons Government. He was a member of the Nationalist Party until 1931, when it was replaced with the United Australia Party. Early life Lawson was born in Dunolly, the son of a Presbyterian clergyman of Scottish descent. He was educated at a local school and then briefly Scotch College in Melbourne. He was a noted Australian rules footballer, playing for Castlemaine. He studied law with a Melbourne law firm and was called to the bar. He then went into practice in Castlemaine, and was elected to the town council, serving as mayor in 1905. In 1901 he married Olive Horwood, with whom he had eight children. State politics Lawson was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Castlemaine as a Liberal in a by-election in December 1899, and represented the district in its different incarnations for 28 years. In June 1904, Lawson was elected to the new Electoral district of Castlemaine and Maldon, holding this seat until a redistribution in 1927, when he was elected as member for Castlemaine and Kyneton. Lawson was President of the Board of Land and Works in the government of William Watt from 1913 to 1915, and Attorney-General and Solicitor-General in the government of Alexander Peacock from 1915 to 1917. He remained loyal to Peacock when most country Liberal members supported John Bowser's rural faction, the Economy Party, and when Bowser's short-lived government ended in resignation in March 1918, Lawson succeeded him, holding the portfolios of Attorney-General and Minister of Labour. Lawson proved to be the longest- serving premier Victoria had seen to date, holding office for six continuous years, something none of his 26 predecessors had done. This was despite the further fragmentation of the non-Labor vote with the emergence of the Country Party. At the 1921 elections, Lawson's Nationalist Party won 30 seats, to Labor's 20 and the Country Party's 13. Both Labor and the Country Party preferred Lawson to each other, so Lawson was able to survive as a minority Premier. He was helped by Labor's continuing inability to win seats outside its strongholds in the industrial suburbs of Melbourne and a few provincial towns. The biggest test Lawson faced was the 1923 Victorian Police strike, which saw riots and looting in the streets of Melbourne. There was also increasingly bitter industrial strife in Melbourne as the prosperity of the pre-war years failed to return. There were major strikes on the waterfront and in the coal mining industry. Lawson gained a reputation as a tough conservative. He refused to give in to the demands of the police for better pay and conditions, running the risk of a breakdown in law and order, but once the strike was over he appointed a Royal Commission into their grievances, which gave them much of what they wanted. In September 1923 Lawson formed Victoria's first conservative coalition, taking in five Country Party ministers. The coalition broke down in March 1924 when the Country Party made demands Lawson would not accept. The Country Party ministers resigned, and then united with Labor to bring Lawson down. After unsuccessfully contesting the Speakership, he retired to the back bench, where he stayed until October 1928, when he quit state politics altogether. Federal politics At the 1928 election, Lawson was elected to the Senate as a Nationalist, taking his seat in July 1929. In October the Scullin Labor government came to power and he spent two years in opposition. In October 1933 he was appointed an Assistant Minister in the Lyons United Australia Party government, and in 1934 he was made Minister in charge of Territories. In 1933 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. At the 1934 election, election he retired, his parliamentary term ending in June 1935. Death and legacy Bust of Lawson at Castlemaine, Victoria. Lawson died in East Melbourne, survived by seven of his eight children. His wife died in 1949 and his youngest son had joined the Royal Australian Air Force and was killed in 1941. Helen Mary Keays his daughter was awarded an OBE in 1972 for Women's Services. His last surviving child, Ina Constance Watson, died in Melbourne, Australia on 9 November 2012.

Early life and education Nadezhda Udaltsova was born in the village of Orel, Russia, on December 29, 1885. When she was six, her family moved to Moscow, where she graduated from high school and began her artistic career. In September 1905 Udaltsova enrolled in the art school run by Konstantin Yuon and Ivan Dudin, where she studied for two years and met fellow-students Vera Mukhina, Liubov Popova, and Aleksander Vesnin. In the spring of 1908 she traveled to Berlin and Dresden, and upon her return to Russia, she unsuccessfully applied for admission to the Moscow Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture. In 1910‚Äì11, Udaltsova studied at several private studios, among them Tatlin's Tower. In 1912‚Äì13 she and Popova traveled to Paris to continue their studies under the tutelage of Henri Le Fauconnier, Jean Metzinger and Andr√© Segonzac at Acad√©mie de La Palette. Udaltsova returned to Moscow in 1913 and worked in Vladimir Tatlin's studio together with Popova, Vesnin, and others. Cubism and Cubo-Futurism Typewriter Girl, 1910s Udaltsova's professional debut was as a participant in a Jack of Diamonds exhibition in Moscow in the winter of 1914. But it was in 1915 that she really made her name as a Cubist artist, participating in three major exhibitions in that single year, including \\"Tramway V\\" (February), \\"Exhibition of Leftist Tendencies\\" (April), and \\"The Last Futurist Exhibition: 0.10\\" (December). Her paintings were subsequently collected and exhibited in the 1920s by the Tretiakov Gallery, the Russian Museum, and other venues as examples of Cubo-Futurism. Suprematism Under the influence of Tatlin, Udaltsova experimented with Constructivism, but eventually embraced the more painterly approach of the Suprematist movement. In 1916, she participated with other Suprematist artists in a Jack of Diamonds exhibition, and during that same time period she joined Kazimir Malevich's Supremus group. In 1915‚Äì1916, together with other suprematist artists (Kazimir Malevich, Aleksandra Ekster, Liubov Popova, Nina Genke, Olga Rozanova, Ivan Kliun, Ivan Puni, Ksenia Boguslavskaya and others) worked at the Verbovka Village Folk Centre.Malevich, by Gerry Souter, page 176 Revolution Like many of her avant-garde contemporaries, Udaltsova embraced the October Revolution. In 1917, she was elected to the Club of the Young Leftist Federation of the Professional Union of Artists and Painters and began work in various state cultural institutions, including the Moscow Proletkult. In 1918, she joined the Free State Studios, first working as Malevich's assistant, and then heading up her own studio. She also collaborated with Aleksei Gan, Aleksei Morgunov, Aleksandr Rodchenko and Malevich on a newspaper entitled Anarkhiia (Anarchy). In 1919, Udaltsova contributed eleven works from the time she was working in Tatlin's studio to the \\"Fifth State Exhibition.\\" She also married her second husband, the painter Alexander Drevin. When Vkhutemas, the Russian state art and technical school, was established in 1920, she was appointed professor and senior lecturer and would remain on staff until 1934. In 1920 she also became a member of the Institute for Artistic Culture (InKhuK) and actively participated in discussions there on the fate of easel art. However, when the Institute endorsed Constructivism and declared the end of easel painting, she resigned her membership in protest in 1921. Fauvism and a return to the figurative In the early 1920s, Udaltsova's work began to show a turn away from the radical avant-garde and a sensibility more aligned with artists associated with the Jack of Diamonds, among them Ilya Mashkov, Petr Konchalovsky and Aristarkh Lentulov, exhibiting her Fauvist portraits and landscapes alongside them at the Vkhutemas \\"Exhibition of Paintings\\" of 1923 and also at the Venice \\"Biennale\\" of 1924. She also continued to teach, including instruction in textile design at Vhkutemas and the Textile Institute in Moscow from 1920 until 1930. Under the influence of Drevin, Udaltsova returned to nature and began painting landscapes. Between 1926 and 1934 they traveled widely, painting the Ural and Altai Mountains, as well as landscapes in Armenia and Central Asia. From 1927 to 1935, she contributed to national and international exhibitions and participated with Drevin in joint exhibitions at the Russian Museum (1928) and in Erevan, Armenia (1934). Repression and rehabilitation In 1932‚Äì33, Udaltsova's contributions to the exhibition of \\"Artists of the RSFSR Over the Last Fifteen Years\\" were publicly criticized for so-called \\"formalist tendencies.\\" In 1938 Alexander Drevin was arrested and executed by the NKVD, and Udaltsova became a persona non grata in the world of Soviet art. She was allowed a solo exhibition at the Moscow Union of Soviet Artists in 1945, and after Stalin's death, she contributed to a group exhibition at Moscow's House of the Artist in October 1958. Udaltsova died in 1961 in Moscow.The Magical Chorus: A History of Russian Culture from Tolstoy to Solzhenitsyn, by Solomon Volkov, page 70 Influence The Udaltsova crater on Venus is named after her.

While intended to discover digital identity services, Yadis is not restricted to those. Other services can easily be included. A Yadis ID can either be a traditional URL or a newer XRI i-name, where the i-name must resolve to a URL. The so-called Yadis URL either equals the Yadis ID (if this is a URL) or the resolved URL of the XRI i-name. Furthermore, Yadis specifies how to use the Yadis URL to retrieve a service descriptor called Yadis Resource Descriptor. This descriptor follows the XRDS format and connects several services, like authentication or authorization to the Yadis URL. Each service description can have further parameters.  Modular architecture  Yadis follows the REST-ful, \\"small pieces loosely joined\\" paradigm that has proven to be successful in the development of the web. The basic assumption is that identities can be addressed with URLs or with other identifiers (such as XRI i-names) that can be resolved to URLs. Yadis then associates an XRDS document (an XML-based capability file) with each URL that expresses the associated capabilities or services. The owner of a Yadis identifier can choose which services he wishes to use in his XRDS document. After retrieving this document, a relying party such as a website accepting Yadis identifiers can select an appropriate services of the XRDS document, e.g. a protocol to use for authentication. This can allow existing web sites, like blogs, to easily implement basic Yadis functionality (for instance, redirecting users who arrive at a blog to relevant information about the person the blog belongs to) while also making it possible to build more advanced applications (for example, allowing complex queries of a site-owner's information to be submitted directly to the Yadis site).  Discovery of the Yadis Resource Descriptor  The capability document associated with an identity URL is found either: # By following a custom HTTP response header called \`X-XRDS-Location\`, # By an equivalent entry in the HTML HEAD section, called \`<meta http-equiv=\\"X-XRDS-Location\\" content=\\"http://example.com/yadis.xml\\">\`, or # By requesting a special mime type called \`application/xrds+xml\` when performing an HTTP GET on the identity URL. Developers can choose which of the alternatives to implement, based on factors such as whether they can run software at the identity URL or not.  XRDS documents  Here is an example XRDS capability document: http://openid.net/signon/1.0 http://www.myopenid.com/server http://smoker.myopenid.com/ http://openid.net/signon/1.0 http://www.livejournal.com/openid/server.bml http://www.livejournal.com/users/frank/ http://lid.netmesh.org/sso/2.0 http://mylid.net/liddemouser http://lid.netmesh.org/sso/1.0 If this XRDS document was returned, using one of the listed mechanisms, for a URL, it would express the following information: * The URL is a Yadis identity URL. * This URL supports the OpenID protocol, through two servers and two delegates. * This URL supports version 1.0 and version 2.0 of the LID protocol, with a delegate. * The owner of this identity URL prefers to sign-on using their LiveJournal account and the OpenID protocol (priority 10). If that is not possible (e.g. because a relying party does not support OpenID, or because the LiveJournal server is unavailable), the owner would like to use the LID URL http://mylid.net/liddemouser (priority 20), followed by the MyOpenID service (priority 50).  LID, OpenID and the developer community  Yadis was initiated by developers of the Light-Weight Identity (LID) and OpenID protocols. This collaboration was then joined by members of the OASIS XRI Technical Committee, particularly those working on i-names. However, Yadis is an open initiative, so other developers will start using XRDS lightweight capabilities description, making possible a \\"mix and match\\" approach to building Yadis-enabled applications, enabling application developers to choose their own balance between ease of implementation on one hand, and range of features on the other.

He has been involved in all aspects of the music industry as manager-director, record label owner, reporter, chief editor, radio and TV program director. In 1998, Despot received recognition from the Croatian government as one of top private entrepreneurs in the country. Despot was born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and since 1950 has lived in Zagreb, Croatia, where his father was a respected businessman. His mother, Mirjana, studied cello at the Zagreb Conservatory under Italian cellist Antonio Janigro and later taught many cellists herself. Career Despot's career began at the age of 18 in local press (\\"Plavi vjesnik\\") reporting from London on swinging sixties and trilling pop and rock scene. He was the first journalist from former Yugoslavia who specialized in covering international popular music, and was the first and only East European journalist to interview The Beatles. This interview was published as one of his first articles, in \\"Plavi vjesnik\\" (17 April 1967). In the late sixties, Despot's articles appeared in several Croatian publications, including Arena, Studio, and Vjesnik, interviewing artists such as Pink Floyd, The Hollies, Bee Gees, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Marc Bolan, and The Who. Despot attended recording sessions of The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (London, 1967), Rolling Stones' Let It Bleed (London, 1969), Pink Floyd's Ummagumma (London, 1969) and Arsen Dediƒá's Homo volans (Zagreb, 1973). Veljko Despot (left) and George Harrison at the Abbey Road Studios in London, 1967 In 1967, Despot was part of the very first record producer agreement in Yugoslav recording industry history, producing an EP release for the Slovenian rock group Kameleoni. In 1968 he produced their soundtrack for the film \\"Sonƒçni krik\\" (\\"Sunny Cry\\") by director Bo≈°tjan Hladnik. In 1968 Despot founded the Jugoslavenski Beatles Fan Club/The Yugoslav Beatles Fan Club in Zagreb, a branch of The Official Beatles Fan Club which covered most East European countries. He was also co-founder and on the board of editors of the Zagreb \\"Pop Express\\" (1969‚Äì1970), one of the first music newspapers in Yugoslavia. Since 1971, he has also contributed to New Musical Express. Since 1968, Despot has continued to contribute as a freelance music journalist on radio stations, and since 1972 on the Yugoslavian Radio Television (Jugoslavenska radiotelevizija or Jugoslovenska radio-televizija, JRT), on Croatian Radio Television and subnational radio and TV centers based in Belgrade, Ljubljana and Sarajevo. Throughout the seventies, eighties and nineties Despot had numerous music reports on television, interviews, portraits and special programs, all concerning international popular music. In the mid-seventies he brought the first music videos on Yugoslav television, and in the eighties he introduced Yugoslavia's first music advertising on national TV. In 1974, Despot established an international department for Jugoton, acquiring major license deals for the company and working with artists, managers, publishers, and record company executives for their product releases in the territory of former Yugoslavia. From the seventies through the beginning of the nineties, Jugoton had license for several international artists and had exclusive deals with many international record companies, such as EMI, Warner Music, BMG, Decca, Island, Chrysalis, Virgin, Motown and many more. Despot edited record albums as well, editing Bijelo dugme in 1975 for \\"≈†ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu\\" and in 1976 for \\"Eto! Ba≈° hoƒáu\\". Both albums were recorded in Air Studios, London and produced by Neil Harrison. Veljko Despot and Tina Turner in Graz, 1985 Despot helped bring to Yugoslavia many important artists, like Deep Purple in 1975, The Rolling Stones (1976), Paul McCartney & Wings (1976), Queen (1979), Elton John (1984), Dire Straits (1985), Laurie Anderson (1990), Eros Ramazzotti (1990, 1994), Pet Shop Boys (1991), David Bowie (1990, 1996, 1997) and many more. For many of these artists it was their first visit in East Europe. In 1991 after Croatia became independent from the former Yugoslavia, Jugoton became Croatia Records. Despot remained with the company until 1994, when he established his own record company Koncept VD, a label exclusively representing BMG Music, MCA, Geffen Records and GRP Records repertoire in new states in the former Yugoslavia. The label signed domestic artists as well, such as Croatian singer-songwriter Arsen Dediƒá, and the Soul Fingers from Zagreb. Their albums on Koncept label won the Porin music award for best releases in Croatia, an award which Despot helped to originate as one of founding members of the Croatian Phonographic Association. The Porin was established in 1993 for outstanding achievements in the Croatian recording industry. Veljko Despot in Rovinj In 1999, Despot created Simbol Music, a consulting company that assists music artists and labels. In 2000 and 2001, he also created the Cantus label (a record division of the Croatian Composers' Society, HDS). He added Croatian artists such as Tony Cetinski, Goran Karan, Matija Dediƒá, and Tamara Obrovac. Their albums have won many Porin awards as well. In 2001, Despot contracted with the Neweurope Corporation (NEC) in Florida, a private corporation with a \\"Click- Media-Mortar\\" business model centered around the New Europe theme. NEC targets over 28 million first- and second-generation Europeans living in the United States and millions of American fans of European music, screening European recording artists' songs and videos, as well as European TV programs, for marketing in the United States. Despot is now a corporate partner as the Director of Neweurope Media & Entertainment Center (NEMEC). Since 1993, Despot has been a member of The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in the United States and since 2000 is also a member of The Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences.

Ximenes, a Mexican American and American G.I. Forum charter member, to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1966. Garcia was named as alternate representative to the United Nations in 1967, was appointed to the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 1968, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 1984; and was named to the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II in 1990. In 1998, he was posthumously awarded the Aguila Azteca, Mexico's highest award for foreigners, in a ceremony in Corpus Christi. Early life A descendant of Spanish land grantees, Dr. Garc√≠a was born in the city of Llera, Tamaulipas, M√©xico, to Jos√© Garc√≠a and Faustina P√©rez Garc√≠a, both school teachers. His family fled the violence of the Mexican Revolution in 1917, legally immigrating to Mercedes, Texas.

Both parents instilled a love and respect for education in all of their children and expected them all to become medical doctors. Hector and five of his siblings: Jos√© Antonio Garc√≠a, Clotilde P√©rez Garc√≠a, Cuitl√°huac P√©rez Garc√≠a, Xicotenc√°tl P√©rez Garc√≠a, and Dalia Garc√≠a-Malison did become physicians. In 1929, Garcia joined the Citizens Military Training Corps, a peacetime branch of the United States Army for youths. He graduated from a segregated high school in 1932. That year he earned a commission from the CMTC with a rank equivalent to a second lieutenant in the U.S. infantry. He began attending Edinburg Junior College, to and from which he had to hitchhike thirty miles daily. His father had to cash in his life insurance policy to finance young Hector's education. In 1932, Garc√≠a entered the University of Texas at Austin, graduating with a degree in zoology. He was one of the top five of his class. He went on to study at the University of Texas at Galveston, earning his doctorate in medicine in 1940. He accomplished his residency at St. Joseph's Hospital at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska in 1942. He earned a degree of zoology from the University of Texas in Austin. Army career Upon completing his internship in 1942, Garc√≠a was called to active duty in the army, as the United States had entered World War II. He was placed in command of a company of infantry. Later, he commanded a company of combat engineers before being transferred to the medical corps. He was stationed in Europe, and eventually rose to the rank of major. He earned the Bronze Star Medal, the European African Middle Eastern Medal with six bronze stars, and the World War II Victory Medal. While in Italy, he met and fell in love with Wanda Fusillo of Naples, whom he married in 1945. Life after the war In 1945, with the war over, Dr. Garc√≠a returned to Southern Texas with his wife Wanda, settling in Corpus Christi. Their first child Daisy Wanda was born in 1946. The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) had been formed in the city seven years previously by Hispanic veterans to defend the rights of Hispanic- American citizens. Garcia opened a private medical practice with his brother Jos√© Antonio; they treated all patients regardless of their ability to pay. In 1947, Hector Garcia was elected president of the local chapter of LULAC. In the same year he was hospitalized with life-threatening acute nephritis. While recuperating, he heard the local superintendent of the school district talking about the racial segregation in his district. Southern states had established a binary system, classifying all people as mainly either black or white, or Hispanic in some states like Texas, and segregating public facilities by race. At that moment, he made a private oath that if he recovered, he would dedicate his life to gaining the equality of his people. Founding of the American G.I. Forum After being discharged from the hospital, Garcia began helping other Mexican-American veterans file claims with the Veteran's Administration. He helped veterans to obtain services from the VA since the administration was slow to respond to the Hispanic-American veterans' needs. In 1948, he began an investigation of conditions for migrant laborers in Mathis, Texas. He found the impoverished workers to be ill-clothed, malnourished, and diseased from lack of basic sanitation. On March 26 of the same year, he called a meeting to address the concerns of Mexican-American veterans. This meeting was a catalyst for developing the American G.I. Forum, which soon had chapters in 40 Texas cities. It became the primary vehicle by which Mexican-American veterans expressed their discontent with the official discrimination against them and asserted their right to equality. They chose this name to emphasize that the Forum's participants were American citizens entitled to their constitutional rights. Later, the Forum's patriotism would exempt them from FBI infiltration at a time when the agency accused many Mexican-American organizations of having Marxist sympathies. F√©lix Longoria In 1945, a Japanese sniper killed Mexican-American private F√©lix Longoria in the Philippines. His body was returned to Texas in 1949. His widow's request to use the funeral chapel in Three Rivers was denied, as the funeral director claimed that \\"the whites won't like it.\\" Dr. Garc√≠a and the G.I. Forum intervened, petitioning freshman US Senator Lyndon B. Johnson for redress of the outrage. Johnson secured Longoria's burial in Arlington National Cemetery, where he became the first Mexican American to be awarded this honor. When New York Times reported on the case, it gained national attention, and the G.I. Forum was propelled to the forefront of the movement for civil rights. Following this incident, the G.I. Forum expanded into the states of New Mexico and Colorado. The American G.I. Forum and American politics The American G.I. Forum became a recognized voice for Mexican Americans in the post-World War II era. Besides providing veterans with a social and political network, the forum took pragmatic actions: it raised funds to pay for poll taxes for the indigent, so they did not have a barrier to voting. It campaigned against the Bracero Program, which had recruited migrant laborers during the war years and was known for discriminatory abuses. Dr. Garc√≠a testified before the National Advisory Committee on Farm Labor, asserting that \\"The migrant problem is not only a national emergency, it has become a national shame on the American conscience.\\" This work brought him into contact with such national political figures as Hubert Humphrey, Arthur Goldberg and George McGovern. The organization, and the attention it drew to poverty and discrimination in Texas, also got the attention of Look magazine. It published an article on the high rates of diphtheria, infant diarrhea, and tuberculosis suffered by the neglected community. Garcia also worked to bring national attention to the conditions of schools for children in South Texas. In 1950, he wrote a request to the State Department of Health, expressing concerns about sanitation and mandating inspection to prevent disease or epidemics. Garcia also voiced his opposition to segregation of schools and discrimination in the classroom. Many Anglos expressed opposition towards Garcia and felt threatened by the work of the GI Forum. One hostile letter threatened Garcia, comparing him to Joseph Stalin, head of the Soviet Union, and saying that Texans should \\"drive [him] back to Mexico.\\" In 1953, the G.I. Forum published its own study, \\"What Price Wetbacks\\", on the issues related to farm labor in South Texas. They invited Senator Lyndon Johnson to speak at their statewide convention. In 1954, attorneys funded by the G.I. Forum and LULAC argued and won Hernandez v. Texas in the Supreme Court of the United States. The decision, one of the Warren court's first, threw out the plaintiff's murder conviction on the grounds that he had not had a jury of his peers. Court records showed that no one with a Spanish surname had served on a jury in the county for twenty-five years. In Brown v. the Board of Education (1954), the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. LULAC and the G.I. Forum mounted litigation challenges in Texas to ensure that the ruling was applied to gain integrated education for Mexican-American citizens. They took cases to the Texas Supreme Court challenging the practices of independent school districts in Driscoll, Carrizo Springs, and Kingsville. In 1960, Dr. Garc√≠a became national coordinator of the Viva Kennedy! clubs, organized to elect Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) as president. Garcia is credited with delivering 85% of the Hispanic vote to the Democratic party in that close election. The civil rights agenda of the Forum, however, was not at the forefront of the Kennedy administration's platform. Dr. Garc√≠a and his supporters had to accept his appointment in 1962 as representative of the United States in mutual defense treaty talks with the Federation of West Indies Islands. The appointment was notable as the first instance that a Mexican American had represented an American president, and talks were successful. After Kennedy was assassinated, VP Lyndon Johnson succeeded to the presidency. He appointed Garc√≠a as Presidential Representative, with the rank of Special Ambassador, to the presidential inauguration ceremonies of Dr. Ra√∫l Leoni in Venezuela. In 1966, through the efforts of the Forum and other groups, the state legislature voted to repeal the Texas poll tax, which had been a barrier to voting by poor people. The forum also undertook a march on the Texas state capital to protest the low wages of Mexican agricultural laborers. In 1967, President Johnson appointed Dr. Garc√≠a as alternate representative, with the full rank of Ambassador to the United Nations. He was tasked with improving US relations with Latin American nations. Garcia made history on October 26, when he addressed the UN in Spanish; he was the first United States representative to speak before the U.N. in a language other than English. Starting in 1968, Dr. Garc√≠a and other members of the G.I. Forum began accompanying families of fallen soldiers to the airport to collect their sons' bodies when they were returned from Vietnam. He would often eulogize the soldier, and never refused a request to speak at any funeral. In the same year, President Johnson appointed Garcia to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. In 1972, Dr. Garc√≠a was arrested at a sit-in protest of the de facto segregation in Corpus Christi school district. He consulted with President Carter several times during the 1970s. In 1987, he became involved in the struggle against the campaign to Designated English as the only official language of the United States; the rate of Hispanic and Latino immigration to the country had increased, bringing many new Spanish speakers. His final project was to improve the standard of living in the colonias in the Rio Grande Valley along the United States‚ÄìMexico border. Death Garcia died July 26, 1996 in Corpus Christi, Texas at age 82. He was buried at Seaside Memorial Park in Corpus Christi. President Bill Clinton presented a eulogy for him. Honors and awards Dr. Garc√≠a received numerous awards from various governments and other organizations during his lifetime. They include: *The U.S. Army's Bronze Star Medal, the European African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with six bronze stars, and the World War II Victory Medal, 1942‚Äì1946 *The American G.I. Forum's Medalla al Merito, 1952, for his work with Mexican- American veterans *National Coordinator and National Organizer of the \\"Viva Kennedy\\" clubs, 1960. *Representative of President John F.

As a figure of national and international prominence, the effects of his life have been felt at all levels of society, from the poor barrios that he fought to improve, to the highest echelons of government. The end of the 1950s desegregated Texan hotels, cinemas, and restaurants. Beauty parlors and barbershops were desegregated in the 1960s, with cemeteries and swimming pools not being opened to Mexican Americans until the 1970s. In the realm of popular culture, in 1950, Pulitzer Prize winner Edna Ferber interviewed Garcia to get a sense of the Mexican American experience in Texas. She later wrote the 1952 novel Giant, basing some of the incidents in the work on her interview. The book was later turned into a 1956 film starring James Dean, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, and Dennis Hopper. In 1985, the Dr. H√©ctor P√©rez Garc√≠a Endowed Chair was created at Yale University. In 1988, the main branch of the Corpus Christi post office was renamed in his honor. In 1996, a nine-foot statue of him was dedicated at Texas A&M;'s Corpus Christi campus. In 1999, his image was placed on the U.S. Treasury's $75 I Bond series honoring great Americans. In 2002, public television station KEDT in Corpus Christi, Texas produced a documentary on him entitled \\"Justice for my People: The Dr. Hector P. Garcia Story\\". The program was broadcast nationally on PBS. Under Senate Bill 495, signed on May 30, 2009 by the Governor of Texas, The State of Texas established the third Wednesday of each September as \\"Dr. Hector P. Garcia Texas State Recognition Day.\\" In April, 2010 the United States House of Representatives passed H.CON.RES.222, recognizing the leadership and historical contributions of Dr. Hector Garcia to the Hispanic community and his remarkable efforts to combat racial and ethnic discrimination in the United States of America.

It is part of the Louros municipal unit. It is built upon the mountain Baldenezi, at 500 meters above sea level. Skiadas took that name because according to the Greek mythology the Greek God of the dead, Hades, would sometimes come out of his underworld (which its supposed entrance is only a few miles away from Skiadas at the nearby Serziana village) to seek for some daily light. But because he was sensitive to sun light, he preferred to stay near Skiadas where sun does not shine before 11 AM and there is plenty of shadow (because of a high mountain in front of the village). \\"Skiadas\\" means \\"the shadow of Hades\\" (in Greek: Œ£Œ∫ŒπŒ¨ œÑŒøœÖ ŒÜŒ¥Œ∑). During the Greek enslavement by the Turkish Empire, Skiadas and its surrounding villages have seen very little of the burden, as Skiadas is part of the Souli valley which resisted the Turkish rule for hundreds of years by brewing many local fighting heroes. Skiadas currently has fewer than 40 inhabitants, but only a few years ago it could measure up to 400.

Stewart catalog The Banjeaurine, also known as Banjourine or Banjorine, was a variant of the banjo, designed to play lead instrument in banjo orchestras from the 1890s to the 1930s. They have shorter necks than traditional 5-string banjos, and are tuned a 4th higher, in C. There were normally 2 of these instruments in a banjo orchestra. A banjo manufacturer named Samuel Swaim Stewart, also called S.S., invented the banjeaurine. From Philadelphia, Stewart advertised the banjeaurine and this instrument became a critical part of banjo orchestras. The banjeaurine first hit the music scene in 1885, played before the public by William A Huntley. In banjo orchestras, the banjeaurine was responsible for the majority of the solos in musical pieces. The banjeaurine has a short neck with a scale between 19\\" and 20\\", a fretboard extension that is cantilevered over the head, and either 17 or 19 frets. It is a higher pitched version of the conventional 5 string banjo. Most banjorines, especially early ones, have 12\\" to 12-1/2\\" diameter rims. Later models may have 11\\" rims, a size that became a standard banjo rim size during the late 1920s. The body has a top made out of skin or synthetic, and usually an open back without a resonator. The banjeaurine has five strings. One is shorter than the others, and is called the fifth string, or thumb string. The concept of the banjeaurine is similar to that of other banjo family instruments. Banjeaurines were most notably constructed by S.S. Stewart, but were offered by most major banjo manufacturers, including Washburn, Fairbanks, Fairbanks & Cole, Cole, Vega, Weyman, Schall, Thompson & Odell, Kraske, Lyon & Healy, and many others. 1892 Washburn catalog ReferencesExternal links *https://web.archive.org/web/20100306010853/http://www.banjoorchestra.org/history.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20090207003442/http://www.classicbanjo.com/instruments.php *https://web.archive.org/web/20100926133227/http://irish- banjo.com/instruments/five-string-banjo/banjeaurine/index.html Category:Banjo family instruments A Fairbanks #3 Electric Banjorine, 1891 (center).

Yes‚Äìno interrogatives Yes‚Äìno questions are formed with the interrogative ƒâu \\"whether\\" at the beginning of the clause. For example, the interrogative equivalent of the statement La pomo estas sur la tablo \\"The apple is on the table\\" is ƒàu la pomo estas sur la tablo? \\"Is the apple on the table?\\" A yes‚Äìno question is also normally accompanied by a rising intonation. In some cases, especially when the context makes it clear that the sentence is an interrogative, a rising intonation alone can make a clause into a question, but this is uncommon and highly marked. The subject and the verb are not inverted to form questions as in English and many other European languages. Correlative interrogatives Esperanto has a series of words that can be arranged in a table according to how they start and end. These are usually called correlatives. The column of words that begin with ki- can be used to ask questions that cannot be answered by yes or no. These correspond to wh-questions in English. These words are: * kiu - who or which * kio - what * kia - what kind of * kie - where * kiam - when * kies - whose * kiel - how * kial - why * kiom - how much or how many These words are inflected according to the role they play in the clause (for the words that take an inflection), and moved to the beginning of the clause. For example, Kion vi faras? - What are you doing? Kiu has the usual dual function of adjectives: standing alone as proform, or modifying a noun, as in \\"Kiu tago?\\" (which day?). Tio is exclusively used standing alone. As with yes‚Äìno questions, there is no inversion of subject and verb, and the sentence is generally ended with a rising intonation in the spoken language. Indirect questions As explained above, any interrogative clause can be used as-is as an indirect question, e.g. as the object of a verb like scii, to know: * Mi ne scias, ƒâu la pomo estas sur la tablo. - I don't know whether the apple is on the table. * Li scias, kion vi faras. - He knows what you are doing. Ambiguity Because the correlatives that begin with ki- are also used to form relative clauses (similarly to many European languages) there is in theory a potential for ambiguity between indirect questions and relative clauses. In practice, however, confusion is very rare.

Presented by Mike Murphy, the show usually consisted of a serious discussion, comedy contributions by Dermot Morgan, and a candid camera segment of unsuspecting members of the public, including a famous prank played on broadcaster Gay Byrne. The candid camera scenes invariably ended with the host saying \\"I'm Mike Murphy from RT√â\\", which virtually became a catchphrase. =Final show= The programme ran for three series and ended in 1982. On the last show, Murphy caused consternation when he told viewers that the show would not be returning. This was Murphy's decision and had not been discussed with any of the senior management at the station. Many thought that this incident would result in the death of Murphy's career. However, he remained with the station for the next twenty years. Murphy said in an interview in 2006 that he had decided to end the show when, after the second season ended in 1981, a number of crew members had left, and that the show was no longer as fun to make as it had previously been.

His most familiar work is probably his portrait of Alexander Pushkin (1827), which prompted the poet to remark that \\"the mirror flatters me\\".  Biography  Orest was born in the village of Nezhnovo in the Saint Petersburg Governorate on . He was an illegitimate son of a landowner Alexey Dyakonov, hence his name, derived from Kypris, one of the Greek names for the goddess of love. He was raised in the family of Adam Shvalber, a serf. Although Kiprensky was born a serf, he was released from the serfdom upon his birth and later his father helped him to enter a boarding school at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg in 1788 (when Orest was only six years old). He studied at the boarding school and the Academy itself until 1803. He lived at the Academy for three more years as a pensioner to fulfill requirements necessary to win the Major Gold medal. Winning the first prize for his work Prince Dmitri Donskoi after the Battle of Kulikovo (1805) enabled the young artist to go abroad to study art in Europe. A year before his graduation, in 1804, he painted the portrait of Adam Shvalber, his foster father (1804), which was a great success. The portrait so impressed his contemporaries, that later members of the Naples Academy of Arts took it for the painting by some Old Master ‚Äì Rubens or van Dyck. Kiprensky had to ask the members of the Imperial Academy of Arts for letters supporting his authorship. After that, Kiprensky lived in Moscow (1809), Tver 1811, Saint Petersburg 1812, in 1816‚Äì1822 he lived in Rome and Napoli. In Italy he met a local girl Anna Maria Falcucci (Mariucci), to whom he became attached. He bought her from her dissolute family and employed as his ward. On leaving Italy, he sent her to a Roman Catholic convent. In 1828, Kiprensky came back to Italy, as he got a letter from his friend Samuel Halberg, informing him that they had lost track of Mariucci. Kiprensky found Mariucci, who had been transferred to another convent. In 1836 he eventually married her. He had to convert into Roman Catholicism from Russian Orthodoxy for this marriage to happen. He died by pneumonia in Rome later that year. He is buried in the church of Sant'Andrea delle Fratte.

It is the home stadium of local football team Atl√©tico Junior. It was built with a capacity of 46,692 for the Colombian World Cup bid in 1986. The stadium was inaugurated that year with a game between Uruguay and Junior, which the Uruguayans won 2‚Äì1. It is the second largest stadium in Colombia. The first official name of the stadium was Estadio Metropolitano, which was changed around 1991 in order to honor the Colombian footballer Roberto Mel√©ndez. This is the official stadium for the national football team of Colombia. History Before the construction of Estadio Metropolitano, the city only had the Romelio Mart√≠nez Stadium, which was built in 1934 with a capacity of 10,000 spectators. Since the advent of professional football to Barranquilla in 1948, it became evident the need for a sports arena that would house the football fans. In the early 1970s, the expansion of the Romelio Mart√≠nez Stadium was projected with the construction of new bleachers for the sports arena. However, an architectural error would force the reduction of the 72nd Street to complete the works. After some time it was decided to demolish the new forum yet unfinished in the midst of strong criticism, which the local press called the Gallery of Shame. Due to the large amount of money being spent on this project, it failed because subsequent studies showed the impossibility of conducting a proper extension to the scenario, it was decided that the best solution was to design an entirely new football stadium for the city. In 1979, the governor of the department of Atl√°ntico, Pedro Mart√≠n Leyes presented President Julio C√©sar Turbay the project to build a new stadium in Barranquilla, supported the idea of doing a host of World Cup 1986 to be held in Colombia. The project is approved and the foundation stone for the building is placed on December 7 of 1979 in an area of 30 hectares, located on the avenue Circunvalar with Murillo Street, donated by the Instituto de Cr√©dito Territorial (Inscredial). For its construction the firm Metrof√∫tbol was formed, led by architect Jaime de Biasse. Jos√© Francisco Ramos was appointed as architect of the stadium, awarding construction to engineer Julio Gerlein and electrical Engineer Luis Gonzalo Prada Ch. Inauguration The construction of Estadio Metropolitano lasted six years, after which a grand opening was held on May 11, 1986 with a folk show in which 5,000 artists, an awards ceremony for VIPs Sport Colombia, a giant ball that left 200 white doves and the holding of an international friendly match. The opening match was played between the teams Junior and Uruguay national team, led by coach Omar Borr√°s, which was preparing for 1986 FIFA World Cup. The match ended with Uruguay's victory 1-2, goals scored by Enzo Francescoli (the first goal scored in the stadium at 62 minutes) and Jorge da Silva for the visitors and Jos√© \\"Perilla\\" Angulo for the locals, all goals scored in the second half. The first red card was for Uruguayan player Walter Barrios at 87 minutes. Four days later, another match was held against Argentina national team during their tour in preparation for the same event, which ended up winning the future world championship. Events This stadium was one of the venues where Colombian National Games in 1992 were contested. Hosted the 2001 Copa Am√©rica including the opening ceremony with a colourful parade and a show dance. The venue held six matches in Group A which included the national teams of Colombia, Venezuela, Chile and Ecuador, between July 11 and 17.

In 2011, the stadium was one of eight stadiums that hosted matches during the FIFA U-20 World Cup, including the opening ceremony. The stadium has also hosted numerous concerts of various artists such as REO Speedwagon, Franco De Vita, Shakira, Juanes and Carlos Vives. On June 27, 2019, the stadium was announced as the venue to host the 2021 Copa Am√©rica Final. The announcement was made by Ernesto Lucena, Director of Coldeportes.

By winning 15 major titles he is one of the most successful association football coaches in the history of the game. In 2019, France Football ranked him at No. 43 on their list of the Top 50 football managers of all time. Career Born into an ethnic Hungarian family in Timi»ôoara, Romania, Kov√°cs was an average midfielder, although having both individual technique and tactical intuition. He was never selected to play for Romania unlike his older brother Nicolae Kov√°cs, who was one of the five players who participated at all three World Cups before the Second World War. Kov√°cs had his first major coaching successes at the helm of Steaua Bucure»ôti, where he won between 1967 and 1971 once the championship and three times the cup of Romania. After this he succeeded Rinus Michels as the head of Ajax in 1971, continuing and expanding on his \\"total football\\" philosophy. With Ajax he achieved in 1972 and 1973, two consecutive European Champions Cups. In 1972, he even won the Intercontinental Cup and also the first edition of European Supercup (1973). Further to that he led Ajax to the double of cup and championship in 1972 and another national championship in 1973. After he left Ajax in 1973, he was called up by the French football federation to take the reins of the national side. In this position he raised the young generations of French talents. Journalists of France Football asked him when he arrived how long it would take to make the France team a great team, he replied visionary with structures in eight years, ten years, we can make a good national team. Michel Hidalgo, his deputy and successor, took advantage of this work and continued to lead the team of France to its victory at Euro 84. Kov√°cs remains the only foreign manager of the French national side. After this episode, he returned to Romania becoming its national team coach. Later he had further successes with Panathinaikos and Monaco. He died on 12 May 1995, twelve days before Ajax won their fourth European Cup.

As many public bodies in Scotland (for example, educational bodies) are controlled by the Scottish Parliament, the 2000 Act would not apply to them, and thus a second Act of the Scottish Parliament was required. The acts are very similar but not identical \\\\- the types of public bodies covered in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are also covered in Scotland - and the requirements are similar, though the Scottish Act has slightly stronger phrasing in favour of disclosing information. The 2000 Act does not extend to public bodies in the overseas territories or crown dependencies. Some of these have contemplated implementing their own legislation, though none is currently in force. History FOI legislation in the UK is the result of a series of incremental reforms. The 1966 Fulton report recommended the elimination of 'unnecessary secrecy.' The 1974 Labour manifesto promised a future FOI Act and the repeal of the 1911 Official Secrets Act. In 1977, a draft \\"Freedom of Information and Privacy Bill\\" was circulated; this was shorter and simpler than the later Acts, and also included privacy legislation. Later versions were occasionally suggested by opposition parties, and it became a manifesto commitment for the Labour Party at the 1997 general election. This promised to introduce some form of freedom of information legislation in line with other western nations. A schedule for compliance was arranged at the time of the 2000 Act, and then for the 2002 Act, with timescales arranged so that both would come into full force on the same date - 1 January 2005. This reduced confusion and ambiguities, but the delay in passing an Act in Scotland pushed back the final implementation by some time. As a result, a manifesto promise from the 1997 election was finally fulfilled just in time for the 2005 election. In 2007, the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill was introduced as a private members bill in the House of the Commons by the Conservative MP David Maclean. The bill proposed to exempt MPs and Peers from the provisions of the 2000 Act, but whilst it successfully completed its passage in the Commons,Houses of Parliament - Public Bills - Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2006-07 it failed to progress through the House of Lords after failing to find a sponsor.The Guardian - Bill curbing FoI fails to find sponsor in Lords See also * Freedom of information legislation * Campaign for Freedom of Information * Information Commissioner's Office * Scottish Information Commissioner ReferencesExternal links *Freedom of Information and Privacy Bill.

The reserve covers an area of over bound by the surrounding suburbs of Camp Hill, Coorparoo, Carina Heights and Mount Gravatt East. The site is popular with locals, with the reserve offering many sporting and recreational facilities. White Hill lies within the catchment area of Bulimba Creek. History The indigenous name for the area was Boolimba meaning place of magpie larks. Fijian cricketers posing with the Whites Hill tearooms in the background A Talbot touring car at Whites Hill in 1911 Aerial photography of Whites Hill tearooms on 20th April, 1936 Whites Hill is named after Robert (Bob) White, who, in 1873, acquired of land surrounding the elevation now known as Whites Hill. Halfway up the hill facing Coorparoo, the White family built their family home. In 1886, White installed a powerful telescope, which he allowed others to use. Later White built a road to the top of the summit and built a house with huge verandahs to take advantage of the views of Brisbane city. Soon, the house was opened to the public with tea and meals available. Alcohol was also available, albeit illegally and White was prosecuted in 1890 for \\"sly grog-selling\\". The grandeur of this house proved popular with the locals and was frequently used for group outings, such as church groups, sporting groups, and scientific conventions. Alcohol was not the only dispute that White had with the authorities. He had a long-running dispute in relation to the availability and condition of access roads to his property, a matter made more complicated by being within the jurisdictions of two local government authorities, Shire of Coorparoo and Bulimba Division which had to reach an agreement on the work and the division of the expenses. Later, a camera obscura was constructed. It projected the Brisbane skyline onto a horizontal, circular, slightly concave table about in diameter. This, as well as the installation of a music machine, made the house ideal for functions, with many weddings and parties taking place. Brisbane City Council sought to acquire the land for development in 1924, offering Bob White ‚Ç§22000 for its sale. He declined and lived out his days on the property. Upon his death in January 1927, the land was sold to the council for less than half the original offer. With clear views of the Greater Brisbane Area from its peak, Whites Hill became an ideal observation post during the Second World War and the army used the hill for training. The house remained on the land until 1964, where it was torn down after repeated acts of vandalism forced the council to condemn the residence. Soon after, the land was developed into a reserve. An area of land was set aside for a public park, which includes a playground area, barbecue and toilet facilities and a sizeable area of parkland. Further development from the 1980s to present day has seen sporting clubs for cricket, soccer and touch football become established within the reserve. Kilometres of walking track also snake through the reserve, most notably to a reconstructed lookout on Whites Hill that provides excellent views of the Brisbane CBD and the lookout on Sankey's Mountain that looks out towards the coast. The reserve was also the site of the Whites Hill Landfill and Recycling Facility, which closed in 1994 in favour of a larger facility in the Brisbane suburb of Chandler. Portions of the reserve near Pine Mountain have also been used as a quarry. Through community action however, much of that land has been rehabilitated. A whites family reunion is held every five years. Environment Whites Hill Reserve is characterised by a topographical ridge that extends from Pine Mountain through to Whites Hill (the highest elevation on the reserve at 120m). The reserve plays host to a range of local wildlife with a 1981 survey finding 58 species of bird, 1 of mammals and 4 species of reptiles. Today, there is also known to be a scattered koala population throughout the reserve. There are also echidnas, elf skinks and swamp wallabies. The reserve's vegetation consists of tallowwood, Grey Gum, Brush Box, Queensland Blue Gum and White Mahogany with small instances of Rainforest. The Brisbane City Council actively practices anti-bushfire methods, such as sacrificial back burning. This involves burning selected sections of bushland to inhibit the spread of potentially damaging fires in the event of an emergency. The reserve is also dotted with a number of fire trails. Facilities Whites Hill Reserve currently plays home to a number of sporting clubs and recreation facilities critical to servicing the demand in the local area. The Eastern Districts Junior Cricket Association has been based at Whites Hill for over 45 years though in practice since 7 August 2017 the cricket facilities including 4 cricket pitches (3 synthetic and 1 turf) as well as the Tom Lonegan Pavilion and practice nets have been successfully managed and maintained under sub-lease by the Holland Park Junior Cricket Club. In addition, The Holland Park Hawks lease two full size soccer pitches on site as well as a club house. There are also seven fully lit touch football fields located on the eastern side of Whites Hill managed by the Brisbane Metropolitan Touch Association, Australia's largest touch football affiliate. As Brisbane's only dedicated touch football facility, games are played 5 nights per week and the venue also hosts many large events including the Queensland All Schools each October. The reserve also features a number of barbecue areas and playgrounds, as well as several hundred square metres of cleared bushland.

It is situated on the A4080 road some 10 km south-east of Holyhead, and is on the Anglesey Coastal Path. From the clock at the centre of the village can be seen RAF Valley and Holyhead Mountain. The major towns of Holyhead and Llangefni and the city of Bangor are all within easy travelling distance. It is the most expensive place to live in Anglesey in terms of house prices. The village contains four caravan sites, three camp sites, holiday homes and bungalows, pubs, hotels, cafes, a new village hall, a chapel, residential homes, a school, a fire station, a convenience store and post office, a pharmacy and a fish and chip shop. It is served by Rhosneigr railway station. Etymology The name Rhosneigr is derived from Welsh. Rhos is a common prefix in Welsh place names, meaning 'moor' or 'moorland'. The second part of the name neigr, is less clear, but it is likely to derive from the personal name 'Yneigr'. Yneigr was the grandson of Cunedda Wledig, an important leader in the area in the fifth century. Little is known about Yneigr, or how the village came to be named in his honour. Governance Prior to the 2012 Anglesey electoral boundary changes an electoral ward in the same name existed, electing a county councillor to the Isle of Anglesey County Council. This ward had a population taken at the 2011 census of 1,008. A by-election took place in November 2010 following the resignation of Independent councillor (and former council leader) Phil Fowlie. The election was won by another Independent, Richard Dew. Since the 1995 elections the ward had been represented by Independent councillors representing the Llifon ward. The two present councillors are Richard Dew (Ind.) and Gwilym O. Jones (Ind.). Rhosneigr is in the community of Llanfaelog, which elects a community council. Leisure Recreational activities include: swimming, surfing, wind surfing, kite surfing, wakeboarding, shore and boat fishing, water skiing, golf, tennis and underwater diving. The village is home to Anglesey Golf Club. It has a number of beaches including: *'Traeth Crigyll' that stretches from Pwll Cwch to Ynys Wellt (leading then to Traeth Cymyran), sandy beaches interspersed by rocks and views of Snowdonia. It is popular with watersports enthusiasts, notably windsurfers and sailors. * 'Pwll Cwch' ‚Äì a small, rocky beach where boats and yachts stay overnight. *'Traeth Llydan' which runs from the Porth y Tywod to the south Rhosneigr, ranging from pebble shores to pristine sandy shores. It is perfect for canoeing, walking and surfing. Traeth Llydan is a regular Green Coast Award Winner and is backed by sand dunes. Llyn Maelog is around 65 acres in total with varying depth up to seven feet. It is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest. There is a good stock of fish in the lake including perch, bream, roach and pike. A large variety of birdlife inhabits the reedbeds. Grey heron, snipe, reed warblers, coots, mallard, shelducks etc. Black headed gulls nest on the small island. The lake is circled by public footpath and is popular with walkers. In 2011 it became the first lake in Wales to be classified as a village green. Maelog Lake Golf Club (now defunct) appeared prior to the First World War.

The population of the civil parish at the 2001 Census was 562, reducing to 445 at the 2011 Census. Located at the mouth of the River Aln, the village had a port supporting a small fishing industry and engaging in national and international trade. It was for a time a leading north-east centre for the export of grain and other foodstuffs, especially to London; and specialised in the import of timber and slate. These activities to some extent shaped the village, as granaries were constructed to store grain, and sawmills and a boatyard established to process wood and build ships. Port activities declined at the end of the 19th century, in part because of the deterioration of the port due to the shifting and silting of the river estuary, in part as trade transferred to the railways. A notable change in the course of the river during a violent storm in 1806 resulted in the loss of the remains of the village's original church and disruption to the functioning of the port and industries. With the coming of the railways, Alnmouth transformed into a coastal resort complete with one of the earliest English golf courses, a holiday camp, bathing houses, beach huts and spacious sea-view villas. In contemporary times, Alnmouth is a well conserved picturesque coastal resort and tourist attraction, lying within the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  History =Establishment and early history= Alnmouth was established as a village by William de Vesci, who was granted a charter in 1152 to hold court and establish a settlement on a spit of land in the manor of Lesbury. Eustace de Vesci was granted royal permission to establish a port and a Wednesday fish market in 1207 or 1208. What preceded the Norman village is less clear, although land at the mouth of the river is likely to have been used throughout antiquity, coastal plains being some of the first areas of recorded human settlement in Britain. A few flint tools from the Mesolithic period have been found, but no evidence has been found for the Neolithic period. A number of Bronze Age remains have been found including cist burials and a spear-head; and a presumed enclosure at the very north of the village is conjectured to be an Iron Age feature. No Roman remains have been discovered, but it appears likely that the estuary was known and presumably used by the Romans. Ptolemy, writing in the 2nd century CE notes the river Alaunus, and the much later Ravenna Cosmography notes a place-name of Alauna. Alnmouth harbour would have been useful to the Romans, both to support military campaigns and to facilitate trade, albeit the river is not navigable beyond Lesbury, upstream. There is speculation that Adtwifyrdi or Adtuifyrdi (\\"at the two fords\\"), the name used by the Venerable Bede, refers to the estuary of the River Aln. Here, according to Bede's account in Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, Book IV, ch. 28, Archbishop Theodore presided over a synod in 684 in the presence of King Ecgfrith of Northumbria, at which bishop Tunberht of Hexham was deposed and St Cuthbert elected Bishop of Lindisfarne.The Gentleman's Magazine, volume XXXVIII, 1852 page 500 from Google Book Search The name ‚ÄúAlnmouth‚Äù derives from the Old English m≈´√æa (mouth of river). =Port= oxbow meander to a straighter course Alnmouth's port, engaging in fishing and trade, has had a fitful 800-year documented history. The village was attacked and greatly depleted by the Scots in 1336. Further depredations were caused by the Black Death in 1348. The village was described as \\"depeopled\\" in 1597. A 1614 survey notes that the village was \\"in great ruin and decay\\", albeit somewhat improved. A 1567 survey established that 20 of the 60 households in Alnmouth were engaged in fishing. Prosperity seems to have improved in the 17th century, and in the 18th century trade as the port burgeoned. The most notable export from the port was grain. A major import of the time was guano from Peru, part of the larger pattern of agricultural improvement of the time. Other exports noted in this period are coal, and eggs, pork and pickled salmon for the London trade, and wool for the Yorkshire woolen industry. Imports mentioned include blue slate from Scotland and timber from Holland and Scandinavia. The grain trade gave rise to 16 granaries in the village, some of which were much later converted to residential use. The port also prospered as a shipbuilding centre, albeit on a modest scale. At its peak, around 1750, up to 18 vessels might be seen in the harbour at any one time. The reputation of the village was not high, though. John Wesley is famously reported to have described the place as \\"a small sea- port town, famous for all kinds of wickedness\\", and much earlier accounts speak of members of the community who added nothing to the commonwealth, and against whom all things must be secured lest they be stolen. A shift in the course of the river on Christmas Day 1806 was sometimes identified as a cause of the decline of the port. A violent storm breached the northern end of the Church Hill sandbank, allowing the river to divert away from a south-north meander to take a more direct course to the sea. The 19th century saw a decline in traffic at the port, falling off completely at the end of the century. =Resort= Alnmouth's Northumberland Street in the late 19th century. The same view in 2013. The effects of the port‚Äôs decline were offset by a new role for the village, as a holiday and second-home resort. With the coming of the railway to nearby Hipsburn in 1847( the station known then as Bilton junction then Alnmouth, now Alnmouth for Alnwick ), spacious villas with sea-views were built, granary buildings converted to residential use or demolished to make way for new cottages. Maps of 1897 show a holiday camp, garden tea-room and many beach-huts amongst the dunes. Heated baths were available by the village's gas station. A links golf course was established in 1869, the fourth oldest in England; it is believed that it was designed by Mungo Park who became the club's first professional.Alnmouth Golf Club website Gives details golf course history. Two lines of WW2 anti-tank cubes defend Alnmouth's north beach The early 19th century had seen trade at the port affected by the Napoleonic Wars and fear of French invasion persisted until late in the century. The Duke of Northumberland maintained an army, the Percy volunteers, against the threat, and a gun battery was installed overlooking Alnmouth in 1852. Similar invasion fears arose during World War II, and a variety of defences were installed on the south and north beaches at Alnmouth, including concrete anti-tank cubes, an anti-tank ditch, pill-boxes, reinforcement of the previous century's gun battery, and firing slits built into the walls of the Church Hill guano shed. Remains of many of these defences are evident today. Geography Alnmouth is a village on the north- east coast of England, some due north of Newcastle Upon Tyne, south-south-east of Berwick Upon Tweed, and to the east-south-east of Alnwick. The village is built on a promontory on a spit of land bordered to the east by the north sea and to the south and west by the estuary of the River Aln, falling from around above Mean High Water level at the north of the village to in the south-west. The geology of the North East of England around Alnmouth is a superficial layer of glacial till in the form of boulder clay lying on often outcropping Whin Sill, a carboniferous limestone, with peat deposits, and, at the coast, wind-blown sand including a coastline dune system which has evolved over the last 10,000 years. The coastline of the county is a series of headlands and bays - such as at Alnmouth - with wide, sandy beaches, the result of differential erosion of ice-age deposits. Alnmouth's south-beach dune is calcerous, containing mainly marine-animal shell, and is only 2‚Äì300 years old. Alnmouth lies at the south-east extent of low hills such run down from the Cheviot Hills to the coast. Its hinterland is an open agricultural landscape of arable land and pasture, with broadleaf woodlands in river valleys such as of the Aln, and some forestry plantations. Its history is of medieval tree- clearance and the establishment of scattered settlements and farms with complex field patterns. Alnmouth's coastline has multiple protected area designations. It lies at the southern end of the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the (non-statutory) Northumberland Heritage Coast, both of which seek to protect its landscape in all aspects. The saltflats of the estuary and the south beach dune is a Site of Special Scientific Interest listed in 1988 as Alnmouth Saltmarsh and Dunes for its varied plant community. As part of the Environment Agency's Northumberland 4shores Project, in 2006, flood banks protecting of estuarine pasture were breached and shallow ponds created, to allow tidal action to recreate saltflats to provide habitats for wading birds, dissipate wave energy, and diminish the potential for flooding. The golf course area, north of the village, is registered as common land. Most of the village was designated as a conservation area in 1972 - areas of recent building in the north are excluded. The architecture of the town is a mix of a few 17th century structures with 18th and 19th century buildings, ranging from terraced cottages to spacious Victorian villas, some flamboyant in style; 31 are Grade II listed. South of the river, a roofless 1870s mortuary chapel and the remains of a concrete cottage stand on the south-west of Church Hill. Further south, the first edition Ordnance Survey map of the area shows a bathhouse on Buston links associated with 'sandpits' - apparently bathing holes - drilled into the outcropping stone on the beach, and presumably evidence of the Victorian Spa movement.  Transport  The 1856 Duchess's Bridge, providing a direct dry link between Alnmouth and Hipsburn and its 1847 railway station Alnmouth is served by Alnmouth railway station which is situated in Hipsburn, a mile inland to the west. It is on the X18 bus route from Berwick via Alnwick and Amble to Newcastle. Two roads serve access to the village. The east-west B1336 runs from the north of Alnmouth to Hipsburn, providing a connection to the A1068 Alnwick-Ashington road. This link was developed in 1856 when the Hipsburn bridge crossing the River Aln was constructed to support a direct connection with the new railway station. The bridge was renamed The Duchess's Bridge in 1864. A second more ancient road exits the village to the north, following contours above the north bank of the Aln, to Lesbury and the coast northwards of Alnmouth. Prior to the bridge, the river was crossed by mettled and kerbstoned fords at two points; one, High Ford, was due west of the centre of the village, leading in the direction of Hipsburn and Alnwick; and a second, Low Ford, was to the south-west of the village and north-west of Church Hill, leading in the direction of High Buston and Warkworth, and adjacent to stepping-stones across the river usable at low tide. The village is on National Cycle Route 1.  Notable people  *Arthur Campbell Walker founded Alnmouth Golf Club. *Val McDermid, crime writer, lived in Alnmouth for a period.

It is the general form of dynamic equation for a system with both reversible and irreversible dynamics (generated by energy and entropy, respectively). GENERIC formalism is the theory built around the GENERIC equation, which has been proposed in its final form in 1997 by Miroslav Grmela and Hans Christian √ñttinger. GENERIC equation The GENERIC equation is usually written as :\\\\frac{dx}{dt}=L(x)\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\delta E}{\\\\delta x}(x)+M(x)\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\delta S}{\\\\delta x}(x). Here: * x denotes a set of variables used to describe the state space. The vector x can also contain variables depending on a continuous index like a temperature field.

It was first published in Omni in October 1981 and was republished in his short fiction collection Burning Chrome (1986). The story is a fable about the \\"cargo cult'\\" mentality and explores the consequences for cultures and civilisations when confronted with artifacts - from an unknown but likely superior source - that are dangerous but nonetheless valuable. \\"Hinterlands\\" is a German term that literally translates to \\"behind land\\", and in that original context it refers to a remote or less developed area behind a more central or developed site, for example the land behind a coast, a harbour, or a city. Plot summary The story is told by the narrator, Toby Halpert, through a series of expositions detailing the history of the space station in which he lives, nicknamed Heaven. The history begins with Soviet cosmonaut Olga Tovyevsky, who disappears from radar while en route to Mars shortly after a routine scientific experiment. She returns into space-time two years later, and after being discovered her spacecraft is towed back to Earth orbit to be examined. Tovyevsky is in a catatonic state, and the spacecraft has been sabotaged in an attempt to make it impossible to find and to hide any details of the missing two years. In her hands Tovyevsky has a seashell, the likes of which is unknown in Earth's biosphere. Tovyevsky never regains her sanity. The Russians send another probe to the same space coordinates Tovyevsky had travelled to. The solo cosmonaut also disappears, at precisely the same point, after performing the same experiment, and returns dead 234 days later. He has committed suicide before anyone can reach him. Further attempts always end the same way; most of the cosmonauts have killed themselves before they can be found, while a very few have attempted to and failed, and are now insane. Attempts to send through unmanned spacecraft all fail, as well, and some manned spacecraft are simply never picked up for reasons unknown. Presently, the Russians enlist other countries in their search for answers. The process continues and interest wanes as the smartest minds humanity has to offer are destroyed. Everything changes when a Frenchman returns dead, carrying an iron ring encoded with information that proves to be the \\"Rosetta Stone for cancer\\". From that point on the astonishing frequency of the events creates a cargo cult mentality, with line-ups of prospective astronauts ready to take the trip regardless of its inescapable fatal end. The coordinates are the same each time, and referred to as the Highway, Metro, or River by various cultures. In an effort to learn more, a space station is established near the Highway, designed to be paradise. When capsules arrive with live astronauts they are sent to Heaven in an effort to keep the astronauts alive longer and tease out any additional information available before they eventually kill themselves. Halpert is one of the astronauts who had volunteered to go to the Highway, but he was rejected by whatever is out there. The same fate befell his girlfriend Charmian, who holds the record for keeping one survivor alive for two weeks. Halpert and Charmian's role is to meet returning astronauts, soothe their transition to the station, and allow scientists to analyze their findings. What information is returned shows that the technologies on the other side of the Highway are different, but not necessarily more advanced. None of what comes back could possibly explain how the Highway works, and it is assumed the same is true for the other races the astronauts apparently meet on the \\"other side\\". Halpert likens it to houseflies meeting in an international airport, happy to converse but utterly unaware of where they are or how they got there. The story is being told as Halpert is being readied to meet a returning female astronaut who is still alive ‚Äì a \\"meat shot\\". While racing to meet the spacecraft, Halpert suffers a massive bout of agoraphobia, called \\"The Fear\\", a Lovecraftian sensation of being overwhelmed by the Highway's significance. Forced by electric shocks to enter the capsule, he finds the astronaut recently dead and discovers that she has reprogrammed her robotic surgeon suite to assist her suicide. Diagrams for incredibly powerful molecular switches are scrawled on the walls. Language \\"Hinterlands\\" makes extensive use of metaphors. For instance, the story's wormhole is referred to as \\"The Highway\\". From this metaphor, Gibson creates several other metaphors. The Highway's travelers are referred to as \\"hitchhikers\\", \\"flies\\", and \\"hicks.'\\". These words have a figurative rather than a literal meaning. The story's title is also a metaphor, comparing the known space to a backwoods area that is far from civilization. The destination at the end of the wormhole is figuratively \\"the big city\\". Film and TV adaptation In 2016, Last Studio Standing Inc., a Vancouver, Canada-based animation studio, acquired the rights to \\"Hinterlands\\" and announced that they will be creating both a theatrical short film and a television series. The studio, which specializes in adult and science fiction based animation, has the theatrical short slated for a 2018 release. Comic book adaptation Vancouver artist Gavin Lonergan adapted and illustrated \\"Hinterlands\\" as a comic book, published in 1995. The William Gibson Aleph has called the comic an \\"interesting evocation of the fake paradise of the short story\\".William Gibson Aleph The 20-page comic book was anthologised in two sections which appeared in Freeflight #5 and #6, Dec/Jan 95 and Apr/May 95. The look of the comic book is similar to Moebius, and Gibson was directly involved in the adaptation process.

He was educated at King's College London and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 1839 and an M.A. in 1844. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1841. While still an undergraduate, he lobbied the Government to form rifle clubs for defence against invasion, and created a model rifle club at Cambridge in 1837. This grew into the \\"Volunteers\\" movement, which he helped to pioneer. He served with the 1st Middlesex Rifle Volunteers and with the Royal Victoria Rifle Club, and wrote a number of practical manuals regarding rifle training. He was styled \\"Captain Busk\\". He also took an interest in designing yachts and lifeboats, and advocated the installation of lifeboat stations. He was a gastronome, and founded the School of Cookery at South Kensington. In 1873 he became a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Family He was the son of Hans Busk the elder. His siblings included Julia Clara Pitt Byrne and Rachel Harriette Busk; another sister, Maria Georgiana, married Sir Robert Loder, 1st Baronet. Another sister, Frances Rosalie, married Rev. Charles Vansittart in May 1845, but the marriage was deeply troubled, and Hans Busk was involved in legal proceedings between his sister and her husband, including the precedent-setting case Vansittart v.

Protected area A large number of different species of waders and wildfowl, listed below, use the estuaries as feeding and over-wintering areas. This wide variety of bird species has led to the estuaries being officially designated as a Special Protection Area and as a Ramsar site. The Ribble Estuary has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1966 and is now covered by Natural England's Ribble Estuary National Nature Reserve. The site The Ribble Marshes National Nature Reserve is in extent and it is located in the middle of the SSSI which extends to . There are extensive areas of intertidal sand and silt flats, and expanses of saltmarsh. The mudflats have a large invertebrate fauna on which the waders and waterbirds feed. The saltmarshes are dominated by saltmarsh grass and red fescue with cord-grass on the seaward edge. The Ramsar wetlands extend to and include an area of sand dunes which has interesting vegetation and provides habitat for important populations of amphibians. The whole site is of great importance to internationally important numbers of wintering waterbirds.

Col. Jan Kowalewski (23 October 1892 ‚Äì 31 October 1965) was a Polish cryptologist, intelligence officer, engineer, journalist, military commander, and creator and first head of the Polish Cipher Bureau. He recruited a large staff of cryptologists who broke Soviet military codes and ciphers during the Polish-Soviet War, enabling Poland to weather the war and achieve victory in the 1920 Battle of Warsaw. Early life Jan Kowalewski was born 1892 in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Congress Poland, under rule of the Russian Empire. After graduating from a local trade school, between 1909 and 1913 he studied at the University of Li√®ge in Belgium, where he graduated from the faculty of chemistry. World War I He returned to Poland in 1913, only to be mobilized for the Russian Army the following year, at the outbreak of World War I. He fought in various formations on the Belarusian and Romanian fronts as an officer of the Engineering and Signal Corps, and in December 1918 he was allowed to join the Polish unit formed under command of Gen. Lucjan ≈ªeligowski out of Poles living in Russia. As chief of intelligence of the Polish 4th Rifle Division he crossed the Romanian border with the Division and reached Poland in May 1919. Polish-Soviet War A polyglot and amateur cryptologist, Kowalewski was initially attached to the staff of Gen. J√≥zef Haller, fighting in Volhynia and Eastern Lesser Poland during the Polish-Ukrainian War for the city of Lw√≥w. One day during his service there, Kowalewski was given some enciphered Bolshevik messages that had been intercepted, and within two days, he had deciphered them. They revealed the Bolsheviks' appreciation of General Anton Denikin's White Russian forces. Available at: Cryptologic Foundation (Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, USA) He also managed to break the codes and ciphers of the army of the West Ukrainian People's Republic. He had to spend all night segregating radio intercepts and discarding the encrypted ones, it caused a major sensation among the staff. As a result, in July 1919 he was transferred to Warsaw, where he became chief of the Polish General Staff's radio-intelligence department. By early September he had gathered a group of mathematicians from Warsaw University and Lw√≥w University (most notably, founders of the Polish School of Mathematics‚ÄîStanis≈Çaw Le≈õniewski, Stefan Mazurkiewicz and Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski), who were also able to break Russian ciphers. Though Kowalewski's contribution to Polish victory in the Polish- Soviet War remained a secret for over 70 years, he was awarded Poland's highest military decoration, the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari. Interbellum After the war ended, he was attached to the staff of the Third Silesian Uprising as the commander of intelligence services. In 1923 he was sent to Tokyo, where he organized a course in radio intelligence for Japanese officers. For his efforts in this area he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun - the highest military award in Japan. In 1928 he graduated from the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Guerre in Paris and was promoted to the rank of major. Although not directly involved in radio intelligence any more, he remained a Polish intelligence officer. From 1929 he served as a military attach√© at the Polish embassy in Moscow, but in 1933 he was declared persona non grata and moved to a similar post in the embassy in Bucharest, where he remained until 1937. Upon his return to Poland he briefly headed one of the branches of the Ob√≥z Zjednoczenia Narodowego political organization and became the director of TISSA company, a Polish intelligence-sponsored company importing rare materials for the Polish arms industry. He was also promoted to lieutenant colonel. World War II After the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 he was evacuated to Romania, where he headed a committee of relief for Polish war refugees. In January 1940 he moved to France, where he joined the Polish Army in exile and became a proponent of an Allied offensive in the Balkans. However, the German spring offensive and the fall of France made the plan moot and Kowalewski had to flee German-occupied France. Through Vichy France and Spain he reached Portugal, where he formed yet another committee of relief for war refugees. Initially based at Figueira da Foz, he soon moved to Lisbon, then a center of espionage and battleground for spies of all countries involved in World War II. There he made contact with his friend Jean Pangal (Ioan Pangal), a Romanian centrist politician and former Romanian envoy to Lisbon. Though dismissed by the end of 1941 by Romanian leader Ion Antonescu for his pro-Allied stance, Pangal remained in Lisbon and became a collaborator of Polish intelligence in Allied attempts to win over the Third Reich's allies - Hungary, Romania, Finland and Italy. =Lisbon, 1941= The collaboration with Pangal proved vital to the Polish and Allied war effort, and Kowalewski managed to convince Gen. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski and Minister Stanis≈Çaw Kot to create a center of Polish intelligence in Lisbon on January 15, 1941. Officially named the Center for Contact with the Continent (Plac√≥wka ≈ÅƒÖczno≈õci z Kontynentem), the Lisbon-based bureau was headed by Kowalewski and soon became the hub of an extensive net of Polish resistance, sabotage and intelligence organizations throughout occupied Europe. Acting independently of similar groups in Poland, which were run directly from London or Warsaw, the center coordinated the efforts of dozens of groups in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, North Africa, Spain and even Germany. It organized communication between the Polish Government in Exile and occupied Europe, as well as providing logistical and financial support for Polish resistance groups throughout Western Europe. Kowalewski's intelligence network was also helpful to the British government, as most of his reports were passed either to SOE or to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. A notable coup for his Lisbon center was the passing of the exact date for Operation Barbarossa to the British, who were thus informed of the fact at least two weeks prior to the actual invasion of Russia. Kowalewski also managed to neutralize a secret radio station used by the Germans to communicate with U-Boats operating in the Atlantic. He was also crucial in enabling former Romanian King Carol II to escape from Romania, and leave Spain for Lisbon. Postwar However, despite the fact that Kowalewski had contacts with numerous politicians of Hungary, Romania and Italy willing to change sides, the situation changed after the Casablanca Conference of 1943, when the Allies demanded the unconditional surrender of the Axis. The situation further deteriorated after the Tehran Conference, when it became clear that Hungary and Romania would fall under Soviet domination anyway and that the plan for a second front in the Balkans, which would allow the Hungarians and Romanians to break with Nazi Germany was finally dismissed. According to recent research by a Polish-British joint history commission for investigation of Polish World War II intelligence service, at the latter conference the Soviets demanded that Kowalewski be withdrawn from his post to England.See Western betrayal In late January 1944 Frank Roberts, head of the Central Department of the British Foreign Office, informed Gen. Colin Gubbins, head of the SOE, that Kowalewski's network was not only aimed at the Germans, but at creating a common Polish-Hungarian- Romanian Bloc, which was allegedly aimed at vital Soviet interests. On March 6, 1944 Sir Alexander Cadogan of the Foreign Office informed the Polish minister of foreign affairs Edward Raczy≈Ñski that Kowalewski's contacts with the opposing powers could be treated as treachery and that he should be dismissed. Although no proofs were presented, the Polish government felt forced to obey the British wish and Kowalewski was dismissed from his post on March 20 and on April 5 he was transported to London. Kowalewski was named the chief of the Polish Operations Bureau at the Special Forces Headquarters. Among his tasks was the preparation of the Polish resistance organizations in occupied Europe for Operation Overlord. However, his post was mostly titular as it was already too late for any arrangements to have effect and Kowalewski could change nothing. British exile After the war Kowalewski remained in exile in Great Britain, where he started working as a journalist. Until 1955 he was the editor in chief of an East Europe and Soviet Russia monthly. In 1958 and 1959 he was also a tutor at an unofficial military school for the Polish diaspora. He also briefly collaborated with Radio Free Europe and other Polish exile organizations. In his late years, in 1963, he briefly returned to cryptanalysis and managed to break the codes used by Romuald Traugutt during the January Uprising. He died of cancer on October 31, 1965 in London.

First painted on wood panel, it was later transferred to canvas. History The painting was executed for Sigismondo de' Conti, chamberlain to Pope Julius II, in 1511. It was placed on a high altar of the church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli on Capitoline Hill (Italian: Campidoglio) in Rome, where Sigismondo was buried in 1512. It was moved by Anna Conti, a descendant of Sigismondi Conti, to the monastery of St. Anne in Foligno in 1565 and remained there for more than two centuries, hence the name. In 1799 it was carried to Paris, France by Napoleon. There, in 1802, the painting was transferred from panel to canvas by Hacquin and restored by Roser of Heidelberg. A note was made by the restorer: \\"Rapporto dei cittadini Guijon Vincent Tannay e Berthollet sul ristauro dei quadri di Raffaello conosciuto sotto il nome di Madonna di Foligno.\\" In 1815, after the Battle of Waterloo, it was returned to Italy, where it was placed in the room with the Transfiguration in the Pinacoteca Vaticana of the Vatican Museum in the Vatican City. Description The painting is a sacra conversazione, where holy figures seem to be in conversation and draw the audience into their discussion. Rather than sitting under a canopy, of the Umbrian or Florentine style, the Virgin is seated on clouds, embracing Jesus, while surrounded by angels. They look down upon Sigismonde de' Conti, kneeling in a red, fur lined cape. Conti is presented by St. Jerome on the right with his lion, appealing for the Virgin's protection. On the left are the kneeling St. Francis of Assisi and St. John the Baptist, who is standing and wearing a tunic of skins. As St. John points to Jesus, he clearly looks out to us, pulling us in, while St. Francis points to us and looks at the Christ Child. Between the men is an angel, linking the saints of earth to the seraph host of heaven. Behind them are the towers of Foligno. Painted during Raphael's Roman period, it is a testament to his artistic maturity, evidenced in the paintings composition, coloring and form. Conti commissioned the painting to commemorate his survival of a shell that exploded near him during the Siege of Foligno, his hometown. He credited his safety to heavenly intervention. According to historian Massimo Polidoro this painting has been used by UFO websites as evidence of a flying saucer crash. What Polidoro says you are actually seeing is the house of Sigismondo Conti and a fireball. Painters at this time used \\"symbolic meanings that were anything but random.\\" The angel is holding a sign with nothing written on it. According to Polidoro this was because Sigismondo died before he could tell Raphael what \\"thank you\\" to the Virgin he wanted written on the sign. Polidoro calls the UFO explanation, \\"reinterpreting with the eyes of twenty-first-century Europeans the product of other cultures\\".

He played most of his career with Benfica, for which he appeared in 369 competitive matches and scored 174 goals, winning 13 major titles including eight Primeira Liga championships and two European Cups. He was dubbed the \\"Portuguese Garrincha\\" by Gabriel Hanot. A Portuguese international over one full decade, Jos√© Augusto represented the nation at the 1966 World Cup. He later worked as a manager, for more than 30 years. Club career Born in Barreiro, Set√∫bal District, Jos√© Augusto started playing with local F.C. Barreirense, spending four seasons in the Primeira Liga there. In summer 1959 he joined S.L. Benfica, going on to be part of the club's legendary attacking unit that also included M√°rio Coluna, Eus√©bio, Ant√≥nio Sim√µes and Jos√© Torres. He and his teammates won two European Cups, in 1961 and 1962, and still reached a further three finals in the decade; in the 1960‚Äì61 domestic league season he scored a career-best 24 goals in only 25 games, helping the side to the title. Jos√© Augusto retired early into the 1969‚Äì70 campaign at the age of 32, immediately being named Benfica's head coach and leading them to the second position behind Sporting CP. He subsequently worked with several teams, including S.C. Farense and F.C. Penafiel in the top level. In 1994‚Äì95, in what was his first experience abroad, Jos√© Augusto was one of five managers in charge of CD Logro√±√©s, as the club was relegated from La Liga with an all-time low 13 points. International career Jos√© Augusto made his debut for Portugal on 7 May 1958, in a 1‚Äì2 friendly loss with England. He took part in a further 44 internationals over one full decade, and scored nine goals. Jos√© Augusto was selected for the 1966 FIFA World Cup squad. He played all the games and netted three times through headers for the eventual third-placed team, twice against Hungary in the opener (3‚Äì1, the first in the first minute) and once against North Korea in the quarter-finals (5‚Äì3). As a manager, Jos√© Augusto had a two-year spell with the national side, leading them to the runner-up position in the Brazil Independence Cup and through the unsuccessful 1974 World Cup qualifying campaign. In the 80s he was in charge of the youth teams, helping develop Carlos Queiroz; additionally, he was an assistant in the UEFA Euro 1984 finals in France.

The name is derived from its situation in a jarrah forest. Established in the late 1800s as the state's first major timber milling operation, it played a key role in the development of Western Australia through the exportation of jarrah around the world.Jarrahdale Heritage Park at Natural Heritage site of the National Trust (W.A.) At the 2016 census, Jarrahdale had a population of 1,192. Since 2001, the historic precinct has been managed by the state's National Trust organisation alongside private residential and tourism-oriented developments. History The Jarrahdale Timber Company constructed a railway for the transport of timber from Jarrahdale through Mundijong to Rockingham. In 1872 the townsite was granted timber concessions and the town was born,History and Culture www.peel.wa.gov.au. Retrieved 15 October 2007. though it was not gazetted until 1913. The locality was destroyed by an 1895 bushfire.Jarrahdale - main mill burned down West Australian, 5 June 1895 and the town was relocated west of its original position. Historic buildings in the area include a mill manager's house, nurses' quarters/hospital, general store, single men's quarters, Gianatti store, Murray Arms/Jarrahdale Tavern/Rileys Bar, churches, post office and other buildings. A POW camp was located outside the town during World War II. Recently the old mill office, behind the nurses' quarters, was destroyed by fire, a recurring hazard throughout the township's history. The population of the town was 600 (400 males and 200 females) in 1898. Bauxite had been mined by Western Aluminium near Jarrahdale throughout the 1960s. The ore was transported by rail to Kwinana for processing at the company's Alumina refinery. In 1967 the company had mined of bauxite. On 14 July 1997, the Jarrahdale townsite was entered on the National Trust's List of Classified Heritage places, the seventh Western Australian town to be so classified.Jarradale Forest Heritage at Jarradale Forest Protectors website The Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale instigated a redevelopment scheme for the Jarrahdale Heritage Park which houses the previous mill sites and the last standing mill built in the 1930s. This mill is still operating as a small production business called Heritage Sawmillers, located on the Gooralong Brook which flows through the townsite. Following negotiations with the landowners Wesfarmers/Sotico, the shire purchased some of the land for housing development and, in 2001, an entire historic precinct was donated to National Trust of Australia (WA), including the site of a closed timber sawmill. Surviving relics On the main pass road, Jarrahdale Road, are located the successive mill sites and, to the extremity of the town heading east, the last mill site which still contains relics of its existence. This mill was operated by Bunnings until 1997. An Alcoa alumina mining operation was concluded in 1998. Both Bunnings and Alcoa removed most of their plant fittings when they departed. The surrounding area includes catchments and steep slopes with remnants of the former native forest, e.g., near the Kitty's Gorge walk trail within the Serpentine National Park. In 2009, the Forest Products Commission announced plans for renewed logging in the vicinity, plotting 50-year-old regrowth sites east of the townsite.Chris Thomson Last jarrah yanked from Jarrahdale at WA Today (Fairfax Media), 25 June 2009.

Her maternal grandparents were Bernard de Saint-Severin, Prince of Besignano, and Jeanne El√©onore Piccolomini. The latter was a descendant of King Alfonso V of Aragon and his mistress Giraldona Carlino. She served as lady-in-waiting to both Eleanor of Austria (fille d'honneur 1531-1536 and Dame d'honneur 1538-1543) and Catherine de Medici. Her husband, Francois of Orleans-Longueville, Marquis de Rothelin, died on 25 October 1548, and in watching her son Leonor's interests in Neuch√¢tel she was brought into contact with the reformers in Switzerland. She then embraced Protestantism and turned her ch√¢teau at Blandy, in Brie, into a refuge for Huguenots. In 1567 she underwent a term of imprisonment at the Louvre for harbouring Protestants.  Marriage and children  On 19 June 1536, at Lyon, she married Fran√ßois of Orl√©ans-Longueville, Marquis de Rothelin, Prince of Chalet-Aillon, Viscount of Melun (2 March 1513 ‚Äì 25 October 1548), son of Louis I d'Orl√©ans, duc de Longueville, Duke of Neufchatel, Prince of Chatel- Aillon and Johanna of Baden-Hochberg, Countess of Neufchatel and Margravine of Rothelin, with whom she had two children: # Leonor, Duke de Longueville, Duke d' Estouteville, Prince of the Blood (1540‚Äì1573), married in 1563, Marie d'Estouteville, by whom he had issue, including Henri I, 8th Duke de Longueville. # Fran√ßoise d'Orl√©ans-Longueville (5 April 1549 ‚Äì 11 June 1601), who was born posthumously. On 8 November 1565, she married Huguenot leader Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√©, as his second wife, by whom she had issue. The House of Savoy-Carignan descended from their union.

It appears in a number of present-day placenames. Origin of the word It appears in print very early in the history of New England; records from 1630 note that William Blaxton was \\"dwelling on the other side of Charles River, alone, at a place by the Indians called Shawmutt\\". The meaning of Shawmut is uncertain. Most explanations refer to either the salt water surrounding the peninsula, from which come explanations like \\"canoe landing place\\" or \\"place to ferry across\\", or to the springs of fresh water found within, a major inducement for the settlement of the Massachusetts Bay Colony at that site.

As one of the most famous drivers in Roman history, Scorpus earned extraordinarily large amounts of money; his income surpassing that of professional Roman sponsors.

Eventually, he bought his freedom, becoming a libertus (freed slave). Martial, a Roman poet, refers to Scorpus twice in Book X of his Epigrams, composed between 95 and 98 AD: and Although the cause of Scorpus' death is unknown, it is likely to have been in one of the numerous crashes that occurred during chariot races, known as naufragia (\\"shipwrecks\\"). Charioteers wrapped the reins around their bodies in order to use their body weight to better control the horses. While this was extremely dangerous, the drivers carried knives that, in the case of an accident, would be used to cut themselves free.

In 1846 he gave permission to William T.G. Morton to provide ether anesthesia while Warren performed a minor surgical procedure. News of this first public demonstration of surgical anesthesia quickly circulated around the world. He was a founder of the New England Journal of Medicine and was the third president of the American Medical Association. He was the first Dean of Harvard Medical School and a founding member of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Biography 285x285px Born in Boston, he was the son of John Warren, well-known doctor, Harvard professor, and a founder of the Harvard Medical School and the nephew of Dr. Joseph Warren. He graduated from Harvard College in 1797, then began the study of medicine with his father. In 1799, he continued his medical studies in London and Paris and Edinburgh, including work with the pioneer anatomist Sir Astley Cooper (1768‚Äì1841). He graduated with an M.D. from the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1801. On his return to America in 1802, Warren entered into partnership with his father and also assisted him with anatomical lectures, dissections, and demonstrations at Harvard Medical School. By 1806, Warren had begun performing cataract extractions for a condition which was most likely angle-closure glaucoma. He was named Adjunct Professor of Anatomy and Surgery in 1806, then, at his father's death in 1815, assumed the Hersey Professorship of Anatomy and Surgery, which post he held until retirement in 1847. During this time, Warren played a leading role in establishing New England's first medical journal, The New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery (first issue January 1812), which subsequently evolved into today's New England Journal of Medicine. He was also active in the Anthology Club. Warren was the first dean of Harvard Medical School (1816‚Äì1819) and promoted its move from Cambridge to Boston. Harvard presented him with an honorary medical degree in 1819. He was a founding member of Massachusetts General Hospital and served as the facility's first surgeon. He held an appointment on the hospital staff until 1853 and was then on its Board of Consultation until his death. Over the course of his long career, Warren assembled an extraordinary teaching collection of anatomical and pathological specimens, which he presented to Harvard in 1847 along with $5000. This was the beginning of the Warren Anatomical Museum. =Warren and anesthesia= Re-enactment of the October 16, 1846 ether operation; daguerrotype by Southworth & Hawes. Warren was involved not once but twice in the earliest history of anesthesia. The first incident was a failed demonstration of nitrous-oxide by dentist Horace Wells on January 20, 1845. Although Warren did not believe that the anesthesia would work, he arranged for a demonstration at Massachusetts General Hospital. Warren presented Wells to his students but the patient who had been scheduled that morning, for an amputation, refused to be operated on. Warren then asked his students if anybody needed a tooth extracted and one student agreed. Unfortunately the gas was not properly administered. The student suffered normal levels of pain, thus discrediting Wells and nitrous-oxide as an anesthetic. Not willing to accept that failure, on October 16, 1846, Warren again agreed to perform a public demonstration of a surgical operation, with anesthesia, on a patient, this time under ether anesthesia administered by Wells' colleague and competitor, William Thomas Green Morton. Warren was at this time 68 years of age. The operation lasted about ten minutes and the patient was seemingly unconscious for its duration. After Warren had finished, and the patient had regained consciousness, Warren asked the patient how he felt. Reportedly, the patient answered: \\"Feels as if my neck's been scratched\\". Warren then stated to his audience \\"Gentlemen, this is no Humbug\\". Although this proclaim is disputed. His personal journal for this day records, \\"Did an interesting operation at the Hospital this morning, while the patient was under the influence of Dr. Morton's preparation to prevent pain. The substance employed was sulphuric ether.\\" Warren was quick to see the remarkable advantages offered by ether in surgical procedures, and he then championed the cause of etherization through his work and publications. Mindful of the potential importance of the demonstration, Warren invited noted photographers Southworth & Hawes to document the surgery via a re-enactment. In subsequent months, they made a series of daguerrotypes of actual operations.  Death  Daguerreotype of John Collins Warren, c. 1855, attributed to Josiah Johnson Hawes Dr Warren's grandson Dr. Thomas Dwight with a skull 1896 Warren died from pericarditis on May 4, 1856 at his home at Park 2 street in Boston. It was believed for over 100 years that his remains laid in his memorial tomb at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, MA but in fact his remains are divided; his skeleton is in a coffin-like box at Harvard‚Äôs Warren Museum, since he donated his body to Harvard Medical School for research, and his so- called \\"morbid parts\\" [i.e. flesh] only were interred in the tomb.

His first wife was Susan Powell Mason (1780‚Äì1840) whom he married 17 Nov 1803 at Boston and had six children: John Warren (b.1803-died young), Susan Powell Warren Lyman (1806‚Äì1856), Jonathan Mason Warren (1811‚Äì1867), James Sullivan Warren (1812‚Äì1867), Mary Collins Warren Dwight (1816-1900 Death date Authority of James Archer O'Reilly III, author \\"Memorials of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati\\" pub 2004 Boston),and Emily Appleton (1818‚Äì1905).

The sampling chamber is based on a nephelometer that detects the presence of smoke particles suspended in air by detecting the light scattered by them in the chamber. ASDs can typically detect smoke before it is visible to the naked eye. In most cases aspirating smoke detectors require a fan unit to draw in a sample of air from the protected area through its network of pipes. History In 1970 the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) used a nephelometer to carry out research into forest fires. Subsequently, the Australian Postmaster-General's Department engaged the CSIRO to investigate technologies that could prevent service interruption due to fire. After selecting a sample site to carry out research, the CSIRO suggested that the nephelometer should be used as the benchmark for the APO fire tests. This was installed to monitor smoke levels within the return-air ducts of the mechanical ventilation system, utilising a chart- recorder output display. At the conclusion of several weeks of testing, it was discovered that there no commercially available fire detection technology suitable for preventing damage to telephone equipment. One technology that did show great promise however was the nephelometer itself. In 1979, Xtralis, then IEI Pty Ltd., produced and sold an air sampling device they called VESDA (Very Early Smoke Detection Apparatus). The company redesigned the detector in 1982 to provide the reliability, features, size and reduced cost for export markets. ASD systems have gained popularity due to their ability to sense smoke long before a catastrophic incident. Design ASD design corrects shortcomings of conventional smoke detectors by using a sampling pipe with multiple holes. The air samples are captured and filtered, removing any contaminants or dust to avoid false alarms and then processed by a centralized, highly sensitive laser detection unit. If smoke is detected, the systems alarm is triggered, and signals are then processed through centralized monitoring stations within a few seconds. Unlike passive smoke detection systems, including spot detectors, ASD systems actively draw smoke to the detector through bore holes within a piping system that runs throughout the protected area. Furthermore, ASD systems incorporate integrity monitoring to ensure an alert is raised at any time the ASD‚Äôs ability to detect smoke is compromised. This is not the case with passive devices that are generally only electrically monitored with no ability to determine if smoke can actually reach the detection element. ASD systems incorporate more than one level of alarm. This allows an ASD system to provide very early warning of an event, prompting investigation at the earliest smouldering stage of a fire when it is easily addressed. Other alarm levels may be configured to provide fire alarm inputs to fire systems as well as releasing suppression systems. ASD alarm sensitivities are configurable and can be programmed to levels ranging from thousands of times more sensitive than a conventional detector, to much less sensitive. The detectors work best in non-volatile environments. They can also be used in computer cabinets to alert users to the overheating of computer cables or individual computer components. Installation and placement An example of how a simple ASD unit with a single pipe could cover a five-room area ASDs are suitable for environments where a highly sensitive rapid smoke detection capability is required. This makes them suitable in clean rooms; areas which contain goods easily damaged by fire, such as tobacco, electronic rooms and highly flammable liquid and gases. Often, normal point detectors will recognise the danger too late, as smoke often does not reach the ceiling quickly enough for a fire to be detected in a timely fashion. As they can be easily hidden, pipe networks are suitable in environments where point detectors can be considered aesthetically displeasing, such as offices, apartments and hotel rooms. This factor also makes them suitable in locations where point detectors can be easily tampered with, such as in correctional facilities. Despite their high sensitivity ASDs can be used in dusty or dirty environments as long as correct design, installation and maintenance processes are followed. Most ASD products can accommodate a broad range of environments and applications ‚Äì from both confined and open spaces to the cleanest or dirtiest environment, including telecomm, control rooms, waste treatment, mining and more.\\"What is CCD Aspriating Smoke Detection\\", Safe Fire Detection Inc, Retrieved 2010-03-23 See also * Carbon monoxide detector * Heat detector * Smoke detector ReferencesExternal links * Detecting smoke in air ducts * Three Wavelength Integrating Category:Active fire protection Category:Detectors Category:Fire detection and alarm Category:Smoke Category:Aerosol measurement ","title":"Aspirating smoke detector"},{"id":"3035914","title":"Machakos"},{"id":"3035916","text":"Gulliver's World is a theme park located in Warrington, England.
