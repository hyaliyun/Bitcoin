The women in Montenegro are also known as Montenegrin or Serbian women in Montenegro. They live in Montenegro, a country in southeastern Europe: a region commonly known as the Balkans. They belong to a group of people known as South Slavs. An early description of women from Montenegro comes from a column of The New York Times on November 5, 1880, wherein the newspaper said that \\"The Montenegrin woman takes an equal share of labor with the man at field-work, and she does all the carrying\\" in relation to travel by horse ride and other forms of transport by animals. The newspaper further described them to be engaged in knitting or spinning. (abstract) Physical attributes Among the tallest people in the world, the average height of women in Montenegro is at . Status in society Women in Montenegro may either be living in a conservative and patriarchal Montenegrin society or a matriarchal society depending on the region of their residence. In a family unit that is headed by a male, a woman may act as a guide to the man regarding family matters. In modern times, Montenegrin people have a \\"caring attitude\\" to their women.  Fertility rate  A report from the World Bank shows that the fertility rate (total births per woman) in Montenegro had been declining from 2002 to 2010. The trend was from 1.77 in 2002, then 1.68 in 2008, and 1.66 in 2010. Notable Montenegrin women=Queen of Italy There are notable women in Montenegro in the history of Montenegro. One of them was Elena of Montenegro (1873‚Äì1952), the daughter of a former king of Montenegro, who became Queen of Italy. The English historian Denis Mack Smith described Elena of Montenegro, particularly as Italy's queen, as the most influential Montenegrin woman in history; Elena of Montenegro was able to convince her husband Victor Emmanuel III, who was during her time the King of Italy, to impose on Benito Mussolini the creation of an independent Montenegro, against the wishes of the fascist Croats and Albanians (who wanted to enlarge their countries with the Montenegrin territories). Her nephew Prince Michael of Montenegro never accepted the offered crown, pledging loyalty to his nephew King Peter II of Yugoslavia. First female physician Another notable woman from Montenegro was Divna Vekoviƒá (1886‚Äì1944), the first female medical doctor in Montenegro. Apart from being a physician during World War I, Vekoviƒá was also a humanitarian and a literary translator. As a translator, she was the first to translate The Mountain Wreath (also known as The Mountain of Wreath) from the Montenegrin language into the French language; The Mountain Wreath is a well-known poem and play in Serbian literature written by the Prince-Bishop and poet Petar II Petroviƒá- Njego≈°.

Biography He was born in Milan. He did not attend a particular academy or have any specific mentor, but was self-educated and drew from eclectic sources. He was equally eclectic in subjects he painted or wrote about. He was am artistic collaborator to the journal of La stampa in Venice. He was also correspondent del Monde lllustr√© and of Tour de Monde of Paris, along with Enrico Castelnuovo and Alessandro Pascolato. Stella also served as director of the Arte del Mondo Illustrato of Turin and spent some time in Paris. Camillo Boito said of Stella: > Stella bests all in the subject of depth and in comic wit. Few painters in > Italy as he know how to discover in ridiculous things, their pathetic face > of things, and in pretentious things, their comical face: he is a subtle > revealer of social hypocrisy and of the old prejudices: he is an elegant > moralist. His brush is now satirical, and now sentimental, and he is not > infrequently sermonizing, like (the playwright) Gaspare Gozzi. He is > addicted to paint in large dimensions, but still makes the effort in every > part, though minute, to bring life-like rendering; but of this science he is > inclined to abuse, and looking overpowers the details of the things, he > seems a little dry in the design and raw in color. Among his works are An indiscreet scene; A captured peasant; In the sacristy ; and The saltimbanco at the bed of his dying wife. In 1870, he exhibited at the Italian Exposition of Fine arts in Parma: The Saintly murmurs and I preparativi per un ballo in maschera. In 1887, at the National Artistic Exposition in Venice: Fiori di rupe and Pax. Regarding the painting \\"Vice and virtue, which was also titled An Episode of the Carnival of Venice, one contemporary critic said: > It shows up in a family, poor but not destitute, and contrasts the carefree > attitude of a husband and good household virtues of his wife... This > painting captures one of those gradations of social relationships that > escape the eyes of a common observer, but Stella knows how to capture with > such assurance and reveal the passionate and happy requests of the heart, > and the ill reply of society. Yet the qualities of form and color disappear > under the force of philosophical thought, which dominates the composition > and grabs the viewer's attention. Oh, if artists thought this way always! Stella was knighted into the Order of the Crown of Italy. He also became Consigliere Comunale to the council of Venice. In his official positions, he vigorously opposed the projects involving large demolitions that planned for Venice, by comparing the theories used in the renewal of Naples.

It aired from July 14, 1990 to August 8, 1992. History Stern was approached by Bob Woodruff, vice president of program development at WWOR-TV, in early 1990. He agreed to host a weekly late night television show at a production and salary budget of $100,000. Episodes were filmed at WWOR's studio, 9 Broadcast Plaza, in Secaucus, New Jersey. The Howard Stern Show launched on July 14, 1990, with four Saturday night pilots. The program entered national syndication in January 1991 by All American Television. Unlike the pilots he had shot for Fox three years earlier, Stern enjoyed greater creative freedom. The WWOR show featured outrageous segments including \\"Guess Who's the Jew\\" and \\"Lesbian Dating Game\\". A critic of the Los Angeles Times described the show as \\"at once incredibly funny and incredibly vile\\". In the New York market, The Howard Stern Show often doubled the ratings share of Saturday Night Live on NBC during the half-hour the two programmes overlapped.Colford, p. 199. In Los Angeles on KCOP, the show managed to attract a 34.4% market share at 12:30 am in the male 18-49 demographic. In July 1992, The Howard Stern Show came to an end. \\"We made this business decision, even though the show had high ratings, because the cost exceeded the revenue,\\" a WWOR spokesperson explained. A total of 69 episodes were broadcast to 65 markets across the country; the last airing on August 8, 1992. Because the show's flagship station, WWOR, broadcasts on channel 9 in the New York market, Stern and his staff generally refer to it as \\"The Channel 9 Show.\\" See also * The Howard Stern Show (radio program, 1979‚Äìpresent) * Howard Stern television shows ReferencesBibliography * * External links * Category:1990s American television talk shows Category:1990 American television series debuts Category:1992 American television series endings Category:1990s American variety television series Category:1990s American late-night television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Howard Stern Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) ","title":"The Howard Stern Show (1990 TV program)"},{"id":"41113066","text":"Waseda Univ. baseball team 1911 Keio Univ. baseball team 1928‚Äì1929 The , also known as the Waseda‚ÄìKO rivalry, is a college rivalry between two universities located in Tokyo, Japan: Waseda University and Keio University.

The process of language acquisition is varied among deaf children. Deaf children born to deaf parents are typically exposed to a sign language at birth and their language acquisition following a typical developmental timeline. However, at least 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents who use a spoken language at home. Hearing loss prevents many deaf children from hearing spoken language to the degree necessary for language acquisition. For many deaf children, language acquisition is delayed until the time that they are exposed to a sign language or until they begin using amplification devices such as hearing aids or cochlear implants. Deaf children who experience delayed language acquisition, sometimes called language deprivation, are at risk for lower language and cognitive outcomes.  Background  Human languages can be spoken or signed. Typically developing infants can easily acquire any language in their environment if it is accessible to them, regardless of whether the language uses the vocal mode (spoken language) or the gestural mode (signed language). Deaf children who are exposed to an established sign language from birth learn that language in the same manner as any other hearing child acquiring a spoken language. Signed languages like ASL (American Sign Language) are, however, acquired by signers of varying age and are atypical from a language acquisition perspective. For example, only 5-10% of deaf children are born to deaf, signing parents in the United States. The remaining 90-95% of the signing community are deaf children born to hearing, non-signing parents/families who usually lack knowledge of signed languages and may discourage the use of a signed language in favor of spoken English. These circumstances cause unique features of sign language acquisition not usually observed in spoken language acquisition. Due to the visual/manual modality, these differences can assist in distinguishing among universal aspects of language acquisition and aspects that may be affected by early language experience.  Acquisition of signed language  Children need language from birth. Deaf infants should have access to sign language from birth or as young as possible, with research showing that the critical period of language acquisition applies to sign language too. Sign languages are fully accessible to deaf children as they are visual, rather than aural, languages. Sign languages are natural languages with the same linguistic status as spoken languages. Like other languages, sign languages are much harder to learn when the child is past the critical age of development for language acquisition. Studies have found that children who learned sign language from birth understand much more than children who start learning sign language at an older age. Also, studies indicate that the younger a child is when learning sign language, the better their language outcomes are. There is a wide rage of ages at which deaf children exposed to a sign language and begin their acquisition process. Approximately 5% of deaf children acquire a sign language from birth from their deaf parents. Deaf children with hearing parents often have a delayed process of sign language acquisition, beginning at the time when the parents start learning a sign language or when the child attends a signing program. Sign languages have natural prosodic patterns, and infants are sensitive to these prosodic boundaries even if they have no specific experience with sign languages. Six-month-old hearing infants with no sign experience also preferentially attend to sign language stimuli over complex gesture, indicating that they are perceiving sign language as meaningful linguistic input. Since infants attend to spoken and signed language in a similar manner, several researchers have concluded that much of language acquisition is universal, not tied to the modality of the language, and that sign languages are acquired and processed very similarly to spoken languages, given adequate exposure. These babies acquire sign language from birth and their language acquisition progresses through predictable developmental milestones. Babies acquiring a sign language produce manual babbling (akin to vocal babbling), produce their first sign, and produce their first two-word sentences on the same timeline as hearing children acquiring spoken language. At the same time, researchers point out that there are many unknowns in terms of how a visual language might be processed differently than a spoken language, particularly given the unusual path of language transmission for most deaf infants. Language acquisition strategies for deaf children acquiring a sign language are different than those appropriate for hearing children, or for deaf children who use spoken language with hearing aids and/or cochlear implants. Because sign languages are visual languages, eye gaze and eye contact are critical for language acquisition and communication. Studies of deaf parents who sign with their deaf children have shed light on paralinguistic features that are important for sign language acquisition. Deaf parents are adept at ensuring that the infant is visually engaged prior to signing, and use specific modifications to their signing, referred to as child-directed sign, to gain and maintain their children's attention. To attract and direct a deaf child's attention, caregivers can break the child's line of gaze using hand and body movements, touch, and pointing to allow language input. Just as in child-directed speech (CDS), child-directed signing is characterized by slower production, exaggerated prosody, and repetition. Due to the unique demands of a visual language, child-directed signing also includes tactile strategies and relocation of language into the child's line of vision. Another important feature of language acquisition that affects eye gaze is joint attention. In spoken languages, joint attention involves the caregiver speaking about the object that the child is looking at. Deaf signing parents capitalize on moments of joint attention to provide language input. Deaf signing children learn to adjust their eye gaze to look back and forth between the object and the caregiver‚Äôs signing. To reduce the child's need for divided attention between an object and the caregiver's signing, a caregiver can position themselves and objects within the child's visual field so that language and the object can be seen at the same time. Sign languages appear naturally among deaf groups even if no formal sign language has been taught. Natural sign languages are much like English and Spanish in that they are true languages, and children learn them in similar ways. They also follow the same social expectations of language systems. Some studies indicate that if a deaf child learns sign language, he or she will be less likely to learn spoken languages because they will lose motivation. However, Humphries et al. found that there is no evidence for this. One of Humphries' arguments is that many hearing children learn multiple languages and do not lose the motivation to do so. Other studies have shown that sign language actually aids spoken language development. Understanding and using sign language provides the platform that is needed to develop other language skills. It can also provide the foundation for learning the meaning of written words. There are many different sign languages used around the world. Some of the main sign languages include American Sign Language, British Sign Language and French Sign Language. = American Sign Language (ASL) = ASL is mostly used in north America, though derivative forms are used in various places around the world including most of Canada. ASL is not simply a translation of English works, this is demonstrated by the fact that words that have dual meaning in English have different signs for each individual meaning in ASL. = British Sign Language (BSL) = BSL is mainly used in Great Britain, with derivatives being used in Australia and New Zealand. British sign language has its own syntax and grammar rules. It is different from spoken English though hearing people in America and the United Kingdom share a language, ASL and BSL are different meaning that deaf children in English speaking countries do not have a shared language. = French Sign Language (LSF) = LSF is used in France as well as many other countries in Europe. The influence of French sign language is apparent in other signed languages, including American sign language.  Acquisition of spoken language  Because 90-95% of deaf children are born to hearing parents, many deaf children are encouraged to acquire a spoken language. Deaf children acquiring spoken language use assistive technology such as hearing aids or cochlear implants, and work closely with speech language pathologists. Due to hearing loss, the spoken language acquisition process is delayed until such technologies and therapies are used. The outcome of spoken language acquisition is highly variable in deaf children with hearing aids and cochlear implants. One study of infants and toddlers with cochlear implants showed that their spoken language delays were still persistent three years post implantation. Another study showed that children with cochlear implants demonstrated persistent delays into elementary school with almost 75% of children‚Äôs spoken language skills falling below the average for hearing norms (See Figure 1). For children using hearing aids, spoken language outcomes in deaf children are correlated with the amount of residual hearing the child has. For children with cochlear implants, spoken language outcomes are correlated with or the amount of residual hearing the child had before implantation, age of implantation, and other factors that have yet to be identified. For newborns, the earliest linguistic tasks are perceptual. Babies need to determine what basic linguistic elements are used in their native language to create words (their phonetic inventory). They also need to determine how to segment the continuous stream of language input into phrases, and eventually, words. From birth, they have an attraction to patterned linguistic input, which is evident whether the input is spoken or signed. They use their sensitive perceptual skills to acquire information about the structure of their native language, particularly prosodic and phonological features. For deaf children who: receive cochlear implants early in life, are born to parents who use spoken language in the home, and pursue spoken language proficiency, research demonstrates that L1 language and reading skills are consistently higher for those children who have not been exposed to a signed language as an L1 or L2, and have instead focused exclusively on listening and spoken language development. In fact, \\"Over 70% of children without sign language exposure achieved age-appropriate spoken language compared with only 39% of those exposed for 3 or more years.\\" Children who focused primarily on spoken language also demonstrated greater social well- being when they did not use manual communication as a supplement. For a detailed description of spoken language acquisition in hearing children see: Language acquisition. = Cochlear implants= A cochlear implant is placed surgically inside the cochlea, which is the part of the inner ear that converts sound to neural signals. There is much debate regarding the linguistic conditions under which deaf children acquire spoken language via cochlear implantation. A singular, yet to be replicated, study concluded that long-term use of sign language impedes the development of spoken language and reading ability in deaf and hard of hearing children, and that using sign language is not at all advantageous, and can be detrimental to language development. However, studies have found that sign language exposure actually facilitates the development of spoken language of deaf children of deaf parents who had exposure to sign language from birth. These children outperformed their deaf peers who were born to hearing parents following cochlear implantation. New parents with a deaf infant are faced with a range of options for how to interact with their newborn, and may try several methods, including different amounts of sign language, oral/auditory language training, and communicative codes invented to facilitate acquisition of spoken language. In addition, parents may decide to use cochlear implants or hearing aids with their infants. According to one US-based study from 2008, approximately 55% of eligible deaf infants received cochlear implants. A study in Switzerland found that 80% of deaf infants were given cochlear implants as of 2006 and the numbers have been steadily increasing. While cochlear implants provide auditory stimulation, not all children succeed at acquiring spoken language completely. Many children with implants often continue to struggle in a spoken-language-only environment, even when support is given. Children who received cochlear implants before twelve months old were significantly more likely to perform at age-level standards for spoken language than children who received implants later. However, there is research that shows that the information given to parents is often not correct or missing important information; this can lead them to make decisions that might not be the best for their child. Parents need time to make informed decisions. As most deaf children are born to hearing parents, they have to make decisions on topics they have never considered. Research shows that deaf children with cochlear implants who listen and speak to communicate, but do not use sign language, have better communication outcomes and social well-being than deaf children who use sign language. However, sign language is often only recommended as a last resort, with parents being told not to use sign language with their child. Though implants offer many benefits for children, including potential gains in hearing and academic achievement, they are unable to fix deafness. A child who is born deaf will always be deaf, and they will likely still face many challenges that a hearing child will not. There is also research that shows that early deprivation of language and sign language, before an implant is fitted can affect the ability to learn language. There is no definitive research that states whether cochlear implants and spoken language, or singing has the best outcomes. Ultimately the decision comes down to the parents to make the choices that are best for their child.  Bilingual language acquisition  Some deaf children acquire both a sign language and a spoken language. This is called bimodal bilingual language acquisition. Bimodal bilingualism is common in hearing children of deaf adults (CODAs). One group of deaf children who experience bimodal bilingual language acquisition are deaf children with cochlear implants who have deaf parents. These children acquire sign language from birth and spoken language after implantation. Other deaf children who experience bimodal bilingual language acquisition are deaf children of hearing parents who have decided to pursue both spoken language and sign language. Some parents make the decision to pursue sign language while pursuing spoken language so as not to delay exposure to a fully accessible language, thereby starting the language acquisition process as early as possible. While some caution that sign language might interfere with spoken language, other research has shown that early sign language acquisition does not hinder and may in fact support spoken language acquisition.  Alternative communication approaches  For a review of educational methods including signing and spoken language approaches, see: Deaf education  Manually Coded English  Manually coded English is any one of a number of different representations of the English language that uses manual signs to encode English words visually. Although MCE uses signs, it is not a language like ASL; it is an encoding of English that uses hand gestures to make English visible in a visual mode. Most types of MCE use signs borrowed or adapted from American Sign Language, but use English sentence order and grammatical construction. However, it is not possible to fully encode a spoken language in the manual modality. Numerous systems of manually encoded English have been proposed and used with greater or lesser success. Methods such as Signed English, Signing Exact English, Linguistics of Visual English, and others use signs borrowed from ASL along with various grammatical marker signs, to indicate whole words, or meaning-bearing morphemes like -ed or -ing. Though there is limited evidence for its efficacy, some people have suggested using MCE or other visual representations of English as a way to support English language acquisition for deaf children. Because MCE systems are encodings of English which follow English word order and sentence structure, it is possible to sign MCE and speak English at the same time. This is a technique that is used in order to teach deaf children the structure of the English language not only through the sound and lip-reading patterns of spoken English, but also through manual patterns of signed English. Because of MCE uses English word order, it is hypothesized that it is easier for hearing people to learn MCE than ASL. Since MCE is not a natural language, children have difficulty learning it.  Cued speech  Cued speech is a hybrid, oral/manual system of communication used by some deaf or hard-of-hearing people. It is a technique that uses handshapes near the mouth (\\"cues\\") to represent phonemes that can be challenging for some deaf or hard-of-hearing people to distinguish from one another through speechreading (\\"lipreading\\") alone. It is designed to help receptive communicators to observe and fully understand the speaker. Cued speech is not a signed language, and it does not have any signs in common with ASL. It is a kind of augmented speechreading, making speechreading much more accurate and accessible to deaf people. The handshapes by themselves have no meaning; they only have meaning as a cue in combination with a mouth shape, so that the mouth shape 'two lips together' plus one handshape might mean an 'M' sound, the same shape with a different cue might represent a 'B' sound, and with a third cue might represent a 'P' sound. Some research shows a link between lack of phonological awareness and reading disorders, and indicate that teaching cued speech may be an aid to phonological awareness and literacy.  Fingerspelling  Another manual encoding system used by the deaf and which has been around for more than two centuries is fingerspelling. Fingerspelling is a system that encodes letters and not words or morphemes, so is not a manual encoding of English, but rather an encoding of the alphabet. As such, it is a method of spelling out words one letter at a time using 26 different handshapes. In the United States and many other countries, the letters are indicated on one handCarmel, Simon (1982). International hand alphabet charts. National Association of the Deaf (United States); 2nd edition. (June 1982). and go back to the deaf school of the Abbe de l'Epee in Paris. Since fingerspelling is connected to the alphabet and not to entire words, it can be used to spell out words in any language that uses the same alphabet. It is not tied to any one language in particular, and to that extent, it is analogous to other letter-encodings, such as Morse code, or semaphore. The Rochester Method relies heavily on fingerspelling, but it is slow and has mostly fallen out of favor.  Hybrid methods  Hybrid methods use a mixture of aural/oral methods as well as some visible indicators such as hand shapes in order to communicate in the standard spoken language by making parts of it visible to those with hearing loss. One example of this is sign supported English (SSE) which is used in the United Kingdom. It is a type of sign language that is used mainly with children who are hard of hearing in schools. It is used alongside English and the signs are used in the same order as spoken English. Another hybrid method is called Total Communication. This method of communication allows and encourages the user to use all methods of communication. These can include spoken language, signed language and lip reading. Like sign-supported English, signs are used in spoken English order. The use of hearing aids or implants is highly recommended for this form of communication. It is only recently that ASL has been an accepted form of communication to be used in the total communication method.  Language deprivation  Language deprivation occurs when a child is not immediately exposed to an easily and naturally accessible language during the critical period of language acquisition. The majority of children with some form of hearing loss cannot easily and naturally acquire spoken language. Naturally, this puts deaf children at a real disadvantage compared to hearing peers and places them at risk for serious developmental consequences such as neurological changes, stunted socio-emotional development, delays in academic achievement, limited employment outcomes, and poor mental and physical health.  Ethics and language acquisition  Cochlear implants have been the subject of a heated debate between those who believe deaf children should receive the implants and those who do not. Certain deaf activists believe this is an important ethical problem, claiming that sign language is their first or native language, just as any other spoken language is for a hearing person. They do not see deafness as a deficiency in any way, but rather a normal human trait amongst a variety of different ones. One issue on the ethical perspective of implantation is the possible side effects that may present after surgery. However, complications from cochlear implant surgery are rare, with some centers showing less than a three percent failure rate.  Relationship between language acquisition and other domains of development = Cognitive development  Early exposure and access to language facilitates healthy language acquisition, regardless of whether or not that language is native or non-native. in turn, strong language skills support the development of the child's cognitive skills, including executive functioning. Studies have shown that executive functioning skills are extremely important, as these are the skills that guide learning and behavior. Executive functioning skills are responsible for self-regulation, inhibition, emotional control, working memory, and planning and organization, which contribute to overall social, emotional and academic development for children. Early access to a language, whether signed or spoken, from birth supports the development of these cognitive skills and abilities in deaf and hard of hearing children, and supports their development in this area. However, late exposure to language and delayed language acquisition can inhibit or significantly delay the cognitive development of deaf and hard of hearing children, and impact these skills. Late exposure to language can be defined as language deprivation (see Language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children). This experience is the result of a lack of exposure to natural human language, whether that be spoken or signed language, during the critical language period. According to World Health Organization, approximately 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents; hearing parents that more often than not, and through no fault of their own, are not prepared to provide an accessible language to their children, therefore, some degree of language deprivation occurs in these children. Language Deprivation has been found to impair deaf children‚Äôs cognitive development, specifically their executive functioning skills and working memory skills, causing deficits in critical executive functioning skills and overall cognitive development. It is not deafness that causes these deficits, but delayed language acquisition that influences the cognitive development and abilities of deaf people.  Social- emotional development  Having an acquired language means an individual has had full access to at least one spoken or signed language.Typically, if a person has had this full access to language and has been able to acquire it, the foundation for their social emotional development is present. Being able to communicate is critical for those still developing their social skills. There is also evidence to suggest that language acquisition can play a critical role in developing Theory of Mind. For children who have not had this access or have not yet fully acquired a language, social development can be stunted or hindered, which in turn can affect one‚Äôs emotional development as well. The lack of socialization can significantly impact a child‚Äôs emotional well-being. A child‚Äôs first experience with social communication typically begins at home, but deaf and hard of hearing children in particular who are born to hearing parents tend to struggle with this interaction, due to the fact that they are a ‚Äúminority in their own family\\". Parents who have a deaf child typically do not know a signed language, the logistical problem becomes how to give that child exposure to language that the child can access. Without a method of communication between the child and parents, facilitating their child‚Äôs social skill development at home is more difficult. By the time these children enter school, they can be behind in this area of development. All of this can lead to struggles with age appropriate emotional development. It will be hard on a child who was not given a language early in life to try and express their emotions appropriately. The problem is not caused by deafness, it is caused by lack of communication that occurs when there is a lack of language access from birth. There is evidence to suggest that language acquisition is a predictor of how a child‚Äôs ability to develop theory of mind. Theory of mind can be an indicator of social and cognitive development. Without language acquisition, deaf children can become behind in theory of mind and the skills that coincide, which can lead to further social and emotional delays.  Academic development  Second language acquisition is also highly affected by early language exposure. More exposure in an accessible language leads to better performance in the second language upon entering school. Providing deaf and hard of hearing children with the most fluent language exposure possible from the earliest age possible promotes both first and second language acquisition. This means giving students the opportunity to develop language at home and in social environments early on supports the child's language acquisition in American Sign Language as well as printed English. There is extensive research regarding the correlation between proficiency in ASL and proficiency in English literacy skills. Deaf students who use ASL as their primary language tend to have higher English reading and writing scores when they also have a higher proficiency in ASL. There is also research to support that the development of a second language also improves proficiency in the student's first language According to Hrastinski & Wilbur (2016), American Sign Language proficiency is the single most contributing factor to the academic achievement of Deaf students who attend schools that teach with American Sign Language, particularly in the areas of reading literacy and math. Deaf and hard of hearing children who have higher levels of American Sign Language proficiency and those who have higher proficiency in a second language (e.g., English) are those who were exposed to American Sign Language during the critical period of language. = Reading = According to research from Goldin-Meadow & Mayberry, reading requires two essential abilities: familiarity with a language and understanding the mapping between that language and the written word. However, reading is possible if deaf children learn ASL. Once they have acquired ASL, deaf children learn how to map between sign language and print so that they can learn English. Several techniques are used to help bridge the gap between ASL and spoken language or the \\"translation process\\" such as sandwiching and chaining. Sandwiching consists of alternating between saying the word and signing it. Chaining consists of finger spelling a word, pointing to the spoken language version of the word and using pictorial support. Although chaining is not widely used, it creates an understanding between the visual spelling of a word and the sign language spelling of the word. This helps the child become bilingual in both ASL and spoken language. The deaf child's social context is crucial for nurturing his or her capacity to read. Research shows that deaf children born to deaf parents are usually better readers than deaf children born to hearing parents. This is because deaf parents provide a strong social and emotional network and may immediately have access to the necessary resources for their child. Deaf parents already anticipate the needs of their child, having been through the same experience, as opposed to a hearing parent.

Andreae Andreae & Co. (informally the Andreasche Apotheke or Andreae Pharmacy) was the first court pharmacy in Hanover and was owned by members of the Andreae family from 1645 to 1803. It was founded in 1639 on Klappenburg by Dr. Joachim J√§ger with a ducal privilege from Christian Louis, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. The pharmacy quickly came to serve the ducal court and became the official court pharmacy. As J√§ger became canonicus at Braunschweig, he sold the pharmacy to Johann Andreae in 1645 with permission from the Duke. The then-Hirsch Pharmacy in 1891 In 1657, the pharmacy was taken over by Ernst Andreas Hornbostel, who was married to Andreae's widow. Eleven years later, it was moved to a square near the ducal palace and Hornbostel was officially appointed court pharmacist. In 1679, Hornbostel died and his stepson, Ernst Leopold Andreae (born ca. 1640), succeeded him as court pharmacist. He is mentioned in 1673 as the \\"court pharmacist of the Dowager Princess\\", i.e. Elisabeth Sophie of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. In 1668, the Prince-Bishop of Osnabr√ºck, the later Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, had appointed Christian J√§ger as his court pharmacist in Iburg and Osnabr√ºck. When Ernest Augustus relocated to Hanover in 1680, J√§ger moved his pharmacy as well and demanded the status of court pharmacist and that the Andreae Pharmacy be closed because he claimed to be the \\"true court pharmacist.\\" This led to over 20 years of legal wrangling between J√§ger and Johann Andreae's children, which ended with a settlement.Quellen und Darstellungen zur Geschichte Niedersachsens, 1907, Historischer Verein f√ºr Niedersachsen, pp. 118‚Äì119 In 1732, the widow and children of the deceased court pharmacist Heinrich Leopold Andreae received a confirmation of their ducal privilege from George II. In 1747, his son Johann Gerhard Reinhard Andreae, the famous natural scientist, became owner of the pharmacy. He was also a noted philanthropist in Hanover. The botanist Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart worked as an apprentice in the firm under J.G.R. Andreae's ownership, and later named the genus Andreaea (the type genus of the family Andreaeaceae) for Andreae.Transactions of the Linnean Society of London, Volume 10, p. 381, Linnean Society of London, 1811 The Andreae family were one of the most highly regarded families in Hanover, and J.G.R. Andreae in particular was one of the city's major benefactors.\\"Andreae, Johann Gerhart Reinhart,\\" in Deutsche Biographische Enzyklop√§die, Walter de Gruyter publishing house, 2005, , Johann Gerhard Reinhard Andreae had no children of his own, but he had one sister, Sophie Elisabeth Andreae (1730‚Äì1764), who was married to the banker turned theatre director Abel Seyler. Following her death, her husband Abel Seyler gave up his paternal rights to their three children to his brother-in-law Andreae, who raised them as his own. They were Abel Jacob Gerhard Seyler (1756‚Äì1805), who became a court pharmacist and a member of the Illuminati, Ludwig Erdwin Seyler (1758‚Äì1836), who became a prominent banker and co-owner of Berenberg Bank, and Sophie Seyler (1762‚Äì1833), who married the poet Johann Anton Leisewitz. After Andreae's death in 1793, the Seyler siblings inherited the pharmacy, and employed Philipp Friedrich David Murray (1770‚Äì1828) as its administrator. In 1803, Abel Jacob Gerhard Seyler sold the pharmacy to Johann Ludewig Wilhelm Gruner, with a ducal privilege from George III. The pharmacy retained the name Andreae & Co. and remained widely known as the Andreae Pharmacy, even after the Andreae family's ownership ended in 1803. In the later half of the 19th century, the pharmacy was also known unofficially as the Hirsch Pharmacy (Hirsch-Apotheke). It was located in Calenbergerstrasse 28.

Studies have shown that its isolation for millennia helped to form a stable homogeneous population. In 2001 there were 28,000 cows and 1,300 bulls for natural and 6 for artificial insemination. The numbers are stable and 60% of females reproduce purebred. Morphology The breed has a tan coat with shades ranging from blond to dark wheat and gray. The belly is often lighter. The mucous membranes are dark. The lyre-shaped horns are brought up. The breed is of small size and low weight. Cows measures 1.15 m and 280 kg, the bulls 1.20 and 350 kg. Use Cows at Mausoleo. Today the breed is primarily for meat production. Formerly it was also used for traction, but its small size limited its capacity. It is not used for cheese because the Corsican cheese tradition was based on sheep and goat. Therefore, milk production is low but enough to raise a calf. *Good resistance to heat *Good ability to transform a poor diet *Good ability to replenish body reserves after times of scarcity (summer drought) *Easy calving (it only calves outdoors) *Excellent maternal qualities Currently two separate farming methods are practiced: In the mountains it is pure breed in areas where it is the only one to be profitable. There is extensive farming with the animals almost ranging free. This farm provides weanlings, young beef bulls and heifers for breeding.

It was listed in the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1975 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. History The university's library collection was originally housed in Hodgin Hall, but had outgrown that space by the 1920s. A new, dedicated library building was constructed on the site of Hadley Hall, an earlier university building that burned down in 1910. The new library was designed by the El Paso firm of Trost & Trost in collaboration with local architect Elson H. Norris and was completed in 1926 at a cost of $42,000. However, the library collection continued to grow rapidly and exceeded the capacity of the building after only a few years. In 1938 the new, much larger Zimmerman Library was completed, and the old library was remodeled into classroom and studio space using Works Progress Administration funding. The building was remodeled again in 1984‚Äì5, and currently houses graduate studios for Master of Fine Arts candidates in painting, photography, printmaking, and experimental art and technology. Architecture The Art Annex is a single story (with basement), flat-roofed building of brick bearing wall construction. Built during a transitional period in UNM's architectural history, it incorporates elements from a number of different styles including Pueblo Revival, Beaux-Arts, modernist, and Mayan. The building features a symmetrical, classically organized facade with banks of tall hopper windows to supply light to the interior reading areas. The strongly battered exterior walls are stuccoed and decorated with stylized vigas and other simple geometric elements.

The script is Greek minuscule. The Exhortation to the Greeks (; alternative Latin: '; ) is an Ancient Greek Christian paraenetic or protreptic text in thirty-eight chapters. Author and date Although the work is anonymous, it was wrongly ascribed to, and included in collections of the works of, Justin Martyr.Buitenwerf (2003), p. 78. . \\"Pseudo-Justin\\" became the current name when it was recognized that this author and Justin Martyr had significantly differing writing styles. Another difference is that the author of Exhortation to the Greeks, while nonetheless using Hellenistic period writers, rejects Greek thought, but Justin Martyr accepted the aspects of Greek philosophy which he felt were not in conflict with the gospels.Hardwick (1996), p. 379. By way of phraseological and formal comparison Riedweg argues compellingly that Pseudo-Justin is to be identified with Marcellus of Ancyra.Riedweg (1994), p. 167. Among previous commentators there was no consensus concerning the exact dating, but Hardwick (1989), pp. 38‚Äì41. Hardwick (1996), p. 379. Schreckenberg, Buitenwerf, and Hardwick agreed that the work was probably from the 4th century,Schreckenberg (1991), p. 52. Buitenwerf (2003), p. 78. Hardwick (1996), p. 379. which is in line with the biographical data of Marcellus of Ancyra. The work must not be confounded with Pseudo-Justin's Oratio ad Graecos or Oratio ad Gentiles, another writing erroneously transmitted under the name of Justin Martyr. Content Pseudo- Justin identifies Homer as the main source for the theological views of pagans, views which he criticizes.Hardwick (1996), p. 379. The theories of the pagan Greek thinkers, the author claims, share in this false Homeric heritage.Pseudo-Justin, chapter 2, p. 377. Pseudo-Justin instead offers up Moses as the source of proper theological views. He claims that Moses was more ancient‚Äîand thus, more authoritative‚Äîthan Homer or any other pagan writer.Pseudo-Justin, chapter 9, p. 384.The standard views of contemporary scholarship concerning the dating and authorship of Mosaic literature and Homeric literature are far more complex and reject anything like Pseudo- Justin's theories; see Documentary hypothesis and Homeric question. Coogan (2008), p. 20; Fowler (2004), p. 5. He also claims that many of the good ideas which pagan philosophers had were taken from Moses, including claiming that Plato read Moses and the Nevi'im.Pseudo-Justin, chapter 26, p. 405. While Augustine and other ancient writers also espoused theories like this concerning Plato, such a view is in now seen as \\"ludicrous\\".Droge (1989), p. 63. Pseudo-Justin starts his analysis of the pagan thinkers by looking at the teachings of the Milesian school, including Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes of Miletus. Together with the Milesians he adds Heraclitus, Hippasus, Anaxagoras, and Archelaus. He briefly mentions their various theories of \\"principle[s]\\" or \\"first cause[s]\\" (see arche); for example, Thales' theory that all matter comes from water.Pseudo-Justin, chapter 3, pp. 377‚Äì8. Next he mentions the theories of Pythagoras, Epicurus, and Empedocles. He concludes that all these Pre-Socratic philosophers and Epicurus (who was not Pre-Socratic) could not agree, and that this lack of agreement shows the weakness of their philosophy altogether.Pseudo-Justin, chapter 4, p. 379. Heraclitus is listed as coming from the same city as Hippasus‚ÄîMetapontum‚Äîalthough he in fact came from Ephesus.Guthrie (1962), p. 408. Next he considers Plato and Aristotle. Despite these two being the most well-regarded of the pagan philosophers, Pseudo-Justin concludes similarly as before: They widely do not agree with each other and are to be criticized for as much. For example, he says that Plato teaches that the human soul has three parts (see Plato's tripartite theory of soul), while Aristotle teaches that the human soul has only one, reasoning aspect (see On the Soul).Pseudo-Justin, chapter 6, p. 382. He also maintains that they contradict themselves as well. For example, he claims that Plato says at one time that there are three first causes, but then at another time that there are four. Again, he claims that Plato says that matter is uncreated, but then later contradicts himself and says that it is created.Pseudo-Justin, chapter 7, p. 382. The modern scholarly views on the relationship between Plato's and Aristotle's philosophies are varied and complex.Pellegrin (2006). See also Shields (2006); Anagnostopoulos (2009), pp. 22‚Äì25. In contrast with the disagreements between all the pagan philosophers, Pseudo-Justin commends the Christian teachers, who, he says, did not \\"contradict or argue with one another. Instead, without strife or quarrel, they passed on to us the knowledge they had received from God.\\"Pseudo-Justin, chapter 8, p. 383. He includes Moses as the oldest Christian teacher, although Christianity is normally understood as beginning after the life of Jesus.Woodhead (2004), p. 1. Many scholars have identified the text as Jewish in nature, on the basis of Pseudo-Justin's strong debt to Jewish thought. Another theory is that it is a particularly superficial reworking of Jewish material for Christian purposes (see split of early Christianity and Judaism).van der Horst (1998), p. 262. Pseudo-Justin also quotes and discusses some Sibylline oracles. He writes that some of these oracles teach the true religion, including monotheism.Pseudo-Justin, chapter 16, pp. 393‚Äì4; chapter 37, pp. 422‚Äì3. Pseudo-Justin's quotations and commentary are an important textual source for these oracles.Buitenwerf, pp. 65, 78‚Äì9. Editions There is an edition by Miroslav Marcovich including the text in the original Greek, and a summary and notes in English, published by De Gruyter in 1990.Marcovich (1990).

The ship was originally planned as SS Boadicea, for the Wilson and Furness-Leyland Line, but was acquired by the Atlantic Transport Line shortly after completion to replace ships requisitioned during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. She made a single voyage under the name Boadicea, and was renamed Marquette on 15 September 1898.  The sinking of Marquette  On 19 October 1915 the ship departed from Alexandria, Egypt, destined for Salonika (now Thessalonika) in Greece. The total ship's complement was 741: 95 crew, 6 Egyptians, the No 1 Stationary Hospital (36 nurses, 12 officers and 143 other ranks), and the Ammunition Column of the British 29th Division (10 officers and 439 other ranks). There were also 491 mules and 50 horses on board. Captain John Bell Findlay (born 1853 in Montrose, Scotland; died Essex 1938) was Master. On leaving Alexandria, the ship was accompanied by a French destroyer escort, however the escort left Marquette on the night of 22 October. At 9.15 a.m. on 23 October, the ship was hit by a torpedo on the starboard side and immediately listed to port. Some on board were killed by the explosion, while others were killed by lifeboats which were inexpertly launched - one, for example, fell onto another which was already in the water. The ship sank within ten minutes, with nurses, soldiers and crew still on board. Many survivors died in the water while waiting to be rescued. The Stationary Hospital had been allocated to a troop ship by the British authorities, despite the empty British hospital ship Grantully Castle having sailed on the same route on the same day from Egypt to the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki. The loss of nurses and medical staff led to the New Zealand government asking the War Office (via the Governor, Lord Liverpool) in November 1915 that transfers of medical staff be done by hospital ships where possibleAnniversary of sinking Subsequent voyages of the 1st New Zealand Stationary Hospital were made in hospital ships. Survivors Survivors were rescued about seven hours after the sinking by British ships HMHS Grantully Castle and HMS Lynn, and the French ships and . The surviving members of the Stationary Hospital sailed from Salonika back to Alexandria on 29 October, on the hospital ship HMHS Grantully Castle, and continued to serve for the remainder of the war. Survivors included New Zealanders surgeon Hugh Acland and nurses Minnie Jeffery, Mary Looney and Jean Erwin. Postcard in memory of the 32 New Zealanders lost in the Marquette sinking  Casualties  The first two rows of crosses commemorate the ten SS Marquette nurses who died 29 crew, 10 nurses and 128 troops died in the sinking. 32 of the dead were New Zealand nationals: 19 from the Royal New Zealand Army Medical Corps, 3 privates (medical orderlies) attached to the Stationary Hospital and 10 nurses from the Royal New Zealand Army Nursing Service.Photo of memorial postcard with names Casualties included:  Aftermath  A naval Court of Enquiry into the sinking was held on the protected cruiser in Salonika Harbour on 26 October. The report, dated 3 November, found that no-one was at fault. The sinking and the deaths of ten New Zealand nurses caused public outrage in New Zealand, particularly in the South Island where most of the nurses had come from. The deaths were used in propaganda to encourage men to recruit for the war. Medical staff had not needed to be on the troop transport ship, as a marked hospital ship had left the same port on the same day and would in theory have been safe from attack. In November 1915, New Zealand's governor Lord Liverpool requested future transfers of medical personnel be done by hospital ships if possible.  Discovery of the shipwreck  In 2009, the wreck of Marquette was located and verified by divers. The ship lies in of water approximately off the shore of Greece, in the Thermaikos Gulf. The British Embassy in Greece issued a protection order over the wreck.  Memorials  The names of the dead are recorded in the Mikra British Cemetery in Greece. The Nurses' Memorial Chapel at Christchurch Hospital in New Zealand commemorates the three Christchurch nurses who drowned. In October 2015, on the centenary of the sinking, memorial events were held in New Zealand. In Christchurch a historical display, a memorial service and a lecture were held and St Margaret's College performed a stage play based on the Marquette story, \\"Roses of No Man's Land\\". In Waimate, a memorial service was held and a commemorative plaque was unveiled.

The resolution was adopted on 10 December 1976 at the 31st Session of the UN General Assembly. The convention aims to prohibit the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques that have widespread, long-lasting, or severe effects. The convention entered into force on 5 October 1978. History According to the historical narrative of the U.S. Department of State, \\"although the use of environmental modification techniques for hostile purposes does not play a major role in military planning at the present time,\\" the U.S. Government sought that such techniques might be developed in the future and \\"would pose a threat of serious damage unless action was taken to prohibit their use.\\" Accordingly, in July 1972, the U.S. Government renounced the use of climate modification techniques for hostile purposes, even if their development were proved to be feasible in the future. The following year, they called for international agreement to avoid the military use of environmental and geophysical modifications and, after exploring the possible uses, reached out to the former Soviet Union (USSR). In 1974 and 1975, U.S. President Richard Nixon and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev held three sets of discussions on the issue. In 1975, the two nations began negotiating specific terms at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD). Finalized in 1976, the agreed text was sent to the UN General Assembly for consideration during the fall session. On 10 December 1976, the resolution was approved with 96 to 8 votes, 30 abstaining.

As a promoter and manager he was a founder of Frontier Touring Company (1979‚Äì99) and Michael Chugg Entertainment (2000‚Äìpresent). On 8 June 1998 he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia with the citation \\"for service to music and the performing arts, particularly in relation to the promotion of Australian artists and to fundraising for youth and children's charities\\". In 2010 he co-authored his autobiography, Hey, You in the Black T-Shirt: The Real Story of Touring the World's Biggest Acts, with journalist, Iain Shedden. In March 2014 on the 50th anniversary of his start as a promoter, Denis Handlin (CEO of Sony Music Australia) opined \\"Chuggy is noisy, wild, cantankerous, the oldest teenager I know and very often a nightmare to deal with. But somehow we all love him because he lives and sweats the business with 100 per cent persistence and passion\\". At the ARIA Music Awards of 2019 Chugg received the ARIA Industry Icon Award. Biography Michael Glenn Chugg was born on 15 June 1947 in Launceston to Victor Chugg and Lorna (n√©e Hancock). Note: His first names are given as Michiel Glen. Chugg was the eldest of four children, while his grandmother, Ella Chugg, was his \\"best friend\\". He credits his great- grandfather with his idiosyncratic use of profanity \\"the first thing he did was taught me to swear. And it's always been a major part of my delivery of things. There might have been one or two instance over the 40 years where I was probably out of order but in the main it's usually been because it needed to be done\\". He attended Glen Dhu Primary School and then Queechy High School. Chugg's career as a promoter began on 16 March 1964, when at 16 he organised a dance at the Trades Hall in Launceston for the local cycling club. About 300 people turned up for a profit of ¬£80. He was an amateur cyclist, he volunteered to be a track announcer and then became a sports broadcaster for horse races, trotting, greyhounds and football. His career as a Tasmanian radio announcer ended after he called a live Melbourne greyhound race: the lead dog was ahead by five lengths as he commentated, \\"Well, I'll be fucked, it's fallen over\\". Chugg started \\"running dances all over Tasmania ... I was just a working class kid\\". He became the band manager of local artists, The Chevrons, and arranged performances of visiting mainland acts, including Bobby and Laurie and The Easybeats. Chugg moved to Melbourne in 1967 where he worked for the Australian Musicians Booking Organisation (AMBO), run by Gary Spry, Jeff Joseph and Darryl Sambell. At AMBO he met a 16-yr old, Michael Gudinski, whom Chugg described as \\"this young guy there with red hair and a big nose who was booking all these new bands\\", they became friends, business associates and sometime rivals. In the late 1960s Gudinski, together with Michael Browning, set up the Consolidated Rock Agency, Chugg started working for them. In 1970 Chugg married Liselotte 'Lilo' Reisner, later that year Consolidated Rock opened a Sydney office and Chugg moved there to run it with Phil Walker. In June 1971 Consolidated Rock organised a concert at the Sydney Town Hall featuring Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs and Daddy Cool. Whilst well attended the organisers were criticised by attendees and, in particular, a music newspaper, Go-Set. As a result, Consolidated Rock launched a rival magazine, The Daily Planet, however its high running costs resulted in the closure of the magazine and Consolidated Rock. Chugg and fellow agent Roger Davies then opened a new agency, Sunrise, in Sydney in late 1971. Their clients included Sherbet. It became a national company when it joined with Phillip Jacobsen's Melbourne- based, Let It Be agency, which handled Daddy Cool and Spectrum. When Davies left in 1975, to continue his career in the United States, Chugg was invited to join Gudinski's Premier Artists agency. At the same time, Chugg was managing acts and working as a freelance tour coordinator with Paul Dainty Corporation. He also spent time overseas, including the United Kingdom, managing Richard Clapton, and Kevin Borich. Frontier Touring Company was founded in 1979 by nine people: Chugg, Gudinski, Jacobsen, Ray Evans, Sam Righi, Frank Stivala, Glenn Wheatley, Steve White and Robbie Williams. Wheatley and White left the company shortly after to concentrate on promoting their clients, Little River Band, in the US, with the remaining partners buying out their shares. In October 1980 Chugg and Gudinski were involved in an attempt to revive a national Battle of the Sounds competition, which had last run in 1972. The 1980 winner, Little Heroes, was one of three bands representing Victoria with three others from New South Wales, and three more from Queensland ‚Äì other states were not represented. Whilst arranging and promoting national tours for Squeeze, The Police, The Cure and Gary Numan, Chugg also took on the management of Jimmy and the Boys, The Church and The Sunnyboys. In January 1983 Chugg, with other concert promoters, staged the first Narara Music Festival, which was attended by over 30,000 people and grossed over $1.5 million. In 1999, Chugg left Frontier Touring Company after 20 years with the organisation, and founded Michael Chugg Entertainment (MCE) the following year. He later recalled: In 2000 Chugg was co-producer of the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the Paralympic Games in Sydney and he was awarded 'International Promoter of the Year' by Pollstar. Initially MCE had backing from the Packer family's Consolidated Press Entertainment (CPE), but according to Stuart Coupe this was terminated because of CPE's unwillingness to back tours which Chugg was promoting, notably CPE's refusal to back Bob Dylan's 2001 tour, although Chugg and Dainty, then-CPE chairman, give differing accounts of their disagreements. Long Way to the Top was an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) six-part TV documentary on the history of Australian rock and roll from 1956 to the modern era. \\"Episode 3: Billy Killed the Fish\\", was broadcast on 29 August 2001, and featured interviews with Chugg, Thorpe and Lobby Loyde. They described their Sunbury festival experiences and the development of pub rock in Australia. According to Chugg, an Aztec performance at Sydney's Bondi Lifesaver club in 1974 was so continuously loud as to kill a full tank of tropical fish in an upstairs area ‚Äì hence the episode title. During August 2002, promoters Chugg and Kevin Jacobsen, with Thorpe as co-producer, organised a related concert tour, Long Way to the Top, which featured many of the artists from the TV series. Note: On-line copy has limited view. Performances at two Sydney concerts in September were recorded, broadcast on ABC-TV and subsequently released on DVD in December. From late 2002 to early 2003 MCE promoted Australia and New Zealand tours by Santana and Red Hot Chili Peppers, both of which made substantial financial losses for the company. In December 2004 Chugg together with Daryl Herbert and Glenn Wheatley purchased a 50% share of the company running the East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival, an annual music festival held over the Easter long weekend at Byron Bay, New South Wales. In 2006 Chugg Entertainment, in conjunction with Backrow Productions, expanded into musical theatre producing the musical, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, which debuted at the Lyric Theatre, Sydney in October that year. That year also saw Chugg Entertainment partner with the organisers of the Laneway Festival expanding the event to Sydney. The Laneway Festival has subsequently expanded to include events in Brisbane (2007), Adelaide (2008), Perth (2009), Auckland (2010), Singapore (2011) and Detroit (2013). In September 2012 Chugg Entertainment entered into a partnership with the promoters of the Homebake musical festival, held at the Domain every December. The 2013 event however was cancelled following poor ticket sales after the festival was forced to relocate to the steps of the Sydney Opera House. In 2013 he launched Chugg Music, his own record label, signing Australian bands, The Griswolds, Deep Sea Arcade, Sheppard, Major Leagues, Casey Barnes, Lime Cordiale and New Zealand outfit Avalanche City. On 25 February 2014 Chugg expanded the label into the US.  Personal life  In 1970 Chugg married Liselotte \\"Lilo\\" Reisner, from a German immigrant family. Chugg's first child was born in 1977. Chugg and Liselotte divorced in 1983. In 1987 he married Lisa Slattery and in 1988 his daughter was born. His second son was born in 1991. In 1993 Michael divorced Lisa. In 2002 while visiting the US, Chugg had a heart attack. As of March 2008 his partner was Chutimon Yensai, whom he met in Thailand. Chugg was a chain-smoker and was noted for uttering profanities in on-stage rants, including yelling at incoming patrons with \\"hey, you in the black t-shirt, stop fucking running!\\" In 2010 he co-authored his autobiography, Hey, You in the Black T-Shirt: The Real Story of Touring the World's Biggest Acts, with journalist, Iain Shedden. In March 2014 on the 50th anniversary of his start as a promoter, Denis Handlin (CEO of Sony Music Australia) opined \\"Chuggy is noisy, wild, cantankerous, the oldest teenager I know and very often a nightmare to deal with. But somehow we all love him because he lives and sweats the business with 100 per cent persistence and passion\\".  Charities and causes  As of 2002 Michael Chugg had raised more than $20 million (AUS) for various charities. Chugg was a co-organiser of WaveAid, held on 29 January 2005, to support victims of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. John Watson of Eleven Music recalled \\"Mark Pope, convinced us that we needed [Chugg's] help ... we were all very hesitant because Michael was really from a different generation and, let's face it, he had a reputation. Within hours [he] had sorted the SCG as the venue by means that do not bear repeating here and we all realised we'd completely underestimated him. It would never have happened without [him]. He'd be the first to admit he's no saint but the amount he's done for charity over the years is truly staggering\\". In November 2005 Chugg was the patron of Amplified, a presentation for industry leaders and fans of Tasmanian musicians. Live Earth's Sydney concert on 7 July 2007 was promoted by MCE, with Chugg also a presenter ‚Äì it was billed as a \\"climate change awareness\\" concert. In 2009 Chugg and Gudinski, were the co-organizers of Sound Relief, a multi-venue rock music concert held simultaneously in Melbourne and Sydney to raise funds for those affected by the February 2009 Victorian bushfires. The event raised over $8 million (AUS) for Red Cross Victorian Bushfire Appeal and The Premier's Disaster Relief Fund Appeal in Queensland. Awards and honours In 1993 Michael Chugg was named Australia's 'Father of the Year'. He received the award on the same day that he filed for divorce from his second wife. He was voted International Promoter of the Year by Performance Magazine readers (1997), and by Pollstar (2000, 2009, and 2010). On 8 June 1998 he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia with a citation \\"for service to music and the performing arts, particularly in relation to the promotion of Australian artists and to fundraising for youth and children's charities\\". In 2005 he received the 'Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music' at the APRA Awards. At the 2007 Country Music Association Awards Chugg was announced as was the winner of the 'Jo Walker Meador International Award' ‚Äì recognising outstanding achievement by an individual in advocating and supporting Country Music's marketing development in territories outside the US. In 2008 he received an Arthur Award for 'Outstanding Contribution to Live Music' at the 20th International Live Music Conference. In 2011 he received 'The Immortal' award (a lifetime achievement award for outstanding contributions to popular culture) at The 2nd Annual Rolling Stone Awards in Sydney, Australia. In 2013 he was nominated for the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2013.

It has been designed at the University of Alberta to assist with the process of evaluating and validating protein structures solved by NMR spectroscopy. Structure validation Structure validation is a particularly important component of the structure determination pipeline as many protein structures have small structural errors (i.e. distorted bond lengths or angles, incompatible torsion angles, overlapping atoms) that are not easily detected by visual inspection. For protein structures solved by NMR spectroscopy, where large numbers of structures are generated and where coordinate inaccuracies are common, this problem is particularly acute. Methodology Most NMR-based structure validation protocols primarily use NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement), J-coupling or residual dipolar coupling (RDC ) data to assess or validate structures. In particular, they try to assess the agreement between the experimentally observed and the calculated NOEs, RDCs and/or J-couplings. Good agreement between the calculated and observed parameters normally indicates a good structure. Other methods for structure validation (such as ProCheck, MolProbity, ResProx and VADAR) focus on measuring coordinate data, rather than experimental data, to assess the quality of the bond or torsion angle geometry. PROSESS is unique among structure validation servers in that it evaluates both coordinate quality and experimental data quality. PROSESS is also able to use NMR chemical shifts (as well as NOEs) to assess or validate protein structures. Chemical shifts are easily and very precisely measurable NMR observables that provide a great deal of information about protein structure and dynamics (see Protein Chemical Shift Prediction). Specifically, PROSESS assesses the agreement between observed chemical shifts and ShiftX- predicted HA, CA, CB, N, C, and HN NMR chemical shifts. In addition to its ability to validate structures using chemical shifts, PROSESS also checks many other protein structure parameters including covalent bond quality, non- covalent bond and atomic packing quality, torsion angle quality and NOE quality (i.e. measuring the model agreement with NOE-based distance restraints). A total of 8 different programs (see PROSESS sub-programs below) are used in the PROSESS evaluation and validation process. PROSESS can handle single-chain X-ray models, multi-chain X-ray models, single-chain NMR ensembles, multi-chain NMR ensembles of monomeric and multimeric proteins. In addition to being able to validate NMR protein structures, PROSESS can be used to validate or evaluate any protein model, regardless of how it was solved (X-ray, NMR, comparative modelling, etc.). Output PROSESS generates a detailed and colorful structure validation report, including tables, color- coded images and graphs or bar charts. Many of the tables contain embedded hyperlinks to additional details or explanations. For most of its graphs and charts, PROSESS uses a simple RAG (red, amber, green) color scheme to indicate the quality of different structure parameters for the protein (as a whole), for different members of the structure ensemble, for specific residues and for specific atoms. Different shades of red indicate serious problems, different shades of yellow or amber indicate potential problems and different shades of green indicate that the protein model or its residues/atoms are free of problems. Each color is also assigned a number (ranging from 0 to 9with 0 being bad and 9 being excellent) so that the structure quality assessment is more quantifiable. PROSESS's quality indices and quality color scales have been designed specifically to help non-structural biologists to more easily and rapidly understand protein structure validation reports.

CS23D combines maximal fragment assembly with chemical shift threading, de novo structure generation, chemical shift-based torsion angle prediction, and chemical shift refinement. CS23D makes use of RefDB and ShiftX. CS23D input formats CS23D accepts chemical shift files in either SHIFTY or BMRB formats. CS23D options  A user can # Exclude a protein from being used as the template # Ignore high-identity homologs in the list of available templates # Change the number of models in the final ensemble # Change the number of model optimization steps CS23D output CS23D output consists of a set of 10 best-score PDB coordinates. A hyperlink to the single best score structure is also provided. The overall CS23D score, knowledge-based score, chemical shift score, Ramachandran plot statistics, correlations between the observed and calculated shifts before and after refinement are displayed. A conclusion about structure reliability is given to the user. CS23D protocol Homology search: The query sequence is used to find homologous proteins or/and protein fragments in a non-redundant database of PDB sequences and secondary structures of PPT-DB using BLAST. Homology modelling: Homology modelling is done by the Homodeller program, which is a part of the PROTEUS2 program. The proteins that are identified during the homology search step are used as the templates in homology modelling. Chemical shift re-referencing: Chemical shifts are re-referenced by the RefCor, which is a part of the RCI webserver backend. Secondary structure prediction from chemical shifts: Secondary structure is predicted from chemical shifts by CSI. Torsion angle prediction from chemical shifts: Torsion angles are predicted from chemical shifts by PREDITOR. Chemical shift threading: Backbone Phi and Psi torsion angles predicted from chemical shifts by PREDITOR are mapped into nine different regions in Ramachandran space, each of which are assigned specific letters. A protein can represented by a sequence of these nine \\"torsion angle letters\\". Thrifty is using these sequences of torsion angle letters to identify good templates in a database of ‚àº18 500 nonredundant PDB structures that have had their structures converted to the nine-letter Ramachandran \\"alphabet\\". In a similar manner, chemical shift threading is additionally done using three-letter secondary structure alphabet (H for helix, B for beta-strand, C for coil) and secondary structure predicted from chemical shifts by the CSI program. Model assembly: Subfragments identified by homology modelling and chemical shift threading steps are assembled into initial 3D models using CS23D SFassembler (SubFragment assembler). The initial models are evaluated by the GAFolder scoring function (see below) and the best model is further refined by GAFolder (see more info about GAFolder below). Ab initio folding: Ab initio folding is done by Rosetta when no template was identified by the homology modelling and chemical shift threading steps. Rosetta models are evaluated by GAFolder scoring function and the best Rosetta models are refined by GAFolder (see below). Model optimization: Model optimization in CS23D is done by a torsion-angle-based minimizer GAfolder (Genetic Algorithm folder) that uses a genetic algorithm to sample conformation space. The method is similar to that employed by GENFOLD. GAFolder makes torsion angles moves within the ranges defined by the values and uncertainties of torsion angles predicted by PREDITOR. GAFolder evaluates protein models by the scoring function described below. Scoring function: Scoring function of GAFolder consists of knowledge based scores and chemical shift scores. The knowledge-based scores include: # radius of gyration score, # hydrogen bond energy, # number of hydrogen bonds, # bad contacts score, # disulfide bond score, # modified threading energy based on the Bryant and Lawrence potential. # Ramachandran score that evaluates normality of model torsion angles Phi and Psi # Omega score that evaluates normality of model torsion omega angles # Chi score that is based on expected chi angles for different phi and psi combinations. The chemical shift component of the GAfolder scoring function uses: # weighted coefficients of correlation between the experimental chemical shifts (CA, CB, CO, N, HA, HN) and chemical shifts calculated by SHIFTX 1.0. # agreement between model secondary structure and secondary structure predicted by CSI from experimental chemical shifts.

Therefore, its performance depends on sequence identity of the selected template(s), see the adjacent picture. Likewise, Rosetta is a fragment-biased method. Its performance depends on the quality of selected fragments. Fragment quality and, thus, Rosetta performance can be improved by using chemical shifts during the fragment selection step (e.g. in CS-Rosetta protocol). For a structural solution that is not biased by a template structure or fragment structure, one may want to consider obtaining NOE-based distance restraints (8-10 per residue) and using them with the GeNMR program in its ab initio mode.

Every part of the body is connected to a corresponding area in the brain which creates a cortical map. When something happens to disrupt the cortical maps such as an amputation or a change in neuronal characteristics, the map is no longer relevant. The part of the brain that is in charge of the amputated limb or neuronal change will be dominated by adjacent cortical regions that are still receiving input, thus creating a remapped area. Remapping can occur in the sensory or motor system. The mechanism for each system may be quite different. Cortical remapping in the somatosensory system happens when there has been a decrease in sensory input to the brain due to deafferentation or amputation, as well as a sensory input increase to an area of the brain. Motor system remapping receives more limited feedback that can be difficult to interpret. Cortical map representation of a dog by David Ferrier  History = Localization  Wilder Penfield, a neurosurgeon, was one of the first to map the cortical maps of the human brain. When performing brain surgeries on conscious patients, Penfield would touch either a patient's sensory or motor brain map, located on the cerebral cortex, with an electric probe to determine if a patient could notice either a specific sensation or movement in a particular area on their body. Penfield also discovered that the sensory or motor maps were topographical; areas of the body adjacent to one another would likely be adjacent on the cortical maps. Due to Penfield's work, the scientific community concluded that the brain must be fixed and unchangeable because a specific area of the brain corresponds to a particular point on the body. However, this conclusion was challenged by Michael Merzenich, whom many call \\"the world's leading researcher on brain plasticity.\\"  Plasticity  In 1968, Merzenich and two neurosurgeons, Ron Paul and Herbert Goodman, conducted an experiment to determine effects on the brain after a large bundle of peripheral nerves in adolescent monkeys' hands were cut and began to regenerate again. They knew that the peripheral nervous system could regenerate itself and sometimes during that process the neurons would 'rewire' themselves by accident. These 'wires' would accidentally connect to a different axon, stimulating the wrong nerve. This resulted in a \\"false localization\\" sensation; when the patient was touched on a specific area of the body, that touch was actually felt on a different part of the body than expected. To better understand this phenomenon in the brain, they used micro- electrodes to micromap the monkey's cortical map of its hand. The peripheral nerves were cut and sewn close together to observe evidence of axon 'wires' crossing during regeneration. After seven months, the cortical map of the monkeys' hands were remapped and it was found that the map appeared to be essentially normal, with no 'wire crossing' as expected. They concluded if a cortical map was able to \\"normalize\\" itself when stimulated with an irregular input that the adult brain must be plastic. This experiment helped inspire questioning of the scientific \\"truth\\" that the adult brain is fixed and cannot continue to change outside of the critical period, especially by Merzenich. Later in his career, Merzenich conducted an experiment that highlighted the existence of cortical remapping and neuroplasticity. Merzenich and fellow neuroscientist, Jon Kaas, cut the median nerve of a monkey's hand, which delivers sensation to the middle of the hand, to see what the median nerve map would look like when all input was cut off after a period of two months. When the hand was remapped, it was found that when the middle of the hand was touched no activity occurred at the median nerve location. But when the sides of the monkey's hand were touched, activity was found in the median nerve location on the map. This meant that cortical remapping had occurred at the median nerve; the nerves that correlated to the outsides of the monkey's hand had remapped themselves to take over the 'cortical real estate' that was now available due to the median nerve being disconnected.  Sensory system  Sensory system remapping can potentially self-organize due to the spatiotemporal structure of input. This means that the location and timing of the input is critical for remapping in the sensory system. A study by Gregg Recanzone demonstrates this by seeing if a monkey could distinguish between a stimulus of high and low frequency vibrations, delivered to the tip of its finger at a fixed location. Over time, the monkey got better at identifying the differences in vibration frequency. When the finger was mapped, the map was found to be degraded and unrefined. Because the stimuli were done at a fixed location, everything was excited and therefore selected, resulting in a crude map. The experiment was conducted again except, the location of the high and low vibrations were varied at different parts of the monkey's fingertip. As before, the monkey improved over time. When the monkey's finger was remapped it was found that the crude map from before had been replaced with an elegant map of the fingertip showing all the different places stimulation had occurred on different locations of the fingertip. This study showed that over a period of time, a map could be created from a localized stimulus and then altered by a location variable stimulus. Cerebrum lobes  Motor system  Motor system remapping, as compared to sensory system remapping, receives more limited feedback that can be difficult to interpret. When looking at motor system maps, you find that the last pathway for movement to occur in the motor cortex does not actually activate the muscles directly but causes decreased motor neuron activity. This means, there is a possibility that remapping in the motor cortex can come from changes in the brainstem and spinal cord, locations that are difficult to experiment on, due to challenging access. A study done by Anke Karl helps demonstrate why the motor system may be dependent on the sensory system in regard to cortical remapping. The study found a strong connection between motor and somatosensory cortical remapping after amputation and phantom limb pain. The study assumed that somatosensory cortex reorganization can affect plasticity in the motor system because stimulation of the somatosensory cortex prompts long term potentiation in the motor cortex. The study concluded that reorganization of the motor cortex may only be subsidiary to cortical changes in the somatosensory cortex. This helps support why feedback to the motor system is limited and difficult to determine for cortical remapping.  Application  Cortical remapping helps individuals regain function from injury.  Phantom limbs  Phantom limbs are sensations felt by amputees that make it feel like their amputated extremity is still there. Sometimes amputees can experience pain from their phantom limbs; this is called phantom limb pain (PLP). Phantom limb pain is considered to be caused from functional cortical reorganization, sometimes called maladaptive plasticity, of the primary sensorimotor cortex. Adjustment of this cortical reorganization has the potential to help alleviate PLP. One study taught amputees over a two-week period to identify different patterns of electrical stimuli being applied to their stump to help reduce their PLP. It was found that the training reduced PLP in the patients and reversed the cortical reorganization that had previously occurred. However, a recent study by Tamar R. Makin suggests that instead of PLP being caused by maladaptive plasticity, it may actually be pain induced. The maladaptive plasticity hypothesis suggests that once afferent input is lost from an amputation, cortical areas bordering the same amputation area will begin to invade and take over the area, affecting the primary sensorimotor cortex, seeming to cause PLP. Makin now argues that chronic PLP may actually be 'triggered' by \\"bottom-up nociceptive inputs or top-down inputs from pain-related brain areas\\" and that the cortical maps of the amputation remain intact while the \\"inter-regional connectivity\\" is distorted.  Stroke  The mechanisms involved in stroke recovery mirror those related to brain plasticity. Tim H. Murphy describes it as, \\"Stroke recovery mechanisms are based on structural and functional changes in brain circuits that have a close functional relationship to those circuits affected by stroke.\\" Neuroplasticity after a stroke is enabled by new structural and functional circuits that are formed through cortical remapping. A stroke occurs when there is not enough blood flow to the brain, causing debilitating neurological damage. The tissue that surrounds the infarct (stroke damaged area) has reduced blood flow and is called the penumbra. Though the dendrites in the penumbra have been damaged due to the stroke, they can recover during the restoration of blood flow (reperfusion) if done within hours to a few days of the stroke due to time sensitivity. Due to reperfusion in the peri-infarct cortex (found next to the infarct), the neurons can help with active structural and functional remodelling after stroke. Initial stages of cortical development Cortical remapping is activity-dependent and competitive. The recovering peri-infarct regions that have bad circuits are competing with healthy tissue for cortical map space. An in vivo study by Murphy was done using mice to help identify the sequence and kinetics of the peri-infarct cortical remapping after stroke. The study showed that eight weeks after a stroke had occurred in the forelimb sensory cortex of a mouse, the 'surviving' portion was able to promptly relay enhanced sensory signals to the motor cortex, which resulted in the remapping of sensory function. The mouse that experienced a stroke had remapped responses that lasted longer and spread farther from the motor cortex than those of the control. This means that recovery of the sensorimotor functions after stroke and cortex remodeling suggests changes in the temporal and spatial spread of sensory information. A model for stroke recovery suggested by Murphy, involves beginning with homeostatic mechanisms (neurons receive proper amount of synaptic input) at the start of stroke recovery. This will restart activity in stroke-affected areas through structural and functional circuit changes. Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity can then strengthen and refine circuits when some of the sensory and motor circuitry is spared. Regions of the brain with partial function can have their circuits recover over a few days to weeks through remapping. Cortical remapping after a stroke is comparable to initial brain development. For example, remapping that occurs in motor recovery after a stroke is similar to an infant learning skilled movement patterns. Though this is very important information on developing recovery plans for stroke patients, it is important to keep in mind that the circuitry of a stroke patient is quite different from that of a developing brain, and could be less receptive.

All 18 passengers and crew on board were killed. The crash was the worst in Alaskan commercial aviation at the time, as well as the first crash of a Pan Am four-engine aircraft. An investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, the precursor to the NTSB) was unable to determine probable cause and it remains unknown to this day.  Flight history  Flight 923 was a regularly-scheduled Pan American Airways flight between Seattle and Juneau, with a scheduled stopover at Annette Island Airport. The aircraft left Seattle at 10:30 A.M. on October 26, 1947. It was scheduled to arrive in Juneau around 3:00 P.M. that same day. There were five Pan Am crew members aboard: three cockpit crew and two pursers. The pilot was Captain Alf N. Monsen, a veteran pilot with 13,565 hours of flying time. His copilot was First Officer Laurence A. Foster, another captain who was serving as copilot and first officer due to personnel reductions at Pan Am. The flight engineer was C. L. Dunwoody.Civil Aeronautics Board. Docket #SA-155. File #1-0099-47.Accident Investigation Report: Pan American Airways -- Annette Island, Alaska -- October 26, 1947 . US Department of Transportation. Accessed online on November 17, 2013. (The report is indexed at NTLL Special Collections The aircraft for the flight was a Douglas DC-4, a four-engine propliner, registration NC88920, and had been in service since 1944, accumulating 4,146 hours of flying time. Maintenance records obtained by the CAB after the crash indicated that the airplane was in good working condition, with no reported mechanical failures or issues. The aircraft departed Seattle on schedule at 10:30 A.M.. There were 13 passengers aboard, along with of cargo and of fuel. The aircraft was well within weight and load limits, and was only carrying a quarter of its usual capacity of 44 passengers. Prior to departure, Captain Monsen received a weather report from Pan American's meteorologist, which indicated that a cold front would be passing through Annette Island prior to the flight's arrival. The first leg of the journey was uneventful, up until the aircraft reached the radio range station near the Annette airport. The radio range station was located northwest of the airport. Air Traffic Control cleared the flight to pass over the range station at 7,000 feet and then to proceed with a normal landing. Captain Monsen acknowledged the clearance at 1:38 PM and reported his position over the range station at 7,000 feet. Five minutes later, at 1:43, the Captain radioed Annette control tower and aborted his approach. He reported extreme turbulence at lower elevations, and indicated that he would instead continue to Juneau without landing at Annette. This was the last radio contact made with the aircraft. After Captain Monsen had radioed his intent to Juneau, the control tower radioed an acknowledgement and asked for Flight 923's altitude. When the control tower was unable to reestablish radio communications, the station issued an alert that Flight 923 had gone missing. The alert was issued at 2:01 P.M..  Search and recovery  Initial search and rescue operations were hampered by severe weather and the arrival of the cold front forecasted by the Pan Am meteorologist. Further complicating search efforts was the fact that the DC-4 was carrying enough fuel for it to return to Seattle. One newspaper reported Pan American officials as stating that the aircraft was carrying enough fuel to continue flying until 8:40 P.M. Initial search operations were undertaken by the United States Coast Guard as well as the Army Air Force's Alaska command. The army sent B-17s and a C-47 to aid in the search. However snow, fog, heavy winds of , and severe icing conditions around the airport limited the abilities of searchers and completely hid the crash scene from view. Search teams from the Coast Guard located the scene of the crash at 8:45 A.M. (PST) on October 31, five days after the plane had disappeared. The wreckage lay on the north face of Tamgas mountain, a peak approximately east of the Annette Island air field. The DC-4 had flown into the mountain approximately below the summit. Initial reports indicated that the tail section of the plane was clearly visible on the mountain side. The CAB team sent on site to investigate, determined that the wreckage was buried under significant snowfall on a part of the mountain that was difficult to access by foot. The CAB determined that they would be unable to continue with the investigation until the snow melted. Instead, the Coast Guard members and CAB employees retrieved the bodies of the victims from the scene, a process which took several days due to ongoing foul weather.  Investigation  Pan Am Flight 923 was the first crash of a Pan American four-engined aircraft. At the time of the crash, it was also the deadliest crash in Alaskan commercial aviation. It was the 31st worst accident at the time, in terms of loss of life, and remains the 195th worst accident . The Civil Aeronautics Board began its investigation at 2:30 P.M. on October 26, 1947, less than an hour after the last known communication with Flight 923. Once the wreckage was located, investigators flew a seaplane to a lake near the foot of Tamgas mountain and accompanied Coast Guard members up to the crash site. The wreckage of the plane was scattered over an area of at a position below the summit of the mountain. When investigators reached the scene, it was snowing heavily and it was determined that the investigation could not continue until the snow had melted in the summer thaw. The investigation therefore resumed in late August 1948, the time of maximum thaw on the mountain. Investigators were able to gather little from the wreckage, most of which was severely damaged by the crash and the subsequent flash fire. The only instrument with readable settings which could be salvaged was the fluxgate compass, which was used to confirm the aircraft's heading. Propeller marks on the cliff face also confirmed the aircraft's heading and indicated that the aircraft was pitched nose upwards as it tried to climb. The propellers themselves were broken in such a fashion to indicate that they were functioning normally at impact. It was impossible to determine, however, the aircraft's speed at the time of the crash due to a lack of surviving instruments. Investigators were also able to determine that all of the damage to the plane was incurred during or after the crash; there was no indication of a midair mechanical failure.  Incorrect charts  Initial newspaper reports indicated that the height of Tamgas Mountain was misrepresented on aviation charts. These charts indicated that the mountain was tall. Reporters who toured the crash site from aircraft reported that the mountain was in fact significantly taller, and estimated the true height of the peak to be between tall. The position of the aircraft, and its bearing to the south when the pilot had declared his intention to divert to Juneau in the north, led to speculation that the pilot had attempted to return to Seattle and had crashed into the mountain due to faulty charts. According to the CAB investigation report, both the Pan Am aviation charts as well as the standard U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey charts indicated the height of Tamgas mountain as . Following the crash, the exact height of the mountain was recalculated and new charts were issued with the corrected height of the mountain: . As the actual height of the mountain was in fact lower than the height indicated on the charts, the discrepancy in elevation was not considered to be a contributing factor in the crash.  Foul weather  The weather report issued to Captain Morsen prior to the flight indicated weather conditions that were significantly different from those he actually encountered when approaching Annette Island. The Pan American Airways meteorologist had forecast that the cold front would reach Annette Island prior to the flight's arrival, and that conditions would be light rain, gusty, and overcast. This forecast actually contradicted what the US and Canadian Weather Bureaus were forecasting at the time. Pan American's meteorologist revised his forecast at 12:39 PM, but there was no indication that Flight 923 received the information. The updated forecast called for the cold front to reach Annette Island at 4:00 PM PST, but still made no mention of turbulence. The CAB, upon reviewing available weather data, determined that the Pan Am meteorologist should have been able to predict, with some amount of certainty, that there would be severe turbulence at lower altitude and high winds. This data would have been available for the meteorologist to make such a prediction prior to or shortly after Flight 923's departure from Seattle. Such a forecast would have warned the crew of the weather conditions they encountered when they decided to abort their landing at Annette Island airport. 23 minutes prior to Flight 923's aborted landing at Annette Island, an Army Air Force pilot flying from Tacoma, Washington, landed at Annette Island airport. He reported to investigators that he encountered heavy turbulence at lower altitude that grew more severe as he descended from . Three hours after Flight 923's disappearance, another passenger aircraft landed at Annette Field, this one from Whitehorse, Canada. The pilot reported icing between and turbulence below that was so severe it nearly tumbled the gyro flight instruments. Six hours after Flight 923's disappearance, the Army Air Force pilot attempted to depart Annette Island, but encountered icing so severe he was forced to return to the air field. Investigators were able to conclude that there was significant foul weather and severe turbulence in the area at the time Flight 923 was attempting to land at Annette Island. Furthermore, the incorrect weather report by the Pan Am meteorologist left the pilot unaware of the turbulence and high winds he would encounter on approach. The CAB postulated that severe turbulence or severe icing may have caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. However this could not be declared the definitive cause of the accident due to insufficient evidence.  Probable cause  Given the lack of communication, witnesses, and evidence, the Civil Aeronautics Board was unable to determine a probable cause for the crash of Flight 923. While the investigation was able to determine a number of factors which may have contributed to the crash, there did not exist enough evidence to determine a definitive cause.

A horse and wagon parked inside the Hollow Log shown in a turn-of-the century photograph. The Hollow Log of Balch Park is the naturally hollowed out log of a fallen Giant Sequoia tree. It is also one of the best known features of the Mountain Home Grove, a stand of Giant Sequoia trees that surrounds Balch Park in Tulare County, California. History The Hollow Log was known to early Native Americans who frequented the Tule River watershed, but its first recorded mention is in 1856 when soldiers used it as a headquarters for patrols hunting Indian renegades during the Tule River Indian War. Known for many years as the \\"Soldiers Log\\", it was a popular destination for settlers visiting the surrounding grove of Giant Sequoia trees. Among these early visitors was a local sheep farmer named Clinton T. Brown, who carved his initials and the date 1870 on the log. The log was part of a parcel of land that John J. Doyle in 1885 acquired, with plans to make the area into a resort to be called \\"Summer Home.\\" He first used the log as a dwelling, and then as a fruit cellar for an apple orchard that he planted a few miles away. Doyle next had the rough end of the log sawed off in 1888 so that the rest of the log could be moved to a railroad siding and mounted on wheels to be used as a railroad dining car for a promotion tour to the eastern United States. However, the log was spared when measurements revealed that it was too large fit through the railroad tunnels on the planned journey. Ultimately Dole's Hollow Log became the center attraction for his Summer Home resort, which for a few years was a popular tourist destination. Doyle's fortunes waned in later years, and he sold his property, along with the log and surrounding grove, in 1906 to the Mt. Whitney Power Company. The land eventually passed to Allan and Janet Balch, who in 1930 donated the property to Tulare County for a park, so that the Hollow Log and nearby Giant Sequoia trees would be preserved for future generations. Dimensions The Hollow Log is about long with a diameter of . It originally was longer, but in 1888 the end was sawed off. Although steel cables are bound around the log to prevent it from collapsing, it is still possible to walk and crawl all the way through it from one end to the other.

Background General Finance Acceptance (GFA) leased a computer to Melrose on a five-year term, with the leasing contract having the term that upon default, that Melrose would pay all the remaining lease payments less the cost of the computer at the date of cancellation, plus interest on top of al this at 32% per annum. Melrose cancelled the contract early, and was billed by GFA for this default as per the default clause in the lease agreement, even though these damages were far higher than Melrose would have paid had the lease gone the whole five-year term, and they disputed liability for these damages.

History=Middle East The early recipes of white nougat were found in a Middle Eastern book in Baghdad the 10th century. That nougat was called ŸÜÿßÿ∑ŸÅ nƒÅ·π≠if. One of these recipes indicates that the nƒÅ·π≠if comes from Harran, a city located between Urfa (now in southeast Turkey) and Aleppo, Syria. Mention of nƒÅ·π≠if was found in a triangle between Urfa, Aleppo, and Baghdad. At the end of the 10th century, the traveler and geographer Ibn Hawqal wrote that he ate some nƒÅ·π≠if in Manbij (in modern Syria) and Bukhara (in modern Uzbekistan). Andalucia Then recipes of white nougat are attested in Arab Andalusia in the 13th century, then in Catalonia in the 14th century, where it is called toron or pinyonada. In Italy, the torrone is the heir to the Catalan nougat. In 1555, Nostradamus gave a recipe for rock pignolate, which came from Italy. Despite its name in reference to pine nuts, it is a recipe similar to the recipes for white nougat with almonds. This recipe was adopted in 1600 by Olivier de Serres, an agronomist living in Ardeche. France Legend has it that Olivier de Serres had almond trees planted in the region near Mont√©limar to make nougat, but almond trees had been cultivated in Provence since at least the 14th and 15th centuries and between 1474 and the middle of the 16th century, the Lyon fairs already marketed almonds from Dr√¥me and Ard√®che. The word nogat (from nux, walnuts, which became nuca in popular Latin, then noga in old Proven√ßal), which became nougat at the beginning of the 19th century, was certified in 1607 in the Thresor de sant√©, a book on dietetics, to designate a confectionery from Provence and Languedoc .  Mont√©limar  The Nougat de Mont√©limar is composed of almonds, honey, and a light mousse of egg whites. The latter lightens the dough and gives it the traditional whitish color of the Nougat. Traditionally, nougat was baked at home, not by skilled nougat makers (in French nougatiers). In 1701, when they were coming back from Spain on horseback, Louis, Duke of Bourgogne, and Charles, Duke of Berry stopped in Mont√©limar. The inhabitants offered them one quintal of Nougat (equivalent to 95 lbs). The sweet's reputation spread from this point. The success of Mont√©limar nougat is mainly due to Mont√©limar‚Äôs mayor, Emile Loubet, who was later elected President of France (1899‚Äì1906). During this period, he undertook a huge campaign promoting the nougat. He offered nougats to all crowned royalty in France, as well as to foreign Presidents coming to the √âlys√©e Palace. Through these efforts, the reputation of nougat became international. In 1968, the A7 autoroute was built and the Nougatiers took advantage of this opportunity.

It has been developed with respect to painting, but also applies to photography History The American art historian Carol Strickland (born 1946) coined the term Sottorealism in an essay titled ‚ÄúDetour as a Route to Unity and Order‚Äù (2006). In the essay, she was concerned with the art work of the German-Greek painter Aris Kalaizis. While approaching his work, Strickland discovered a hermeneutical void between realism and surrealism, which she filled with the neologism.aus:Aris Kalaizis im Gespr√§ch mit Carol Strickland_Katalog 'Rubbacord'_Kerber-Vg._S. 12 Concept Instead of painting a surreal universe, the Sottorealist is interested in crawling beneath the surface of reality. While the world of the dream isn‚Äôt a creative act, and while no photographic device is able to fully mediate that which is beyond reality, the Sottorealist acknowledges that which is given in reality. In doing so, the Sottorealist, however, also acknowledges that unseen forces are active in our perception of reality, such as memory or cultural frameworks or metaphysical. By making these numinous realities present in his work, he creates a convergence of the seen and unseen. The idea is to go beyond the appearance of things and to uncover substructures that are beyond the empirical reality. Sottorealists approach these second or third orders of reality by constructing elaborate models. These models could be viewed as experiments that are necessary in order to sound out the full scope of that which is part of reality, even though it is not an apparent and visible part of it.

Massacre On December 2, 1984, the Sri Lankan military imposed a curfew throughout Cheddikulam and the adjoining villages and towns. The military began cordoning off the village at 5.30 a.m. Most of its inhabitants were still asleep, when armed personnel entered the village and took away the males of the village for 'inquiries'. 52 men were reportedly bundled into military vehicles, and taken to the Anuradhapura District and killed. The locals allege that the 52 men were taken to a Sinhalese settlement near Medawachchiya, and were chopped up with sharp knives and later heavy vehicles were run over them.

After the Howard Government was elected at the 1996 federal election, Prime Minister John Howard dismantled the department, assigning its welfare housing functions to the Department of Social Security and its industry functions to the newly created Department of Industry, Science and Tourism.

Early life  Wayment was born in Woolwich, east London on 23 April 1912, the son of Alfred Wayment, headmaster of the local church school. His godfather Eric Milner-White, a curate at the church of St Mary Magdalen Woolwich, was later Dean of King's College, Cambridge from 1918 to 1941, and became a strong influence on Wayment's life, leading him a near lifelong study of stained glass, particularly the windows of King's College. He was educated at Charterhouse School, then from 1931‚Äì1935 at King's College, where he took a first in Part I of the Classical Tripos before reading English for Part II, and was a chorister. He was a contemporary at King's of Oliver Churchill, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship, and their paths crossed during World War II in Cairo where Wayment was working from 1937‚Äì44 and Churchill was posted to SOE Headquarters, Middle East from 1942‚Äì45. Wayment was godfather to Churchill's eldest son, Toby. In 1952 he married Lilah Sykes (n√©e Dixon) and had a son and a daughter.  Career  From 1937 to 1944 he served as Assistant Lecturer and then Lecturer in English at Fuad I University in Cairo. He published a collection of poems and stories Egypt Now: a miscellany in 1943, and translated from the French ' by Henry Habib Ayrout (published as The Fellaheen, 1945). He also learned Arabic, translating into English the autobiography of the highly influential scholar Taha Hussein (The Stream of Days: a student at the Azhar, 1943). In 1944 he returned to England and took up a post with the British Council, serving firstly in London, then in Cambridge from 1948‚Äì1952, in Brussels from 1952‚Äì54, and from 1954‚Äì59 as Director of the British Institute in Paris, and 1963‚Äì68 in Amsterdam, and Turkey from 1970 to 1973. These periods of residence furthered his research on 16th-century glass, and he formed friendships with other stained-glass scholars. In 1967 King's College Chapel underwent an extensive cleaning operation for which scaffolding was erected around the building. In 1968‚Äì69 Wayment took a sabbatical leave from his British Council post and was elected a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge to take advantage of the scaffolding to systematically study at close quarters and photograph the famous 16th-century cycle of stained glass in the Chapel, according to the precise standards of the project.Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevi project The subsequent large folio volume, The Windows of King's College Chapel, Cambridge published by the British Academy in 1972, was the first and became a standard for the Great Britain CVMA volumes,Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevi guidelines On retirement from the British Council he was elected a Fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge from 1973‚Äì77 to study the windows of the St Mary's Church, Fairford, in Gloucestershire, which have a close relationship to those at King's, and wrote The Stained Glass of the Church of St Mary, Fairford, Gloucestershire published in 1984. Four years later he wrote King's College Chapel Cambridge: The Side-chapel Glass. He died in Cambridge on 20 March 2005 aged 92.

Early life and education  Boon Tuan was born on July 18, 1865 in the village of Bang-Pa, Ratchaburi province, Thailand. After the death of his father, Boon Tuan's family moved to Bangkok, where Boon Tuan and his brother Boon Yee were enrolled at the Christian school at Samray. At eleven years old, Boon Tuan was taken to the United States by the pioneer medical missionary Dr Samuel Reynolds HouseFeltus, George Haws, Samuel Reynolds House of Siam: Pioneer Medical Missionary 1847-1876, Revell, 1924 and his wife. In 1881, Boon Tuan was enrolled in Williston Seminary, Easthampton, Massachusetts. At this school, and then later at Williams College, Boon Tuan excelled in academics and athletics. As a student at Williams, Boon Tuan had an evangelical Christian conversion experience and worked with YMCA at the college. Boon Tuan graduated from Williams in 1889 and then enrolled in Auburn Theological Seminary to study for the Christian ministry.  Career  In 1893, Boon Tuan returned to Siam (now Thailand) to begin Christian ministry work in his native country. Boon Tuan married his cousin, Maa Kim Hock, on September 23, 1897. The newly married couple moved to Phitsanulok, Thailand to begin Christian work in the province. In 1899, he founded a school for boys which is currently called Padoongrasdra School. In 1902, Boon was asked by the American Presbyterian Mission Board to come to Bangkok to start a new church for young educated men who were graduating from mission schools and coming into the city in large numbers. Boon Tuan accepted this call to plant a church in Bangkok. He founded the church which is now called Suebsampantawong Church (Thai: ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏™‡∏ï‡∏à‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏™‡∏∑‡∏ö‡∏™‡∏±‡∏°‡∏û‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏®‡πå), the fourth Presbyterian church to be started in the city of Bangkok, and the first church in Thailand to be established and support entirely by Thai Christians themselves, apart from assistance from foreign missionaries.

You may not know that I offered him a position which would have led to high titles of nobility from the King of Siam, to the governorship of a large province, and to a large increase in his income.

The film stars Ona Casamiquela as a college student that accepts a job from a wealthy former piano player that wants a caretaker for her mentally challenged daughter. The film's name is a take on the Beethoven composition F√ºr Elise. Filming for Para Elisa took place during August 2012 in Cuenca, Spain. In an article for ABC Fern√°ndez noted that it was difficult to film in the region, as the region did not have a pre-existing film industry. Synopsis College student Ana (Ona Casamiquela) needs money for a post-graduation class trip. In answer to a help-wanted ad for a nanny, she goes to have tea with Diamantina (Luisa Gavasa), an elderly concert pianist with a mentally challenged and reclusive daughter named Elisa. Diamantina needs someone to occupy her daughter for a few hours each day while she herself works on a concert piece, and she insists that Ana set her own schedule so as not to miss any classes. Seeing the opportunity as the perfect job, Ana agrees eagerly, but when Diamantina finally allows Ana to meet Elisa (Ana Turpin), she is shocked to learn that the presumed \\"little girl\\" is a full-grown woman dressed in children's clothing who lives in a bedroom full of toys and dolls. Ana begins to back out of the job, but suddenly collapses. Diamantina reveals that the tea was drugged. Ana wakes dressed as a doll and tied to a chair in Elisa's room. Elisa tries to play with her as if she is a doll, only to become angry and abusive when Ana, still disoriented from the drugged tea, refuses to cooperate. Over the course of the day, Ana recovers enough to begin loosening her bonds whenever Elisa leaves the room. In the evening, Diamantina returns to give Elisa her \\"medicine,\\" a powerful sedative meant to prevent Elisa's violent nightly rages. While this is happening, Ana hears muffled screaming from another part of the flat. Diamantina goes to take care of the problem, and Ana overhears remarks that hint that not only is there another living \\"doll\\" in the flat, but that Diamantina has sewn its mouth shut to keep it silent. Diamantina forces Ana to take a dose of the medicine, which knocks her unconscious. Suspicious when Ana does not return from her appointment, her boyfriend Alex (Jes√∫s Caba) goes to the police. Due to Alex's past reputation as a drug dealer, they refuse to help him, stating that he must wait forty-eight hours to make a missing-person report. In the middle of the night, Elisa wakes in a terrible rage. Diamantina takes Elisa into the music room in order to calm her, but Elisa murders her mother with a cleaver. Ana awakens and seizes the opportunity to untie her bonds and escape the bedroom, but the medicine has left her too groggy to find an exit. Instead she hides from Elisa in a closet where she finds her personal belongings, including her phone. Ana calls Alex but is too incoherent to tell him anything before Elisa discovers her and drags her back to the bedroom. To prevent Ana from escaping again, Elisa gives her another dose of medicine, ties her to the bed, and breaks her ankles with a hammer. Alex returns to tell the police about the disturbing call, but they again dismiss him, believing he is lying in order to be taken seriously. Remembering the ad for Ana's earlier job appointment, Alex phones the flat directly, only to have Elisa answer and tell him that she is Ana's mother and that Ana is \\"being punished\\" before hanging up. Using the phone number, he is able to find the building where Ana is trapped, but without the apartment number, he must go from flat to flat in hopes of finding the correct one. Ana regains consciousness to find Elisa asleep beside her. Freeing herself, Ana pulls a large crucifix from the wall and uses it to bludgeon Elisa before crawling back to the phone, where she is able to tell Alex where she is and what is happening. Alex rushes upstairs to rescue her, but as Ana lies waiting, Elisa recovers and strikes Ana with the cleaver, presumably killing her.

Fearnet echoed these sentiments, saying that \\"Not many of the components offered here are all that unique or remarkable on their own ... but it's the combination of story points, suspense moments, and slightly familiar themes that make For Elise such a strangely amusing horror import.\\" La Vanguardia gave the film three out of five stars.

This struggle for acceptance comes from both sport fan bases as well as from within the various sports organizations, associations, federations, etc. However, following the Stonewall riots there has been marginal and gradual improvement in the rights and acceptance of homosexual athletes coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In the past, an athlete who made the decision to come out was, in essence, committing career suicide, and would risk losing support from fans who come from more conservative or intolerant backgrounds. As such, there where no openly gay athletes in the United States until 2012-2013. Individual sports The study of the relationship between sports and homosexuality did not emerge until around the 1990s, when Brian Pronger and Michael Messner began interviewing athletes about their views on homosexuality. Neither researcher was able to find a male athlete who was openly gay and active competitors in both individual and team sports. They suggested that it was not that there were no such athletes during this period in time, but they were just too afraid to admit to it due to their teammates‚Äô opposition to homosexuality. Messner reiterated this opposition in his 1992 study: ‚ÄúThe extent of homophobia in the sports world is staggering. Males (in sports) learn early that to be gay, to be suspected of being gay, or even to be unable to prove one‚Äôs heterosexual status is not acceptable.\\" Naturalized U.S. citizen Martina Navratilova was openly lesbian while still playing tennis, as was Billie Jean King, though previously married.  Team sports A member of the United States women's national soccer team, Megan Rapinoe, came out in 2012. Several other members and alumni of the team, including Adrianna Franch, Tierna Davidson, Abby Wambach, Sarah Huffman, Ashlyn Harris and Ali Krieger, are also openly homosexual. Harris and Krieger are a couple; Wambach and Huffman were once married but have since divorced. In 2013, soccer's Robbie Rogers and basketball's Jason Collins publicly came out as gay. Several athletes declared their support for both Rogers and Collins; also President Barack Obama contacted both athletes offering his support. Thierry Henry, at the time playing in Major League Soccer, was quoted in a column for New York Daily News as saying \\"he (Rogers) is a human being, first of all. And that‚Äôs good enough.\\" Rogers then made his historic debut for the Los Angeles Galaxy in May 2013 and became the first openly gay male athlete to compete on a professional sporting team in North America. In basketball, Sheryl Swoopes came out in 2005, Brittney Griner came out in 2013, and Elena Delle Donne came out in 2016. In 2014, Michael Sam, an openly gay college football player, was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the 2014 NFL Draft, becoming both the first openly gay National Football League athlete and the first athlete in any sport to be drafted into a major league while already openly gay (rather than coming out after they were already playing in the league). During his research, Anderson found \\"more openly gay runners and swimmers than football and baseball players.\\" He then hypothesized that this occurred because gay men likely abandoned the more macho sports in favor of sports that were more accepting of homosexuality. In 2006, a Sports Illustrated poll of roughly 1,400 professional athletes found that a majority would be willing to accept a gay teammate. Although an aggressive and often violent sport, professional hockey (NHL) athletes seemed to be the most accepting of such teammates as 80% of its players approved of having a gay teammate. Nearly a quarter of those in the U.S. polled believe that openly gay athletes hurt sports in general, while over half think being openly gay hurts the athlete's career. In 2002, the National Gay Flag Football League was founded.

It was one of Harley-Davidson's attempts to enter the small displacement off-road motorcycle market. It was built in Aermacchi's Varese, Italy factory. It had a two-stroke, single cylinder engine with five speed transmission, derived from the current two-stroke production, mostly Aletta and Aletta d'Oro off the shelf parts by reducing bore from 54 mm to 50 mm. The only purpose-made part was the frame to accommodate for the front holder for the cylinder head and the air filter box. Production runs The first production run started in September 1969 and ended just before August, traditionally the time of the year when factories were closed for holidays and consequently a new model year introduced. ;Production *1969: 853 MY ‚Äô70 MSR *1970: 569 MSR MY ‚Äô70 MSR *1970: 1204 MSR MY ‚Äô71 *1971: 704 MY ‚Äô72 SR and 200 MY ‚Äô72 MSR *1972: 1008 MY 73 MSR Production runs of 1973 are not known even if some MY 74 models seem to exist but this means that there have been no changes after MY73. As a rule frame numbers (which are repeated on the engine) start with 8B on the MSR (Competition Model) and 8C for the \\"street model\\" which had lights, muffler and a high front fender. But for some early \\"street models\\" the MSR frame numbering may apply. A major overhaul took place end of 1972 when the engine was fitted with a new aluminum cylinder and carburetor, and gear shift on the right side of the engine. There were other minor differences such as the rear fork or the missing vent on the tank. The Baja had a racing history and won the Baja 1000 in 1971 with the official Harley-Davidson team in its class.

In 1979 he succeeded his father, the fourth Sadigura Rebbe, and took his seat on the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. He oversaw the growth of Sadigura communities in Israel and in London, Antwerp, and New York City. Early life Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef Friedman, fourth Sadigura Rebbe Avrohom Yaakov Friedman was the son of Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef Friedman, the fourth Sadigura Rebbe, and his wife, Mira Reisel. On his father's side, he was the great-grandson of Rabbi Yisrael Friedman, the second Sadigura Rebbe; the great-great-grandson of Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, the first Sadigura Rebbe; and the great-great-great-grandson of Rabbi Yisrael Friedman of Ruzhyn, the Ruzhiner Rebbe. On his mother's side, he was the grandson of Rabbi Yisrael Shalom Yosef Heschel, the Medzhybizher Rav. He was born in Vienna, the city to which his father had escaped during World War I together with his great-uncle, Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, the third Sadigura Rebbe. When he was 5 years old, he and his parents moved to Przemy≈õl, Poland, where his father opened a Hasidic court and a yeshiva. In the spring of 1939, his father traveled to Palestine to visit his Ruzhin relatives and was advised by his uncle, Rabbi Yisrael Friedman, the Husiatyner Rebbe, who had emigrated there several years earlier, to remain. Later that summer, weeks before the outbreak of World War II, young Avrohom Yaakov and his mother joined him in Palestine. Education and marriage From the time he was a young child, Avrohom Yaakov immersed himself in Torah learning. During his teens, he studied at Yeshivas HaYishuv Hechadash and Yeshivas Novarodok in Tel Aviv, and at Yeshivas Lomza in Petah Tikva. In each place, he was noted for using every spare minute to learn Torah.Marks, Yehudah. \\"Tribute: The Sadigura Rebbe, zy\\"a\\". Hamodia Israel News, January 3, 2013, pp. A12-13. He was a close student of Rabbi Yehoshua Menachem Ehrenberg, who gave him rabbinic ordination. He was also very close to his father, whom he considered his Rebbe. At age 18, his father instructed him to begin learning Kabbalah, and he eventually became conversant in Kabbalah texts. In 1953 Friedman married Tzipora Faige Feldman, the daughter of Antiniya Hasidim who had emigrated from Romania when she was eight years old. Her father was one of the founders of Bais Yaakov in Israel.Florans, Estie. \\"In the Footsteps of Greatness: Rebbetzin Chava Scharf shares a personal glimpse of her renowned father, HaAdmor Harav Avrohom Yaakov Friedman, the Sadigura Rebbe, ztvk\\"l\\".

In 1956 he followed his father to America, where his father opened a Przemy≈õl-Sadigura beis medrash in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. While he engaged in full-time Torah study, his wife operated a preschool while raising their family. In 1965, when his father returned to Israel to open a court in Tel Aviv, Friedman stayed on as Rav of the Brooklyn beis medrash. In 1973 Friedman and his wife returned to Israel, where he served as rosh yeshiva of the Ruzhiner yeshiva in Bnei Brak founded by his father.Friedman, Yisroel.

Chapter 4: The Sadigerer Rebbe, Reb Mordechai Sholom Yosef, zt\\"l. Accession to Rebbe Sadigura beis medrash in Bnei Brak Upon his father's death on 29 Nisan 1979, Friedman became the leader of the Sadigura Hasidim. He was also inducted into the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah in his father's stead. He retained his father's court on Pinkus Street in Tel Aviv, and established an outreach center there for secular Jewish youth. In 2005 he relocated his court to a large edifice on Gutmacher Street in Bnei Brak. He was known for his great love of fellow Jews and his open door to all petitioners. His prayers and blessings on behalf of others were said to be especially potent. He took an active interest in his children and grandchildren, answering their questions and learning Torah with them. He oversaw the opening of Sadigura battei medrash in Jerusalem, Ashdod, Modiin Illit, Beitar Illit, and Elad, and the expansion of Sadigura communities to London, Antwerp, and New York City. Political views The Rebbe took an active role in Israeli politics, supporting the Agudat Yisrael political party and urging his followers to vote for the United Torah Judaism list in the 2013 Israeli legislative election. He was the most right-wing member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah, expressing his strong opposition to the Oslo Accords and Israel's unilateral disengagement plan and visiting Israeli settlements in the West Bank to bolster the Jews living there. Final years Graves of Rabbi Avrohom Yaakov Friedman (front) and his father, Rabbi Mordechai Sholom Yosef Friedman (rear), in the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery, Tel Aviv In 1995 the Rebbe was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, he continued to conduct his private and public activities without any interruption. At the end of December 2012 he came down with severe pneumonia, and was rushed to Ma'ayanei Hayeshuah Hospital in Bnei Brak on the morning of January 1, 2013 (19 Tevet 5773), where he died. His funeral, which set out from the Sadigura beis medrash in Bnei Brak in the early afternoon, was attended by the Rebbes of Boyan, Bohush, Kapishnitz, Vasloi, Ger, Vizhnitz, Toldos Abraham Yitzchak, and Sanz, as well as Litvishe gedolim. In keeping with tradition, no eulogies were said at this funeral of a Rebbe, but his will was read, naming his only son, Rabbi Tzvi Yisrael Moshe Friedman, av beis din of the Sadigura rabbinical court in London, as his successor. He was buried beside his father in the Ruzhiner section of the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery in Tel Aviv. Lineage of Sadigura dynastic leadership *Yisrael Friedman of Ruzhyn, Ruzhiner Rebbe (1797‚Äì1850).

They eventually grow up and meet again, but a series of misunderstandings lead them being forced to marry. Zain wants to get rid of her, as he never wanted to get married and only wanted to have girlfriends. Zain's elder brother, Fahad has two wives Nafisa and Shazia who hate each other. It is revealed that Fahad married his second wife, Shazia as Suraiya (Zain and Fahad's mother) wanted a male heir but Nafisa was unable to conceive anymore after having two girls. So, Fahad married Shazia and they had a son. He loves both his wives and tries his best to fulfil their needs. On the other hand, Zain and Aaliya constantly bicker but slowly become friends when they help Fahad who has landed in trouble with some goons. Aayat, Aaliya's younger sister gets into trouble and Zain helps her out without informing his family. He meets with an accident and is injured. During the investigation, Aaliya finds out Zain helped Aayat and his accident was caused by Rocky Singh who owned a brothel and had deceived Aayat. Suraiya, who dislikes Aaliya emotionally blackmails her which makes Aaliya leave the house. Zain finds out later and brings her back home. Fahad and Osman plan to make Zain and Aaliya fall in love. In the meantime, it's revealed that Suraiya dislikes Aaliya and her family because Barkat, her long lost daughter was kidnapped by Mir who is Aaliya's uncle. Aaliya promises to bring Barkat back. Zain and Aaliya finally find Barkat. Joyous, Suraiyya starts liking Aaliya and her family again, which makes Shazia and Nafisa unhappy. Zain realizes that he has fallen in love with Aaliya. Then, Zubair is introduced. Zain thinks that Aaliya loves Zubair when he sees them together not knowing they are cousins. Having fallen for Aayat, Rizwan too feels the same when he sees her with Zubair. For clarification, Zain humiliates Aaliya who leaves for her hometown Bhopal and leaves a message asking him to realise his mistake. However, Zain and Aaliya finally express their love and they return home. Aaliya soon finds Barkat's behaviour suspicious and it is revealed that she is actually Mir's biological daughter who is after the Abdullahs' family wealth and property. Aaliya and Zain work together and finally succeed in exposing Barkat and she is thrown out the house but before going, Barkat poisons Suraiyya's mind against Aaliya telling her she is having an affair with Zubair and thus Suraiyya once again starts detesting Aaliya. She plots to separate Zain and Aaliya by creating misunderstandings between them. Nafisa who is sick of Suraiyya's attitude towards her and favouring Shazia over her plots revenge and reports Suraiyya of claims that she abuses Aaliya. She is arrested and so is Zain for trying to intervene and they are both beaten up in jail. When Aaliya comes know of this she is shocked and heartbroken and takes the fake complaint back but Zain shuns her saying everything is all her fault and he starts hating her. Unfortunately, one day Usman gets into an accident and dies which Aaliya is blamed for. He announces he wants to end his relationship with Aaliya who is shocked by his actions but she agrees knowing there's no way back and is hurt by Zain not believing her. They get divorced on Usman's funeral and she gets help from Rehan who is a lawyer and a single father of two children who Aaliya develops a bond with. Suraiyya wants Zain to marry a family friend, Sanam but he refuses but makes Aaliya jealous who has started to work in Abdullah Industries to fulfil Usman's dreams. Rehan tries to get to the bottom of the truth regarding the arrest and finds out it was actually Nafisa. He plots a plan to make her think Usman is alive which frightens her and causes her to expose herself before him. Usman tells Aaliya who is still hurt by Zain's level of trust in her betrayal and Zain's re-marriage and decides to start afresh somewhere else. Before going, Nafisa who has realised her wrongdoings apologises and regretfully tells Aaliya to not reveal to anyone for the sake of her daughters but Aaliya decides to forgive her and tells her she's moving away. Rehan sends Nafisa's recording to Zain at the last minute and he realises his mistake and rushes to stop Aaliya but it is too late. He breaks down and vows to find her.  One year later  Aaliya is seen living happily in Hyderabad with Rehan and his kids who call Aaliya mother as of her motherly bond towards them. She runs her own dhaba but is now not the innocent and carefree she once was but is strict and bossy to her employees. On the other hand, Zain is living a sad life and is seen always going to Usman's grave and repents his mistake. He is still searching for Aaliya. Nafisa has repented and is still seeking forgiveness from Zain who for a year started hating and not speaking to after her betrayal. She wishes Zain- Aaliya find their way back to each other after seeing how alone he was for the past year. One day, on a visit to Hyderabad, Zain sees Aaliya and they both are emotional but the latter is still cold towards him. He is heartbroken on learning Aaliya's bond with Rehan and the kids. He attempts to win her back and begins to spend time in her dhaba. However, attempting to leave Zain once and for all she soon marries Rehan but Zain finds out that Rehan is plotting against Suraiyya as he thinks she killed his first wife. Zain and Aaliya work together to uncover the truth. Suraiyya finds out the truth about Aaliya's innocence from Nafisa after Suraiyya's harsh treatment to Aaliya and seeks forgiveness from her but she doesn't forgive Nafisa and rejects her. It is revealed that Suraiyya didn't actually kill Rehan's wife but she committed suicide. After, Zain saves Rehan's son from an accident and gets hurt in the process he seeks forgiveness and seeing that they still love each other he offers Aaliya to Zain and the duo are finally back together and welcomed happily by everyone in the household. Surraiya and Fahad are still cold towards Nafisa but Aaliya tells them to forgive her and that Nafisa has truly repented. Zain and Aaliya's happiness is shortlived when Rocky, Zain's lookalike arrives and is brought in the house as Zain by Suraiyya's evil sister, Zareena. He pretends to be Zain unbeknownst to the family. But later the truth comes out and the real Zain appears as he was kidnapped and he and Aliya are reunited. Zareena realises her mistake and apologises. Nafisa is pregnant once again and the whole family is happy except Shazia and plots to harm her and the baby. But in the other incident Shazia's son, Saif nearly gets hurt but is saved by Nafisa. Shazia also realises her mistake and accepts she tried to kill the baby but everyone makes her realise her and Nafisa can't compete with each other and Fahad treats both wives equally and loves them both.

She sings and plays multiple instruments including the piano, guitar, saxophone, accordion, and drums. Monika's debut album Avatar was released in 2008 and her second album Exit followed in 2010. Both albums achieved platinum status in her native Greece and were met with critical acclaim. Her third album, Secret in the Dark, was the first to be given an international release, in 2015. It was recorded in New York in collaboration with musicians from the Dap-Kings, and sees Christodoulou moving away from the folk, singer-songwriter style of her earlier albums towards a disco and funk sound. Early life Christodoulou was born in Athens on May 26, 1985. She grew up in various cities around Greece, such as Korinthos, Lamia and Karpenisi, moving around due to her father's occupation as a doctor. In 2004 she was accepted at the School of Mathematics of Kapodistriako University of Athens. She made her first musical steps by joining her brother's rock band Serpentine, where she sang and played the guitar and saxophone. While she was in Serpentine, the band opened for local and international acts such as Devendra Banhart, Michael Gira and Raining Pleasure. Serpentine disbanded in 2004 and Monika started pursuing a solo career. Music career Monika took part in many local bands' live gigs and albums, as a guitar and saxophone player and vocalist.

Porter's The Great Train Robbery (considered to be the first American-made Western filmIt was preceded by the British short Kidnapping by Indians (1899) by several years.), released later the same year, were inspired by those used in Mottershaw's film.

After a struggle with one of the policemen, the burglar throws him off the roof. An ambulance arrives and takes away the injured policeman.

Design and development Luigi Teichfuss took part in the First International Gliding Competition, held on Monte Sisemol near Asiago in October 1924, with a glider of his own design, the poorly documented Condor. At the Competition he saw the Akaflieg Darmstadt D-9 Konsul and used it in 1927 as the starting point of his Gabbiano design, though the finished aircraft was distinctly different. The Gabbiano was a high wing cantilever monoplane built from wood and covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its wing had a single spar, torsion box structure and was constructed in three sections. The central part, about 40% of the span, was rectangular in plan and was without dihedral. The outer panels were straight tapered to blunt tips, the wing becoming thinner and thus acquiring dihedral though retaining a horizontal upper surface. Ailerons occupied the whole trailing edges of these outer panels; there were no inboard flaps or air brakes. At 16:1 its aspect ratio was similar to that of the Konsul. Its fuselage was oval in cross section, wood framed, plywood covered and tapered strongly to the tail. The wing was mounted on a pedestal faired into the aft fuselage with the pilot's open cockpit immediately ahead it, below the wing leading edge. The fin and fuselage mounted tailplane, both ply covered, had swept, straight leading edges which were rounded at their tips to merge into a curved rudder and semi-elliptical elevators. These control surfaces were fabric covered, the rudder ending above the elevators. There was a landing skid running from near the nose to under the wing trailing edge, assisted by a small tail bumper. The Gabbiano made its first flights in 1928, piloted by Umberto Nannini. Some launches were made by aerotow, behind an Aviatik from Taliedo. Only one Gabbiano was built.

Story The Climber tells the story of a lonely British mountaineer who visits the Italian Alps in the mid-20th century who sees mountain climbing as a romantic conquest. The local community however see it as something dangerous. The mountaineer wishes to climb a mountain all by himself, but the local community won't let him, so he sneaks out as they aren't watching.

Orfeas is notable because of the use of speech music, where a musical instrument plays along with spoken words at the same pitch of each syllable. The album is also notable because of the variety of musical styles it incorporates, ranging from a string sextet, trance music, acoustic guitar music, and death metal. Finally, the music by the George Orfeas Band is notable because the electric guitar (by John Ellis who plays George Orfeas) and the saxophones (by David Jackson who plays Maxwell Blow) play identical melodic lines simultaneously. Story The story of Orfeas is loosely based on the myth of Orpheus. In three acts Orfeas tells the story of the talented and successful guitar player George Orfeas, who is fed up with his playing and his success, but then suddenly loses his guitar he calls Furry Dice. Subsequently he nearly dies in a car crash in Cuilfail Tunnel. After meeting his muse Eurydice somewhere between life and death he regains his humility and is allowed to return to the land of the living, on the condition that he does not look back. After his return, the George Orfeas Band does not play any of the old songs anymore. Seduced to play his old hits once again, however, his career comes to an end. Production The recordings of the George Orfeas Band were largely done in Nogaredo in Italy. Ricardo Odriozola and Ben Nation recorded the string sextet sessions in Norway. Trance music producer Andy Haldane contributed to the trance parts. David Minnick was the arranger, producer and co-performer of the parts with speech music. The mysterious band Black Path recorded their death metal parts. Lastly, in 2010 the solos by John Ellis and David Jackson were recorded. Cover art A photography session was done in January 2011 to portray George Orfeas, Eurydice and other players in the CD booklet. Reception Dom Lawson of Prog Magazine in January 2012 called Orfeas \\"weird, witty and resolutely ecccentric\\".

Originally intended as a summer theatre for English-speaking tourists, it won immediate acceptance by the Viennese public and extended its initial season to offer a year-round programme. After opening in a 99-seat playhouse in the Erzherzog Karl Palace in central Vienna, the theatre moved several times over the next ten years to accommodate its growing audience. During this time, most of the productions were directed by Franz Schafranek while Ruth Brinkmann demonstrated her acting talent and versatility in numerous roles.

A highlight was the 1991 world premiere of Edward Albee's Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning Three Tall Women, directed by the author, which he dedicated to the memory of Franz Schafranek after his sudden death earlier that year. International stars Through its international recognition, the theatre has attracted stage and screen personalities to the Josefsgasse, among them Joan Fontaine, Anthony Quinn, Horst Buchholz, Linda Gray, Larry Hagman, Princess Grace of Monaco, Dame Anna Neagle, Siobhan McKenna and Judi Dench as well as Jean-Louis Barrault, Jeanne Moreau and Jean-Paul Belmondo who appeared for the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais de Vienne.

ACQUIN is a member-based, non-profit organisation located in Bayreuth, Bavaria, Germany. The Institute operates under the licence of the German Accreditation Council and is thus empowered to award its quality seal to study programs which have successfully undergone accreditation. ACQUIN was reaccredited by the German Accreditation Council until 30 September 2011. ACQUIN operates internationally in several key regions, including the German-speaking European region, Middle and Eastern Europe and North Africa - Near and Middle East. Nowadays ACQUIN is an association of over 100 higher education institutions from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and the United States of America. ACQUIN operates as a non-profit organisation which is financed through membership fees as well as through Higher Education Institutions for accreditation services provided. ACQUIN is a member of and is recognized by various international agencies such as: the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education (EQAR),EQAR Listing the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA),EQNA Listing the European University Association (EUA),EUA Listing the Central Eastern European Network for Quality Assurance (CEENQA),CEENQA Listing and the International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE). INQAAHE Listing  History  In May 2000, the Bavaria Rectors‚Äô Conference passed a resolution to establish an accreditation agency that performs accreditation for all types of higher education institutions taking into account all types of programs and disciplines. As a result, the Accreditation, Certification and Quality assurance Institute (ACQUIN) was founded on January 26, 2001 and accredited by the German Accreditation Council on March 22, 2001. The German Accreditation Council reaccredited ACQUIN in 2006 until 30 September 2011.http://www.mba- studium.de/faqs/acquin.html  Objective of the accreditation  ACQUIN‚Äôs aim is to support the maintenance and enhancement of quality standards for teaching and learning in higher education and to contribute to the internationalization of German higher education by performing accreditation for all different types of higher education institutions and taking into account all different types of programs and subjects. A main objective is to provide guidance and information for students, employers and higher education institutions and to contribute to more transparency in the market of study programs. Within the accreditation process, the institutional membership of the applicant does not have any decisive influence, neither on the content of the evaluation procedure nor on the accreditation decision-making process. The main characteristics of ACQUIN are independence, objectivity and high quality. Academic freedom and academic autonomy are respected: Higher education institutions may regulate their own quality and standards, but at the same time they must guarantee transparency of process and public accountability in discharging this self-regulation. Degree programs are evaluated by reason of their characteristic purpose as well as on the basis of the quality criteria developed and applied by the agency, regardless of their institutional membership. The make-up of the decision-making bodies does not allow biased persons to intervene in the current procedure. Not only professors and higher education experts, but also students and independent representatives of professional practice participate actively in the accreditation procedures, while members of the state can observe the activities of the agency.

John Tolson Massey was born in Hawthorn on 1 May 1887 the son of Herbert John Massey, a draper, and Fanny Tolson. He first came to public prominence when in 1910 he was recruited from Carlton Juniors (later Carlton District) to play two games with Carlton in the VFL. Massey became the 242nd senior player to represent the Blues. Like his brother Claude, Jack was educated at Footscray College. In 1903 he joined the importing firm Paterson, Laing & Bruce Ltd. An active member of the Church of England, he soon became involved in youth work. He joined the Australian Natives' Association, serving as president of its Elsternwick and Caulfield branch. His pacifism was overtaken by the outbreak of World War I, and after rejection for army service because of a leg injury, he embarked upon what would become both career and ministry by joining the YMCA as a field secretary with the Australian Imperial Force. Attached to the 4th Division, Massey went to England in 1916 and then to France and Belgium, where he helped to provide comforts for the troops. Granted the honorary rank of captain in 1918, he remained in Belgium until January 1919 when he joined the International YMCA Hospitality League in London, caring for soldiers awaiting repatriation. YMCA In August 1919 he returned to Australia. Winning the Dallen prize as dux of the YMCA's training school, he was appointed assistant general secretary of its Melbourne branch.

Once settled in Adelaide, he rebuilt and extended an organisation neglected during the war and expanded its activities, establishing himself as an effective speaker and organiser and a well-loved 'chief'. He conducted difficult negotiations to buy the association's building, undertook fund-raising, promoted staff training and superannuation and a staff journal, and played cricket and football for the 'Y'. He travelled extensively to YMCA centres and conferences, touring overseas in 1925-26 (when he was an Australian delegate to the first conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations at Honolulu, Hawaii) and in 1936 to Japan, India and North Africa. He was YMCA General Secretary in South Australia from 1920 to 1938. During that time he spent some time as chair of the SA Amateur Football Association bringing in positive changes to that organisation and football in Australia. In 1925 he spent time as a Staff Member of the YMCA in the United States. In 1939 he moved to England and served as Executive Secretary of the National YMCAs of England returning to Australia in 1944 as National General Secretary of the YMCA of Australia a post he held for many years.

The theatre was, in retrospect, Franz Schafranek's destiny from the cradle on. The founder and director of Vienna‚Äôs English Theatre certainly grew into a total theatre person: a visionary and realist; philosopher and entrepreneur; an artist through and through. His youthful ambition to study literature and theatre arts led him out of the gloomy confines of post-war Austria to Sweden. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of Stockholm where he attracted the attention of Ingmar Bergman. After serving under the famed Swedish filmmaker as assistant director, Schafranek went on to Berlin. Here he gained invaluable insights and experience working with Bertolt Brecht at his \\"Theater on the Schiffbauerdamm.\\" In 1963, having returned to Vienna after his years abroad, he embarked on a venture deemed incredible at the time. No one believed he could make a success of the English-speaking theatre he founded together with his American wife, Ruth Brinkmann. Yet, without public subsidies, relying only on his own vision and sure theatrical instincts, he achieved the seemingly impossible. In a city still mired in post-war provincialism, Franz Schafranek found a ready-made audience eager from the start to lend support and fill the seats of Vienna‚Äôs English Theatre. Within a few years Franz Schafranek‚Äôs confident vision, personal charisma and tireless leadership had made Vienna‚Äôs English Theatre into a permanent fixture in the city‚Äôs theatrical landscape. Ever searching out new possibilities, he gained wide recognition for his theatre and for the city of Vienna as a forward-looking centre of international theatre. He staged world premieres of works by renowned American playwrights, Tennessee Williams, William Saroyan and Edward Albee, as well as numerous continental premieres of British and American dramas. He also brought prominent stars of stage and screen to perform on his Josefsgasse stage. Others might have been satisfied with such achievements, but Franz Schafranek was never one to rest on his laurels. In 1978 he founded the \\"Theatre Fran√ßais de Vienne\\", and in 1985 the \\"Teatro Italiano di Vienna\\", exciting new interest with productions and star appearances from these countries. Franz Schafranek placed the world on the small stage of Vienna‚Äôs English Theatre. He took his success with characteristic modesty and a sure sense of the possibilities open to him. These he carried to the utmost, earning numerous awards both at home and abroad in recognition of his contribution to the dramatic arts. His greatest reward was doubtless the steady increase and loyal patronage of his many subscribers. The theatre was his life, and his sudden death in the night following a much acclaimed premiere, while shocking, seemed appropriate in the Rilkian sense of, \\"Oh God! Give to each his own death.\\" Franz Schafranek had actually envisioned taking his final bow at such a moment of deep personal fulfilment and fate granted this wish. He has left the stage, yet his life work lives on in Vienna's English Theatre.

Early life  Ruth Brinkmann was brought up in the Long Island suburbs of New York City. She studied acting at the Yale University Graduate School of Drama, directly from which she made her New York debut as Louise in G. B. Shaw's In Good King Charles's Golden Days, and continued her professional career in repertory at the Williamstown Playhouse in Massachusetts, the Cleveland Playhouse in Ohio, as well as the Court Theatre in Beloit, Wisconsin; Manhattan's Town Hall, and the Chautauqua Arts Festival.  Career  Subsequent to these appearances, Brinkmann was, together with Alan Alda, chosen from more than one thousand actors who auditioned for the Ford Foundation's experimental theatre program at the Cleveland Playhouse in Ohio. Her Ford award was for three years, but, on her first summer vacation from Cleveland in 1959, she visited Vienna as a tourist. She met and later married the Austrian director, Franz Schafranek, and settled there in 1960.  English-language theater in Vienna  As she spoke no German at the time, her husband had the idea of starting an English-language theatre that would enable her to continue her work. The young couple opened their theatre in 1963 in a rented 99-seat auditorium in a downtown palace with a production of Jerome Kilty's Dear Liar, starring Brinkmann and Anthony Steel, directed by Franz Schafranek.  Acting roles abroad  For the first ten years before Vienna's English Theatre acquired its permanent home, she played the female lead in every production except two. Among them were multiple roles in The World of Carl Sandburg and Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology, as well as the four ladies in Thornton Wilder's Queens of France. She also played the Lady in Shaw's Man of Destiny, Doris in The Owl and the Pussycat, Miss Prism in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, and Amanda in The Glass Menagerie, which subsequently toured throughout Israel. At the Josefsgasse opening, Brinkmann starred in Terence Rattigan's In Praise of Love, and when Spoon River was revived - with Ruth Brinkmann playing 22 different roles - the American Journalist Nino Lo Bello wrote in the Los Angeles Times that \\"she has just wrapped up another of her 'tours de force' successes\\". Her multiple roles and quick changes in this production also won her a niche in Ripley's Believe It or Not gallery.  1970's  In the following season, 1976, Tennessee Williams honoured Vienna's English Theatre with the world premiere of The Red Devil Battery Sign, in which Brinkmann starred as the Woman Downtown. Thomas Quinn Curtiss wrote in the International Herald Tribune that Williams had been \\"magnificently served by Vienna's English Theatre's production (directed by Franz Schafranek). Ruth Brinkmann, an American actress, is superb as the distracted woman... a portrayal of astonishing range, which captures both the bitter anger and the moving pathos of the difficult role.\\" In 1978 she played Sheila in Alan Ayckbourn's Relatively Speaking, opposite the British actor Roger Lloyd Pack. In 1979, Brinkmann was invited by the Wiener Konzerthaus to venture into the music world by performing the William Walton/Edith Sitwell collaboration, Fa√ßade, under the direction of Friedrich Cerha. Soon afterwards she was dialogue director for the English-language version of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar for two seasons at the Theater an der Wien, and in 1981 she made her German-language stage debut as Countess Almaviva in √ñd√∂n von Horvath's Figaro l√§√üt sich scheiden at the Theater in der Josefstadt.  1980's  In June 1981, at the invitation of Professor Otto Molden, she performed Alan Levy's adaptation of The World of Ruth Draper at the opening of the Dialogue Congress Western Europe - USA in Alpbach in the Tyrol, Austria. This presentation was followed by the play's World Premiere at Vienna's English Theatre in February, 1982. Early in 1983, she was invited to do a guest appearance of the show at the South Street Theatre on Times Square's Theatre Row in New York City. She returned to Vienna for the 20th anniversary celebrations of Vienna's English Theatre, for which she played the title rote in G. B. Shaw's Candida, in the presence of Princess Alexandra of Kent, who came to Vienna especially for the occasion. Brinkmann and her husband also received a personal letter of citation on the Theatre's 20th Anniversary from President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan. In 1984 Ruth Brinkmann made her debut as director with Graham Greene's The Complaisant Lover and on October 10, she was honored by the Mayor of Vienna, Dr. Helmut Zilk, who awarded her the Grosses Silberne Ehrenzeichen (Vienna's Silver Medal of Honor).

History  The band was formed in 1985 by Miroslav Nemirov. At their first gig, the KGB declared them to be fascists and expelled them from the Komsomol and sent them to the army. Initially, they played punk rock, but their style changed to alternative rock in 1991, around the time lead singer Roman Neumoev converted to Orthodox Christianity. In 1987, they were involved with the collective Instruktsiya po Oborone. However, Neumoev and Yegor Letov, the leader of Grazhdanskaya Oborona, did not get along well and often quarreled over political views.Dropping out of Socialism: The Creation of Alternative Spheres in the Soviet Bloc edited by Juliane F√ºrst, Josie McLellan, et al. (Lexington Books, 2016). pp 244 Grazhdanskaya Oborona's song \\"Society Pamyat,\\" though primarily meant as a criticism of the right-wing group of the same name, was likely a reference to Instruktsiya po Vyzhivaniyu's album Pamyat and doubly- intended as a criticism of Neumoev's antisemitic views. In 1993, they joined the Russky Proryv movement. Their latest album, Armageddon Pozadi!, is being funded by a Boomstarter (Russian equivalent of Kickstarter or Pozible) page. Their most controversial song is \\"Ubit zhida\\" (Kill the Jew) from 1991. Neumoev has stated that the song is not antisemitic, but a Biblical reference, and that he will not play the song on Victory Day, because he feels the day is both for Russians and Jews. Neumoev had changed Nemirov's original lyrics (\\"kill a bull, to collect his gun\\") to \\"kill a Jew, to buy a gun,\\" at a 1991 music festival in Moscow. Nemirov disagreed with Neumoev's changes and this incident led to his departure from the band.Dropping out of Socialism: The Creation of Alternative Spheres in the Soviet Bloc edited by Juliane F√ºrst, Josie McLellan, et al.

It covers horror films, comics, novels, and toys. Dread Central has won the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Award for Best Website four times and was selected as AMC's Site of the Week in 2008.  History  Dread Central was founded on July 4, 2006. When a venture to create a horror-themed cable television channel stalled, the web team left and established their own news site. In 2012, a negative review posted by Scott Foy attracted controversy when Foy and the film's director, Jim Wynorski, engaged in a verbal altercation online. Jonathan Barkan became Dread Central's new editor-in-chief on August 3, 2018.https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/280430/on-farewells-and-new-beginnings/ On September 30, 2019, Jonathan Barkan announced he was stepping down as editor-in-chief. There are now two co-editors-in-chief: Josh Millican, and Alyse Wax.https://www.dreadcentral.com/editorials/311388/on-final-chapters- and-new-beginnings/  Website  The site's staff use horror-themed aliases. The website has a broad focus, and it covers both mainstream and fringe topics that range from horror films to comics to toys. Besides reviews and news, they also host several podcasts. Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times states, \\"if it gushes blood or desecrates flesh, Dread Central covers it.\\" The site is oriented toward a male demographic and favors edgy, exploitative films. After 10 years, Dread Central became reader-supported via Patreon. This would make Dread Central the first genre news site to switch from being ad-supported to being crowd supported. Celebrity supporters include John Carpenter, Gale Anne Hurd, Sid Haig, Adam Green, and Darren Lynn Bousman.  Other ventures  In 2007, Dread Central and VersusMedia announced Horror D'Oeuvres, a competition for independent short films. In 2008, the site partnered with several other prominent horror sites and studios in a horror-themed auction to raise money for the Entertainment Industry Foundation. In 2013, they partnered with Gas Lamp Museum and the San Diego Ghost Hunters to organize a ghost hunt at the William Heath Davis House. The proceeds went toward upkeep for the historic site. Also in 2013, they began offering the \\"Box of Dread\\", a random package full of merchandise delivered monthly to subscribers, one of whom is randomly chosen to receive a \\"special edition\\" valued at $250.  CineMayhem  CineMayhem, a film festival for independent genre films, was founded by Heather Wixson in association with Dread Central's Indie Horror Month. The festival, whose inaugural date was March 2‚Äì3, 2013, is presented in Thousand Oaks, California. The festival is backed by Scream Factory, Sideshow Collectibles, Magnet Releasing, and Breaking Glass Pictures.  Reaper Awards  Dread Central and Home Media Magazine present the Reaper Awards annually for the best home video releases and direct-to-video features. It is held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and is hosted by Steve Barton, co-founder of Dread Central.  DREAD  In 2017, Dread Central Media was acquired by Epic Pictures Group. The independent studio announced it would be launching a new distribution label specializing in horror films released in theaters and on demand. On January 29, 2019, the label was renamed DREAD. Their first in-house produced film, The Golem, will be the first film under the DREAD Originals banner. * Book of Monsters * Director's Cut * Extremity * The Golem * Imitation Girl * Lasso * The Lodgers * Slay Belles * Terrifier * To Hell and Back: The Kane Hodder Story * Vidar the Vampire * Villmark Asylum * Zombiology: Enjoy Yourself Tonight * Zone of the Dead  Reception  Dread Central was chosen as AMC's Site of the Week, in 2008.

The chair is attached to the University's College of Science and Engineering, based in the King's Buildings in Edinburgh. Appointment to the Regius Chair is by Royal Warrant from the British monarch, on the recommendation of Scotland's First Minister. History of the chair Regius professorships are a unique feature of academia in the British Isles. The first Regius professorship was in the field of medicine, and founded in 1497 by King James IV of Scotland at University of Aberdeen. Regius Chairs have since been instituted in a variety of academic disciplines in various universities. Each was established by a British monarch, and ‚Äî except in Ireland ‚Äî the current monarch still officially appoints the professor (following proper advertisement and interview, through the offices of the university and the national government). This royal imprimatur, and the relative rarity of these professorships, means a Regius Chair is prestigious and highly sought-after. Regius Professors are traditionally addressed as 'Regius' and not 'Professor'. George Wilson was appointed to a new Regius Chair of Technology in the University of Edinburgh in 1855. His interest in acquiring artefacts and relics of the industrial revolution led to his simultaneous appointment as the first Director of the Industrial Museum of Scotland (now part of the National Museum of Scotland). While this Chair of Technology was abolished on Wilson's death in 1859, the growing importance of engineering studies at the University of Edinburgh was recognised by the founding of the Regius Chair of Engineering by Queen Victoria in1868 within the university's Faculty of Arts. The new chair was endowed by Sir David Baxter, of Dundee, and supplemented by annual funds from the UK parliament. Henry Charles Fleeming Jenkin was appointed from the Chair of Engineering at University College, London, to be its first incumbent. Fleeming (pronounced as \\"Fleming\\", so we are informed by his one-time student Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote an affectionate memoir of him) Jenkin brought to the Regius Chair a notable combination of scientific knowledge, practical experience and business acumen. His reputation rested principally on his work on long-distance undersea telegraphy, and as a member of the committee which drew up the proposals for methods of electrical measurement, subsequently ratified as international electrical standards. In 1885 George Armstrong, a specialist in railway engineering, became the second Regius Professor, following his move from Yorkshire. https://books.google.com/books?id=lC5CAQAAMAAJ&lpg;=PA308&ots;=fhNDIiTZ5t&dq;=George%20Frederick%20Armstrong%201842&pg;=PA308#v=onepage&q;=George%20Frederick%20Armstrong%201842&f;=false Under his supervision, the Fulton Engineering Laboratory was established in 1889, \\"to provide systematic instruction on experimental methods ... and to familiarise students with the strength and other physical properties of the chief materials used by engineers.\\" Following Armstrong's death in 1900, Thomas Hudson Beare was appointed as the third Regius Professor of Engineering. He oversaw the Engineering Department grow from a handful of students in the basement of the university's Old College to more than a hundred occupying what the Edinburgh University Journal called \\"one of the best planned and equipped engineering schools in the Empire\\". These were the new engineering facilities at the university's King's Buildings, which had been opened in 1935. In 1946 Ronald Arnold, a Glasgow-born specialist in structural analysis and gyrodynamics, was appointed from Swansea University as the fourth Regius Professor of Engineering. Arnold pioneered in 1960 the division of the unitary department of engineering into separate departments of civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. Following the untimely death of Arnold in 1963, Leslie Jaeger was appointed fifth Regius Professor, from Magdalene College, Cambridge. Jaeger‚Äôs appointment was brief, leaving after only four years to take up the Chair of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics at McGill University (coincidentally, the chair that a previous Regius Professor, George Armstrong, had held much earlier). James King, former Chief Scientist in the Naval Construction Research Establishment at Rosyth, became the sixth Regius Professor in 1968, and on his retirement in 1983 the seventh holder of the chair was Joseph McGeough, who was appointed from the University of Aberdeen to expand the Edinburgh research activities in electro- chemical machining. Following McGeough's retiral in 2005, the university appointed, in 2007, Peter Grant as the eighth Regius Professor of Engineering, from within the enlarged 26-strong body of professors in the newly merged School of Engineering. Grant had previously led the signal processing research at Edinburgh, with achievements in the design of adaptive filters and mobile communication receivers. He was President of EURASIP, the European Association for Signal Processing from 2000‚Äì02 and recipient of the 2004 IEE Faraday medal. In 2008 he was awarded an OBE. In 2013 Jason Reese was appointed the ninth Regius Professor of Engineering. With a background in physics and applied mathematics, his research focuses on multiscale flow systems in which the molecular nature of the fluid determines the overall fluid dynamics. For example, micro and nano flows. A former Philip Leverhulme Prize for Engineering (Leverhulme Trust) winner, Bruce-Preller Prize Lecturer (Royal Society of Edinburgh) and MacRobert Award (Royal Academy of Engineering) finalist, he had previously been Weir Professor of Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics, and Head of the Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Department, at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow.

According to Ellington scholar A.H. Lawrence, the composition started out as a solo piano piece titled \\"Firewater\\" that Ellington played at the Cotton Club at the end of intermissions, as his band members returned to the stage. After he orchestrated and recorded the tune, he decided the title did not suit the work. He renamed the piece \\"Black Beauty\\" and dedicated it to singer, dancer, and comedian Florence Mills, who had died the previous year. It became one of Ellington's signature songs. Ellington first recorded it in March of 1928 with his orchestra--initially for the Brunswick label under the name \\"The Washingtonians\\", and then again a week later for the Victor label under the name \\"Duke Ellington & His Cotton Club Orchestra\\". Sixth months later, Ellington recorded a solo piano version for the OKeh label. Ellington recorded the song in the studio on several later occasions, the last being a small group version made for the Columbia label in 1960.

Although biogeography traditionally focused on plants and larger animals, recent studies have broadened this field to include distribution patterns of microorganisms. This extension of biogeography to smaller scales‚Äîknown as \\"microbial biogeography\\"‚Äîis enabled by ongoing advances in genetic technologies. The aim of microbial biogeography is to reveal where microorganisms live, at what abundance, and why. Microbial biogeography can therefore provide insight into the underlying mechanisms that generate and hinder biodiversity. Microbial biogeography also enables predictions of where certain organisms can survive and how they respond to changing environments, making it applicable to several other fields such as climate change research. History Schewiakoff (1893) theorized about the cosmopolitan habitat of free-living protozoans.Schewiakoff, W.T. 1893. √úber die geographische Verbreitung der S√º√üwasser-protozoen. Mem. Acad. Imp.

English translation, 2015, . concluded that \\"everything is everywhere, but the environment selects\\".Translated from the original Dutch: \\"Alles is overal: maar het milieu selecteert\\" Baas Becking attributed the first half of this hypothesis to his colleague Martinus Beijerinck (1913).Beijerinck, M.W.

Biogeography of Microscopic Organisms. Is Everything Small Everywhere? Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, .  Microbial vs macro-organism biogeography  The biogeography of macro- organisms (i.e., plants and animals that can be seen with the naked eye) has been studied since the eighteenth century. For macro-organisms, biogeographical patterns (i.e., which organism assemblages appear in specific places and times) appear to arise from both past and current environments. For example, polar bears live in the Arctic but not the Antarctic, while the reverse is true for penguins; although both polar bears and penguins have adapted to cold climates over many generations (the result of past environments), the distance and warmer climates between the north and south poles prevent these species from spreading to the opposite hemisphere (the result of current environments). This demonstrates the biogeographical pattern known as \\"isolation with geographic distance\\" by which the limited ability of a species to physically disperse across space (rather than any selective genetic reasons) restricts the geographical range over which it can be found. The biogeography of microorganisms (i.e., organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye, such as fungi and bacteria) is an emerging field enabled by ongoing advancements in genetic technologies, in particular cheaper DNA sequencing with higher throughput that now allows analysis of global datasets on microbial biology at the molecular level. When scientists began studying microbial biogeography, they anticipated a lack of biogeographic patterns due to the high dispersibility and large population sizes of microbes, which were expected to ultimately render geographical distance irrelevant. Indeed, in microbial ecology the oft-repeated saying by Lourens Baas Becking that ‚Äúeverything is everywhere, but the environment selects‚Äù has come to mean that as long as the environment is ecologically appropriate, geological barriers are irrelevant. However, recent studies show clear evidence for biogeographical patterns in microbial life, which challenge this common interpretation: the existence of microbial biogeographic patterns disputes the idea that ‚Äúeverything is everywhere‚Äù while also supporting the idea that environmental selection includes geography as well as historical events that can leave lasting signatures on microbial communities. Microbial biogeographic patterns are often similar to those of macro-organisms. Microbes generally follow well-known patterns such as the distance decay relationship, the abundance-range relationship, and Rapoport's rule. This is surprising given the many disparities between microorganisms and macro-organisms, in particular their size (micrometers vs. meters), time between generations (minutes vs. years), and dispersibility (global vs. local). However, important differences between the biogeographical patterns of microorganism and macro-organism do exist, and likely result from differences in their underlying biogeographic processes (e.g., drift, dispersal, selection, and mutation). For example, dispersal is an important biogeographical process for both microbes and larger organisms, but small microbes can disperse across much greater ranges and at much greater speeds by traveling through the atmosphere (for larger animals dispersal is much more constrained due to their size). As a result, many microbial species can be found in both northern and southern hemispheres, while larger animals are typically found only at one pole rather than both.  Distinct patterns = Reversed latitudinal diversity gradient  Larger organisms tend to exhibit latitudinal gradients in species diversity, with larger biodiversity existing in the tropics and decreasing toward more temperate polar regions. In contrast, a study on indoor fungal communities found microbial biodiversity to be significantly higher in temperate zones than in the tropics. The same study found that drastically different buildings exhibited the same indoor fungal composition in any given location, where similarity increased with proximity. Thus despite human efforts to control indoor climates, outside environments appear to be the strongest determinant of indoor fungal composition.  Bipolar latitude distributions  Certain microbial populations exist in opposite hemispheres and at complementary latitudes. These ‚Äòbipolar‚Äô (or ‚Äòantitropical‚Äô) distributions are much rarer in macro-organisms; although macro-organisms exhibit latitude gradients, ‚Äòisolation by geographic distance‚Äô prevents bipolar distributions (e.g., polar bears are not found at both poles). In contrast, a study on marine surface bacteria showed not only a latitude gradient, but also complementarity distributions with similar populations at both poles, suggesting no \\"isolation by geographic distance\\". This is likely due to differences in the underlying biogeographic process, dispersal, as microbes tend to disperse at high rates and far distances by traveling through the atmosphere.  Seasonal variations  Microbial diversity can exhibit striking seasonal patterns at a single geographical location. This is largely due to dormancy, a microbial feature not seen in larger animals that allows microbial community composition to fluctuate in relative abundance of persistent species (rather than actual species present). This is known as the \\"seed-bank hypothesis\\" and has implications for our understanding of ecological resilience and thresholds to change.  Applications = Directed panspermia  Panspermia suggests that life can be distributed throughout outer space via comets, asteroids, and meteoroids. Panspermia assumes that life can survive the harsh space environment, which features vacuum conditions, intense radiation, extreme temperatures, and a dearth of available nutrients. Many microorganisms are able to evade such stressors by forming spores or entering a state of low- metabolic dormancy. Studies in microbial biogeography have even shown that the ability of microbes to enter and successfully emerge from dormancy when their respective environmental conditions are favorable contributes to the high levels of microbial biodiversity observed in almost all ecosystems. Thus microbial biogeography can be applied to panspermia as it predicts that microbes are able to protect themselves from the harsh space environment, know to emerge when conditions are safe, and also take advantage of their dormancy capability to enhance biodiversity wherever they may land. Directed panspermia is the deliberate transport of microorganisms to colonize another planet. If aiming to colonize an Earth-like environment, microbial biogeography can inform decisions on the biological payload of such a mission. In particular, microbes exhibit latitudinal ranges according to Rapoport's rule, which states that organisms living at lower latitudes (near the equator) are found within smaller latitude ranges than those living at higher latitudes (near the poles). Thus the ideal biological payload would include widespread, higher- latitude microorganisms that can tolerate of a wider range of climates. This is not necessarily the obvious choice, as these widespread organisms are also rare in microbial communities and tend to be weaker competitors when faced with endemic organisms. Still, they can survive in a range of climates and thus would be ideal for inhabiting otherwise lifeless Earth-like planets with uncertain environmental conditions. Extremophiles, although tough enough to withstand the space environment, may not be ideal for directed panspermia as any given extremophile species requires a very specific climate to survive. However, if the target was closer to Earth, such as a planet or moon in our Solar System, it may be possible to select a specific extremophile species for the well-defined target environment.

The Umayyad conquest of Transoxiana had been undone in the 720s by the uprisings of the local Soghdian princes and the T√ºrgesh invasions. By 729, the small fortress of Kamarja near Samarkand (in modern Uzbekistan) was one of the last remaining Arab strongholds in Transoxiana, when it was attacked by the T√ºrgesh under the personal direction of their ruler, Suluk. The subsequent siege, for which a detailed account survives in the history of al-Tabari, lasted for 58 days and ended with the negotiated withdrawal of its garrison to Samarkand. The stubborn defence of Kamarja was celebrated in Arabic literature, but the Arab hold over the region was broken after the Battle of the Defile two years later. It was only following the collapse of the T√ºrgesh Khaganate after 738 that the Arabs re-established their rule over Transoxiana.  Background  The region of Transoxiana (Arabic: Ma wara' al-nahr) had been conquered by the Umayyad leader Qutayba ibn Muslim in the reign of al-Walid I (r. 705‚Äì715), following the Muslim conquests of Persia and Khurasan in the mid-7th century. The loyalty to the Caliphate of Transoxiana's native Iranian and Turkic populations and of the autonomous local rulers remained questionable, and in 719 the latter requested aid from the Chinese and their T√ºrgesh vassals. In response, from 720 on the T√ºrgesh launched a series of attacks against the Muslims in Transoxiana, coupled with uprisings against the Caliphate among the local Soghdians. The Umayyad governors initially managed to suppress the unrest, although control over the Ferghana Valley was lost. In 724, governor Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi and his army suffered a heavy defeat (the so-called \\"Day of Thirst\\") at the hands of the T√ºrgesh when he tried to recapture Ferghana. This defeat pushed the Arabs on the defensive, and even though no pitched battles took place, over the next few years the Arab position in Transoxiana collapsed swiftly. By 728, in the face of the T√ºrgesh attacks and a widespread anti-Arab revolt, only Samarkand and the two fortresses of Kamarja and Dabusiyya on the Zarafshan River remained in Arab hands in all of Transoxiana.  Siege  In 729, the new Arab governor, Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami, managed to cross the Oxus River and reach Bukhara against stiff opposition by the T√ºrgesh and their Soghdian allies. The Arab victory was narrow, and the T√ºrgesh were able to withdraw unmolested back towards the region of Samarkand, which brought them near the Arab fortress of Kamarja, a fortified town some seven farsakhs‚Äîroughly ‚Äîwest of Samarkand. The subsequent siege of Kamarja, narrated in al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings is, in the words of the historian Hugh N. Kennedy, \\"one of the most vividly described set pieces of the war\\". The T√ºrgesh army under the khagan Suluk, which included the contingents of Ferghana, al-Taraband (capital of Shash, modern Tashkent), Afshinah (a town near Samarkand), Nasaf, and Bukhara, approached along the Bukhara‚ÄìSamarkand road. When they reached Kamarja, the T√ºrgesh and their allies left the road and made camp, but the town's garrison was unaware of their approach as their movements were screened by a hill. The next morning, when the Arabs took their animals out to water them and climbed the hill, they were amazed to encounter the \\"mountain of steel\\" of their enemies' army, as al-Tabari writes. The Arabs sent some of their animals down the hill towards the river to lure the T√ºrgesh that way, and hastened back to the town. The T√ºrgesh soon discovered them and began pursuit, but the Arabs knew the terrain better and managed to reach the town and find refuge behind its earthworks, just before their pursuers caught up with them. A fierce fight developed as the T√ºrgesh attacked the gates and tried to enter the town, until the Arabs threw burning bundles of wood at them, driving them back across the moat. In the evening, the T√ºrgesh withdrew, and the Arabs burned the wooden bridge that spanned the moat. The khagan then sent two emissaries to the besieged. The first to approach the wall was Khosrau, a grandson of the last Sassanid Persian ruler, Yazdegerd III (r. 632‚Äì651). Khosrau's father, Peroz, had fled to the Tang court in China, and now Khosrau accompanied the T√ºrgesh in hopes of recovering his ancestral throne. When he approached the garrison, he urged them to surrender and offered them a safe-conduct, while proclaiming the restoration of his realm. The Arabs, however, indignantly refused to hear him and hurled abuses at him. As the Orientalist scholar H.A.R. Gibb writes, the presence of Khosrau \\"might be taken as an indication that the rebels were receiving encouragement from China also, though the Chinese records are silent on this expedition\\". After Khosrau's failure, the khagan sent a local, Bazaghari, to parley with the garrison, bringing a few Arab captives along with him to intimidate them. The khagan offered to take up the Arab garrison into his own army, doubling their salary, but this proposal too was rejected with disdain by the Arab negotiator, Yazid ibn Sa'id al-Bahili (chosen because he spoke a little Turkish), with the words \\"How can the Arabs, who are wolves, be with the T√ºrgesh, who are sheep?\\" His reply infuriated Bazaghari's companions, who threatened to kill him, so Yazid offered to split the garrison up: one half with their portable wealth would be allowed to retreat safely, while the other half would remain in service with the T√ºrgesh. Bazaghari accepted this offer and sent Yazid back to convey the terms to the garrison, but once he was back inside the wall, he rejected the terms and exhorted his fellow Arabs to resist. The khagan then ordered his men to fill the moat with green wood, so that it would not burn, which the garrison countered by throwing in dry wood as well. After six days, when the moat was full, the Arabs set it afire; aided by a strong wind, the hard work of the T√ºrgesh was put to nought. The Arab archers also proved effective, exacting a heavy toll among the T√ºrgesh, including Bazaghari. The T√ºrgesh then executed a hundred Arab captives in full view of the garrison. In response, the Arabs killed the 200 young locals they held as hostages, despite their desperate resistance. The narrative of the siege in al-Tabari, evidently drawing from eyewitness accounts, continues with isolated episodes: the determined T√ºrgesh assault on the gate, with five of them managing to climb the wall before being repelled, the Soghdian prince of al-Taraband who with his companions assaulted a breach in the wall which led into a house only to be killed by the house's elderly and sick owner and his family, how the Arabs used the wooden boards lining the irrigation ditches to improve their earthworks, or the time when the khagan, coming to inspect the Arab fortifications, received an arrow-shot in the face but was saved by his helmet's nose-guard. The stubborn defence of the garrison irritated the khagan, who blamed his Soghdian allies for claiming that there were \\"fifty donkeys in this (town) and that we would take it in five days, but now the five days have become two months\\". At length, the khagan resumed negotiations, and offered safe-conduct to either Dabusiyya or Samarkand, which were still in Arab hands. The garrison sent a rider to Samarkand to ask for advice, and was told to choose Dabusiyya, which was closer to Kamarja. After fifty-eight days, out of which, according to al-Tabari, the garrison \\"did not water their camels for thirty-five days\\", the siege was over. The Arabs and T√ºrgesh exchanged five hostages each, including one of Suluk's most important nobles, Kursul. After the mutual massacre of captives early in the siege, the Arabs' mistrust was such that they refused to leave until the khagan and his army had departed, and an Arab with a dagger in his hand was seated behind each of the T√ºrgesh hostages, who wore no armour. As the Arab garrison of Kamarja approached Dabusiyya, the latter's garrison at first believed that Kamarja had fallen and that the soldiers coming towards them were T√ºrgesh, but as they arrayed themselves for battle, a rider sent by the Kamarja troops alerted them as to the real situation, and \\"the men of al-Dabusiyya galloped forward to carry whoever was too weak to walk or was wounded\\". At this the hostages began being released, with the Arabs sending a hostage back and the T√ºrgesh in turn releasing one of the hostages they held. In the end, when the last two hostages were left, neither side was willing to let its own hostage go first, until the Arab hostage volunteered to go last. For this act of chivalry, he was richly rewarded by Kursul with a suit of armour and a horse.  Aftermath  As Gibb writes, \\"the fame of the defence of Kamarja spread far and wide, but it brought little relief to the pressure on the Arabs\\". Almost all of Transoxiana, except for Bukhara and Samarkand, was lost, and even in neighbouring Khwarizm, a revolt broke out, which was nonetheless swiftly suppressed by the local Arab settlers. Samarkand remained the last major outpost of Arab rule deep in Soghdia, and subsequent operations by both sides focused around it. It was while attempting to relieve the T√ºrgesh siege of the city in 731 that the Arabs suffered the calamitous Battle of the Defile, which was followed by the complete collapse of the Arab position in Transoxiana. The Arabs were not able to recover until the murder of Suluk in 738, which led to the outbreak of civil war and brought about the rapid decline of T√ºrgesh power. In 739‚Äì741, under the governorship of Nasr ibn Sayyar, the Arabs managed to re-establish the Caliphate's authority up to Samarkand.
