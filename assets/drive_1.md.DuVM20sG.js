The album was put together by Alan McGee's Poptones label as a starting point for mainstream listeners (as they would later do for The Hives with Your New Favourite Band). The album spawned four singles including the UK Top 40 hits \\"Revolution (In the Summertime?)\\" and \\"The Pain Inside\\". History Most of the tracks on the album were recorded by Wylie and Fleming in a community funded recording studio in Glasgow's Castlemilk housing scheme and released on two self-financed albums; Deliverance (1999) and Panorama (2000). These albums were critically well received and sold out their initial pressings but the limited distribution and lack of promotion meant they did not cross over to a wide audience. On hearing Panorama, Alan McGee signed the band to a one-album deal. The album would take the best of the first two albums as well as some new tracks. Track listing The album is mostly made up with ten of the fourteen tracks from Panorama with two tracks from Deliverance (\\"Glastonbury Revisited\\" and \\"Emily Darling\\") and three new tracks (\\"Sometime\\", \\"Morning Sun\\" and \\"Baby, You're So Free\\" - itself a reworked version of Deliverance track \\"Baby\\"). #\\"Brothers Gather Round\\" - 1:12 #\\"The Gun Isn't Loaded\\" - 2:51 #\\"Glastonbury Revisited\\" - 2:46 #\\"Baby, You're So Free\\" - 3:45 #\\"Value of Life\\" - 2:38 #\\"Revolution (In the Summertime?)\\" - 3:20 #\\"Have You Heard the News Today?\\" - 2:51 #\\"Sometime\\" - 3:31 #\\"Melanie\\" - 3:23 #\\"The Pain Inside\\" - 3:22 #\\"The Charm\\" - 2:03 #\\"The Loser\\" - 2:24 #\\"You've Got Me\\" - 3:10 #\\"Emily Darling\\" - 2:47 #\\"Morning Sun\\" - 0:56 Singles and chart performance Although never reaching the UK Top 50, the album spent 17 weeks on the Top 200 in 2001, peaking at #82. Steady sales meant that by the end of 2001, the album had achieved silver status (sales of 60,000) in the UK and it was named by Q magazine as one of the 50 best albums of the year. It would go on to achieve sales of over 100,000. Four singles were released on Poptones in 2001 starting with \\"Melanie\\" in February (UK #111) and \\"Baby, You're So Free\\" in April (UK #76). Their next single, \\"Revolution (In the Summertime?)\\" released in July, became their first Top 40 hit, reaching #35 and gave them their debut on BBC Television's Top of the Pops.

The mortgage servicer may be the entity that originated the mortgage, or it may have purchased the mortgage servicing rights from the original mortgage lender.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage- Backed Securities, §3:1 (Thomson West, 2013). The duties of a mortgage servicer vary, but typically include the acceptance and recording of mortgage payments; calculating variable interest rates on adjustable rate loans; payment of taxes and insurance from borrower escrow accounts; negotiations of workouts and modifications of mortgage upon default; and conducting or supervising the foreclosure process when necessary. Many borrowers confuse their mortgage servicer with their lender. A mortgage servicer may be a borrower's lender, but often the beneficial rights to the payment of principal and interest on mortgages are sold to investors such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHA, and private investors in mortgage securitization transactions. Banking organizations often perform mortgage servicing not only for mortgages they originate but for others where they have purchased the servicing rights.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, §11:6 (Thomson West, 2013). Controversies=Reluctance to modify mortgages, prevent foreclosures In July 2009, the mortgage servicing industry received criticism for many servicers' apparent unwillingness to modify adjustable rate mortgages held by homeowners on the verge of foreclosure in the United States. Despite pressure from President Barack Obama's Administration on mortgage servicers to permanently modify thousands of loans to make them more affordable and prevent foreclosures, allegations arose that the servicers had an apparent conflict of interest which led them to stop or slow the modification process in many cases. Industry insiders and legal experts cited the lucrative fees which mortgage servicers charge to delinquent homeowners as the main reason behind the slow and difficult process of modifying a mortgage. Accusations of \\"robo-signing,\\" foreclosure document fraud In October 2010, many major mortgage servicers in the United States came under intense media and government scrutiny for their alleged mishandling of the large amount of foreclosures moving through the court system. Allegations included foreclosures being processed with missing or questionable paperwork (including paperwork showing proper chain of title on the part of the investment bank), falsifying dates and other information in foreclosure documents and \\"robo- signing,\\" the practice of paying under-qualified personnel to sign hundreds or thousands of foreclosure documents a day, often without properly reviewing the documents. Congressional hearings The alleged problems regarding foreclosure fraud were so widespread and popularized by the media that U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters announced that the United States House of Representatives subcommittee on housing issues will hold a hearing on November 18, 2010 to examine problems emerging in the mortgage servicing industry. Illegal foreclosures and mortgage overcharges on active-duty military members The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) of 2003 protects United States active-duty military members from civil court proceedings (such as foreclosure) while serving their country. The SCRA also limits the interest rate which an active-duty military member can be charged on any outstanding debt (secured before their deployment) to 6% (six percentage points). In spite of these special protections granted to active-duty military members, news reports surfaced in which large mortgage servicers and investment banks illegally overcharged military families with members on active duty on their mortgages. In January 2011, JP Morgan Chase, the United States' second-largest bank based on market share, admitted that it had illegally overcharged some 4,000 active-duty military members on their home mortgage and accidentally foreclosed on as many as 14 families. Facing pressure from a United States Marine's lawsuit over the violations, Chase announced that it would work to reverse the illegal foreclosures and was mailing $2 million to the 4,000 military families as compensation, implying the mortgage bank overcharged each family an average of $500 on their mortgage. Lawsuits regarding the overcharges are still pending as of January 2011. Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden sent a letter to several large lending institutions demanding they review their operations in order to safeguard active-duty military members from illegal mortgage overcharges and fraudulent foreclosures. Those institutions included Citigroup, Inc., Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Ally Financial Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Litton Loans. International Mortgage Servicing Problems The controversy over mortgage servicing mistakes is not confined to the United States. Over 18,000 British homeowners holding adjustable rate mortgages with Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank found in July 2010 that their monthly variable interest rates had been miscalculated by a software error. The resulting corrected amortization schedule for their mortgage resulted in increased payments on an average of several hundred pounds a year. In Ireland, 436 mortgage holders with Allied Irish Bank learned in 2009 they were overcharged by an average of €900. In a statement, the bank claimed, \\"The error happened when customers were charged an interest rate that did not match the loan-to-value ratio on their account.\\" An Australian businessman who owned 3 blocks of property with several business partners won a judgement against National Australia Bank in 2010, in which the Supreme Court of New South Wales found that the bank had incorrectly charged excess interest on the related mortgages on two separate occasions. During one period of time, the interest rate on the mortgage was to be fixed at 5.65%, but NAB incorrectly charged 5.85%. At another point during the servicing of the mortgage, National Australia Bank incorrectly charged a \\"default\\" interest rate of 20%, when it should have charged less than 6%, as the loan was not in default. Even if the Australian bank had a legitimate reason to charge such a default rate, that rate should have only been an additional 4%, not 14% according to Justice Stephen Rothman's judgement. The entire proceedings lasted six years.  References  Servicer ","title":"Mortgage servicer"},{"id":"24480786","text":"La cruz is a 1997 Argentine drama film directed by Alejandro Agresti.

After only five examples had been built, with the first two being flying prototypes; the contract was terminated in September 1946. Development In early 1942, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) was planning the replacements for the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bomber and the Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber. The aircraft was to carry the torpedo in an internal bomb bay. By late 1943 it became obvious that the proposed VBT design like the Douglas SB2D had drastically increased in size and weight. Consequently, the U.S. Navy initiated a smaller dive bomber design, intended for escort carrier operation.Kowalski 1999, pp. 1–2. The BuAer recognized the engineering workload for the major wartime programs and therefore assigned the design to companies without a major wartime production contract. BuAer selected Fleetwings at Bristol, Pennsylvania (USA), which was acquired by Henry J. Kaiser in 1943.Andrews 1994, p. 28. The XBK dive bomber program was initiated in February 1944 with a contract for two prototypes. To keep the aircraft size down, it was decided that all stores would be carried externally. A radar could be carried underneath the left wing. The dive brakes were of the lower and upper picket fence type at the inboard wing trailing edge. The horizontal tail was mounted on the tailfin above the fuselage. This feature avoided empennage buffet when the dive brakes were open. The placement of the engine exhausts was unusual, being almost aft of the cockpit. It was hoped that this feature would significantly decrease drag.Francillon 1995, pp. 238–239. The XBTK-1 in flight, 1945. Second XBTK-1 with leading edge slats. A mockup inspection without engine was carried out in April 1944 while the engine was installed in May 1944, with completion of the first prototype scheduled for November 1944.Francillon 1995, p. 239. To speed up later production, the U.S. Navy even constructed a new airfield at the Fleetwing plant. In early 1945, BuAer requested that the aircraft would be able to carry a torpedo. The weapon was fitted to a new centreline station and the designation was changed to XBTK. The first XBTK-1 was finally completed in March 1945, making its first flight on 12 April 1945. Operational history The flight testing revealed inadequate engine cooling and severe fuselage vibration. Resolution of these problems and the replacement of the R-2800-22W engine, which was already out of production, by the -34 delayed restart of flight trials until July 1945. The aircraft was delivered to the U.S. Navy Naval Air Test Center at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, in August 1945 for evaluation. After the end of World War II, the U.S. Navy cut orders from 20 to 10 aircraft.Andrews 1994, pp. 28–29. Test results recommended replacement of the novel exhaust system with a more normal system, as the cockpit temperature was very high and cockpit entry and exit after an engine shutdown was extremely difficult. It also noted that stall performance was poor, particularly with power off. It was noted, however, that diving characteristics were superior to any dive bomber in service or under development.Andrews 1994, p. 29. The aircraft was transported back to Fleetwings where redesign began. The second production aircraft first flew in March 1946 and featured built-in leading edge slots which greatly improved the stall performance of the aircraft. However, by early 1946 procurement of new aircraft was drastically cut down and the BTK found its role already filled by the Douglas AD Skyraider and Martin AM Mauler. In May 1946 it was decided to complete five airframes already in production. Continued testing revealed problems when the aircraft was put in a spin, and the U.S. Navy finally terminated the contract on 3 September 1946, as there was no need for the aircraft anymore. The five prototypes were scrapped, with the two \\"flying\\" examples broken up by April 1946.Kowalski 1999, p. 26.

Through each of the many levels, the goal is to reach the door at the end. Lighting is a key gameplay mechanic, as only platforms and walls illuminated by lightbulbs, or orbs of light the player can carry can actually be touched by the player. The player can therefore walk through walls or fall through the floor based on where the light is. However, this also means the player can fall to their death accidentally by neglecting to stay inside of lit areas. There are also other objects which the player can interact with, such as hinged spotlights, keys, orb pedestals with various purposes and vines tied to orbs of light. The player has to make use of the light source and light orbs in order to get through the area without falling off the bottom. Reception Closure received scores of 78/100 for the PC version (based on 8 reviews) and 81/100 for the PlayStation 3 version (based on 11 reviews) on Metacritic, both indicating \\"generally favorable\\" reviews.

The screenplay was written by Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin, and Andres Heinz, based on an original story by Heinz. The film stars Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, and Winona Ryder. The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet by the New York City Ballet company. The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina (Portman) is a perfect fit, as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities better embodied by the new rival Lily (Kunis). Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into madness. Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a production of Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies and the notion of being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers. Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Double as another inspiration for the film. The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film The Wrestler, with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art. He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios, Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months before filming began. Black Swan premiered as the opening film for the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 1, 2010. It had a limited release in the United States starting December 3, 2010 and opened in wide release on December 17. The film upon release was a critical and commercial success. Critics praised Portman's performance and Aronofsky's direction, while the film grossed over $329 million worldwide. It received five nominations at the 83rd Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and winning Best Actress (for Portman). Plot Nina Sayers is a 28-year-old dancer in a New York City ballet company, which is preparing to open its new season with Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. With prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre being forced into retirement, artistic director Thomas Leroy announces he is looking for a new dancer to portray the dual role of the innocent White Swan Odette and the sensual Black Swan Odile. Nina auditions for the role and gives a flawless performance as Odette, but fails to embody Odile. The following day, Nina asks Thomas to reconsider choosing her to play the role. When he forcibly kisses her, she bites him before running out of his office. Later that day, Nina sees the cast list and discovers, much to her surprise and that of her overprotective mother Erica, she will be portraying the lead. At a gala celebrating the new season, an intoxicated Beth confronts Nina, accusing her of sleeping with Thomas to get the role. The following day, Nina discovers that Beth was hit by a car while walking in the street and Thomas believes she did it on purpose. During rehearsals, Thomas tells Nina to observe new dancer Lily, whom he describes as possessing an uninhibited quality that Nina lacks. Nina also falls victim to several hallucinations of a doppelgänger following her wherever she goes and finds unexplained scratch marks on her back. One night, Nina accepts Lily's invitation to dinner despite Erica's objections. Over dinner, Lily offers Nina an ecstasy capsule to help her relax. Nina turns it down, but later accepts a drink laced with ecstasy powder. After consuming it, Nina become sexually interested in not only the men at the bar, but Lily as well. The two dance at a nightclub and return to Nina's apartment late. After fighting with her mother, Nina barricades herself in her room and has sex with Lily. The following morning, Nina wakes up alone and realizes she is late for the dress rehearsal. Upon arriving at Lincoln Center, she finds Lily dancing as Odile and confronts her about their night together. When Lily denies that the sexual part of the evening had ever taken place, Nina wonders whether or not their sexual encounter was a hallucination. After learning that Thomas has made Lily her alternate, Nina's hallucinations grow increasingly strong to the point where her mother tries to prevent her from performing on opening night. Nina forces her way past her mother, shouting, \\"I'm the Swan Queen, you're the one who never left the corps!\\". She arrives at Lincoln Center only to discover that Lily is indeed set to take over her role. She confronts Thomas, who becomes so impressed by her confidence that he allows her to perform as Odette. During the end of the ballet's second act, Nina becomes distracted by another hallucination, causing the Prince to drop her on stage. She returns to her dressing room and finds Lily preparing to play Odile. When Lily transforms into Nina's evil twin, the two engage in a fight that ends with Nina stabbing the doppelgänger with a shard of glass from a mirror that gets smashed, only to reveal that it is actually Lily who has been stabbed. She hides the corpse and returns to the stage, where she loses herself and gives a flawless performance as Odile. Nina receives a standing ovation from the audience and, after surprising Thomas with a passionate kiss, returns to her dressing room. While changing, Nina hears a knock at the door and opens it to find Lily alive and congratulating her. Realizing the fight never occurred, yet the mirror is still broken, she also realizes that she actually stabbed herself and pulls a shard of glass from her own abdomen. After dancing the final act, in which Odette attempts to commit suicide by throwing herself off a cliff but instead falls onto a hidden mattress, the theater erupts in thunderous applause while Thomas, Lily, and the rest of the cast all gather to congratulate Nina. They then discover that she is bleeding profusely. Thomas orders some of the dancers to go get help and frantically asks Nina what happened to her. Nina replies to him that her performance was perfect and loses consciousness as the screen slowly fades to blinding white light and the credits roll. Cast During the closing credits, the major cast members were credited both as their film characters as well as their corresponding characters from Swan Lake. * Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers / The Swan Queen * Mila Kunis as Lily / The Black Swan * Vincent Cassel as Thomas Leroy / The Gentleman * Barbara Hershey as Erica Sayers / The Queen * Winona Ryder as Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" MacIntyre / The Dying Swan * Benjamin Millepied as David Moreau / The Prince * Ksenia Solo as Veronica / Little Swan * Kristina Anapau as Galina / Little Swan * Janet Montgomery as Madeline / Little Swan * Sebastian Stan as Andrew / Suitor * Toby Hemingway as Tom / Suitor * Sergio Torrado as Sergio / Rothbart Production=Conception The scene from the ballet Swan Lake in which the Black Swan (Odile) tricks and seduces the Prince Darren Aronofsky first became interested in ballet when his sister studied dance at the High School of Performing Arts in New York City. The basic idea for the film started when he hired screenwriters to rework a screenplay called The Understudy, which portrayed off-Broadway actors and explored the notion of being haunted by a double. Aronofsky said the screenplay had elements of All About Eve, Roman Polanski's The Tenant, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novella The Double. The director had also seen numerous productions of Swan Lake, and he connected the duality of the White Swan and the Black Swan to the script. When researching for the production of Black Swan, Aronofsky found ballet to be \\"a very insular world\\" whose dancers were \\"not impressed by movies\\". Regardless, the director found active and inactive dancers to share their experiences with him. He also stood backstage to see the Bolshoi Ballet perform at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Aronofsky called Black Swan a companion piece to his previous film The Wrestler, recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds as \\"too much for one movie\\". He compared the two films: \\"Wrestling some consider the lowest art—if they would even call it art—and ballet some people consider the highest art. But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are. They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves.\\" About the psychological thriller nature of Black Swan, actress Natalie Portman compared the film's tone to Polanski's 1968 film Rosemary's Baby, while Aronofsky said Polanski's Repulsion (1965) and The Tenant (1976) were \\"big influences\\" on the final film. Actor Vincent Cassel also compared Black Swan to Polanski's early works and additionally compared it to David Cronenberg's early works. Casting Mila Kunis was first approached to perform in Black Swan in 2008. Aronofsky first discussed with Portman the possibility of a ballet film in 2000, and he found she was interested in playing a ballet dancer. Portman explained being part of Black Swan, \\"I'm trying to find roles that demand more adulthood from me because you can get stuck in a very awful cute cycle as a woman in film, especially being such a small person.\\" Portman suggested to Aronofsky that her good friend Mila Kunis would be perfect for the role. Kunis contrasted Lily with Nina, \\"My character is very loose ... She's not as technically good as Natalie's character, but she has more passion, naturally. That's what [Nina] lacks.\\" The female characters are directed in the Swan Lake production by Thomas Leroy, played by Cassel. He compared his character to George Balanchine, who co- founded New York City Ballet and was \\"a control freak, a true artist using sexuality to direct his dancers\\". Portman and Kunis started training six months before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers. Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming. A few months closer to filming, she began choreography training. Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, \\"train[ing] seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day.\\" She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman \\"became smaller than I did.\\"Stated by Kunis on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, December 6, 2010. Kunis said, \\"I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet. You wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl. But this is very different because you can't fake it. You can't just stay in there and like pretend you know what you're doing. Your whole body has to be structured differently.\\" Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as \\"dance doubles\\" for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: \\"Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane, a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouettés, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed.\\" In addition to the soloist performances, members of the Pennsylvania Ballet were cast as the corps de ballet, backdrop for the main actors' performances. Also appearing in the film are Kristina Anapau, Toby Hemingway, Sebastian Stan, and Janet Montgomery. Development and filming Part of the filming took place at the State University of New York at Purchase Performing Arts Center. Aronofsky and Portman first discussed a ballet film in 2000, after the release of Requiem for a Dream, though the script had not yet been written. He told her about a love scene between competing ballet dancers, and Portman recalled, \\"I thought that was very interesting because this movie is in so many ways an exploration of an artist's ego and that narcissistic sort of attraction to yourself and also repulsion with yourself.\\" On the decade's wait before production, she said, \\"The fact that I had spent so much time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot.\\" The screenplay The Understudy was written by Andres Heinz; Aronofsky first heard about it while editing his second film Requiem for a Dream (2000) and described it as \\"All About Eve with a double, set in the off-Broadway world.\\" After making The Fountain (2006), Aronofsky and producer Mike Medavoy had screenwriter John McLaughlin rewrite The Understudy; Aronofsky said McLaughlin \\"took my idea of Swan Lake and the ballet and put [the story] into the ballet world and changed the title to Black Swan.\\" When Aronofsky proposed a detailed outline of Black Swan to Universal Pictures, the studio decided to fast-track development of the project in January 2007. The project \\"sort of died, again\\" according to Aronofsky, until after the making of The Wrestler (2008), when he had Mark Heyman, director of development of Aronofsky's production company Protozoa Pictures, write for Black Swan \\"and made it something that was workable.\\" By June 2009, Universal had placed the project in turnaround, generating attention from other studios and specialty divisions, particularly with actress Portman attached to star. Black Swan began development under Protozoa Pictures and Overnight Productions, the latter financing the film. In July 2009, Kunis was cast. Fox Searchlight Pictures distributed Black Swan and gave the film a production budget of $10–12 million. Principal photography was achieved using Super 16 mm cameras and began in New York City toward the end of 2009.Retrieved March 6, 2011 Part of filming took place at the Performing Arts Center at State University of New York at Purchase. Aronofsky filmed Black Swan with a muted palette and a grainy style, which he intended to be similar to The Wrestler. Aronofsky said: Musical soundtrack The non- original music featured in Black Swan consists of music by Tchaikovsky featuring performances on-screen and in the soundtrack by violinist Tim Fain and a track of electronica dance music by English production duo The Chemical Brothers. It marks the fifth consecutive collaboration between Aronofsky and English composer Clint Mansell, who composed the original score for the film. Mansell attempted to score the film based on Tchaikovsky's ballet but with radical changes to the music. Because of the use of Tchaikovsky's music, the score was deemed ineligible to be entered into the 2010 Academy Awards for Best Original Score. The Chemical Brothers' music, which is featured prominently during the club scene in Black Swan, is omitted from the soundtrack album. Release Portman at a premiere for the film at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival Black Swan had its world premiere as the opening film at the 67th Venice Film Festival on September 1, 2010. It received a standing ovation whose length Variety said made it \\"one of the strongest Venice openers in recent memory\\". The festival's artistic director Marco Mueller had chosen Black Swan over The American (starring George Clooney) for opening film, saying, \\"[It] was just a better fit ... Clooney is a wonderful actor, and he will always be welcome in Venice. But it was as simple as that.\\" Black Swan screened in competition and is the third consecutive film directed by Aronofsky to premiere at the festival, following The Fountain and The Wrestler. Black Swan was presented in a sneak screening at the Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2010. It also had a Gala screening at the 35th Toronto International Film Festival later in the month. In October 2010, Black Swan was screened at the New Orleans Film Festival, the Austin Film Festival, and the BFI London Film Festival. In November 2010, the film was screened at American Film Institute's AFI Fest in Los Angeles, the Denver Film Festival and Camerimage Festival in Bydgoszcz, Poland. The release of Black Swan in the United Kingdom was brought forward from February 11 to January 21, 2011. According to The Independent, the film was considered one of \\"the most highly anticipated\\" films of late 2010. The newspaper then compared it to the 1948 ballet film The Red Shoes in having \\"a nightmarish quality ... of a dancer consumed by her desire to dance\\". Box office Black Swan had a limited release in select cities in North America on December 3, 2010, in 18 theaters and was a surprise box office success. The film took in a total of $415,822 on its opening day, averaging $23,101 per theater. By the end of its opening weekend it grossed $1,443,809—$80,212 per theater. The per location average was the second highest for the opening weekend of 2010 behind The King's Speech. The film is Fox Searchlight Pictures' highest per-theater average gross ever, and it ranks 21st on the all-time list. On its second weekend the film expanded to 90 theaters, and grossed $3.3 million, ranking it as the sixth film at the box-office. In its third weekend, it expanded again to 959 theaters and grossed $8,383,479. The film went on to gross over $106 million in the United States and over $329 million worldwide. Home media The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in Region 1/Region A on March 29, 2011. The Region 2/Region B version was released on May 16, 2011. Reception=Critical response Black Swan cast and crew (from left to right: producer Scott Franklin, actress Mila Kunis, actor Vincent Cassel, director Darren Aronofsky) discuss the film with Sandra Hebron at the BFI London Film Festival, where it was nominated for Best Film Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 85% based on 308 reviews, and an average rating of 8.19/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Bracingly intense, passionate, and wildly melodramatic, Black Swan glides on Darren Aronofsky's bold direction—and a bravura performance from Natalie Portman.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out to reviews, the film received an average score of 79 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In September 2010, Entertainment Weekly reported that based on reviews from the film's screening at the Venice Film Festival, \\"[Black Swan] is already set to be one of the year's most love-it-or-hate-it movies.\\" Leonard Maltin, on his blog Movie Crazy, admitted that he \\"couldn't stand\\" the film, despite praising Natalie Portman's performance. Reuters described the early response to the film as \\"largely positive\\" with Portman's performance being highly praised. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that \\"the film divided critics. Some found its theatricality maddening, but most declared themselves 'swept away'.\\" Kurt Loder of Reason magazine called the film \\"wonderfully creepy\\", and wrote that \\"it's not entirely satisfying; but it's infused with the director's usual creative brio, and it has a great dark gleaming look.\\"Loder, Kurt (December 2, 2010) Black Swan, Reason Mike Goodridge from Screen Daily called Black Swan \\"alternately disturbing and exhilarating\\" and described the film as a hybrid of The Turning Point and Polanski's films Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. Goodridge described Portman's performance, \\"[She] is captivating as Nina ... she captures the confusion of a repressed young woman thrown into a world of danger and temptation with frightening veracity.\\" The critic also commended Cassel, Kunis, and Hershey in their supporting roles, particularly comparing Hershey to Ruth Gordon in the role of \\"the desperate, jealous mother\\". Goodridge praised Libatique's cinematography with the dance scenes and the psychologically \\"unnerving\\" scenes: \\"It's a mesmerising psychological ride that builds to a gloriously theatrical tragic finale as Nina attempts to deliver the perfect performance.\\" Black Swan opened at the 67th Venice International Film Festival, making it the third consecutive Aronofsky film to be screened at the ceremony. It was nominated for the Golden Lion and Mila Kunis won the Marcello Mastroianni Award. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review. He wrote, \\"[Black Swan] is an instant guilty pleasure, a gorgeously shot, visually complex film whose badness is what's so good about it. You might howl at the sheer audacity of mixing mental illness with the body-fatiguing, mind-numbing rigors of ballet, but its lurid imagery and a hellcat competition between two rival dancers is pretty irresistible.\\" Honeycutt commended Millepied's \\"sumptuous\\" choreography and Libatique's \\"darting, weaving\\" camera work. The critic said of the thematic mashup, \\"Aronofsky ... never succeeds in wedding genre elements to the world of ballet ... White Swan/Black Swan dynamics almost work, but the horror-movie nonsense drags everything down the rabbit hole of preposterousness.\\" Similarly, in a piece for The Huffington Post, Rob Kirkpatrick praised Portman's performance but compared the film's story to that of Showgirls (1995) and Burlesque (2010) while concluding Black Swan is \\"simply higher- priced cheese, Aronofsky's camembert to [Burlesque director Steve] Antin's cheddar. The film has been criticized for its portrayal of ballet and ballet dancers. Upon the film's release in the United Kingdom, The Guardian interviewed four professional ballet dancers in the UK: Tamara Rojo, Lauren Cuthbertson, Edward Watson, and Elena Glurjidze. Rojo called the film \\"lazy ... featuring every ballet cliche going.\\" Watson felt that the film \\"makes [ballet] look so naff and laughable. It doesn't show why ballet is so important to us – why we would want to try so hard.\\" The Canadian Press also reported that many Canadian ballet dancers felt that the film depicted dancers negatively and exaggerated elements of their lives but gave Portman high marks for her dance technique. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Gillian Murphy, a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre praised the visual elements of the film but noted that the film presentation of the ballet world was \\"extreme.\\" Controversies Several critics noted striking similarities between Satoshi Kon's 1997 anime film Perfect Blue and Aronofsky's Black Swan. In response to comparisons between Perfect Blue and Black Swan, Aronofsky acknowledged the similarities in 2010, but denied that Black Swan was inspired by Perfect Blue. Kon noted in his blog that he had met with Aronofsky in 2001. =Costume design= Amy Westcott is credited as the costume designer and received several award nominations. A publicized controversy arose regarding the question of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers. An article in the British newspaper The Independent suggested those costumes had actually been created by Rodarte's Kate and Laura Mulleavy. Westcott challenged that view and stated that in all only 7 costumes, among them the Black and White Swan, had been created in a collaboration between Rodarte, Westcott, and Aronofsky. Furthermore, the corps ballet's costumes were designed by Zack Brown (for the American Ballet Theatre), and slightly adapted by Westcott and her costume design department. Westcott said: \\"Controversy is too complimentary a word for two people using their considerable self-publicising resources to loudly complain about their credit once they realized how good the film is.\\" =Dance double= ABT dancer Sarah Lane served as a \\"dance double\\" for Portman in the film. In a March 3 blog entry for Dance Magazine, editor-in-chief Wendy Perron asked: \\"Do people really believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film, but that doesn't add up to being a ballerina. However, it seems that many people believe that Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan.\\" This led to responses from Benjamin Millepied and Aronofsky, who both defended Portman, as well as a response from Lane claiming that she has not been given due credit. Accolades and awards Black Swan appeared on many critics' top ten lists of 2010 and is frequently considered to be one of the best films of the year. It was featured on the American Film Institute's 10 Movies of the Year. On January 25, 2011 the film was nominated for five Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing) and won one for Portman's performance.

It is a complex of three late 19th-century brick buildings on a 4-acre (1.6 ha) lot, and the ruins of a dam. Originally built to harness the nearby Kayaderosseras Creek for textile production, in the years of the Gilded Age, George West converted it to paper bag production and made the center of his company. It later became a chocolate factory, and then a warehouse for a local plastics concern. In 1982 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is now used as a retail complex. Property The property is a wedge-shaped parcel with Milton Avenue on the east, the Kayaderosseras Creek on the north and Prospect Street to the south and west. There is a slight rise on the west, and the complex is built into that. The surrounding neighborhood, downtown Ballston Spa, is mostly commercial. The Register listing includes three buildings — the George West Office Building, Union Mill and West Bag Factory — and one structure, the ruins of the former dam that began the industrial use of the property. All three buildings are built of brick laid in common bond with pressed metal roofs. Metal is also used for many of the decorative touches, such as iron finials, window caps, balustrades, cornices and dormer windows. The mill itself is an L-shaped four story building with two stair towers in the late Second Empire style, with corbeled brickwork and cast iron detailing. The original timber framing has been replaced by reinforced concrete on the lower stories. The east tower has a clock face in one dormer and a bell, cast by Jones & Co. of Troy. The bag factory is a two-and-a-half–story 3-by-16-bay gabled building. The windows have flat-arched lintels and hammered limestone sills. The attic windows in the gable ends have been bricked over. It retains the exposed timber rafters and Italianate metal monitors. Its structural system is the original timber. On its east is the George West Office Building, later converted into a creamery. It is a five-by-three-bay two-story gabled structure with a perpendicularly attached nine-by-three-bay gabled single- story wing. On the south elevation is a two-and-a-half-story tower with metallic mansard roof dormers and bracketed cornice. The mill and office building retain much of their original finishing. The former, redecorated in a Queen Anne mode by Saratoga Springs architect R.N. Brezee, features oak and cherry wainscoting, a highly decorated cashier's desk and walk-in vault. Similarly, the bag factory has a wainscoted cashier's office with pay windows, staircase with two open flight and varnished newel posts with turned balusters. It, too, has a walk-in vault. The owner's office overlooking Prospect Street has paneled and varnished cherry wainscoting, tiled fireplace, and pedimented cherry window moldings. The factory has no significant decorative touches. There is no historical machinery left in it or either of the other buildings. Behind the buildings, the Blue Mill Dam on the creek was demolished in the mid-20th century. Some of its stone piers remain. History=Early history Development of the property began around 1830, when Hezekiah Middlebrook first dammed the creek. The Ballston Mill Company built the first cotton mill there in 1844. Six years later, in 1850, they added a woolen mill, the current Bag Factory. In 1878 fire destroyed the original Union Cotton Mill. The following year George West bought the property. The George West era George West had profited during the Civil War when he invented the flat-bottomed paper bag, the first which could hold as much as . After the fire he bought the property and built the current structure, renaming it the Union Paper Mill. Power came from a renovated flume and the turbine from the cotton mill. He also enlarged the wool mill and turned it into a bag factory. Over the next six years the office building was built, intended to be a showpiece of contemporary office design. In 1882 the dam was destroyed in a flood and rebuilt. The clock tower was illuminated with electric light in 1885, followed by the whole mill the next year. The dam was breached and rebuilt in 1886 as well, only to be breached again by another flood. West enlarged the main mill building again in 1889. By this point the complex was the headquarters of a company that operated nine mills, two factories and a pulp mill in northern Saratoga County. He sold his holdings to the Union Bag & Paper Company in 1899.Lost Industries of the Kaydeross Valley: A History of Manufacturing in Ballston Spa, New York; Timothy Starr, 2007. Bischoff's chocolates In 1918 the buildings were sold to German immigrant Frederick Bischoff. His chocolate company had outgrown its original location in Brooklyn and needed new space quickly. A Philadelphia firm renovated the interiors extensively for its new use and shored up the mill with steel and reinforced concrete. All the original machinery was removed by 1920. Bischoff installed colored lights to illuminate the water falling over the dam and made other improvements to the immediate vicinity. Bischoff died in 1942. In 1945 wartime chocolate shortages forced the plant to close. The dam collapsed in 1947 and was not rebuilt. Later history The complex was sold at auction in 1950 and experienced a variety of owners including a knitting company and Tufflite Plastics, a local company which made plastic products, and used the mill as a warehouse. Tufflite closed in the late 1990s. In 1997 the complex underwent extensive interior renovation and was converted into space for small retailers, professional offices, and a restaurant.

It aired on October 12, 2009.  Plot  Wealthy and successful Roy Randall ends his business meeting partway through and heads upstairs to his ill son Jack's room. Jack's doctor says the diagnosis is not what he thought, and recommends his father get him to the hospital. Roy wants House to work on the case, and despite explaining that House is currently unavailable, Cuddy eventually agrees to get House on the case. The patient will officially belong to Foreman but House will lead the team. House decides to start off by completely re- analyzing Jack's history and symptoms. Cameron does a physical on Jack; she notices that Jack feels no pain when she presses his belly. Cameron shows the team Jack's x-rays. She says he's constipated. Foreman diagnoses Hirschsprung's disease. They do a barium enema and a biopsy to confirm. Cameron reviews the x-rays they've done on Jack over the course of over a week which show his colon is clear. Cameron checks Jack's belly and says while it feels better, it appears larger. Just then, Jack's right eye fixes (lateral rectus palsy) and he seizes. They give him diazepam for the seizure. Foreman sees Jack's optic disc is swollen, indicating intracranial hypertension. They give him furosemide and phenytoin to relieve the pressure but it does nothing so they rush him to the O.R to relieve the pressure before Jack's brain herniates and he has irreversible brain damage. They paralyze him for the procedure with pancuronium. They manage to relieve the pressure and Jack does not have any more seizures, but he continues to build up fluid in his abdominal and dural cavities. Foreman notices the shape of the fluid collection is odd, House recommends they do a dural biopsy to confirm brain cancer. Meanwhile, Cuddy also says that he and Chase must present the Dibala case, which unsettles Chase. Foreman and Chase go over the Dibala presentation, making sure they're covering all the evidence. Foreman is extremely apprehensive about the situation. It will get a lot of attention since it was House's case. House overhears Foreman saying, 'I just need to know you've got everything covered,' and asks them what they're talking about. Later, Foreman tells Chase that when Cameron ran Dibala's blood, the printout he got was only what tests Cameron ordered, but the lab did a full work up and Chase did not check the man's cholesterol. Foreman informs a speechless Chase he was off by 20%. Cameron asks Chase what's wrong. Chase denies anything is wrong, but finally tells her there is a problem with the figures on Dibala's blood panels. A sub-plot also revolves around Thirteen. House finds Thirteen at a cafe. She tells him she is making travel plans and does not intend to return to the hospital. They discuss her relationship with Foreman. They say good-bye to each other and Thirteen watches House leave with a smile. Thirteen is shown going to her flight, but it turns out her reservation got cancelled. She goes to Wilson and House's apartment and tells House to stay out of her life. She accuses him of spying on her and then cancelling her reservations to get her back on the team. House claims Foreman is working much better without her, so he doesn't want her back. House accuses Foreman of canceling Thirteen's reservations. Foreman denies this, saying he intends to move on. House tells him he will be a good boss. Chase and Cameron tell Roy that Jack might have brain cancer, adding that there is no visible signs of a mass so if it is cancer they've caught it early. Cameron wants to help with the biopsy but Chase tells her to stay home and rest, and that he will wake her up when he gets back. Cameron wakes up, but Chase is not there. Chase and Foreman are at the hospital going over the Dibala case, not knowing what to make about the new cholesterol problem. Cameron arrives and tells them Jack's biopsy results came back negative. House suggests adenocarcinoma of the stomach, which would cause all Jack's symptoms and not show up on the CT. Chase and Cameron scope Jack and get another set of biopsies. Roy tells Cameron he inherited a business when he was 24 and made major deals until he was very rich. He says everything he touches turns to gold except his family. First he lost his wife, now his son. He thinks it is karma. Just then, Jack starts to seize again, but the readouts show it is not intracranial pressure. There are no signs of masses in Jack's stomach or esophageal lining and he's still accumulating subdural and peritoneal fluid. House notes that Jack seizes every time they try to look at something. It can't be cancer. Chase suggests a drug-resistant strain of an infection, but all the tests have been negative. Cameron suggests abdominal epilepsy. The seizures would look like pain and protein malnutrition would cause fevers. It is their best theory so they start him on gabapentin. However, Jack's EEG shows no interictal spikes so Jack can't have abdominal epilepsy, but he has a rash on his chest. Chase talks with Foreman about Dibala's case. He says he could have 'prescribed' statins and simply forgot to chart it. Foreman figures Chase is going to accuse the pharmacy of bad bookkeeping but Chase suggests they say he just went up and took it out. Foreman walks away and says he'll handle it. He tells Cuddy that he can't do the Dibala presentation as he is very busy with Jack's case and that House is pawning his responsibilities onto Foreman. Cuddy reminds him they're Foreman's responsibilities, not House's. Cuddy is firm that Foreman present the case. The team reviews the symptoms: fever, stomach pain, seizures, peritoneal and subdural fluid collection and a rash. Cameron notes that if it is not cancer or infection it has to be autoimmune. Chase says polyarteritis nodosa. House tells them to start Jack on prednisone and get a testicular biopsy – if Jack has any real inflammation, it will be down there. Foreman says he will do it with Cameron. Cameron asks what's going on. Foreman claims the father will not be happy with a fourth set of biopsies and Cameron has a better rapport. He says he also wants Chase to over-prep for Dibala's M and M. House asks if the rash is on Jack's penis. It is, meaning it is most likely affecting the small blood vessels which explains why they did not see any inflammation on the biopsies. He says it is Degos disease. House tells Roy Jack has Degos disease, which is incurable. Roy insists House is wrong, but House rechecked all the biopsies. Jack has a day at most. House sees Chase agitated in the differential room. Chase goes to Cuddy's office and tells her Foreman can't present the Dibala case, but not because of time. He starts to tell Cuddy the truth when they get interrupted. Cuddy is called to pediatric ICU by a bunch of lawyers. Before she goes she tells Chase to come clean if they screwed up as it won't be that bad. In Jack's room, Roy's lawyers are calling him insane, but House says he is merely irrational. Roy believes it is karma and that if he gets rid of everything he has, it'll help his son. The lawyers tell him that thousands of lives will be affected if he goes bankrupt. Roy signs the paperwork to divest himself of his business. As Roy's lawyers exit the room Jack flatlines. Cuddy tells House Thirteen called to say someone hacked her email and cancelled her reservations. She suspects Foreman. House is surprised she's not accusing him. Cuddy wants to know if he still believes Foreman should be in charge. He tells her that Foreman loves power, he loves puzzles. Cuddy says House loves both. House says, \\"But when I had both..... It wasn't Foreman because he said he'd moved on.\\" Thirteen later shows up at Wilson's office. She thanks him for thinking it was worth breaking the law to keep her around. Thirteen had the techs chase IP addresses to find out who accessed her email; only her and Wilson's IP addresses showed up. He tries to say it was House but eventually admits he did it. He says House needs someone that does not need him. She's the only one who does not feed into his crazy vortex, she keeps his ego in check. Wilson tells her it is a great job, maybe even better now that House is at least trying to have real relationships with people. He tells Thirteen to not throw it all away due to a bad breakup. Thirteen bids Wilson farewells and leaves. Wilson goes to House and says he confessed to cancelling Thirteen's reservation. House says he knows it was not Wilson and asks why he confessed to it. Wilson asks House why he did it, and he responds that Thirteen is making a mistake as she is a good doctor. House starts to tell Wilson he was born with a heart three sizes too small, then has an epiphany. He goes to Jack's room. He tells Foreman that the cardiac arrest was a coronary event, meaning Jack's coronary vessels were obstructed, which can't be from Degos. He says it is primary antiphospholipid syndrome and tells him to start Jack on heparin and IV immunoglobulin. House also says that when Thirteen got 'screwed over' she went to him, Cuddy and Wilson – everyone but Foreman. He says she's not over him. Foreman replies, 'Or she is.' Chase finds some test results sitting on Dibala's file. He goes to Foreman and brings the document. It shows that one of Dibala's doctors prescribed niacin-bound chromium supplements to increase the HDLs. Neither Foreman nor Chase requested the information, which means someone else knows. The next day, House sees in the papers that Roy declared bankruptcy. He stops by Jack's room. He finds Jack sitting up in bed. Roy tells House, \\"It worked.\\" House says the medicine worked. When Roy insists it was karma, House shakes his head and leaves. House enters the office and Chase is sitting at his desk, playing with his ball. Chase wants to know how House knew.

The US Embassy was set on fire by a small group of protesters. A small protest also occurred in London and 5,000 protesters demonstrated in Kosovska Mitrovica the following day. Kosovo police were injured during a protest by 150 war veterans at a border crossing on 25 February. *Violent protests using the slogan occurred in Montenegro after the government recognised the independence of Kosovo in October 2008. When Serbia agreed to integrated border arrangement, right-wing organisations protested outside of Belgrade shouting \\"Kosovo je Srbija\\".  Notable uses  *In March 2008, American-born Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić won the European championship in the 50 m butterfly, setting the new European record, a result briefly quashed when the European Swimming Federation (LEN) disqualified the swimmer for wearing a T-shirt at the medals ceremony that read “Kosovo is Serbia” in Cyrillic. *The Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic used the phrase.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hC88kKdujI *On January 15, 2017, Serbian authorities sent a train (known as the Belgrade–Kosovska Mitrovica train incident) from Belgrade destined for Kosovo, painted with the slogan and iconography inside, which was stopped at the border by Kosovar officials as it was considered to be provocative. Aleksandar Vučić ordered the train to be stopped at Raška as he believed the rail had been mined. The new train was intended for peace relations but was instead used by Tomislav Nikolić to the \\"brink of conflict\\", according to Kosovar officials. Serbian media campaign Solidarity - Kosovo is Serbia () is a media campaign in Serbia launched by Petar Petković in the final months of the negotiations over Kosovo and organised with the participation of 25 notable Serbian public figures, among them: Bata Živojinović, Svetlana Bojković, Dragan Bjelogrlić, Sergej Trifunović, Dragan Jovanović, Bora Đorđević, Đorđe David, Miki Jevremović, Slađana Milošević, Merima Njegomir and Emir Kusturica. In 2000, more than 50 websites, including those of Adidas and Manchester United, were hacked with the message Kosovo je Srbija. Reception Historians Noel Malcolm and Andrea R. Nagy commented on the slogan. Malcolm claimed that Kosovo was not the \\"cradle\\" of Serbia as it was held by Serbs only centuries after they invaded the Balkans and then only for 250 years before the Ottoman occupation. Kosovo was liberated by the Kingdom of Serbia in 1912 and became part of Yugoslavia in 1918. Nagy states that \\"In some sense this slogan is true\\", but notes that Kosovo was administered by Serbia for only a short period.

His penname was Jwa-ong (좌옹, 佐翁Korean spelling for Sitdown is old man); his courtesy name was Sungheum (성흠;聖欽), or Sungheum (성흠;成欽). Yun was a prominent member of reformist organizations such as the Independence Club (독립협회;獨立協會), led by Seo Jae-pil, the People's Joint Association (만민공동회;萬民共同會), and the Shinminhwae (신민회;新民會). He was a strong nationalist especially in his early years; pushing for reform and modernization of the Joseon government.Clark, Donald N.

(1988) Regents of the University of California , pp 89-91, 137, 172 Although Yun's early years were filled with strong support of patriotic and nationalist movements, there seemed to have been a change in Yun's approach to Korean independence in the wake of the Japanese dominance in Korea, starting with Korea becoming a protectorate of Japan in 1905, and then fully annexed into the Japanese Empire in 1910. Because of Yun's apparent change in attitude toward Korean independence and his lack of support of nationalist movements, like the 1919 Samil Movement, many Koreans today see him as a collaborator with the Japanese.Caprio, Mark (2007). \\"Loyal Patriot?

He was also an early leader of the Korean YMCA and a South Korean Methodist. Early life Yun Chi-ho was born on December 26, 1864 in a small village in Dunpo-myeon, Asan, Chungcheong Province. His father, Yun Ung-yeol, was an official in the Joseon government and as a member of the yangban aristocracy saw that Chi-ho received a proper education. Yun Chi-ho excelled in his studies of the Confucian classics at the local seodang and even tried to apply to take the civil-service exams (gwageo) at age twelve. Yun's family was one of Joseon dynasty's most illustrious noble families; his 9G-Great grandfather Yun Doo-su (윤두수;尹斗壽) was Yeonguijeong under King Seonjo. But his father Yun Ung-ryeol was an illegitimate son of his grandfather Yun Chui-dong (윤취동;尹取東). From 1871 to 1878, Yun studied Confucianism at Chang's private village school. Trip to Japan Because of Yun Ung-yeol's position in the government, he was able to arrange for Yun Chi-ho's participation in a delegation of representatives from Korea to observe the process of modernization in Japan in 1881.Schmid, Andre. “Korea Between Empires”. (2002) Columbia University Press pp. 47, 49, 76, 112 Yun was only sixteen years old at the time, but this experience greatly influenced his thoughts on modernization and opened his eyes to world beyond the isolated “Hermit Kingdom” that Korea had become. He frequently compared the lack of progress in Joseon Korea to the rapid modernization of Japan and often lamented in his diaries that he wanted nothing more than for Korea to become the kind of advanced, modern nation that Japan had become.Yun, Chi-ho. \\"Yun Chi-Ho's Diaries\\". Vol I-X. 1975 National History Compilation Committee. Seoul, Korea Studying in China Yun would later travel to Shanghai, China in 1885 where he would attend the Anglo-Chinese College studying English and mathematics, among other things. While in Shanghai he also converted to Christianity, something that would play a major role throughout the rest of his life. Yun Chi-ho viewed Christianity as a strong progressive philosophy that could help Korea catch up with the advancements of Japan and the West. Time in America He eventually even studied in America, starting in 1888 at Vanderbilt University and then Emory University. He strongly admired many aspects of American culture, but was also frustrated with the racial prejudices he experienced while living in the South. In particular, he would identify tensions and contradictions between Christian universalism, and the belief that any individual could earn respect and equality as long as they were pious, and the arbitrary demonstrations of white supremacy that he routinely witnessed and experienced. While in America he studied English, theology and speech and he gained a great deal of proficiency in the English language; writing most of his diaries in English. Yun Chi-ho as a student at Emory University (1892). Government Service=Interpreter Yun served in several important government positions throughout his life. He served as an interpreter for the first American Foreign Minister in Korea, Lucius Foote. Upon arriving in Korea Foote had inquired to the Japanese Foreign Minister Inoue Kaoru about finding someone to interpret for him while in Seoul, and Minister Inoue, who knew Yun Chi-ho from his days in Japan, recommended Yun to help serve Minister Foote. It was also Foote who helped Yun with arranging his studies in Shanghai. Vice President of the Privy Council and banishment Yun also served as the Vice President of the Privy Council of the Joseon Court from 1898 until he was banished in 1899 due to pressure from opposing factions in the government. While banished to the countryside, Yun served as magistrate for a town called Wonsan in Northern Korea. His banishment was not long lived and in 1903 he was called to serve as the Vice Foreign Minister. Korean Independence Movements=The Independence Club When Yun arrived back in Korea from his studies abroad, there were small groups of scholars who were beginning to call for social and political reform in Korea. One such group was the Independence club, which Yun began to participate in. Among other things, the club promoted educating the Korean people on their unique history, promoted the use of Hangeul, the Korean vernacular alphabet, and pushed for government reform. While in the Independence Club Yun called for the government to be more representative of its people and even supported the elevation of King Kojong to the title of Gwangmu Emperor.Neff, Robert D. “Korea through Western Eyes”. (2009) Seoul National University Press. pp 137 Eventually the group was met with pressure from opposing factions in the government that believed the club was gaining too much influence and so in 1899, the club disbanded. The Enlightenment Movement As Japanese influence on the Korean peninsula began to tighten, Yun also began to support groups that were part of the Enlightenment movement. These groups, such as the Korean Self-Strengthening Society and the New People's Society, were picking up the pieces where the independence club had left off, and Yun Chi-ho helped them out by giving speeches and writing pamphlets for them. During his time of Banishment, these groups gave Yun something to work for in the hopes of creating a stronger Korean society.  Japanese Annexation of Korea  From his early years, he was disappointed in the Joseon people for always having an emotional response and frustrated in their irrationality. In January 1910, he participated in the World Missionary Conference in America and that May, he attended to Edinburgh World Missionary Conference in England. In December 1910, he returned to his country. When the Korean Empire was overrun by Japanese military forces in 1910 (see Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910), Yun Chi-ho joined with others in resisting Japanese occupation. He became an anti- Imperialist speaker and independence activist. In 1911, he was Judgment for alleged assassination of the Governor General of Korea. He suffered from malicious punishment and torture as a result of the 105-Man Incident. In 1913, along with 104 others, he was charged with conspiracy against the Japanese Governor-General at the time, Count Terauchi. He was one of six who were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms. His experiences in prison tempered his willingness to express his nationalist ardor, but he was still considered active in the independence movement.Chung, Henry. (1921). The Case of Korea, p. 42. Conspiracy Trial and Imprisonment In 1911 Yun was implicated in assisting with an assassination attempt on Japanese governor- general, Terauchi Masatake. Sources from within some of the Enlightenment Movement groups that Yun had taken part in had informed Japanese officials that he had a hand in planning this attempted assassination. He was put on trial and given the maximum sentence. However, after a series of retrials his sentence was shortened and he eventually gained amnesty after only six years in jail. During this time, he didn't write down anything in his diaries, but his experience in the Japanese prison system seemed to have a significant effect on his actions after his release. In fact, his release can be seen as a turning point for Yun Chi-ho where he began to make many pro-Japanese statements and gives much less support to Korean nationalistic movements. March 1 Movement Inspired by Woodrow Wilson's idea of “self-determination” presented at the Paris Peace Conference the previous year, on March 1, 1919 many Koreans took to the streets in a peaceful protest to demonstrate that Korea was ready for independence from Japan. Yun knew that the European nations would not take this demonstration seriously. Yun said the following about the movement: “He who buys a field and keeps it from falling into irredeemable hands is a wiser patriot than he who sells his lands to finance the independent movement. He who sends a poor boy to school to become more intelligent than his fathers is doing a greater service than he who stirs up students for political agitations. He who leads an erring man into decent religious life is serving the Korean race better than he who sends ignorant folks to jail for yelling ‘mansei.’ Now is the time for Koreans to learn and wait.” Japanese Support Yun’s reversal in opinion took an even larger turn from his previous nationalistic rhetoric when he began supporting the Japanese war efforts during WWII. He urged the young men of Korea to help the Japanese to victory by assisting in the war effort. He celebrated as the Japanese pushed Western imperialist powers out of Asia.Kim, Hyung-chan. “Portrait of a Troubled Korean Patriot: Yun Ch'i-ho's Views of the March First Independence Movement and World War II”. Korean Studies, Volume 13, 1989, pp. 76-91 (Article) Published by University of Hawai'i Press. DOI: 10.1353/ks.1989.0014 According to Yun the Korean people’s part in the Japanese Empire them opportunity and access to education and resources they previously never had. Yun said, “The intellectuals of Korea today all realize that destiny of the Korean people can be promoted by becoming one with the Japanese people and that Manchuria and North China have opened up a field for the development of the Korean people never before dreamed of.”  Asia-Pacific War time  In 1936, outbreak of 'case of Suyang club'. he was all related person personal reference, release. that thim, he was endeavor of Ahn Chang-ho's acquittal, also Ahn Chang-ho's file a petition. but refused of Japanese Government- General of Korea.

Oasis Sports Centre is a leisure centre in Holborn, London, operated by Greenwich Leisure Limited on behalf of the London Borough of Camden. Facilities The centre has two pools, a 27.5 x 10 m heated outdoor pool and a 25 x 9 m indoor pool, poolside sauna, a gym, squash courts and cafeteria.  History =Early history The site has a long history of being an early public swimming pool. The pool was first built c.1728 as the \\"Bagnio\\", a Turkish Bath. In 1840 the Turkish bath closed and the site was eventually reopened by local parishes as the \\"Bloomsbury Baths and Washhouses\\" in 1852. At that time there were two indoor swimming baths. Between 1900 and 1902 the baths were rebuilt and reopened as \\"Holborn Baths\\". This had two covered pools. The site was modernized in the 1930s and after an architectural competition the \\"Swimstad\\" plan was approved. Peter Stechman has the original artist impression of the Swimstadt plan. Building started in 1937 but work halted at the start of the war. After the war, cash shortages lead to the complex not being completed and it was converted to an outdoor swimming pool, opening in June 1946 using wartime gas decontamination rooms as changing facilities. Much of the work to reopen the outdoor pool was carried out by staff using discarded war materials. 1960s and 1970s  In 1960, the outdoor pool size was reduced to 27.5 by 9.5 metres, and a 25 x 9 metre indoor pool was added to the site using all plant materials and pool sizes were made to metric specifications with the Becco sand filters as well as being rubber lined. There is also a child's paddling pool termed 'Kiddies Corner'. The upper sun terrace was designed to give a 'ship's deck' atmosphere. The rebuilding works were funded by a planning benefit arranged by Stanley Thomas, Chair of Holborn BC Leisure with the Hammersons group. It included the 10 storey office block, Berkshire House, as a facade and front entrance from High Holborn plus sun bathing terraces built above the indoor pool and the rear underground car park area. In 1972 the first Local Authority run Sauna Cabins was opened with hand massage on a marble slab. During the IRA campaign, a car bomb was placed outside the front entrance to the office block in High Holborn, with the result that all 10 floor windows, back and front, were blown out. Security staff were injured, but fortunately there were no fatalities. The pool opened the next day, via a back entrance, only 30 minutes later than its normal time. 1980s to present In 1983 the site was reconfigured. The entrance building on Endell Street was demolished and offices, a new public and establishment laundry plus warm baths and shower facilities, were installed on the ground floor. Three floors of sheltered housing for elderly people were built above this, and Dudley Court occupied the ground of the demolished Workhouse at the rear. Skeletons were found in the workhouse earth basements of the former workhouse inmates, which stopped work for a while. In 1989, the installation of a good quality full width Glatz Pioneer heat retention cover enabled Peter Stechman, Sports Centre ManagerCamden New Journal http://www.thecnj.com/camden/2008/011708/news011708_20.html, to run the heated outdoor pool all year round. This practice was later copied by other London pool operators, Hampton and London Fields Lido. On 1 May 1985 a dry sports area consisting of two multi use activity halls and 3 glass backed squash courts were added. At the time, Sports Centre Manager Peter Stechman was one of the best London Pool Managers for his outstanding development work at the Oasis. From 1986 to 1987 the indoor pool was closed for refurbishment, the pool surround was waterproofed, and the Esavian sliding ships doors were removed and replaced with a permanent brick and glass partition, while the outdoor pool stayed open. In the mid 1990s the main sports hall was converted to a multi exercise equipment gym and the sauna was relocated to the previous warm baths and shower area to provide a dance studio. The public laundry that had served the Holborn and Covent Garden area for decades was shut down. In the mid nineties Peter Stechman went on to become Camden's Parks Manager with responsibility for the boroughs 70 Parks and Open Spaces. His security team were the first on the scene at the Tavistock Square bombing in 2005. Following complaints from users about the deterioration of the building fabric, the Oasis was refurbished again at the end of the 2000s.Camden New Journal http://www.thecnj.com/camden/2009/050709/news050709_10.html ReferencesExternal links * Oasis Sports Centre *Greenwich Leisure *Lidos in the UK Category:1852 establishments in England Category:Swimming venues in London Category:Lidos ","title":"Oasis Sports Centre, London"},{"id":"24480976","text":"The New Zealand cricket team and the Pakistan cricket team played a three- match ODI series and two Twenty20 Internationals from 3 November 2009 to 13 November 2009 in the UAE.

In his August 22 comeback he finished third to winner Irish Warrior in the Harry F. Brubaker Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack. Johar then ran second to Storming Home in the September 28 Clement L. Hirsch Memorial Turf Championship before winning the most important race of his career, the October 25 Breeders' Cup Turf, held that year at Santa Anita Park. Johar, last until the field moved through the backstretch, made a powerful late run down the middle of the homestretch to finish first in a dead-heat with High Chaparral and barely a nose ahead of third-place finisher Falbrav. As co-winner of the first dead-heat in Breeders' Cup history, Johar defeated other top runners such as The Tin Man (4th), and the betting favorite, Storming Home (7th). Johar was retired to stud for the 2005 season. As of September 25, 2009, he had sired twenty-three race winners.

His most notable game with Oxford was played on 21 February 1889 against the New Zealand Native football team, Oxford winning 6–0.Maoris v. Oxford paperspast.natlib.govt.nz He first faced Cambridge University in the 1899 Varsity Match. Clauss gained three sporting 'Blues' in total playing in the 1889, 1890 and 1891 matches. In the 1891 match, Clauss was Oxford captain, but adopted the wrong tactics to give Cambridge the game.Marshall (1951), pg 78. Despite excellent work form the Clauss and the rest of the Oxford three- quarters,Marshall (1951), pg 79. the forwards had exhausted themselves through too much tight scrimmaging in the first half of the match, and the Cambridge team won by two tries to nil. In 1890, Clauss was approached by William Percy Carpmael, an ex-Cambridge player, to join his newly formed touring side the Barbarians. Clauss accepted, and became one of the original members of the team. International career While still at Oxford, Clauss was selected to represent the Scotland national team, and made his first appearance in the opening game, against Wales, in the 1891 Home Nations Championship. It was an impressive start for Clauss' international career, scoring two tries in a massive 15–0 win over the Welsh. Clauss kept his place for the remaining two games of the tournament, and continued his scoring streak with another try in the second game of the campaign, this time against Ireland. In the final game of the Championship, Clauss scored a dropped goal eight minutes from the start,Griffiths (1987), 2:8. and Scotland never gave away the lead for the rest of the match. With the victory over England, Clauss became a Triple Crown winning player in his first international season. Between the 1891 and 1892 seasons, Clauss was invited to join the British Isles team on their tour of South Africa. This was the first official overseas tour for the British Isles team, and took in three Test Matches against the South Africa national team. Clauss played in the first five matches of the tour, scoring tries in the first four games.Paul Clauss Lions profile lionsrugby.com Although Clauss was not in the team for the games against Port Elizabeth and Eastern Province he was brought in at his preferred three-quarters position along with tour captain Bill Maclagan and Randolph Aston.

Clauss finished his tour with the wins against South Africa in the Second and Third Tests, and scored a try in the encounter with Cape Colony between the final Tests. Clauss made a journal of the South Africa tour, making notes on the style of play, grounds and his general thoughts on the direction of South African rugby.The Lions and South Africa: Part 2 irb.com He enjoyed the tour and summed it all up as \\"champagne and travel\\". On his return to Britain Clauss retained his place in the Scotland team for the 1892 Championship, and made two appearances. Clauss was on the winning side, in the encounter with Wales, but then missed the following game when he was replaced by J.C. Woodburn. With a win over the Irish secured, Clauss regained his position for the Championship decider against England. Both teams had defeated both Wales and Ireland, and the pressure of losing the title made for a poor game. Protracted mauling and fighting between the forwards slowed the fluency of the game, and England won by a single converted try. Clauss had a chance to level the game, but narrowly missed with an attempted dropped goal. Clauss played one final international game, when he was recalled three years later for the second game of the 1895 Championship. Clauss was brought in at the unfamiliar position of half back, after the retirement of William Wotherspoon left a gap that the Scottish selectors had difficulty filling. Although Scotland won the game 6–0, Clauss lost his place to the more experienced half back William Donaldson.

Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. Downey, Julia: 1999 Kit Aircraft Directory, Kitplanes, Volume 15, Number 12, December 1998, page 38. Primedia Publications. ISSN 0891-1851 Avid Aircraft went out of business in November 2003 and the aircraft kits are no longer available. Development The Champion was created by scaling down the Avid Mark IV and narrowing the wider fuselage into a single seat design intended to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category. The design is a conventional tractor configuration, featuring tube and aircraft fabric construction. The main landing gear is bungee suspended and includes a steerable tailwheel. Like other Avid designs, the wing has an under-cambered airfoil, Junkers style ailerons and scalloped trailing edges. The wing can be folded for storage and the aircraft can be towed on its wheels behind a car. The wing folding mechanism does not include automatic connecting ailerons. The cockpit will accommodate a pilot up to in height and in weight. Two door options were originally available, a Piper J-3 Cub-style horizontally split door or an overhead-hinged door. The Champion only meets the US FAR 103 ultralight vehicle category maximum empty weight limit of , with the lightest of single cylinder, two-stroke engines installed, such as the Rotax 277 and the removal of the cowling, brakes, doors and most of the instruments. When the kit was available, the company did not provide an engine for it, leaving the choice of engines and compliance with FAR 103 restrictions up to the owner. The standard empty weight with the Rotax 447 powerplant was . The aircraft qualifies as an amateur-built in many countries including the US and Canada. Building time to complete the kit was reported by the company to be 160 hours. When the aircraft was introduced in 1998 the kit cost was US$8995, without an engine. Complete airframes, also without an engine, were available for US$12,995. Operational history Andre Cliche's flight review of the Champion describes it as \\"light and responsive\\" and \\"agile\\", but cautions that the Junkers full-span ailerons produce high roll rates and high adverse yaw. He also indicated that \\"the overall responsiveness and taildragger reactions might tax beginners' capabilities.\\" Jim Bethea of UltraFlight magazine said: \\"The Champion is arguably the best fixed-wing ultralight available and perhaps the most overlooked.\\" With the Rotax 447 engine, the aircraft can take-off in under , as one owner explained: \\"You'd better be ready when you advance the throttle because the plane will jump off the ground within the next three seconds!\\" Landings in crosswinds have been described as \\"easy with a forward slip and touchdown on one main wheel\\". A full rudder slip will produce a descent rate of 2000 feet per minute (10 m/s). Because the choice of engine installed was left up to the builder, a variety of engines has been used, including the Rotax 277, 447 and the Rotax 503.

Doctor X was a member of Pandilla Guerreras and the co-leader of Los Guerreros Tuareg. In August 2011, Valencia quit CMLL and joined Perros del Mal Producciones under the new ring name Doctor X-Treme. Valencia also previously worked as \\"Dr. O'Borman Jr.\\" a name he licensed from the original Dr. O'Borman. Throughout his career, Doctor X's real name was not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. He was killed on 11 October 2011 when trying to break up a fight. Professional wrestling career=Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Valencia began his wrestling career in 1995 after training under Rafael Salamanca, La Cobra and Scorpio (Sr.), he would later receive additional training from Memo Díaz and El Satánico. Initially he worked as Dr. O'Borman Jr., paying the original Dr. O'Borman for the use of the name. By the end of the 1999s he began working regularly for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). By 2000 problems with who had the right to the name \\"Dr. O'Borman Jr.\\" arose, forcing him to give up the name. Together with CMLL owner Paco Alonso they came up with the concept of \\"Doctor X\\", a \\"evil doctor\\" in the vein of Dr. Wagner Jr., wearing all white with a big \\"X\\" on his mask. Later on the masks and outfits would become increasingly colorful. Doctor X's first real chance to prove himself came in 2001 where he participated in that year's Gran Alternativa tournament. He teamed with Gran Markus Jr., but lost to eventual tournament winners Olímpico and Sicodelico Jr. in the first round. Over the next couple of years Doctor X kept working low card matches, slowly establishing a name for himself. In early 2003 Doctor X began a storyline feud with Tigre Blanco, the reigning Mexican National Welterweight Champion at the time. On 11 March 2003, Doctor X defeated Tigre Blanco to win the championship, a title he would hold for over two years. In 2004 he once again competed in the Gran Alternativa, teaming with Último Guerrero. The team defeated Último Dragón and Neutron in the first round and Shocker and Alan Stone in the second round before losing to El Hijo del Santo and Místico in the finals. =Pandilla Guerrera= In early 2005 the wrestling group Los Guerreros del Infierno created an affiliated group of low to mid-carders called Pandilla Guerrera (Spanish for \\"Gang of Warriors\\") that included Doctor X, Nitro, Sangre Azteca, Hooligan and several others. On 25 March 2005 Doctor X teamed up with fellow Pandilla Guerrera members Sangre Azteca and Nitro to defeat El Felino, Safari and Volador Jr. to win the Mexican National Trios Championship. For two months Doctor X was a double champion until he lost the Mexican National Welterweight Championship to La Máscara on 13 May 2005. Guerrero Pandilla's Trios title reign lasted 196 days before they lost to Máximo, El Sagrado and El Texano Jr. After making it to the finals of the 2005 Gran Alternativa he teamed with Universo 2000 for the 2005 Gran Alternativa. In the first round the team defeated Bronco and El Texano Jr. before losing to eventual winners Dr. Wagner. Jr. and Misterioso Jr. in the semi-final. =Guerreros Tuareg= In 2007 most members of Pandilla Guerrera broke away from Los Guerreros del Infierno, wanting to break out of their shadow and move up the rankings themselves. Doctor X, Arkangel de la Muerte, Nitro, Skándalo, Hooligan and Loco Max formed a group originally known as Rebeldes del Desierto (Rebels of the desert) but later on would become generally known as Los Guerreros Tuareg (Tuareg Warriors), or Rebeldes Tuareg. Despite objections from Los Guerreros del Infierno that the name was too close to theirs, Guerreros Tuareg is the name that has stuck for the group. Doctor X became the interim co-leader of Guerreros Tuareg along with Arkangel when Nitro suffered a serious injury in early 2009. Since forming Guerreros Tuareg Doctor X has not worked regularly in Arena Mexico, CMLL's main arena, something which he himself has expressed his unhappiness with. He has publicly stated that he feels passed over for wrestlers with \\"1/10\\" his talent. On 18 October 2009 Doctor X was one of 12 wrestlers who put his mask on the line in a 12-man Luchas de Apuestas cage match. He was the fifth person to escape the cage keeping his mask safe, the final saw Pólvora pin Tigre Blanco to unmask him. In April 2010, Doctor X began a feud with Fabián el Gitano, a feud that saw both wrestlers intentionally disqualified several times as they tore each other's masks off. During the 12-man steel cage match in the main event of the 2010 Infierno en el Ring Doctor X primarily targeted his rival Fabián el Gitano, but when it came down to it in the end he decided to leave the cage instead of trying to unmask Fabián. In the end Ángel de Oro defeated Fabián el Gitano in the Lucha de Apuesta (bet match) portion of the match instead, unmasking him. Dr.X took then part to a 12-man cage match on Christmas day of 2010 in Arena Neza including both CMLL and independent luchadores, winning the mask of Hermano Muerte III. On 4 August 2011, it was reported that Doctor X had quit CMLL. Perros del Mal Producciones On 6 August 2011, Doctor X announced that he would joining independent promotion Perros del Mal Producciones under the new ring name Doctor X-Treme. He wrestled his first match for the promotion later that same day. Death On October 11, 2011, Valencia was shot in the head and killed when he tried to break up a fight while attending a religious party in Santa María Aztahuacán, Iztapalapa, Mexico City. He was survived by a wife and two children under the age of ten.

He was educated at Charterhouse and at Christ's College, Cambridge where he graduated B.A. in 1776; though he did not have an honours degree, he was made Fellow in the same year, in the vacancy caused by the departure of William Paley.

Biography Born in Fontainebleau, Seine-et-Marne, Fontenoy worked as a journalist for the Havas news agency from 1924 to the mid-1930s in Russia then China.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 130 Whilst in China he founded the French language Journal de ShanghaiIssues of Le Journal de Shangaï in Gallica, the digital library of the BnF. and became the subject of a gossip campaign suggesting that he was having an affair with Soong Mei-ling, Chiang Kai-shek's wife. Returning to France he sought involvement in politics, initially with the French Communist Party before switching to the Parti Populaire Français, a group he left in 1939 due to his personal dislike of leader Jacques Doriot. Before long however Fontenoy put his personal issues to one side and rejoined the PPF and played a leading role in helping to reorganise the movement, whilst also writing widely, not only for the PPF journals but also for the likes of L'Insurgé and Je suis partout. Despite his skill as an organiser and writer Fontenoy began to develop a reputation for eccentricity, aided by his personal habits. Already an alcoholic, Fontenoy was widowed in 1941 and following the death of his wife he began to abuse opium and morphine. He was also seriously injured after volunteering for service in the Winter War and the head wounds that he sustained led to brain damage. Following these instances Fontenoy continued to be a leading figure on the far right but his actions came to be somewhat more erratic. In 1938 he married Madeleine Charnaux. For a time he served Pierre Laval as his personal envoy to Otto Abetz. This was followed by the launch of the journal La Vie Nationale which proved short-lived and which was followed by a number of equally short-lived collaborationist reviews. He was a founder of Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire and became leader of the group in 1942 after Eugène Deloncle stepped aside. However Fonteony soon lost interest in what was a declining group.David Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, London: Heinemann, 1972, p. 215 He then switched over to the National Popular Rally and formed part of the five man directorate, chaired by Marcel Déat, that led the group.Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, p. 213 During this period Fontenoy became fixated with the notion that Doriot was plotting to kill him, despite a lack of evidence. This played a role in his next move when he enrolled in the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism (LVF) and was sent to the Eastern Front. He served as LVF propaganda chief was also acting as a spy.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 131 He was killed fighting in Berlin a few days before the end of the war after being wounded in the head, this time fatally.Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, p. 355 Bibliography * Gérard GUEGAN, Fontenoy ne reviendra plus, Stock, Parijs, 2011 * Philippe VILGIER, Jean Fontenoy, aventurier, journaliste et écrivain, Uitg.

Morris was a key organiser in the Black Women's Movement in the United Kingdom, co-founding the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent in London and support groups in Manchester. She joined the British Black Panthers and squatted 121 Railton Road in Brixton. Morris died at the age of 27. Her life and work have been widely commemorated, both by official organisations – Lambeth Council named a building after her – and by activist groups. She features on lists of inspirational Black British women and in June 2020 was brought to wider attention with a Google Doodle. Early life Olive Morris was born in 1952 in Harewood, St Catherine, Jamaica, to Doris Lowena (née Moseley) and Vincent Nathaniel Morris. As part of the Windrush generation, the family emigrated to England when she was nine. She had three brothers and two sisters, and lived in South London for most of her life, attending Heathbrook Primary School, Lavender Hill Girls' Secondary School, and Tulse Hill Secondary School. Leaving school without qualifications, she later studied at the London College of Printing (now named the London College of Communication). Adult life and activism=Mistreatment following Clement Gomwalk incident On 15 November 1969, Nigerian diplomat Clement Gomwalk was confronted by police while parked outside \\"Desmond's Hip City\\",Ford, Tanisha C.

The police did not believe him when he said he was a diplomat. Accused of stealing his car under the \\"sus law\\" (suspected person), the police dragged him out of his Mercedes car to interrogate him and continued to beat him as a crowd formed around them to witness the brutality. Local journalist Aymo Martin Tajo later stated that Morris \\"broke through the crowd to the scuffle\\" and \\"tried to physically stop the police from beating the Nigerian\\", the police reaction being to beat her also. However, Morris's account was that she did not arrive until after the diplomat had been taken away by the police. She was then 17 years old. The situation with the police escalated after the crowd began to confront them about their brutal treatment of Gomwalk. Morris recalled her friend being dragged by police into the record store, shouting \\"I've done nothing\\". She did not state how she got involved but does state that she was brutally beaten. As she was dressed in men’s clothes, and had very short hair, the police at that point believed she was a young man, one of them saying when challenged, \\"She ain’t no girl\\".\\"Olive Morris and Sexualized Police Brutality\\" in R. Kelley, S. Tuck, eds., The Other Special Relationship: Race, Rights, and Riots in Britain and the United States (Springer, 2016), pp. 215–218 Morris’s account goes on to describe her treatment in prison. She said she was forced to strip and was threatened with rape in police custody: \\"They all made me take off my jumper and my bra in front of them to show I was a girl. A male cop holding a billy club said, ‘Now prove you're a real woman.’\\" Referencing his billy club (or baton) he stated: \\"Look it's the right colour and the right size for you. Black cunt!\\" Morris's brother Basil described her injuries from the incident, saying that he \\"could hardly recognize her face, they beat her so badly.\\" She was arrested, fined £10 and given a suspended sentence. The charges were: assault on the police, threatening behaviour, and possession of dangerous weapons. Black Panther Movement In the early 1970s, Morris became a member of the youth section of the British Black Panther Movement (later the Black Workers movement), alongside Linton Kwesi Johnson and Clovis Reid. This movement was inspired by the Black Panther Movement in the United States, but was unaffiliated with them. In August 1972 she and a friend, Liz Obi, planned to visit the American Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver, who was living in Algeria on the run from an attempted murder charge, but they became stranded in Morocco. Brixton Black Women's Group Morris co- founded the Brixton Black Women's Group in 1974. Within this group, she and other members rallied to critically explore the experience of women in the Black Panther Party. The overall purpose of the group was to raise consciousness so the women could communicate with each other and talk about their daily lives, putting this understanding into a political framework. The Brixton Black Women's Group pushed for more transparency and unity in their community. Eventually, the group dissolved and transformed into numerous specific groups that were focused on increasing the awareness of the Black struggle. Squatting in Brixton Morris participated in other activities, such as squatting buildings to establish self-help community spaces. She squatted at 121 Railton Road, Brixton, with her friend Liz Obi in 1973. This squat became a hub of political activism and hosted community groups such as Black People against State Harassment. The building was also the site of the Sabarr Bookshop, one of the first Black community bookshops. It was set up by a group of Black men and women in Brixton that included Morris.Beverley Bryan, Stella Dadzie, Suzanne Scafe, The Heart of the Race: Black Women's Lives in Britain, Verso Books, 14 August 2018. The site subsequently became an anarchist project, known as the 121 Centre, which existed until its eviction in 1999. During the 1970s she worked alongside Leila Hassan running Race Today's \\"Basement Sessions\\" at 165 Railton Road, where art, culture and politics were discussed. Manchester Morris studied at Manchester University between 1975 and 1978. Her activism did not halt while she was away from London. She co-founded the Manchester Black Women's Co-operative and the Black Women's Mutual Aid Group with activists in Manchester such as Kath Locke and Elouise Edwards. She also helped to establish a supplementary school after campaigning with local Black parents for better education provision for their children.\\"Black Cultural Archives\\" , Olive Morris Administrative / Biographical History, 1977–2009. Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent She was a founding member of the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD) in London. OWAAD held its first conference at the Abeng Centre on Gresham Road in Brixton, a centre that Morris had helped to establish along with Elaine Holness and other members of the community. Along with the Brixton Black Women's Group it was the first organisation for black women in the United Kingdom. Death Morris became ill during a trip to Spain in 1978. When she returned to London, she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She underwent treatment, which was unsuccessful. She died on 12 July 1979 at St Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth, and was buried in Streatham Vale Cemetery. She was 27 years old. Recognition and legacy Olive Morris House in Brixton Hill Lambeth Council named one of its key buildings after her in 1986. The naming of the building followed the Brixton riot the previous year, triggered by the shooting of Cherry Groce by the police while searching for her son, Michael Groce, in connection with a firearms offence.\\"28 September On this day: 1985 Riots in Brixton after police shooting\\", BBC, 28 September 2005. Some saw it as an attempt by the council to appease the Black community or, in a more positive spin, to show the council's future commitment to reconciliation. A play area and garden was also named after Morris in Myatt's Fields. Morris is depicted on the B£1 note of the Brixton Pound, a local currency. Ana Laura López de la Torre launched the \\"Remember Olive Morris\\" blog in 2007. As López de la Torre started to team up with other women, the following year the Remembering Olive Collective was started, which soon included African-American scholar Tanisha C. Ford. In 2019 this was re- launched as ROC 2.0, as the council building had been scheduled for demolition, and the collective wanted to ensure that Morris would be remembered even when the building named after her is gone. The Olive Morris memorial award was launched in 2011 to give bursaries to young Black women. In 2017, a huge mural entitled \\"Say it loud\\" (a reference to the song of that title) appeared in Blenheim Gardens, Brixton, part of the \\"WatchThisSpace\\" initiative; it was painted by the South African artist Breeze Yoko and draws on his character \\"Boniswa\\", while also paying homage to Morris. In 2018, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of most women gaining the right to vote, The Voice newspaper listed Olive Morris – alongside Kathleen Wrasama, Connie Mark, Fanny Eaton, Diane Abbott, Lilian Bader, Margaret Busby, and Mary Seacole – among eight Black women who have contributed to the development of Britain.Sinclair, Leah (6 February 2018), \\"Suffrage 100: The Black Women Who Changed British History\\", The Voice. . She was also named by the Evening Standard on a list of 14 \\"Inspirational Black British women throughout history\\" alongside Mary Seacole, Connie Mark, Margaret Busby, Diane Abbott, Claudia Jones, Adelaide Hall, Joan Armatrading, Tessa Sanderson, Doreen Lawrence, Maggie Aderin-Pocock, Sharon White, Malorie Blackman, and Zadie Smith.Chambers, Georgia (11 October 2018), \\"Inspirational black British women throughout history\\" , Evening Standard. Morris was recognised with a Google Doodle in the UK on 26 June 2020 to mark what would have been her 68th birthday.

In colonial times Quaker Hill separated \\"the English [settlers] of New England and the Hudson Valley Dutch population.\\"(Smith, p. 318) It is the location of the Oblong Friends Meetinghouse, built in 1764. According to historian Richard Norton Smith, \\"the first antislavery protest meeting in North America convened\\" in 1767 in the Oblong Friends Meetinghouse. One addition to the Oblong Friends Meetinghouse, the Akin Free Library, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1926 the prominent radio broadcaster and reporter Lowell Thomas, who had made Lawrence of Arabia famous, purchased a 350-acre farm on Quaker Hill, which he later enlarged to 2,000 acres and named \\"Clover Brook Farm.\\"(Smith, pp. 318-319) Thomas developed Quaker Hill into a well-known haven for numerous successful business, news media, political, and legal figures.(Smith, pp. 319-320) To keep the rural flavor of the area, Thomas forbid the building of shopping centers, large businesses or factories, or extensive housing developments on Quaker Hill while he lived there. Instead, lots and existing farms were sold to families that met with his approval. About a hundred families settled there, usually under the guidance of Thomas and his real-estate agents.(Smith, p. 320) Among the prominent figures who lived on Quaker Hill at one time or another from the 1930s to the 1970s were New York Governor and two-time Republican presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey, the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, famed CBS News journalist Edward R. Murrow, and Casey Hogate, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal.(Smith, p. 320) In 1953 Thomas moved to a larger estate he built on Quaker Hill called Hammersley Hill.(Smith, p. 320) Thomas also transformed Quaker Hill while he was in residence there. He talked professional golfer Gene Sarazen and golf course architect Robert Trent Jones into building a country club and golf course on the northern part of the hill, and he built ski slopes and ski tows on the hill. Thomas held regular Saturday evening parties and dances for the residents of Quaker Hill at a community center he built called the Barn. In its fireplace he \\"installed stones from the Great Pyramid of Cheops, the Parthenon, St. Peter's Cathedral, China's Great Wall, and Mount Vernon.\\"(Smith, p. 319) He transformed a stone library on the hill, called Akin Hall, into a \\"nondenominational place of worship in Christopher Wren style.\\"(Smith, pp. 319-320) An avid horseman, he also established more than 200 miles of bridle paths that stretched across Quaker Hill.(Smith, p. 329) The community has been studied extensively.

Possessing a wide vocal range with a significant amount of coloratura facility, she tackled roles from both the mezzo-soprano and soprano repertoires. She is best remembered today for portraying the role of Giovanna Seymour (Jane Seymour) in the world premiere of Gaetano Donizetti's Anna Bolena in 1830. Biography Born in Macerata, Orlandi's family moved to Padua soon after her birth. She studied singing in that city with Nardelli and made her professional debut there in 1829 at the age of 18. Later that year she made successful appearances in Milan and Rome. On 24 November 1829 she portrayed Isaura to the Amenaide of Giuditta Pasta in Gioachino Rossini's Tancredi at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna in the presence of the composer.\\"Orlandi, Elisa\\", based on Großes Sängerlexikon, at Operissimo (in German) Orlandi made her debut at the Teatro Regio di Parma on 6 February 1830 as Fiorilla in Rossini's Il turco in Italia. While in Parma she also sang in several concerts at the court of Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma. She made several appearances at the Teatro della Canobbiana in Milan later that year, including the house's first stagings of Giacomo Meyerbeer's Il crociato in Egitto (Palmide), Rossini's Le comte Ory (Alice), Rossini's Aureliano in Palmira (Zenobia), and Donizetti's Olivo e Pasquale (Isabella). She sang the role of Giovanna Seymour in the world premiere of Donizetti's Anna Bolena at the Teatro Carcano in Milan on 26 December 1830.

In the fall of 1832 she was cast as Adina in the Teatro Carignano Turin's first staging of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore. On 2 January 1833 she portrayed Eleonora in the world premiere of Donizetti's Il furioso all'isola di San Domingo at the Teatro Valle in Rome and returned to the Teatro della Canobbiana for several more appearances later that year, including Joseph Weigl's L'imboscata, the premiere of Cesare Pugni's Il contrabbandiere, and the house's first stagings of Giovanni Pacini's Il falegname di Livonia (as Catterina) and Pietro de Moyana's Emma di Fondi (as Emma). She also sang the roles of Adina, Alice, and Carlotta in Saverio Mercadante's Elisa e Claudio at the Teatro della Canobbiana that year. In 1834 Orlandi suddenly collapsed and died backstage at the opera house in Rovigo just prior to going on stage as Adalgisa in Bellini's Norma. Everything had seemed to point to a brilliant opera career for the young singer who was just 23 years old at the time of her death.

The adjacent park has a large car park and buses run close by from Leeds, Skipton and Otley. Etymology The place-name Breary is first attested in the twelfth century, in the forms Brerehag, Brerehagh, and Brerehage. The early forms come from the Old English words brēr ('briar') and haga ('enclosure, hedge'). However, later forms, including the modern name, show replacement of the second element with a related word of similar meaning: Old English hæg ('fence, enclosure'). In both variants, the name meant 'enclosure characterised by briars'. For a time the western part of the settlement so named was called West Breary, first attested in 1549 as 'West Brerry'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), p. 28.

Lactose permease can be classified as a symporter, which uses the proton gradient towards the cell to transport β-galactosides such as lactose in the same direction into the cell. The protein has twelve transmembrane alpha-helices and its molecular weight is 45,000 Daltons. It exhibits an internal two-fold symmetry, relating the N-terminal six helices onto the C-terminal helices. It is encoded by the lacY gene in the lac operon.

On binding, a large conformational change takes place which makes the sugar binding site accessible from the cytoplasm. Mechanism: hydronium ions from the outside of the cell binds to a carboxyl group on the enzyme that allows it to undergo a conformational change. This form of lactose permease can bind lactose from outside the cell. The enzyme then everts and lactose is transported inward. The X-ray crystal structure was first solved in 2003 by J.

Several of the tracks are inspired by black metal, and showcases Phil Elverum's \\"relatively newfound affinity for Xasthur and other lynchpins of the unholy genre.\\"  Background and Composition  While making the album Elverum wished to move away from his usual style; creating an album about violent changes. He intended for it to be the loudest record he had made at the time but also to feature significant emotion. Elverum cites black metal as an influence for the album. At certain points on the record Elverum attempts to replicate Xasthur's Subliminal Genocide. A hill he used to live on and 1990s American drama television series Twin Peaks were also influential. Despite music publications such as Pitchfork labelling the album \\"black metal\\", Elverum has denounced the genre tag, clarifying that \\"It’s definitely not a black metal album and the whole idea of doing kind of a kitschy genre album is so embarrassing and shallow.\\" Recording took place from between February 14th 2008 and March 27th 2009 at Nowhere, Anacortes, Washington with Nick Krgovich. Elverum recorded the album via adding various layers to the compositions. Elverum didn't play the drums on a drum set instead recording each drum individually on their own track. Elverum did so to allow for drum rolls on each drum,simultaneously. The vocals were intentionally mixed low to encourage listeners to turn the volume up—causing the album to \\"[wrap] around the listener...like a dream.\\" The album was mixed in stereo. Field recordings of wind are featured on the album. Elverum used distorted cymbals to emulate the sound of wind.  Music  The theme of nature is featured throughout the album. Elverum described the central theme of the album as wind. Specfically its \\"destruction-and-rebirth cycle\\", \\"wind as an example of the personality that exists in dark nature\\" and occurrence of wind sounding like whispering. Elverum explained the central idea of Wind's Poem: Elverum incorporates many different perspectives on the album. These include the \\"voice of...wind\\", himself and a combination of them. Wind is represented on the album as “River” The symbol/character of a stone is present in the album as well. The stone serves as an inverse to the wind. The stone is intended to represent \\"all tangible things. My face, this building, that mountain, that flower.\\" Certain phrases are repeated throughout the album. The lyrics deal with \\"fundamental dualities.\\" At times the lyrics are almost unintelligible due to the sound overwhelming them. Musically the album is reminiscent of his 2008 EP Black Wooden Ceiling Opening and dynamic in nature with Elverum describing it as \\"Quiet/loud/quiet/loud.\\" He also noted how he \\"recorded two songs on the album that were loud the whole way through, but the other 10 songs are like synthetic goth-pop\\". The first song on the album, \\"Wind's Dark Poem\\", features a black metal style opening. The opening consists of blast beats, layered snyths and distorted guitars. Elverum wished for the album to \\"start at 100 percent volume. All noise at once, and then back off into song a little.\\" He described the lyrics as \\"a collection of images and ideas\\", \\"that came out of me at the very beginning of the writing of this album that were kind of the seeds that the rest of the songs came from.\\" He sings in a speaking singing manner, akin to reading a poem. Elverum described the song as a \\"table of contents...a bunch of noise and ideas that are a preview for what’s to come. Track 0, before track 1.\\" \\"The epic lullaby\\", \\"Through The Trees\\" was an attempt with fellow musician Nick Krgovich to recreate \\"David Lynch sound- track synth music\\", specifically “Polish Poem” from Inland Empire. The hill metioned in the song is a reference to a hill Elverum lived on and the experience of \\"watching the lives of people below and feeling different\\" living there gave him. The lyrics are more political than the other songs, with Elverum referencing the \\"land of dream\\", a metaphor for America. Krgovich sings alongside elverum however his voice is \\"high and distant\\"—intended to represent the wind. It was the first song to be recorded on February 14, 2008. It features multi-tracked vocals and bass drum. In an interview with Believer Magazine, Elverum commented on how due to the song's length it would be more fitting for final then the second track. His decision to place the song there was to demostrate the album's challenging and unorthodox nature. Krgovich also collaborated on the songs \\"Between Two Mysteries,\\" \\"Ancient Questions,\\" and \\"Stone’s Ode\\". Elverum described their creative process as free-form, stating that Mount Erie as seen from the water \\"My Heart Is Not at Peace\\" features \\"malleted\\" cymbals. \\"The Hidden Stone\\" and \\"The Mouth of Sky\\" are reminiscent of the guitar riff heavy songs \\"I Want to Be Cold\\" and \\"Samurai Sword\\" from his 2001 album The Glow Pt. 2. \\"Summons\\" is more relaxed than the black metal infused songs on the album. \\"My Heart Is Not at Peace\\" and \\"Summons\\" continue the wind motifi, posing it as both \\"destroyer\\" and \\"revealer\\". This is a direct reference to Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem \\"Ode to the West Wind\\" “Destroyer and preserver; hear, O hear!\\"). \\"Wind Speaks\\" as explained by Elverum is about \\"standing on Commercial Avenue, and clouds are rolling off a hill on Mount Erie, and it’s windy.\\" The lyrics concern the idea of being an embodiment of nature. \\"Between Two Mysteries\\" samples \\"Laura Palmer's Theme\\" by Angelo Badalamenti and directly references the show by name. It features palm muted electric guitars, percussion, an ascending vocal melody and synthesized strings playing the aformentioned sample. \\"Ancient Questions\\" incorparates nihlistic lyrics, guitar picking, keyboard accompaniment and guitar sounds similar to those used on The Flaming Lips song \\"Thirty-Five Thousand Feet of Despair\\". The album's climax \\"Lost Wisdom pt. 2\\"'s opening is simliar to that which opened the album. A section of lyrics from the track \\"Stone's Ode\\" was taken from the Burzum song \\"Dunkelheit\\". The song focuses on the \\"world of dreams,\\" idea introduced earlier on the album. Elverum explained that the world of dreams is a reference to the buddhist idea of existence as an illusion. The song is composed of two different movements which deal with the day and night respectively. It reuses the ascending vocal melody from \\"Between Two Mysteries\\".  Tour  Le Poisson Rouge After the release of the album, Elverum embarked on an Autumn tour with Krgovich, Tara Jane O'Neil and Julia Jacklin from NO KIDS in support of the album. Elverum and O'Neil played the guitar and were accompanied by two drummers and two keyboard players. The tour received a positive reception. Ben Ratliff in his review of the show played at the Le Poisson Rouge in Greenwich Village, New York described the show as \\"a recollected chronicle of awe, sung in a high, light voice, a little like Will Oldham’s, but clearer and straighter, without its coils and burrs.\\" Crawford Philleo of The Know reviewing the show played at Rhinoceropolis, Denver wrote that \\"Elverum and company terrorized the venue with sonic blasts of distortion so heavy the walls shook\\" concluding with \\"The set was nothing less than an amazing\\".  Critical Reception  Upon release, the album received critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album has received an average score of 85, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\", based on 12 reviews.  Legacy  Ian Gromley of Exclaim! chose the album as one of Elverum's essential albums. Track listingReferences Category:2009 albums Category:Mount Eerie albums Category:P. W.

In their stead, guitarist Brent \\"The Doctor\\" Doerner returned to Helix after a 4-year absence, and Greg Fraser (ex-Brighton Rock) joined on guitar as well. History When writing for the album commenced, Brian Vollmer was also working on a solo album. His plan was that Paul Hackman would write songs for the next Helix record while his songs would be used towards his solo album. Paul's death derailed those plans, and he had no material finished for the Helix album. By this time, Vollmer had almost finished recording his solo album, and decided to release the recordings as the next Helix album. As such, no Helix members actually appeared on the album. Brian Vollmer would later call the album, \\"a huge mistake on my part, and I take full credit for the blunder. The really sad thing about it all was that I was really proud of all those songs on the album and they were wasted because they did not fit under the Helix name.\\"Helix History - 1993 Brent Doerner left Helix during the tour for It's A Business Doing Pleasure, and Greg Fraser shortly after him. After their departures, Helix used three different guitarists live: Mark Chichkan, Gary Borden and Rick Mead.

It was built in the 12th century at the site of what was a pagan shrine. A stone carved from red tufa is situated at the right of the entrance upon a low rock wall. It has on it the design of a bird perched on a floral stem with the rosette of eternity under its tail. The rosette is also a distinctive pagan symbol representing the sun or the moon, symbolizing the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth. It is said that because of this pagan symbology, this stone has a connection to the prior shrine. The church has a small cruciform type central- plan with a single drum and dome. It is constructed from dark grey stone, with red tufa inlaid around the windows, roof, and dome. Elaborate decorations of geometric and foliage patterns may be seen all around the windows, portal, dome, and other parts of the façade. The apron around the apse in the interior of the church also is intricately carved. A number of khachkars are scattered around the church grounds, including one in particular adjacent to the building that is reminiscent of a small shrine. In the village is also the fortress complex of Garni with the 1st century AD Garni Temple, Surb Astvatsatsin Church, a ruined 4th century single-aisle church, a ruined Tukh Manuk Shrine, Saint Sargis Shrine, and a Queen Katranide Shrine.

History Depiction of the plain facade of the Monastery of Santa Lucia in Selci (circa 1743), by Giuseppe Vasi, uses artistic license to widen the narrow street in front. Detail of same view expressed by Vasi, with entrance to monastery and church at lower right corner. The church was built no later than the 8th century above the ruins of a Roman structure, the Portico of Livia. According to the tradition, the first church was built under Pope Symmachus (498-514) back in the 6th century. The building was restored by Pope Honorius I in the 7th century and again by Pope Leo III in the 9th century. The deaconry of Saint Lucy in Silice (or in Orpha) created around 300 is one of the seven original deaconries in Rome.The College of Cardinals - General Documentation -Holy See It was confirmed by Pope Saint Sylvester I ca. 314. The church was restored by Pope Honorius I ca 630 in the vicinity of the monumental fountain lacus orphei. It was assigned to one of the seven deacons by Pope Agatho ca. 678. According to Liber Pontificalis, this deaconry received donations from Pope Leo III (795-816). After the 10th century it was known as Santa Lucia in Silice or in Selci because it was decorated with large flintstones (selci).Accurata e succinta descrizione topografica e istorica di Roma moderna; by Rodulphinus (Rodolfo) Venuti, 1766, page 41. The deaconry was suppressed in 1587 by Pope Sixtus V. In the 13th century, a monastery was attached to the church, enclosing it. In 1370, it was granted to the Carthusians. In 1534, it was given to the Benedictines, and in 1568 Pope Pius V granted it to the Augustinians, who still serve the church. Pope Urban VIII altered the monastery in 1624, enlarging it and dividing it into three parts. One was kept by the Augustinians, one was given to Dominican friars and the last was given to the Poor Clares. The monastery was amplified in 1603 according to designs by Bartolomeo Bassi, active in Rome at that time. However, all that remains of this amplification is the portal of the exterior. In 1878 the Italian state expropriated the convent of the Poor Clares, adjacent to San Lorenzo in Panisperna, but the nuns came to the monastery of Santa Lucia in Selci. Carlo Maderno reconstructed the church in 1604, keeping it enclosed within the Augustinian monastery. The interior of the church was refurbished in 1637-1638 by Francesco Borromini. Interior View of nave interior toward main altar. Landi Chapel, by Francesco Borromini The church is built on a rectangular ground plan and barrel vault. It has a single nave with three shallow chapels on each side. The barrel vault has a 19th-century fresco by an unknown artist that replaced one with the same motif by Giovanni Antonio Lelli, depicting the Glory of St Lucy.Guida metodica di Roma e suoi contorni, by Giuseppe Melchiorri, Rome (1836); page 356. The counterfaçade is decorated with the painting God the Father by Cavaliere d'Arpino. The high altar dates from the 19th century, and replaces one made by Borromini. The painting above the high altar depicting the Annunciation is a work of the Florentine painter Anastasio Fontebuoni. The Landi Chapel, commissioned by the prioress Vittoria Landi, is the first chapel on the left. It was decorated by Borromini, and the altarpiece depicts The Holy Trinity with Saint Augustine and Saint Monica by Cavaliere d'Arpino .Melchiorri, page 356. The Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, the second on the left, contains works attributed to Carlo Maderno: a tabernacle in polychrome marble and gilt bronze and the alabaster statues. At the first altarpiece on the right depicts Martyrdom of St Lucy by Giovanni Lanfranco.Melchiorri, page 356. The Vision of St Augustine by Andrea Camassei is at the second altar on the right.

It included diverse groups of economists, greens and community activists. TOES eventually became an umbrella term and similar meetings were organised around the world for the next two decades.  TOES summits  The Other Economic Summit (TOES) was the idea of Sally Willington (1931-2008), founder of AIMS and founder member of the British Green Party. The First TOES in 1984 was organised by the New Economics Foundation and the Right Livelihood Awards, and was focused on alternative development and environmental issues. The New Economics Foundation, a UK- based think tank, had the aim of working towards a \\"new model of wealth creation, based on equality, diversity and economic stability\\". The purpose of the summit was to highlight that the economy could be organised in other ways. TOES also challenged the right of the G7 leaders to speak for the world. TOES demanded that the system of global economic governance should be democratised. It was also suggested that the G7 Summits should be replaced by a representative World Economic Council within the United Nations system. From 1985 to 1987 TOES was held in the UK, sending a delegation to the G-7 summit city. From 1988 onward, TOES convened every year in the city of the G-7 Summit.

If You Please was written several years before the publication of the Surrealist Manifesto when Breton was primarily associated with Dada. The original performance was on March 27, 1920 at the Salle Berlioz in ParisKnapp, Bettina. French Theater 1918-1939, London: MacMilan Publishers, 1985, pp. 40. and was part of a larger Dada program that \\"included Tzara's Zurich success La Premiere Adventure céleste de M. Antipyrine [The First Celestial Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine], Le Serin muet [The Silent Serin] by Ribemont-Dessaignes, Le ventriloque désaccordé [The Untuned Ventriloquist] by Paul Dermée, and Picabia's Manifeste cannibale dans l'obscurité [The Cannibal Manifesto in the Dark].\\"Goldberg, RoseLee.

Other collaborations Breton and Soupault previously collaborated on Les Champs Magnétiques [The Magnetic Fields], a novel that is one of the first instances of automatic writing. Synopsis The play is in four acts; each act begins a new and unrelated story. The first three acts borrow from popular genres, but the dialogue is often associatively poetic. Act I is a Dada infidelity play that follows two lovers, Paul and Valentine, and Valentine's husband. The Dada dialogue twists the conventions of the dramatic cliché, as in the opening lines which juxtapose the tritest of romantic dialogue with imagistic metaphor. Paul says, \\"I love you.\\"Translation from Benedikt, Michael, and George Wellwarth, eds. Modern French plays : an anthology from Jarry to Ionesco. London: Faber and Faber, 1965. The two share a \\"long kiss.\\" Valentine then replies, \\"A cloud of milk in a cup of tea.\\" This act ends with another cliché of the romantic melodrama, murder at the hands of a jilted lover, but turned on its head. \\"Paul slowly draws a revolver from his pocket, barely taking aim. Valentine falls without a sound.\\" Act II similarly reappropriates the detective story. Its protagonist, Létoile, apparently a private detective, sits in his office and encounters stock private investigator storylines, which quickly become absurd and are as quickly abandoned. In Scene 4, when a man tries to hire Létoile's to recover the man's wife's stolen ring, Létoile, instead of pursuing the case, simply explains \\"Matters such as this concern the police,\\" and the man \\"rises, bows, and leaves,\\" ending the scene and the storyline. In a subsequent scene a woman enters his office and explains that her husband \\"feels an honest and upright love for another woman\\" and that she wants to give him a divorce to \\"grant him his independence.\\" Létoile presents reasons why she shouldn't get a divorce but forcefully insists on executing the divorce for her. Act III features an encounter between Mixime, a thirty- year-old man, and Gilda, a prostitute, who meet in a café. They exchange seemingly incoherent dialogue: > MAXIME: The kingdom of the skies is peopled with assassins. Higher up > there's a swing which waits for you. Don't lift your head again. > GILDA: The photographer said: Let's not move. > MAXIME: I don't want to die. > GILDA: Someone has dared to sadden you? > MAXIME: I don't think so; I've only just come in. > GILDA: Are your eyes really that color? > The act ends with Maxime asking to go with Gilda to her flat. \\"Don't insist, sweetheart,\\" she says. \\"You'll regret it. I've got the syph.\\" Maxime replies simply, \\"Who cares,\\" and they exit together. This act is followed by \\"a long intermission.\\" In the text of the play, Act IV is only a note, stating \\"The authors of 'If You Please' do not want the fourth act printed.\\" Bettina Knapp writesKnapp, pp. 44-45 (citing J. H. Matthews, Theatre in Dada and Surrealism, p. 88). that the fourth act proceeds as follows: \\"The theater plunges into semi-darkness. Two characters are now visible in a doorway. X looks at his watch and informs the other man of his imminent departure. Y walks up and down, speechless.\\" Then an actor planted in the orchestra cries out, \\"Is that all?… Will you soon be finished?\\" A second planted audience member says, \\"'I don't understand a thing. It's idiotic.' From the box we hear a voice asking him to be silent or to leave. No, he insists, he paid for his seat and he'll stay. Another voice intervenes from the orchestra, 'If only it were interesting.'\\" The second planted actor calls for the first to be thrown out. Finally, \\"the Second Spectator has grown angry and shakes his fist at the stage. Amid the tumult caused by his obstreperous behavior one hears 'Vive la France', then 'Continue'. Finally the call for 'Author' is heard, and instead of Breton and Soupault walking out onstage two other actors take their place.\\" References Category:French plays Category:Surrealist plays Category:Works by André Breton ","title":"If You Please"},{"id":"24481637","text":"Hasso Spode (born 1951 in Friedrichshagen) is a German historian and sociologist.

As women tend to the child, expensively dressed female guests are already arriving. Triumph of Fame on the Medici–Tornabuoni desco da parto painted for the birth of Lorenzo de' Medici, 1449 A painted desco da parto (a birth tray or birth salver) was an important symbolic gift on the occasion of a successful birth in late medieval and Early Modern Florence and Siena. The surviving painted deschi represented in museum collections were commissioned by elite families, but inventories show that birth trays and other special birth objects like embroidered pillows were kept long after the successful birth in families of all classes: when Lorenzo de' Medici died, the inventory shows that the desco da parto given by his father to his mother, Lucrezia Tornabuoni, at her lying- in,The Medici–Tornabuoni desco da parte, painted by Giovanni di Ser Giovanni, called \\"Scheggia\\", the brother of Masaccio, with a Triumph of Fame, is conserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, acc. no. 1995.1995.7. was hanging in his private quarters to the day of his death.Musacchio 1998 note 3 quotes from a 1475 inventory \\"3 paia di schodelle [pairs of soup plates] di maiolicha da donna di parto\\", at a time when the testator's children were fifteen and sixteen years old. A desco da parto need not have been specially commissioned; they were produced in workshops in series for stock, often being personalised with a coat-of-arms when they were bought. There was a distinctive repertoire of iconography for the trays, the recto (top) sides sharing much with that for the painted cassone chests often used as gifts at marriage, but also with verso (bottom) sides often showing scenes of mothers after childbirth or pin- up figures of boy toddlers, accompanied by the coats of arms of both parents. After being used as a tray during the period of postpartum confinement, they could be hung on a wall as a painting. Usage Infant mortality was highest during the crucial first days, when the mother might also succumb to childbed fever. A successful childbirth was lavishly celebrated. Sons would one day assert the family interests, whether in modest workshop or banking house; daughters would share the household's work until they were married and would cement the exogamous ties that stabilized Tuscan family position at every social level. Painted childbirth trays began to appear about 1370, in the generation following the Black Death, when the tenuousness of life was more vivid than ever.Musacchio 1998:140. In the fifteenth century, D.C. Ahl found, at least one appears in almost half of all inventories she surveyed.Ahl, \\"Renaissance birth salvers and the Richmond Judgment of Solomon\\", Studies in Iconography 7 (1981:157-84) p. 158. The mother was expected to remain \\"lying in\\", enjoying bed rest during a postpartum period of variable duration, but probably lasting at least a week. No fixed term of lying-in is recommended in Renaissance manuals on family life (unlike in some other cultures, see Postpartum confinement), but it appears from documentary records that the mother was rarely present at the baptism, in Italian cities usually held within a week of the birth at the local parish church, normally a few minutes' walk from any house. During this period the mother and child were visited in the bedroom by family and female friends, and presented with gifts.V&A; traditionally, a Chinese mother was not allowed to leave the house for a month, or receive visitors for 12 days. The tray or salver, often covered with a protective cloth, was used for serving delicacies to the visitors, perhaps including some they had brought as presents: a maid brings a cloth-covered desco with two carafes of water and wine to fortify Saint Anne in Paolo Uccello's fresco of the Birth of the Virgin (1436), in the Chapel of the Annunciation, Duomo of Prato,Noted by Musacchio 1998:141; the fresco is illustrated in Georges Duby, ed. A History of Private Life, II: Revelations of the Medieval World (1988) following p. 254. Raiment might be ceremoniously brought into the specially-decorated bedchamber where the new mother lay: in a desco da parto by Masaccio of 1427,Gemäldegalerie, Berlin; illustrated in Duby 1988 p. 248. the tray and a covered cup are preceded by a pair of trumpeters flying banners with the Florentine gigli. In fact, in patrician households the bed was often placed in a reception room for the occasion (if there was not one already in such a room, after the fashion of the French and Burgundian courts), and the mother lay there while receiving visits from her friends over several days. Iconography For the painted trays made for the elite on these joyous occasions, in general, both sides of the tray are painted, the upper side (or recto) generally with a crowded figure scene, usually secular, such as a scene from classical myth or a suitable allegory. Scenes from the Old Testament or the Christian religious repertoire also appear in some cases. Birthing scenes were popular. These might be the Birth of the Virgin or that of Florence's patron saint, John the Baptist, but only a halo or two distinguishes these from other scenes apparently showing a birth scene as a genre painting. A tray in the New York Historical Society shows a genre birthing scene but is closely copied from a drawing of the birth of John the Baptist by Lorenzo Monaco.Web Gallery of Art, \\"Desco da parto (recto), 1428, Tempera on panel, diameter 59 cm, New York Historical Society, New York]; the verso is illustrated here In all these the mother sits up in bed receiving gifts from a stream of female visitors, while at the front of the scene the child is washed or wrapped in swaddling by more women. In one male pageboys serve the guests. Another tray shows boys and men playing a local fighting game in the street (see gallery). The earliest painted illustration of a novella of Boccaccio is on a Florentine desco da parto with the arms of a Pisan family, made c. 1410 and in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.on-line catalogue entry The survivals include three allegorical scenes of the Triumph of Love, derived from Petrarch's Triumphs, and one Triumph of Venus. The underside or verso generally has a simpler and often less elevated subject, with fewer, larger figures, and usually includes heraldry, with the arms of both parents shown.The Medici–Tornabuoni tray is painted with the feather device of Piero de' Medici and the coats of arms of the Medici and Tornabuoni families. Scenes with one or two naked boy toddlers, with the coats of arms of both parents at the sides, are especially popular. The arms of the mother's family traditionally take the right hand side, but in some examples the arms have been changed by overpainting them.Christies Inscriptions in the field or round the rim sometimes provide the date of the fortunate event,A desco da parto dated 25 April 1428, in the New-York Historical Society collection (illustrated here), is attributed to the prolific manuscript illuminator and occasional panel painter, the Florentine Bartolomeo di Fruosino, in Paul F. Watson, \\"A Desco da parto by Bartolomeo di Fruosino\\" The Art Bulletin 56.1 (March 1974:4–9); another desco by Bartolomeo is Musacchio 1998 fig. 6. providing art historians with a useful fixed point. Like some other types of art, such as the \\"Otto prints\\", desci were mostly expected to be decorated in what was considered to be feminine taste, although how the design was selected is unclear. In an example painted by Masaccio's brother two boys wrestle, with certainly one and probably both using the hold of pulling on the other's penis with one hand and hair with the other (see gallery).Conceivably the one on the right could be a girl, which would be an exception in these images In the Renaissance it was believed that the sights a pregnant woman saw affected her pregnancy and even what it produced – Martin Luther told the cautionary story of a woman frightened by a mouse in pregnancy, who then gave birth to a mouse. Manuals advised keeping images with a positive impact in the sight of pregnant women, and it is in this context that the recurrent naked boys, and the scenes showing the end of a successful childbirth, should be seen. This was also a factor in the display of images of the Virgin and Child, which were ubiquitous in bedrooms.V&A; Probably the desci were hung with the verso displayed during pregnancy, to promote the production of a similar healthy boy. ;Two pairs of images File:Scuola fiorentina, desco da parto, 1420 ca, diam. 51, coll. privata 01.JPGGarden of Love, recto c. 1420, 51 cm diameter File:Scuola fiorentina, desco da parto, 1420 ca, diam. 51, coll. privata 02.JPGVerso of the last, with 2 coats of arms and a boy with a stork(?)

Two boys engage in no holds barred wrestling Artists and history Workshops that produced deschi da parto were often also manuscript illuminators, as for example Bartolomeo di Fruosino, an illuminator who also produced panel paintings, and painters of the panels that were incorporated into the fronts and ends of quattrocento cassoni. Such a workshop was that of the \\"Master of the Adimari cassone\\", now usually identified as Masaccio's brother Giovanni di ser Giovanni Guidi (or \\"Lo Scheggia\\", \\"the Splinter\\"), which also produced the desco da parto showing youths playing at civettino in an urban setting, in Palazzo Davanzati, Florence,Illustrated in Duby 1988, p.241. and other examples. A divided verso showing two naked boys fighting realized $482,500 at auction in 2012.Christie's Some artists remain unidentified, and were clearly not of the first rank, but, given the significant names represented among the tiny proportion of survivors, it appears that many artists took an occasional break from larger projects to produce desci. The circular tondo shape in normal panel paintings, which became fashionable in the mid-fifteenth century in Florence, may have developed from the smaller desci.\\"The Adoration of the Kings, about 1470-5, Sandro Botticelli\\", National Gallery Diana and Actaeon. San Francisco Legion of Honor Museum The format of the desco, usually about 50 to 60 cm across, is with twelve or sixteen sides, or from about 1430, round,Musacchio 1998:141; Robert Olson, Florentine Tondo, 2000:29, compares deschi with the circular format of a tondo. enclosed within a slightly raised lip integral to the panel. Some examples that are now round seem to have originally been twelve-sided. Some have dates that record the day of the birth (or marriage) concerned. Only about two dozen desci survive, some now with the surfaces sawn apart by dealers in modern times, to create two works.Catalogue entry for example in San Francisco: Nash, Steven A.; Masterworks of European painting in the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, pp. 38–39, Hudson Hills, 1999, , . Google books In inventories they are often described as \\"broken\\" or \\"old\\", and most apparently were used as trays until too scruffy to keep. As the 15th century continued they were gradually replaced as gifts by pieces of majolica, often special \\"birthing sets\\" with similar iconography, although the Uffizi has an example of 1524 by Jacopo Pontormo, and others are even later. Examples from the 16th-century tend to have a more raised bowl- like profile, as in the Pontormo, as if echoing the new maiolica shapes. Production of painted cassoni ceased over the same decades. Jacqueline Marie Musacchio rejects the common assumption that these trays were made to celebrate a marriage; she never encountered a desco da nozze in any 15th- century inventory.Musacchio 98, note 24 But a Sienese wedding casket (cofanetto nuziale) in wood in the Louvre has a round top with a Triumph of Venus by Giovanni di Paolo (dated 1421) that is effectively identical to the desci form.Image Nevertheless, if they were presented at the time of the marriage, though certainly regarded as associated specifically with pregnancy and childbirth, this would both explain how such elaborate objects were available for use very soon after an uncertain event, and mean that the beneficial images of boys could exert their positive influence throughout the important first pregnancy. Example in San Francisco The San Francisco Legion of Honor Museum has an example painted about 1400 by Lorenzo di Niccolo, a Florentine painter who was active from 1391 to 1412. The recto shows the story of Diana and Actaeon. Diana, goddess of hunting appears in the foreground clothed in a dark, brocaded robe and carrying a falcon; at the right, her nymphs pursue a boar. At the top of the painting, Diana and her nymphs are bathing in a pool of water when the mortal Actaeon happens upon the naked goddess. For offending the virgin deity, Actaeon was transformed into a stag to be hunted down by his own dogs. His fate is illustrated on the left side, where hounds chase a deer. The reverse (verso) shows the allegorical figure of Justice with two family coats of arms while holding a scale and a sword.

The effect of the contrast transfer function can be seen in the alternating light and dark rings (Thon rings), which show the relation between contrast and spatial frequency. The contrast transfer function (CTF) mathematically describes how aberrations in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) modify the image of a sample.Spence, John C. H. (1988 2nd ed) Experimental high- resolution electron microscopy (Oxford U. Press, NY) .Ludwig Reimer (1997 4th ed) Transmission electron microscopy: Physics of image formation and microanalysis (Springer, Berlin) preview.Earl J. Kirkland (1998) Advanced computing in electron microscopy (Plenum Press, NY). This contrast transfer function (CTF) sets the resolution of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), also known as phase contrast TEM. By considering the recorded image as a CTF-degraded true object, describing the CTF allows the true object to be reverse-engineered. This is typically denoted CTF- correction, and is vital to obtain high resolution structures in three- dimensional electron microscopy, especially electron cryo-microscopy. Its equivalent in light-based optics is the optical transfer function. Phase contrast in HRTEM The contrast in HRTEM comes from interference in the image plane between the phases of scattered electron waves with the phase of the transmitted electron wave. When an electron wave passes through a sample in the TEM, complex interactions occur. Above the sample, the electron wave can be approximated as a plane wave. As the electron wave, or wavefunction, passes through the sample, both the phase and the amplitude of the electron beam is altered. The resultant scattered and transmitted electron beam is then focused by an objective lens, and imaged by a detector in the image plane. Detectors are only able to directly measure the amplitude, not the phase. However, with the correct microscope parameters, the phase interference can be indirectly measured via the intensity in the image plane. Electrons interact very strongly with crystalline solids. As a result, the phase changes due to very small features, down to the atomic scale, can be recorded via HRTEM.  Contrast transfer theory  TEM Ray Diagram with Phase Contrast Transfer Function Contrast transfer theory provides a quantitative method to translate the exit wavefunction to a final image. Part of the analysis is based on Fourier transforms of the electron beam wavefunction. When an electron wavefunction passes through a lens, the wavefunction goes through a Fourier transform. This is a concept from Fourier optics. Contrast transfer theory consists of four main operations: # Take the Fourier transform of the exit wave to obtain the wave amplitude in back focal plane of objective lens # Modify the wavefunction in reciprocal space by a phase factor, also known as the Phase Contrast Transfer Function, to account for aberrations # Inverse Fourier transform the modified wavefunction to obtain the wavefunction in the image plane # Find the square modulus of the wavefunction in the image plane to find the image intensity (this is the signal that is recorded on a detector, and creates an image) Mathematical form If we incorporate some assumptions about our sample, then an analytical expression can be found for both phase contrast and the phase contrast transfer function. As discussed earlier, when the electron wave passes through a sample, the electron beam interacts with the sample via scattering, and experiences a phase shift. This is represented by the electron wavefunction exiting from the bottom of the sample. This expression assumes that the scattering causes a phase shift (and no amplitude shift). This is called the Phase Object Approximation.  The exit wavefunction  Following Wade's notation, the exit wavefunction expression is represented by: :\\\\tau(r,z) = \\\\tau_o \\\\exp[-i\\\\pi\\\\lambda\\\\int dz'U(r,z')] :\\\\tau_o = \\\\tau(r,0) :U(r,z) = 2mV(r,z)/h^2 Where the exit wavefunction τ is a function of both r in the plane of the sample, and z perpendicular to the plane of the sample. \\\\tau_o represents the wavefunction incident on the top of the sample. \\\\lambda is the wavelength of the electron beam, which is set by the accelerating voltage. U is the effective potential of the sample, which depends on the atomic potentials within the crystal, represented by V. Within the exit wavefunction, the phase shift is represented by: :\\\\phi(r) = \\\\pi\\\\lambda \\\\int dz' U(r,z') This expression can be further simplified taken into account some more assumptions about the sample. If the sample is considered very thin, and a weak scatterer, so that the phase shift is << 1, then the wave function can be approximated by a linear Taylor polynomial expansion. This approximation is called the Weak Phase Object Approximation. The exit wavefunction can then be expressed as: :\\\\tau(r,z) = \\\\tau_o[1 + i\\\\phi(r)]  The phase contrast transfer function  Passing through the objective lens incurs a Fourier transform and phase shift. As such, the wavefunction on the back focal plane of the objective lens can be represented by: :I(\\\\theta) = \\\\delta(\\\\theta) + \\\\Phi K(\\\\theta) \\\\theta = the scattering angle between the transmitted electron wave and the scattered electron wave \\\\delta = a delta function representing the non-scattered, transmitted, electron wave \\\\Phi = the Fourier transform of the wavefunction's phase K(\\\\theta) = the phase shift incurred by the microscope's aberrations, also known as the Contrast Transfer Function: :K(\\\\theta) = \\\\sin[(2\\\\pi/\\\\lambda)W(\\\\theta)] W(\\\\theta) = -z\\\\theta^2/2 + C_s\\\\theta^4/4 \\\\lambda = the relativistic wavelength of the electron wave, C_s = The spherical aberration of the objective lens The contrast transfer function can also be given in terms of spatial frequencies, or reciprocal space. With the relationship \\\\theta =\\\\lambda k, the phase contrast transfer function becomes: :K(k) = \\\\sin[(2\\\\pi) W(k)] W(k) = -z\\\\lambda k^2/2 + C_s\\\\lambda^3 k^4/4 z = the defocus of the objective lens (using the convention that underfocus is positive and overfocus is negative), \\\\lambda = the relativistic wavelength of the electron wave, C_s = The spherical aberration of the objective lens, k = the spatial frequency (units of m−1) Spherical aberration Spherical aberration is a blurring effect arising when a lens is not able to converge incoming rays at higher angles of incidence to the focus point, but rather focuses them to a point closer to the lens. This will have the effect of spreading an imaged point (which is ideally imaged as a single point in the gaussian image plane) out over a finite size disc in the image plane. Giving the measure of aberration in a plane normal to the optical axis is called a transversal aberration. The size (radius) of the aberration disc in this plane can be shown to be proportional to the cube of the incident angle (θ) under the small-angle approximation, and that the explicit form in this case is : r_s = C_s\\\\cdot\\\\theta^3\\\\cdot M where C_s is the spherical aberration and M is the magnification, both effectively being constants of the lens settings. One can then go on to note that the difference in refracted angle between an ideal ray and one which suffers from spherical aberration, is : \\\\alpha_s = \\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{R}\\\\right) -\\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{R+r_s}\\\\right) where b is the distance from the lens to the gaussian image plane and R is the radial distance from the optical axis to the point on the lens which the ray passed through. Simplifying this further (without applying any approximations) shows that : \\\\alpha_s = \\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{br_s}{R^2 + Rr_s +b^2}\\\\right) Two approximations can now be applied to proceed further in a straightforward manner. They rely on the assumption that both r_s and R are much smaller than b, which is equivalent to stating that we are considering relatively small angles of incidence and consequently also very small spherical aberrations. Under such an assumption, the two leading terms in the denominator are insignificant, and can be approximated as not contributing. By way of these assumptions we have also implicitly stated that the fraction itself can be considered small, and this results in the elimination of the \\\\arctan() function by way of the small-angle approximation; : \\\\alpha_s \\\\approx \\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{br_s}{b^2}\\\\right)\\\\approx\\\\frac{br_s}{b^2}=\\\\frac{r_s}{b}=\\\\frac{C_s\\\\cdot\\\\theta^3\\\\cdot M}{b} If the image is considered to be approximately in focus, and the angle of incidence \\\\theta is again considered small, then : \\\\frac{R}{f}\\\\approx\\\\tan\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)\\\\approx\\\\theta ~~ \\\\text{and} ~~ M\\\\approx \\\\frac{b}{f} meaning that an approximate expression for the difference in refracted angle between an ideal ray and one which suffers from spherical aberration, is given by : \\\\alpha_s \\\\approx \\\\frac{C_s\\\\cdot R^3}{f^4} Defocus As opposed to the spherical aberration, we will proceed by estimating the deviation of a defocused ray from the ideal by stating the longitudinal aberration; a measure of how much a ray deviates from the focal point along the optical axis. Denoting this distance \\\\Delta b, it is possible to show that the difference \\\\alpha_f in refracted angle between rays originating from a focused and defocused object, can be related to the refracted angle as : \\\\sqrt{R^2+b^2}\\\\cdot\\\\sin(\\\\alpha_f)=\\\\Delta b \\\\cdot\\\\sin(\\\\theta' -\\\\alpha_f) where R and b are defined in the same way as they were for spherical aberration. Assuming that \\\\alpha_f<<\\\\theta' (or equivalently that b\\\\cdot\\\\sin(\\\\alpha_f)<<R ), we can show that : \\\\sin(\\\\alpha_f)\\\\approx\\\\frac{\\\\Delta b \\\\sin(\\\\theta')}{\\\\sqrt{R^2 +b^2}} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta b \\\\cdot R}{R^2 +b^2} Since we required \\\\alpha_f to be small, and since \\\\theta being small implies R<, we are given an approximation of \\\\alpha_f as : \\\\alpha_f\\\\approx\\\\frac{\\\\Delta b\\\\cdot R}{b^2} From the thin-lens formula it can be shown that \\\\Delta b / b^2 \\\\approx \\\\Delta f / f^2, yielding a final estimation of the difference in refracted angle between in-focus and off-focus rays as : \\\\alpha_f\\\\approx\\\\frac{\\\\Delta f\\\\cdot R}{f^2} :  Examples  The contrast transfer function determines how much phase signal gets transmitted to the real space wavefunction in the image plane. As the modulus squared of the real space wavefunction gives the image signal, the contrast transfer function limits how much information can ultimately be translated into an image. The form of the contrast transfer function determines the quality of real space image formation in the TEM. CTF Function prepared via web applet created by Jiang and Chiu, available at http://jiang.bio.purdue.edu/software/ctf/ctfapplet.html This is an example contrast transfer function. There are a number of things to note: * The function exists in the spatial frequency domain, or k-space * Whenever the function is equal to zero, that means there is no transmittance, or no phase signal is incorporated into the real space image * The first time the function crosses the x-axis is called the point resolution * To maximize phase signal, it is generally better to use imaging conditions that push the point resolution to higher spatial frequencies * When the function is negative, that represents positive phase contrast, leading to a bright background, with dark atomic features * Every time the CTF crosses the x-axis, there is an inversion in contrast * Accordingly, past the point resolution of the microscope the phase information is not directly interpretable, and must be modeled via computer simulation  Scherzer defocus  The defocus value (z) can be used to counteract the spherical aberration to allow for greater phase contrast. This analysis was developed by Scherzer, and is called the Scherzer defocus. z_s = (C_s\\\\lambda)^{1/2} The variables are the same as from the mathematical treatment section, with z_s setting the specific Scherzer defocus, C_s as the spherical aberration, and λ as the relativistic wavelength for the electron wave. The figure in the following section shows the CTF function for a CM300 Microscope at the Scherzer Defocus. Compared to the CTF Function showed above, there is a larger window, also known as a passband, of spatial frequencies with high transmittance. This allows more phase signal to pass through to the image plane.  Envelope function  CTF Function of a CM300 Microscope damped by temporal and spatial envelope functions. The envelope function represents the effect of additional aberrations that damp the contrast transfer function, and in turn the phase. The envelope terms comprising the envelope function tend to suppress high spatial frequencies. The exact form of the envelope functions can differ from source to source. Generally, they are applied by multiplying the Contrast Transfer Function by an envelope term Et representing temporal aberrations, and an envelope term Es representing spatial aberrations. This yields a modified, or effective Contrast Transfer Function: K_{eff}(k) = E_tE_s(\\\\sin[(2\\\\pi/\\\\lambda)W(k)] Examples of temporal aberrations include chromatic aberrations, energy spread, focal spread, instabilities in the high voltage source, and instabilities in the objective lens current. An example of a spatial aberration includes the finite incident beam convergence. As shown in the figure, the most restrictive envelope term will dominate in damping the contrast transfer function. In this particular example, the temporal envelope term is the most restrictive. Because the envelope terms damp more strongly at higher spatial frequencies, there comes a point where no more phase signal can pass through. This is called the Information Limit of the microscope, and is one measure of the resolution. Modeling the envelope function can give insight into both TEM instrument design, and imaging parameters. By modeling the different aberrations via envelope terms, it is possible to see which aberrations are most limiting the phase signal. Various software have been developed to model both the Contrast Transfer Function and Envelope Function for particular microscopes, and particular imaging parameters.  Linear imaging theory vs. non-linear imaging theory = Linear imaging theory  The previous description of the contrast transfer function depends on linear imaging theory. Linear imaging theory assumes that the transmitted beam is dominant, there is only weak phase scattering by the sample, and that the sample is extremely thin. Linear imaging theory corresponds to all of the scattering, or diffraction, being kinematical in nature. Few of these assumptions hold with real samples. In fact, even a single layer of Uranium atoms does not meet the Weak Phase Object Approximation. Linear imaging theory is still used, however, because it has some computational advantages. In Linear imaging theory, the Fourier coefficients for the image plane wavefunction are separable. This greatly reduces computational complexity, allowing for faster computer simulations of HRTEM images.Notes prepared by Professor Laurie Marks at Northwestern University.  Non-linear imaging theory  In practically all crystalline samples, the specimens will be strong scatterers, and will include multiple scattering events. This corresponds to dynamical diffraction. In order to account for these effects, non-linear imaging theory is required. With crystalline samples, diffracted beams will not only interfere with the transmitted beam, but will also interfere with each other. This will produce second order diffraction intensities. Non-linear imaging theory is required to model these additional interference effects.This page was prepared in part for Northwestern University class MSE 465, taught by Professor Laurie Marks.

The locomotive was equipped with two different drives, therefore acquiring the nickname Bastard. Because of its three-part locomotive body it also acquired the nickname Tatzelwurm.  History  During the First World War the SBB decided to establish electric operation on their main lines as fast as possible, in order to become independent of coal supplies which had to be obtained from their warring neighbouring countries. Since electric traction technology was still new, suitable locomotive configurations had to be found. Therefore, the SBB ordered several prototype locomotives. In addition to the Be 3/5 12201, Be 4/6 12301, Be 4/6 12302 and Ce 6/8I 14201 with coupling rods, the SBB procured the Be 2/5 prototype locomotive with fully spring-loaded drives. When tested in the operational environment, this locomotive turned out to be too weak and too slow. As early as 1919 the SBB ordered a second prototype locomotive from SLM and BBC; as with the Be 4/6 this prototype locomotive would have four drive axles. The specified requirements corresponded to those of the Be 4/6; however, for the operation of express trains, a maximum speed of was required.  Layout = Mechanical layout  Side view The Be 4/6 utilized the maximum axle load of fully. The motors for the Ae 4/8 were heavier than those of the Be 4/6, therefore the Ae 4/8 was planned with two more idle axles from the beginning. In contrast to the Be 4/6 bogie locomotive the Ae 4/8 was built as a frame locomotive with a double articulated body. This articulated layout allowed good operation on curves, even with the heavy, frame mounted motors. The locomotive was nicknamed Tatzelwurm because of this layout. The locomotive consisted of three bodies connected by gaiters, the two outer bodies with short cabinets. The chassis consisted of two short-coupled frames. Each of them contained two drive axles, one leading Bissel axle and one trailing Adams axle. The frames were – as with the Be 4/7 – coupled directly by a connecting rod and two auxiliary couplers. The outer bodies were fixed to the frames, while the centre body lay on a bridging slab, which did not transfer any tractive or pressure forces. The bridging slab rested on the outer frames over a pivot, and via horizontal springs between the inner drive axles and the Adams axles. The transformer was mounted in the centre part of the locomotive. For removing the transformer the roof of the centre locomotive body was detachable. The roofs of the outer parts of the locomotive body were detachable separately from the left or right side. The side elements of the three parts of the locomotive body were detachable in segments. The centre body, including the bridging slab, was removable as a whole. The cabinet of cab 1 contained two compressors, while the cabinet of cab 2 contained the brake transformer, a lifting jack and a toolbox. The locomotive was equipped with four identical motors which were mounted fixed in the frames. The fully sprung drives were different on each frame, therefore the locomotive was also nicknamed Bastard. On side 1 Tschanz drives were mounted. The basic feature of this drive was the gimbal principle for the transmission of the torque between the big gearwheel, which was part of the gearbox connected to the unsprung motor, and the suspended drive axle. Because the gimbal-drives were able to be very short it was possible to omit – in contrast to the Be 2/5 – the hollow shaft to the other side of the locomotive. The diameter of the big gearwheel was limited by the loading gauge, therefore the cog transmission had to be cascaded in two steps because the engine speed of all four motors was identical. Side 2 contained single side-mounted Buchli drives. Due to the great weight of those drives they were mounted transversally. The installation of the drive on both sides – as was used on the Be 2/5 – was not considered necessary any more. The brake equipment of the locomotive was: * drive wheels with brakes on both sides * inner idle wheels single-side braked * outer idle wheels non-braked * one braking rod for each locomotive frame * automatic air brake with single releasing brake valves of the Westinghouse type. * direct working through brake * handbrake from both cabs to the respective part of the locomotive * electrical brake (see the next section) * The Ae 4/8 never had divided brake shoes or automatic braking rod adjustment The locomotive's total weight of – coincidentally, the same as the later Ae 4/7 – led to an average weight of per axle, within the specified limit. The axle load was not balanced, though; side 1 had significantly higher axle loads. The axle loads, starting at the Bissel axle of the locomotive (side 1), were in order: 14.0 t – 18.3 t – 18.6 t – 14.5 t – 14.2 t – 18.1 t – 17.9 t – 11.2 t Because of this imbalance the use of the sand distributor was very important. Each drive wheel could be fed with sand, in either direction of travel, by compressed air.  Electrical layout  The electrical part of the locomotive was adapted from the Be 4/6 12303, with changed components: * higher power output from the motors (4 x instead of 4 x over 1 hour) * electrical brake as on the Be 4/6 12313 and successors The transformer, oil operated main switch and stepping switch were located in the centre body. The power supply was obtained from the catenary via the two diamond-shaped pantographs mounted on each end body. At the start of a journey, both pantographs had to be lifted since they were only equipped with a single sliding bar without rocker. The cabinets for the reversing pole shunts and the brake resistors were mounted in front of the pantographs, towards the ends of the outer bodies. The 18-step flat track BBC stepping switch was mounted on the transformer. It was driven by a battery supplied direct-current motor. Initially the stepping switch was controlled by a crank handle, later by a control wheel. It was possible to operate the stepping switch by hand, but only by someone actually at the switch inside the centre locomotive body. The transformer oil was carried through cooling tubes located on both sides under the centre locomotive body. An oil pump was used to circulate the oil. Each cooling tube system was mounted inside a duct. A fan blew air from the interior of the body through this system. The motors in the end bodies were connected in series circuit. The electrical isolation of one locomotive side was possible by blocking the respective reversing switch. The electrical brake was an AC excited resistor brake. Together with the reversing pole shunts they were mounted on the roof over the cabs, where they were cooled by the head wind. The locomotive was equipped with the following auxiliary systems: * two compressors * a converter group for battery charging * one shared fan for the two Tschanz-drive motors * two fans with a shared motor for the BBC-drive motors * an oil pump * cab heating  Service  At the time of the introduction of electric traction the locomotives looked strange to the railway staff. The air grilles resembled wrinkles, therefore the locomotive was sometimes nicknamed grandmother. After its delivery in March 1922 the locomotive was used first on the Bern (Berne) – Thun line, because this line was the first one electrified with the necessary 15 kV 16⅔ Hz AC. Unlike the prototype locomotives with rod drives, the Ae 4/8 was never used on the adjacent Lötschbergbahn (Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon railway) from Thun to Brig. The locomotive was not based in Bern for long; its service there was followed by a test phase on various lines including the Gotthardbahn (Gotthard railway). In 1925 the locomotive was assigned to the Basel (Basle) depot, where it remained until its withdrawal from service. In 1927 its roster included – together with two Ae 4/7s – two fast train pairs Basle – Zürich and back with a daily run of . With its performance (about 90% of that of the Ae 4/7), the locomotive was universally operable. The maximum speed of allowed them to pull fast trains, therefore the locomotive was often used when capacity needed to be doubled. In this role the locomotive led fast trains to Zürich, Chur, Luzern, Berne and Spiez. Often the Ae 4/8 worked freight trains to Zürich and Winterthur. During its last years of service the locomotive was used for Basel – Zürich – Winterthur services, and then commuter trains around Olten and freight trains around Solothurn. In 1961 the locomotive was fitted with new cogwheels in the Tschanz drives. But on October 7th 1964 a driver reported a flashover at the step switch, and as a result of this the locomotive was towed to the Zürich repair workshop. Unfortunately the workshop was busy because of the additional services it had to provide for the 1964 Swiss National Exhibition (Expo 64), and the locomotive was stored for the time being. The SBB general management had decided to withdraw all of the veteran locomotives after Expo 64, so the Ae 4/8 was promptly scrapped. The technical importance of the locomotive was marginal. At the moment of the handover of the Ae 4/8, six Be 4/7s with the Westinghouse drive, and the first few Ae 3/6Is with the BBC drive, were already in service. Because of its complexity the Tschanz drive was not developed any further. The last remaining parts of this drive were scrapped at the Zürich workshop in 1967.  External appearance  Originally the locomotive was, as with many SBB electric locomotives, painted brown, which was later changed to green. At its procurement in 1922 the locomotive was classified as Ae 4/8 and numbered 11000; in 1929 the number was changed to 11300. The same number was assigned later to a Re 4/4II.

Gardner Sullivan, produced by Thomas H. Ince and William S. Hart, and directed by Lambert Hillyer. Upon its release, the Los Angeles Times described it as Hollywood's greatest desert epic. Plot The film's plot centers on Buckskin Hamilton (played by William S. Hart), a desert guide in the mold of Kit Carson. The film is set in the Gold Rush year of 1850. Buckskin rides to Westport Landing to meet a steamer from St. Louis. The steamer is carrying a group that Buckskin has been hired to lead west on the old Santa Fe Trail from Kansas to New Mexico. The group aboard the steamship includes Buckskin's younger brother, Billy Hamilton, who has recently graduated from medical school through Buckskin's sacrifices. While on the steamboat, Billy Hamilton catches David Washburn, a crooked gambler played by screen villain Robert McKim, cheating at cards. A fight ensues, and Washburn's sister, Jane Washburn (played by Jane Novak) walks in and becomes involved in a struggle over the gun. The gun is fired, and Billy Hamilton is killed. David Washburn convinces his sister that she pulled the trigger, and she takes the blame for her brother's actions. Actress Jane Novak plays Hart's love interest Jane Washburn.Buckskin arrives to find his brother dead. Though initially vowing revenge, he is persuaded that the beautiful Jane Washburn did not intend to kill his brother. Buckskin then leads the group, including Jane and David Washburn, and Washburn's henchman, Merton (played by Lloyd Bacon), west along the Santa Fe Trail. Various adventures ensue, including two of the wagons falling over a precipice. A romance develops between Buckskin and Jane Washburn, and she confesses that Buckskin's brother had not been annoying her - the cover story developed by her brother. Buckskin becomes convinced that either David Washburn or his henchman, Merton, is responsible for the death of his brother and marches the two men into the desert at gunpoint. To save himself, Merton confesses that David Washburn killed Buckskin's brother. As Buckskin marches the two men back to camp, he learns that one of the emigrants has shot an Indian brave. The Indian chief demands that a white man be sacrificed - \\"a life for a life.\\" Buckskin gives David Washburn a choice – he can either sacrifice himself to the Indians and die a noble death or kill himself. Washburn agrees to kill himself, and Buckskin agrees to be the sacrifice to the Indians. However, Washburn fakes his suicide and tries to escape, running into the Indian camp where he is mistaken for, and accepted as, the sacrifice. Buckskin walks into the Indian camp as the Indians execute Washburn. Buckskin returns to the camp, where the movie ends in uncertainty as whether the death of David Washburn will cast a permanent shadow over the budding romance between Buckskin and Jane Washburn. The movie ends with Buckskin riding into the desert. Before he leaves, Jane says, \\"Maybe you'll come back some day.\\" As he rides into the spreading dawn, Buckskin sadly replies, \\"Mebbe.\\" Cast *William S. Hart as Buckskin Hamilton *Jane Novak as Jane Washburn *Robert McKim as David Washburn *Lloyd Bacon as Guy Merton *Leo Pierson as Billy Hamilton *Bert Sprotte as Brick Muldoon *Charles Arling as The Captain Critical reception William S. Hart was the lead actor and producer of Wagon Tracks.Upon its release in 1919, Wagon Tracks was hailed by the Los Angeles Times as the industry's \\"Greatest Desert Epic.\\" In its praise of the film, the Times continued, \\"The great desert screen epic is with us at last. It has been done by William S. Hart and C. Gardner Sullivan, with the aid of a fine cast and superlative photography ... Let it also be said that the music adds so vividly to the charm of the production that it might be said to be raised to that level of artistic achievement for which the big ones among the producers and exhibitors are always striving, and which for lack of a better name we call by that rather grandiose one of grand opera of the screen.\\" Commenting on the screenplay, the Times called it Sullivan's \\"masterpiece,\\" a \\"strikingly original story,\\" and wrote that \\"it breathes that clean-cut, Americanism always striven for by play-wrights, novelists and operatic writers -- it is as ruggedly and wholesomely American as its name.\\" As for Hart, the Times wrote that \\"it seems as if all his former efforts were mere training for this big epic of the outdoors.\\" Other reviewers also praised the film. The Atlanta Constitution called it an \\"unusually worth while offering\\" with \\"a story about love and fighting and Indians and thrills galore, a picture in which the popular screen hero literally outdoes himself.\\" The Atlanta paper also wrote that Hart's face was \\"the synonym for power and manliness\\" and concluded, \\"No one who sees this picture will soon forget it.

Life Victor Alter Alter studied in Belgium, at the University of Ghent where he received a degree in mechanical engineering in 1912. Afterward he returned to Warsaw. In April 1913 he was arrested by Tsarist authorities for his activism for the Bund and was exiled to Siberia. He managed to escape and soon made his way to Great Britain where he joined the Labour Party. During World War I he took part in the campaign of conscientious objector and refused military service. After the February Revolution he moved to Russia. In December 1917 he became a member of the Central Committee of the Bund. From 1918 on he resided in newly independent Poland. He was one of the leaders of the Polish Bund in the interwar period, associated with the organization’s left wing. He was in favor of closer cooperation with the Polish Socialist Party, and opposed the Comintern and the Polish Communist Party. During this time he was also a member of Warsaw City Council. In September 1939 after the German invasion of Poland, and the subsequent Soviet invasion of Poland he found himself in the Soviet occupied zone. On 29 September he was arrested by the NKVD. In July 1941 he was sentenced to death by the Soviet authorities, although the sentence was later commuted to ten years in the Gulag. After the Nazi invasion of Soviet Union, and the signing of the Sikorski–Mayski Agreement between the Polish Government in Exile and the Soviet Union he was released from the gulag. Execution Cenotaph of Wiktor Alter and Henryk Ehrlich in Warsaw, Poland He began to organize the International Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee. During this time he established contacts with Stanisław Kot, the Polish ambassador in Moscow, and called for Polish Jews in the Soviet Union to join the Polish Anders Army. In October 1941, Alter, together with Henrik Erlich were placed by the Soviet authorities in a hotel in Kuibishev (Samar). During private conversations, which were taped and reported to Joseph Stalin, the two discussed the rumors about the murder of Polish officers, including many Polish Jews, at Katyn. On 4 December 1941, he was again arrested by the NKVD, together with Erlich and murdered, although the precise details about his death are unknown. According to some reports, he was sentenced to death on 23 December 1941, and immediately executed. Other sources state that his execution did not take place until February 1943. The death sentence was signed by Vyacheslav Molotov in a note to Lavrentiy Beria, stating that Stalin had personally approved the order. In 1943, Soviet authorities issued a communique which announced that Victor Alter had been executed for \\"spying for Hitler\\". His execution, on Stalin's orders, provoked an international outcry. \\"Rehabilitation\\" On 8 February 1991 Victor Erlich, the grandson of Henryk Erlich was informed that according to a decree passed under Russian president Boris Yeltsin, Victor Alter, together with Erlich had been \\"rehabilitated\\" and the repressions against them had been declared unlawful. While the exact place where he was buried is unknown, a symbolic monument was erected at the Jewish cemetery on Okopowa street in Warsaw on 17 April 1988. The inscription reads \\"Leaders of the Bund, Henryk Erlich, b. 1882, and Wiktor Alter, b. 1890. Executed in the Soviet Union\\". The establishment of the monument (as well as the publication of the full story of Alter and Erlich) was opposed by Poland's post-war communist government and was only made possible due to the efforts of Marek Edelman (sole surviving participant of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and a Bundist) and members of the Polish Solidarity Union.

The initial find was made by Ken Wallace on 19 November 2000, when he found about 130 coins with a metal detector. Along with local community archaeologists, the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) excavated what turned out to be one of the most important Iron Age excavations and community archaeology projects in Britain. The hoard includes over 5,000 silver and gold coins, a silver-gilt Roman parade helmet, jewellery, and other objects. Most of the items date to around the time of the Roman Conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD. Of the coins from the site, 4,835 can be attributed to the local tribe, the Corieltauvi. This find more than doubled the total number of Corieltauvian coins previously recorded. A silver Roman coin from the hoard has been dated by local museums to 211 BC, and is the oldest Roman coin found in Britain. Some archaeologists have however speculated that it found its way into Britain before the Roman conquest in 43 AD and is evidence of exchange through trade or diplomacy. The site of the treasure proved to be an internationally important ritual site dating mostly to the generations before and after the Roman Conquest. Archaeologists believe that the site is a type of open air shrine that is the first of its kind to have been discovered in the UK. It was located on a hilltop in the Welland valley and was probably enclosed by a ditch and palisade. According to Professor David Mattingly, an archaeologist with the University of Leicester, \\"This hoard has changed our view of just how significant the East Midlands were in this period and this coin is a good example. It indicates there was contact between this region and the Roman Empire despite the distance between the East Midlands and the parts of Britain the Romans arrived in, like Colchester and Chichester.\\" Finds from the Treasure are displayed at Harborough Museum. The Roman Hallaton Helmet underwent 9 years of conservation at the British Museum and went on display at Harborough Museum in 2012. In January 2011, it was announced that the skeleton of a dog believed to have been sacrificed to guard the treasure would go on display at Harborough Museum. In 2012 a silver ring inscribed \\"TOT\\" was found in the area that the Hallaton Treasure was discovered. The inscription is believed to refer to the Celtic god Toutatis, corresponding to the Roman god Mars, who Adam Daubney, an expert on this type of ring, suggests may have been worshipped at Hallaton. Leicestershire County Council have acquired the ring for display at the Harborough Museum.

Early years Van Genechten was born in Antwerp and studied jurisprudence at the University of Ghent.Rees 1991, p. 146. After the Imperial German forces invaded Belgium in the Great War, Van Genechten wasted no time in collaborating with the occupying German forces. After the armistice and end of the war, he fled to the Netherlands, receiving an eight-year prison sentence in absentia. In the Netherlands, he made a living as a lawyer and a teacher at Utrecht University, taking Dutch citizenship on 14 June 1930. Return When the statute of limitations ran out on Genechten's Belgium conviction he returned to his native country, but he later returned to the Netherlands to enter politics. Joining the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands in 1934, he quickly rose through the party ranks, at one time acting as spokesman on education, and from 1938, editor-in-chief of Nieuw Nederland. As a regular writer on the rightwing paper, he expounded at length on his hatred of rationalism and humanism. In 1937, he wrote a series of articles, Van den vos Reynaerde, which was a re-interpretation of the Reynard cycle attacking Jews. The articles went on to become a book in 1941, and an animated cartoon in 1943. Given his pro-Nazi stance, he was interned by the Dutch government in Hoorn prison during the 1940 invasion. Under the Nazis His fortunes changed once the Nazis took control, and he was released from jail to take a role as the appointed Solicitor-General to the Court of Justice in The Hague, where he presided over \\"peace courts\\" introduced by Arthur Seyss-Inquart. For a time he was also Minister for Education, Arts, and Science in Anton Mussert's proposed cabinet, but he never took power as the Germans refused to devolve power to the NSB and thus the cabinet never took office.Littlejohn 1972, p. 117. As the occupation of the Netherlands wore on, he fell out of favor with the Germans, and in February 1943 was given the new role of Commissioner for South Holland, a demotion. Reacting badly to his reduced role, he attempted suicide, an act that saw him removed from all positions because of his perceived unstable nature. After the liberation of the Netherlands by Canadian forces, he was arrested and sentenced to death by the Special Court. He committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell before the sentence could be carried out.Littlejohn 1972, p. 350.

Bred in Kentucky by Peter E. Blum and raced under the Blue Ribbon Farm banner, he had a record of 41: 11-12-3 with career earnings of $3,920,405. Pedigree Online Thoroughbred Database; At the time of his retirement, he was fourth on the all-time career earnings list. Devil His Due was best known for his three races in the grade one Pimlico Special (1 win and 2 seconds) and his two wins in the grade one Suburban Handicap. He was registered as a dark bay colt; but was later classified as a \\"true black.\\"  Three-year-old season  Devil His Due was a late-developing colt and did not race as a two-year-old. As a three-year-old, he started in 15 races. His marquee wins both came at Aqueduct Racetrack when he won both of New York's top Triple Crown prep races. Devil His Due won the $500,000 Grade I Wood Memorial Stakes at nine furlongs on the dirt. Prior to the Wood win, he finished in a dead heat with Lure in the $250,000 Grade II Gotham Stakes. He also finished eleventh in the Kentucky Derby way behind winner Lil E. Tee. Later that summer, he placed third in the Grade II Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga Race Course as a prep race for the $1,000,000 Grade I Travers Stakes. In that race, Devil His Due ran second to Thunder Rumble. He finished the year with a record of (15): 4-2-1 and earnings of $688,365.  Four-year-old season  At age four, Devil His Due posted perhaps the best year of his career when he raced eleven times and won three Grade I and one Grade II stake races. His record was four wins, two seconds, and two thirds in eleven races for earnings of $1,939,120.Directory of Thoroughbred Race Horses; In the Pimlico Special, he was a slight favorite at 1.3 to 1 over the prior year's Derby winner, Strike the Gold, at 1.7 to 1. That year, the country's top racetracks, owners, and breeders established a series of seven handicap races for older horses to showcase the industry's top division and called it the American Championship Racing Series or A.C.R.S. The Pimlico Special was the capstone of that series. As they broke from the gate and passed the stands for the first time, Ibex took the lead by a length over Pistols and Roses while Devil His Due trailed two lengths behind him. Jockey Herb McCauley kept Devil His Due in a stalking position of third throughout the first mile. On the far turn, Valley Crossings passed everyone to lead. Devil His Due and Pistols and Roses made a charge at the leader, but only the former got by. Devil His Due finished the race in 1:55.2 on a track listed as fast. Valley Crossing finished second, and Pistols and Roses finished third. Derby winner Strike the Gold was never a factor and finished sixth. That win in the Grade I $600,000 Special was the largest of Devil His Due's career. He received a $150,000 bonus for winning the ACRS series (after four races).

Six-year-old season  As a six-year-old, Devil His Due was in the twilight of his career and raced only three times between February and May 1995. In his last year of racing, he placed second in the $110,000 Grade III Westchester Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack. In his next start, he finished off the board. His trainer and owner then ran him against that decade's super horse, Cigar, in the Pimlico Special. Cigar won by two and 1/4 lengths. Devil His Due earned $120,000 for his second-place performance. In the process, he set a career earnings record that still stands for \\"Special\\" runners at $900,000. One of Devil His Due's claims to fame is that in an era of vast Lasix and steroid use, he ran drug-free in 41 starts for a total of over 44 miles of racing.

The aqueduct is supplied by the Mokelumne River and provides water to 35 municipalities in the East Bay in the San Francisco Bay Area. The aqueduct and the associated dams, pipelines, treatment plants and hydroelectric system are owned and operated by the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) and provide over 90 percent of the water used by the agency. The aqueduct is the sole water supply for about 1.4 million people in the East Bay. Under present water rights agreements, EBMUD can withdraw up to 325 million gallons (1,230,000 m3) per day, or per year, from the Mokelumne River. In addition, up to 98 million gallons (371,000 m3) per day or per year can be supplied via a branch from the Sacramento River. However, this supply is expected only to be used in the driest 35% of years. History In the early 20th century, due to a lack of reliable local water, Bay Area cities began to look to rivers in the Sierra Nevada, about east, as a potential new source. Although the city of San Francisco was already extending an aqueduct to the Tuolumne River, East Bay communities wanted to build an independent water system, fearing future \\"hegemony\\" of the water system by San Francisco. In 1923, the EBMUD was organized and in 1924 acquired water rights to the Mokelumne River, a major tributary in the San Joaquin River system. On November 4, 1924, residents approved $39 million in bonds to finance the project. Construction began in 1926 and by 1929, the high, concrete arch Pardee Dam and the First Mokelumne Aqueduct, consisting of a single pipeline, were completed. The first deliveries to the Bay Area were made on June 23, 1929. At the time of completion, Pardee Dam was the tallest in the world (this record was surpassed one year later by Diablo Dam in Washington State). In 1949, a second pipeline was built and in 1963 the third pipeline was constructed, bringing the aqueduct to its present capacity. In 1964, the second major dam of the project, Camanche Dam, was completed below Pardee. In 1970, EBMUD signed a contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) for supplemental water from the Folsom South Canal, which draws water from the American River near Sacramento. The USBR supply was delayed for nearly 40 years in part due to minimum flow requirements in the American River to protect salmon and steelhead populations. The Folsom South Canal Connection (FSCC), which links the two waterways, was finally completed in 2009. Specifications The aqueduct begins at Pardee Reservoir, which is formed by Pardee Dam on the Mokelumne River. The reservoir has a capacity of , or about a 10-month supply. Camanche Reservoir, located directly below Pardee, has a storage capacity of – twice the size of Pardee – but is not directly linked to the aqueduct. However, Camanche allows for greater diversions into the aqueduct by storing winter floodwaters spilled from Pardee. During the dry season, water is released from Camanche in order to satisfy local water-rights holders, eliminating the need to draw water from Pardee. The aqueduct travels southwest for through the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada and then west across the Central Valley along the Calaveras River before crossing the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. Near Lodi, the aqueduct is joined by an extension of the Folsom South Canal, which supplements the Mokelumne River supply. Once the water reaches the Berkeley Hills above the East Bay, it is channeled into a complex distribution system consisting of six terminal reservoirs (Briones, Chabot, Lafayette, San Pablo and Upper San Leandro) with a combined storage capacity of . The water is treated at the San Pablo, Sobrante and Upper San Leandro Treatment Plants before passing through the Claremont Tunnel, which emerges on the western side of the range between Berkeley and Oakland. Water not immediately put into the municipal system is stored in the reservoirs for use in times of low delivery or drought. Most of the aqueduct consists of three separate buried steel pipelines, although there are also some aboveground segments. The pipelines, also known as Aqueducts No. 1, 2 and 3, have diameters of , and , respectively. Aside from the main facilities, the distribution system includes of pipes, 125 pump plants, and 168 local reservoirs/storage tanks. Issues The aqueduct is located in a seismically active zone and is considered vulnerable to earthquakes, especially the stretch where it crosses the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta, where an earthquake or storm-induced levee failure could damage the pipelines or any of three major river crossings here. A large earthquake (100 year return period or more) could put the aqueduct out of service from 18 months to three years, depending on the extent of the damage. Levee failures in 1980 and 2004 (not caused by earthquakes) on Jones Tract have threatened the aqueduct. An aqueduct joint at the crossing of the Middle River also failed in 1992, nearly causing a washout of the levee. The aqueduct was shut down in time before an actual levee breach could occur. Because Pardee Reservoir is relatively small among California reservoirs, EBMUD has pursued to raise Pardee Dam to a height of . This would expand the reservoir surface by . The enlarged reservoir would cover , an increase of 62 percent, and the capacity would be about , a roughly 50 percent increase. It would allow for more water to be provided during the dry season that would otherwise have been spilled over the dam during the winter. This project would have flooded between of the Mokelumne River. Due to environmental concerns, the project was shelved in 2011.

He received a double promotion from Commissioner of Police when he became Deputy Inspector-General of Police. In June 2009, Okiro released a book titled \\"Policing Nigeria in a Democracy\\". Inspector General of Police On assumption of office as the Inspector-General of Police, he worked tirelessly to provide secure environment for the actualization of Mr. President’s Vision of placing Nigeria among the world’s top 20 economies by the year 2020. This he ably did by partnering effectively with the Ministry of Police Affairs and the Police Service Commission, in a conscious effort towards re-positioning the Nigeria Police in the areas of Quality Training, Behavioral and Attitudinal Change, Community Policing and Service Delivery. He significantly improved the welfare and morale of officers and men, by an enhanced salary package and improved logistics, notably owner-occupier houses. He created a channel of communication as a tool of bridging the Police-Public divide; the philosophy that gave birth to 'THE DAWN' newspaper. He reinstated a number of officers who had been forced into early retirement and also made police service more open, receptive and responsive to troubled spots in the country the results of which all Nigerians are living witnesses and promised to provide improved pay, housing and equipment to the police. Among his salient achievements as the Inspector-General of Police are but not limited to the followings: (1).

However, the EFCC stated that they did not have records of the exact properties recovered from Balogun. Intimidation against INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner of Ekiti State In April 2009, Mrs. Ayoke Adebayo, Resident Electoral Commissioner of Ekiti State, wrote a letter to President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua resigning from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) saying she would not yield to pressure to change election results in her state. Mike Mbama Okiro declared that she must make herself available to the Nigeria Police within 24hours. Halliburton Corruption Scandal Mike Okiro headed a five-man inter-agency panel to investigate the $190 million Halliburton scandal in which it was alleged that KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton, had distributed bribes to politicians and officials to gain construction contracts from Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas. In July 2009 it was found that a key suspect, Abdulakadir Abacha, cousin of former military ruler General Sani Abacha, might have fled the country. President Yar’Adua ordered an interim report to ensure that the panel was not compromised or influenced during a planned visit abroad. Although Abdulkadir Abacha was never caught, President Yar’Adua congratulated Okiro on his retirement at age 60 in July 2009, for his achievements while in the IGP Office.

The entire Nigeria Police Force will continue to eulogize, appreciate and give ample reasons to remember him for all that he enacted, stood for, and his inherent principles of being celebrated but yet a benevolent tough cop. Speaking in August 2009 after a farewell parade in his honour in Abuja, Mike Okiro spoke of problems with the system where the IGP does not have the authority to fulfill his responsibilities. He also said \\"The unkindest cut is the attack of a public officer after he has left office with the unholy belief that he is no longer in a position to defend himself.\\" Sir (Dr.) Mike Mbama Okiro is happily married with children and enjoys playing chess and writing in his spare time.

They are built out of a mix of conclusions, beliefs, opinions, attitudes, past experiences and social learning. This concept or life skill has been widely referenced in self-help books and used in the counseling profession since the mid-1980s. According to some counselors, personal boundaries help to define an individual by outlining likes and dislikes, and setting the distances one allows others to approach. They include physical, mental, psychological and spiritual boundaries, involving beliefs, emotions, intuitions and self-esteem. Jacques Lacan considered such boundaries to be layered in a hierarchy, reflecting \\"all the successive envelopes of the biological and social status of the person\\". Personal boundaries operate in two directions, affecting both the incoming and outgoing interactions between people. These are sometimes referred to as the \\"protection\\" and \\"containment\\" functions.  Scope  The three most commonly mentioned categories of values and boundaries are: * Physical – Personal space and touch considerations * Mental – Thoughts and opinions * Emotional – Feelings Some authors have expanded this list with additional or specialized categories such as spirituality, truth, and time/punctuality.  Types  Nina Brown proposed four boundary types: * Soft – A person with soft boundaries merges with other people's boundaries. Someone with a soft boundary is easily a victim of psychological manipulation. * Spongy – A person with spongy boundaries is like a combination of having soft and rigid boundaries. They permit less emotional contagion than soft boundaries but more than those with rigid. People with spongy boundaries are unsure of what to let in and what to keep out. * Rigid – A person with rigid boundaries is closed or walled off so nobody can get close either physically or emotionally. This is often the case if someone has been the victim of physical, emotional, psychological, or sexual abuse. Rigid boundaries can be selective which depend on time, place or circumstances and are usually based on a bad previous experience in a similar situation. * Flexible – Similar to spongy rigid boundaries but the person exercises more control. The person decides what to let in and what to keep out, is resistant to emotional contagion and psychological manipulation, and is difficult to exploit.  Application  The personal boundaries concept is particularly pertinent in environments with controlling people or people not taking responsibility for their own life. Co-Dependents Anonymous recommends setting limits on what members will do to and for people and on what members will allow people to do to and for them, as part of their efforts to establish autonomy from being controlled by other people's thoughts, feelings and problems. The National Alliance on Mental Illness tells its members that establishing and maintaining values and boundaries will improve the sense of security, stability, predictability and order, in a family even when some members of the family resist. NAMI contends that boundaries encourage a more relaxed, nonjudgmental atmosphere and that the presence of boundaries need not conflict with the need for maintaining an understanding atmosphere.  Risks of reestablishing  In Families and How to Survive Them, Robin Skynner MD explains methods for how family therapists can effectively help family members to develop clearer values and boundaries by when treating them, drawing lines, and treating different generations in different compartments – something especially pertinent in families where unhealthy enmeshment overrides normal personal values. However, the establishment of personal values and boundaries in such instances may produce a negative fall-out, if the pathological state of enmeshment had been a central attraction or element of the relationship. This is especially true if the establishment of healthy boundaries results in unilateral limit setting which did not occur previously. It is important to distinguish between unilateral limits and collaborative solutions in these settings.  Anger  Anger is a normal emotion that involves a strong uncomfortable and emotional response to a perceived provocation. Often, it indicates when one's personal boundaries are violated. Anger may be utilized effectively by setting boundaries or escaping from dangerous situations.  Complicating factors = Mental illness  People with certain mental conditions are predisposed to controlling behavior including those with obsessive compulsive disorder, paranoid personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder, attention deficit disorder, and the manic state of bipolar disorder. * Borderline personality disorder (BPD): There is a tendency for loved ones of people with BPD to slip into caretaker roles, giving priority and focus to problems in the life of the person with BPD rather than to issues in their own lives. Too often in these relationships, the codependent will gain a sense of worth by being \\"the sane one\\" or \\"the responsible one\\". Often, this shows up prominently in families with strong Asian cultures because of beliefs tied to the cultures. * Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD): For those involved with a person with NPD, values and boundaries are often challenged as narcissists have a poor sense of self and often do not recognize that others are fully separate and not extensions of themselves. Those who meet their needs and those who provide gratification may be treated as if they are part of the narcissist and expected to live up to their expectations.  Codependency  Codependency often involves placing a lower priority on one's own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships. While a healthy relationship depends on the emotional space provided by personal boundaries, codependent personalities have difficulties in setting such limits, so that defining and protecting boundaries efficiently may be for them a vital part of regaining mental health. In a codependent relationship, the codependent's sense of purpose is based on making extreme sacrifices to satisfy their partner's needs. Codependent relationships signify a degree of unhealthy clinginess, where one person doesn't have self-sufficiency or autonomy. One or both parties depend on the other for fulfilment. There is usually an unconscious reason for continuing to put another person's life first, often for the mistaken notion that self-worth comes from other people.  Dysfunctional family  * Demanding parent: In the dysfunctional family the child learns to become attuned to the parent's needs and feelings instead of the other way around. * Demanding child: Parenting is a role that requires a certain amount of self-sacrifice and giving a child's needs a high priority. A parent can, nevertheless, be codependent towards a child if the caretaking or parental sacrifice reaches unhealthy or destructive levels.Codependents Anonymous: Patterns and Characteristics  Communal influences  Freud described the loss of conscious boundaries that may occur when an individual is in a unified, fast-moving crowd. Almost a century later, Steven Pinker took up the theme of the loss of personal boundaries in a communal experience, noting that such occurrences could be triggered by intense shared ordeals like hunger, fear or pain, and that such methods were traditionally used to create liminal conditions in initiation rites. Jung had described this as the absorption of identity into the collective unconscious. Rave culture has also been said to involve a dissolution of personal boundaries, and a merger into a binding sense of communality.  Unequal power relations  Also unequal relations of political and social power influence the possibilities for marking cultural boundaries and more generally the quality of life of individuals. Unequal power in personal relationships, including abusive relationships, can make it difficult for individuals to mark boundaries.

This provides TB Alert with a unique perspective in order to address issues around TB that are common both to low incidence countries like the UK and high incidence regions such as Africa and Asia. TB Alert's work focuses on: * raising public and professional awareness about TB, addressing barriers to treatment, and providing support to patients during their treatment * bringing together statutory health services, voluntary organisations and people affected by TB to plan and deliver better TB services * advocating for the policy and resources to improve the care of patients and the prevention and control of TB. TB Alert's vision is the control and ultimate elimination of TB. Its mission is to increase access to effective treatment for all. TB Alert India In 2004 TB Alert registered a sister organisation, TB Alert India, which is now at the forefront of national efforts to address TB working in close alignment with the Indian Government's national TB programme. TB Alert works hand in hand with TB Alert India to develop, fund and implement a range of projects to tackle TB in the country. TB Alert India works across two states in central and southern India, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, which comprised a single state before their division in June 2014. Working closely with the Indian government, TB Alert India helps ensure people are treated and cured by the national TB programme. The organisation brings together local grassroots organisations, traditional healers, pharmacists, women's self-help groups, people living with HIV, ex- patients and government health services. Together, they raise awareness of TB and refer people with symptoms to local health centres for diagnosis and treatment. TB Alert India is also a key partner in Axshya, a multimillion- dollar TB project funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, the leading global funder of TB programmes. Active projects=UK TB Alert's work in the UK focuses on making sure people with TB are diagnosed and treated as quickly as possible, and supporting them through treatment, to ensure that they don’t become seriously ill or pass TB on to others. The Truth About TB programme TB Alert's flagship TB awareness raising programme, The Truth About TB, brings statutory bodies together with the voluntary organisations that are embedded within and trusted by communities at risk of TB. By working together, these groups are better able to raise awareness of TB within at-risk communities and support them to get the care they need. In 2010, TB Alert launched a TB awareness raising website as part of the programme: www.thetruthabouttb.org. Patient support TB Alert provide support for people through their TB journey through: * peer support given by members of the TB Action Group. * patient information leaflets, that supplement the advice and information given by TB clinicians * small grants to help vulnerable patients with the associated costs of TB treatment * a TB information service for people with questions about TB The TB Action Group The TB Action Group (TBAG) is a network for people affected by TB in the UK that provides support for people during their treatment and recovery from TB. Members also use their insights and stories to raise awareness of TB and to advocate for improved TB services. Professional awareness raising TB Alert offers online TB training for GPs, practice nurses and nurse practitioners through the Royal College of GPs website, along with a TB Specialist Nurse Resource Pack to use in GP practice meetings. TB Alert also offers TB training to third sector and statutory service organisations that provide services for communities affected by TB. India TB Alert has been working in India since 2000 to help the government reach the most vulnerable communities and give them access to life-saving treatment. TB Alert's sister organisation, TB Alert India, was formed in 2004 and has since been at the forefront of wide- ranging efforts to fight TB. Educate, Prevent and Treat In October 2015, TB Alert launched the Educate, Prevent and Treat project to improve the health of women, children and people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the Virudhunagar and Kanchipuram Districts of Tamil Nadu, India. These groups face many social and structural barriers to TB diagnosis and treatment, such as their health being considered a low priority or specific stigma and discrimination. TB Alert's project, which is funded by the Big Lottery Fund, works in partnership with the Blossom Trust to support marginalised groups to influence TB service provision and overcome barriers to accessing services. Axshya – TB free Axshya (meaning TB free), is a major India wide TB initiative funded by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, the leading global funder of TB programmes. TB Alert India carries out Axshya's work in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, managing the project in seven districts. Axshya's programmes aim to improve the rates of TB diagnosis and treatment for vulnerable people in under-served communities. Delhi DIVINE The Delhi DIVINE TB Project was launched in the Burari and Sant Nagar districts of Delhi in March 2008 by TB Alert's sister organisation, TB Alert India. The project aims to strengthen India's national TB programme at a grassroots level, by providing community-based TB diagnosis and treatment facilities. PRATAM TB Alert India's PRATAM (Pharmacist and rural healthcare provider TB activism) project in Telangana State provides TB training for community-based health providers. These providers are often the first point of call for people who fall ill in India, though many lack medical qualifications. As they are part of their local communities and hold their trust, they are perfectly placed to reach people with TB quickly, supporting early diagnosis and treatment and reducing the spread of the illness. TB Advocacy Project (TAP) The TB Advocacy Project (TAP) ran between 2011 and 2014, with funding from the Department for International Development, to improve access to TB services for under served communities in Andhra Pradesh. The project worked with partners to reach rural and urban poor people to increase their knowledge and awareness of TB-HIV co- infection and their access to free government TB-HIV services. The project also created and strengthened community groups that advocate for improved TB diagnostic and treatment services at project and state level. The end of project evaluation, which was compiled by an external agency, showed that the project reached 12% of the local population and exceeded its targets, particularly in respect of the number of people diagnosed with TB, HIV or TB- HIV coinfection. Community challenge to stop TB In 2013, TB Alert India was awarded funding from the Stop TB Partnership's Challenge Facility for Civil Society (CFCS), which works to empower local communities to fight TB, for a one-year project to increase the participation of TB-affected people in national decision making and to identify and address barriers to TB care. Malawi Integrated TB-HIV in Thyolo In 2015, TB Alert launched a new project to integrate TB and HIV services in the Thyolo district of Malawi. Though Thyolo is just one of 28 districts in the country, it is home to nearly a quarter of Malawi's PLHIV. The project will reach 168,000 people in the district through: * TB and HIV awareness raising * improved and integrated TB- HIV services * support for families affected by TB and HIV. Community empowerment in Mulanje In April 2014, TB Alert launched a new community empowerment project to get people diagnosed and into effective treatment as early as possible. The project aims to reduce the number of TB deaths, contain the development of drug resistance in the area and prevent poverty. The project follows the World Health Organization's TB ENGAGE approach, which recognises that the best way to reach a community is from within that community. This integrated community-based approach covers all aspects of TB, including prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care. The project will help people in more than 500 villages throughout the district by: * providing information on the prevention, testing, treatment, care and management of TB * supporting diagnosis through 100 sputum collection centres and six new microscopy centres * supporting TB affected families with nutrition education and help to establish ‘backyard gardens’ * training microscopists, establishing new microscopy centres and supporting enhanced case detection * testing people living with HIV for TB. JournAIDS TB Alert's JournAIDS project ran between 2013 and 2014 in the Chiwamba area of Malawi, where poverty levels are particularly high and health services are poor. Many people in the region lack even basic information about TB and HIV/AIDS, and are unable to access vital testing and treatment for these conditions. In partnership with local NGO JournAIDS, a network of journalists, and the local community group CYDSE, the project reached over 5 million people with awareness raising messages about TB and HIV/AIDS. To develop the programme, project journalists visited health centres to learn about TB prevention, care and treatment. They then targeted electronic, print and radio media with stories about TB and its association with HIV. Zambia TB and HIV: inside and out In April 2014, long-standing TB Alert partners, Chichetekelo, launched a year-long project to address TB and TB-HIV in the Mpima and Mukobeko prisons in Kabwe. TB Alert's technical advice and support underpinned Chichetekelo's success in securing the project's grant funding from the Stop TB Partnership‘s Challenge Facility for Civil Society. Through the project, prisoners learnt about TB and TB-HIV, so that they could seek help if they experienced symptoms. Prison staff and authorities also received TB training: to enable them to refer prisoners with possible TB symptoms to appropriate services, to address conditions that encourage TB to spread, and to advocate for the rights of prisoners at national level. Community TB-HIV advocacy TB Alert's Community TB-HIV Advocacy in Zambia (COTHAZ) project ran from 2010 to 2014, and involved seven local NGOs working across six areas of the country, to raise awareness of TB-HIV. The project was funded by the Department for International Development and reached over 6 million people in the Kabwe, Katete, Luanshya, Masaiti, Lusaka and Kitwe districts. The COTHAZ project worked at three levels: * community TB awareness raising * local advocacy for better TB services * national government engagement to secure funding and support for improved TB services. Zimbabwe TB-HIV action in Chimanimani and Mutasa In October 2015, TB Alert launched a new 3-year project to reduce TB and HIV in the Manicaland province of Zimbabwe. The project works in the rural Chimanimani and Mutasa districts where rates of diagnosis and treatment for TB and HIV are low, even by Zimbabwe's standards. Using a model developed in-line with the WHO's ENGAGE-TB approach; which calls for the integration of community-based TB and HIV services; the project aims to turn this situation around. Murambinda Mission Hospital TB Programme TB Alert funded the Murambinda Mission Hospital Tuberculosis Programme from 2002 until early 2015. Although it has just 120 beds, the hospital is one of only two hospitals serving Buhera District in Zimbabwe's vast Manicaland Province. The district is home to 200,000 people, the majority of whom earn a meagre living as subsistence farmers. Murambinda's TB project helped people to receive and remain on treatment by: * training local community volunteers, who are known and trusted by their communities, to identify symptoms, refer suspected cases to local clinics and support patients to take their medication * training and supporting local health workers to develop and manage community outreach activities and to collect and monitor TB data * strengthening information systems to understand TB in the local area, so that clinics never ran short of drugs and to reestablish treatment for patients that stopped too early. Global advocacy TB Alert seeks to influence policy-makers and decision-makers in the UK, across Europe, internationally and through field programmes in Africa and India. TB Alert's philosophy is to treat advocacy and programmes as two sides of the same coin. TB Alert's fieldwork helps people and communities in their day-to-day lives, whilst its advocacy is aimed at ensuring the policies and resources are in place to achieve the same outcomes on a wider scale: to prevent TB making people ill, to provide the care everyone affected by TB needs and to control the spread of the infection. Notable supporters=Honorary President Sir John Crofton 1912-2009 As Emeritus Professor of Respiratory Diseases and Tuberculosis at the University of Edinburgh in the 1950s – a place and time in which TB was the leading cause of death in young people – Crofton led the team responsible for bringing TB under control. His ‘Edinburgh Method’ was the first demonstration of mass control of TB, which was subsequently instituted in 23 European countries. Crofton was a leader in the work of the World Health Organisation, a celebrated author and an influential teacher. Crofton was knighted in 1977 and awarded the Union Medal in 2005 by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, for his contributions to TB control. To the end of his life in 2009, at the age of 97, he continued as a tireless campaigner on TB issues and fundraiser for TB Alert. His legacy continues to support TB Alert's life-saving work through The Sir John Crofton Fund To Fight TB Patron Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, South African activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner.

The mission of MHRP is to develop an HIV-1 vaccine, provide prevention, care, and treatment, and conduct meaningful HIV/AIDS research for the global community through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). It is centered at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and has established five international research sites in Africa and Asia (Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Thailand). MHRP also partners with the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) in Thailand. MHRP works closely with The Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine (HJF), most notably in the development of the RV144 HIV vaccine in Thailand. MHRP is the largest research program supported by the HJF.  Funding  The MHRP is a $175 million program which receives funding for research and treatment endeavors from the Department of Defense ($28 million), PEPFAR, and other organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Some of MHRP's collaborative vaccine-as-treatment research is funded by Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson. MHRP studies in combination approaches to HIV are made possible by a competitive grant that they competed for from a NIH-funded Martin Delaney Collaboratorive. In 2012, a MHRP scientist named Dr. Gary R. Matyas proposed a vaccine to treat heroin addiction and prevent those who received this vaccine from contracting HIV. Matyas was awarded the NIDA Avant- Garde Award for Medications Development for this proposition, which gave him $1 million per year for five years to continue his research at MHRP on the dual vaccine. International vaccine research The program's most notable contribution to HIV/AIDS medical research was the RV 144 vaccine study of over 16,000 volunteers in Thailand. In September 2009, the MHRP and the Thai Ministry of Health conducted the first successful HIV/AIDS vaccine trial to show effective prevention in humans, with a final prevention rate of 31%. Also see Frequently asked questions regarding the RV144 Phase III HIV Vaccine Trial and Thailand MHRP site information . Although the efficacy is modest, this trial is significant because it proved that it is possible to develop an HIV vaccine. The breakthrough led to increased interest in research on RV144 and the foundation of partnerships such as the Pox-Protein Public-Private Partnership (P5), a mosaic of public and private entities that focus on building on the success of RV144. MHRP also provides study leadership, and is working with researchers around the globe to dissect the results from the RV144 trial and to design future clinical trials to translate a scientific milestone into an eventual public health tool. RV144 remains the only instance of successful preventative HIV vaccination. MHRP scientists are also pursuing other strategies to target multiple sub-types of HIV, including modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vaccines, which were initially developed by collaborating scientists from WRAIR, NIAID, the National Institutes of Health, and the Laboratory of Viral Diseases (LVD). MHRP has ongoing studies and clinical trials using different types of MVA vaccines in Uganda and Thailand, with progress milestones including partial protection and viral load reduction in monkeys being infected with Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). Prevention, care, and treatment In addition to vaccine research, the MHRP provides prevention, care, and treatment services to the communities where they conduct research. According to the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine's 2016 annual report, MHRP works with local programs around the world to support more than 240,000 patients on antiretroviral therapy and to make HIV testing/advising accessible to more than 1.1 million people. Using existing in-country technical expertise and administrative infrastructure, MHRP expands partnerships with local researchers, health care services and NGOs in Africa to implement PEPFAR activities. Goals include providing counseling, testing, prevention of mother to child transmission, full access to antiretroviral therapy, home-based care, and care for orphans and vulnerable children. MHRP also conducts therapeutic research, tracks the HIV epidemic in active-duty forces, assesses the risk of HIV exposure to deployed U.S. and allied forces overseas, and conducts all HIV-1 testing for the Army. In 2008, MHRP helped evaluate the efficacy of new Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) for HIV types 1 and 2. They were developed to be able to quickly test the blood of soldiers who transfuse blood to wounded soldiers in battle situations. This technology prevents transmission of HIV, HCV, and HBV from soldier to soldier and helps keep these diseases from weakening the fighting force further. Additionally, MHRP conducted the first study to characterize that current clinical testing methods can have difficulty detecting HIV viral presence in persons with acute infections.  Work Outside of HIV  Zika, Ebola, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were responded to by MHRP, as they used their infrastructure and research experience to help develop vaccines for both local people and military personnel living in regions where those diseases were endemic. In 2014, MHRP's Uganda site conducted the first vaccine trial for Ebola and Marburg virus ever done in Africa. Using combination DNA vaccines, it was shown that it is safe for people to receive both vaccines in combination. The antigens conduced by these vaccines were critical in the future development of stronger Ebola vaccines in Africa. In 2015, the Uganda site conducted a uniquely extensive study of Ebola survivors, finding that many were suffering from chronic malaise including hearing and vision loss up to 21 months post- infection. MHRP scientists under WRAIR developed a Zika vaccine called ZIKV in only ten months, beginning clinical trial in 2016. This vaccine is not only important to maintain troop health when deploying to foreign regions where Zika is prevalent, but also for those servicemen stationed domestically because there are clusters of military bases in the southern United States where people are at risk for Zika. Preliminary data from a phase 1 clinical trial indicate that 92% of participants would be protected from Zika infection.

The film is about a woman who has lost her son and finds out her niece is in contact with his spirit. Plot Erica and Heather Rose (Kim Raver) are identical twins who share a bond that becomes stronger as they grow up. As adults, their lives have had many parallels: They both have successful careers (Erica is an author and teacher and Heather is a doctor) and both are happily married and loving mothers to seven-year-old children. Erica's daughter Sarah (Niamh Wilson) and Heather's son David grow up sharing an equally close bond, but David is struck by a car and dies. Erica anguishes over how she might be able to explain to Sarah that David is dead, but the bond between the two children seems to extend past the grave, as Sarah reveals that David has already told her he is gone. At school, Sarah hurts a boy from her class when he makes a negative comment about David. When her parents pick her up, Sarah nervously tells them that she doesn't want them to drive over Creek Bridge. Later, they find out there was an accident on that bridge and Sarah had drawn a picture of it because David had told her to. That day, Sarah's nanny, Rosie, notices that the girl has a strange bruise on the back of her neck. Erica and her husband Edgar decide that Erica and Sarah should go stay at the family's country house to help Sarah forget about David. In the city, Heather is still in grief so she decides to drive out to the country house to join her sister. Rosie finds out that Sarah is still in contact with David and gives her a friendship bracelet to protect her. Rosie tells Erica she thinks the bruises may be from David's spirit looking to cross back over, holding onto the neck of a living person, which she refers to as 'hanting.' During the night, Erica, Heather and Rosie run to Sarah's room at her screams and see that her wrist is swollen and bloody, as if someone was trying to rip the bracelet off. Rosie is apprehensive as she senses that David might be a danger to Sarah. The twins however disregard her warnings and decide it would be best to have Rosie leave because of her beliefs, wary they might be impacting Sarah. As Heather drops off Rosie the next morning, Rosie begs her to at least place the talisman bracelet she'd made before under Sarah's pillow or bed, in order to help protect Sarah. Heather agrees, yet the moment Rosie leaves she chucks it out of the car window. Rosie, unawares of her action, yet feels a chill. Heather and Sarah start building a dollhouse as a memorial for David but don't tell Erica that is its purpose. Erica surprisingly finds out she is 12 weeks pregnant, after Sarah mysteriously mentions her having a baby, and is put on bed rest. She again says David told her. Erica starts getting jealous because Sarah spends a lot of time with Heather building the dollhouse, but eventually calms down when she sees how beautiful it is; she apologises to both for being so neurotic. Later, Edgar shows Erica a house he put an offer on. The strange thing is that it's an exact replica of the dollhouse. They move in, although Erica does so reluctantly as she cannot explain how the dollhouse can be an almost exact replica of the house, or how Sarah could've known. Three months later, Sarah is still acting strangely: she never has an appetite, is always tired and doesn't make any friends at the new school. Concerned, Erica takes her to the psychologist, who notices the bruises on her neck and wants to call social services, thinking Erica might be hurting her own daughter. However, Heather (a colleague) talks her out of it. When Heather mentions it to Erica, the latter freaks out and tells her sister to leave; accusing her that Heather believes Erica's baby might be David's reincarnation. Outside, as she leaves Heather sees Sarah holding a sign to the window saying \\"HE'S MAD\\". When Erica asks Sarah if she knows how she got the bruises or what is wrong, Sarah shows Erica the toy figure on her shelf that had belonged to David (it had fallen on the street, which was why he ran back and got struck by the car that killed him). Erica, surprised to find it there, throws it in the bin to which Sarah says \\"You shouldn't have done that!\\". Erica looks up 'Hanting', reading that the host's life force is drained by the Hant and the host then slips into a coma and dies. Erica rushes to the school for Sarah but finds out that Heather impersonated her and picked Sarah up earlier. Erica eventually finds Sarah and Heather with another colleague of Heather's who is a hypnotist. They are talking to Sarah, but calling her David, who is repeatedly shouting \\"I want to be born now, I want to be born NOW!\\". Sarah suddenly attacks Erica, lunge/pounce/flying at her neck, screaming \\"You are not my mother. You bitch!\\". Once they manage to pry Sarah off her, and the hypnotist calls Sarah back into her body, Heather explains that she only wanted to talk to David (& that Erica would do the same in her shoes) but Erica punches her and storms out with Sarah. Erica calls Rosie back after seeing the increasing strong bruises on Sarah's neck and now back. Rosie explains that David is hanging on to Sarah, buying time while waiting for Erica's baby to be born so that he can take its body and be reborn. They get rid of everything that belonged to David. Erica finds the dollhouse down in the basement and Rosie says that it is no wonder David has been so strong; he had been given an invite and a place/home of his own to live in, that the dollhouse was a \\"spirit-house\\". Erica burns down the dollhouse and Sarah throws the last picture she has of David into the flames, finally accepting the death of her friend. That night, Erica realises they hadn't burned everything of David's; the toy she had thrown away is still in Sarah's room. She and Edgar hurry to Sarah and find her on the top story window ledge. Sarah says that David tells her it won't hurt, then jumps off the roof crashing to the floor below. She is rushed to hospital and the doctor explains that she suffered severe head trauma and is in a coma. Erica senses her sisters distress and visits them at the hospital. She decides that they should give David what he wants in order to save Sarah. Heather injects Erica with a medication that will induce the birth of the baby. Erica gives birth to a baby girl, much to everyone's surprise. But then starts having more contractions; after an emergency C-section, Erica has a healthy second baby – a boy. At the same moment the boy starts to cry, Sarah opens her eyes, showing that David has let go of her. Heather takes the boy in her arms and looks at him lovingly. One year later, at their Halloween party, the family seems to be happy and Sarah is in good health. Erica has finally published her new book about twin studies. A red devils mask creeps up to baby boy Jack's crib – as the mask is removed, the audience sees it's Sarah. She says: \\"Hello David. Now, I'm the one in charge\\", as she smiles menacingly.

He played ninety eight games, mainly at right back, for Fulham between 1904 and 1908 and scored a total of nine goals. Fulham had appointed Harry Bradshaw as manager in 1904 and \\"Bradshaw's teams were built around a wonderful defence in which the consistent and highly regarded Fryer was supported by two Harrys at full back, Ross and Thorpe.\\" He was described in 1905 as \\"one of those players who can play equally well at right or left back.

Biography He was born in Paris in 1890 to Italian parents, Ettore Tedesco and Ida D'Ascanio. After relocating to Rome following his father's death, his mother married Adolfo Zammarano. As a young man Vittorio enrolled in the Accademia Militare di Modena on 5 November 1908, where he graduated on 17 September 1910 with the rank of 1st lieutenant. From there he went on to the 51st Infantry Regiment. After a three-month course for aviator pilots at the Specialist Battalion of the Engineer Corps he was sent to Libya with the 60th Infantry Regiment to fight in the Italo-Turkish War of 1912. Upon his return to Italy in 1913 he was promoted to lieutenant. At the end of the year he was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Battalion of Libya where he remained until January 1915, at which time he was repatriated to Italy. His newfound love for Africa was so strong that he requested to be transferred to the Royal Corps of Colonial Somali Troops and was placed at the orders of the Ministry of Colonies in March of the same year. So begins his adventurous career as explorer and big-game hunter, as well as zoologist, geographer, cartographer, hydrographer, meteorologist, anthropologist, writer, film-maker, photographer, and impromptu doctor. During his stay in the Italian colonies in Africa, he held various government posts, such as: * Commissioned officer of government troops in civil service. * Appointed envoy for missions on behalf of the Royal Italian Geographic Society. * Appointed envoy for missions on behalf of the Ministry of the Colonies. * Residing Government Officer in Somalia. * Royal Commercial Agent in Ethiopia. * Executive Officer for the Italian Political Section of the Italian-English Mission, charged with outlining the borders and defining the treaty for the relinquishment to Italy of what became known as Italian Jubaland. His most notable geographic discovery was the identification of the final course of the lower Uebi River as a tributary of the Giuba River in Somalia; and while on an expedition in Ethiopia that follows the course of the Blue Nile River to its source [making him the first European to do so] he identified and mapped all the tributaries to its upper basin. At the time he arrived in the region, only 21 species of mammals were considered native to Somalia. Following his explorations, that number grew to 87. He discovered a genus of blind fish (Uegitglanis zammaranoi), a species of chiropteran (Petalia parisii), a species of murid (Taterillus zammaranoi), a subspecies of viverra (Genetta dongolana tedescoi) and a subspecies of cercopithecus (Cercopithecus albogularis zammaranoi). In 1917 he was ordered back to Italy due to World War I, and sent to the battlefront where he fought on the Carso, and in the Battle of the Piave River. For his acts of heroism, he received two Silver Medals and two Bronze Medals for Military Valor, two Crosses of War for Military Valor, and two Distinguished Crosses of War. After a short respite following the end of the war, he returned to Africa in 1919. Tedesco Zammarano regularly donated live animals to the Rome Zoo, visiting them often and even surprising the zoo's visitors by joining the lions in their cage. He also donated many of his hunting trophies for research purposes to the Museum of Natural History in Rome and to the Civic Museum of Natural History in Milan, prompting the city of Milan to honor him with the Grand Gold Medal of Merit in April 1924. He returned permanently to Rome in November 1925 with his first son, Amedeo, born in Garbatula, Kenya, and with two domesticated cheetah cubs, named Sabatino and Pimpinella, who lived the rest of their lives with him as beloved pets and companions. In 1931 he received a Gold Medal at the International Colonial Exposition in Paris for his cartography work during his African itineraries. The rest of his life was dedicated to writing books, treatises for various government organizations, scientific and hunting articles. He also completed his second (Il Rifugio delle Pleiadi) and third (Il Sentiero delle Belve) movies on Africa, his first being Hic Sunt Leones which was released in 1922. He died in Rome on 25 August 1959.

Social-democratic politics Ehrlich became an activist in the social-democratic movement in 1904. During the 1917 Russian Revolution he was a member of the Petrograd Soviet executive committee, and a member of Soviet's delegation to England, France and Italy. Interwar Polish and Jewish communal politics In 1921 Ehrlich was named a co-editor of the Warsaw Yiddish daily Folkstsaytung. In 1924 he was elected to the Warsaw kehilla council as one of 5 Bundists out of 50 members. He was then candidate for the chairmanship of the council, as unique countercandidate to the Agudist Eliahu Kirshbraun, who was elected as well as Jacob Trokenheim, another Agudist, as vice-president. The Bund did not take part to the 1931 kehillot elections, but won 15 seats out of 50 at the 1936 elections. After the elections, Ehrlich created an incident by accusing Zionist leaders Grünbaum and Ze'ev Jabotinsky for recent antisemitic agitation in Poland by their campaign urging Jewish emigration from Poland. This time again Ehrlich was candidate to the presidency, he got 16 votes, the Zionist candidate Yitshak Schipper 10, and the Agudist Jacob Trokenheim won by a plurality of 19 votes. World War II After the outbreak of World War II, Ehrlich made his way to the part of Poland that had come under Soviet control. He was arrested by the NKVD in Brest on 4 October 1939. On 2 August 1940, in Saratov, he was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later commuted to ten years in the Gulag. After the June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was released in 1942 as part of the Sikorski–Mayski Agreement of 30 July 1941 between the Polish Government in Exile and the Soviet Union. He was asked to join the newly formed Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, headed by Solomon Mikhoels. Imprisonment and death At about the same time Ehrlich was supposed to join Gen. Sikorski (the Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile) in traveling to London where he was supposed to join the Polish government. However, on 4 December 1941, Ehrlich, together with Victor Alter were once again arrested by the NKVD in Kuybyshev. At the time of their arrest they both resided in the Polish embassy and no reason was given for their arrest. According to various sources at the time, they were charged with spying for “enemies of the Soviet Union”. The arrest of Ehrlich and Alter took place immediately after the Soviet government issued a declaration to the Polish government in exile on 1 December 1941, that Polish citizens of Belarusian or Jewish ethnicity would be treated as Soviet citizens and forbidden to enter the Polish Army (Anders Army) which was being formed at the time. The Soviet imprisonment of two prominent socialist activists and leaders of the Second International caused a wave of protests among socialist circles in the West. \\"LABOR: Carey on Communism\\", Time Magazine, Monday, 12 April 1943 Eleanor Roosevelt and Albert Einstein made direct appeals to Stalin for their release. However, Soviet authorities remained quiet throughout 1942, and only after the Soviet victory at Stalingrad announced that Ehrlich and Alter had been executed on Stalin's orders. According to some sources Ehrlich, unlike Alter, was never executed, because he managed to commit suicide by hanging himself from the bars of his prison window. Other sources state that together with Alter, he was shot in December 1942. As late as February 1943, letters from \\"Henryk Wiktor\\" (first names of Ehrlich and Alter) were being circulated in the Warsaw Ghetto.Charles Kotkowsky (2000) \\"Memoirs of A Survivor\\", Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies, originally published by Concordia University Chair in Canadian Jewish Studies. Rehabilitation On 8 February 1991, Victor Ehrlich, Henryk Ehrlich's son, was informed that according to a decree passed under Russian president Boris Yeltsin, Victor Alter, together with Ehrlich had been \\"rehabilitated\\" and the repressions against them had been declared unlawful.Lucan Way (1 March 1993) \\"Exhuming the Buried Past; in the K.G.B. Files\\", The Nation, Vol. 256. While the exact place where he was buried is unknown, a cenotaph was erected at the Jewish cemetery on Okopowa street in Warsaw on 17 April 1988. The inscription reads \\"Leaders of the Bund, Henryk Ehrlich, b. 1882, and Wiktor Alter, b. 1890. Executed in the Soviet Union\\". The establishment of the monument (as well as the publication of the full story of Alter and Ehrlich) was opposed by Poland's post-war communist government and was only made possible because of the efforts of Marek Edelman (last surviving participant of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and a Bundist) and members of the Polish Solidarity Union. The commemoration ceremony was attended by over three thousand people. Family His father-in-law was historian Simon Dubnow.

Between 1806 and 1808 she was converted to a bomb vessel. She was crushed by ice and abandoned in 1808 at the island of Anholt while acting as a lightvessel. Service Proselyte was commissioned under Captain George Hardinge in September 1804. Captain George Sayer was appointed to command her in January 1805. On 9 January 1805 he sailed her for the West Indies, escorting a convoy of 150 merchant vessels and three regiments of infantry. The convoy reached Barbados safely, having eluded the Rochefort squadron, under Rear-Admiral Allemand, who had found out about the convoy and was looking for it.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, p.351. Sayer moved to Galatea in July and Captain John Woolcombe took command, sailing her back to Portsmouth in November. When Proselyte arrived at Portsmouth she was paid off into ordinary. Between December 1806 and April 1808 the Navy converted her to a bomb vessel. She was recommissioned in February 1808 under the command of Captain Henry James Lyford and sailed to the Baltic. During the Gunboat War on 2 October 1808 the Admiralty published a notice for mariners that it had ordered her to station herself off the island of Anholt in the Kattegat to carry a light for the safety of passing convoys. (At the outbreak of the war the Danes had closed their lighthouse on Anholt.) Proselyte took up her station in early November. Loss Proselyte was caught in the ice on 5 December 1808 and was wrecked at the outer end of the Anholt reef. The ice pushed her onto her starboard beam, forcing her crew to abandon her. They then walked, with great difficulty but no losses, to Anholt Island. Proselyte's loss led the British to send a squadron in May consisting of , , and some smaller vessels to seize Anholt and restore the lighthouse.

Methodology Internet bots monitor news articles, blogs, forums, and other forms of Internet chatter. Words in the lexicon are assigned numeric values for emotional quantifiers such as duration, impact, immediacy, intensity, and others. The lexicon is dynamic, and changes according to shifts in emotional tension, and how humans communicate those changes using the Internet.

All samples were collected in Lebanon. There is no marked sexual dimorphism apart from a small size difference: males were between 30.0 and 39.0 mm long and females were 39.0 to 44.0 mm long. There are twelve regularly alternative longitudinal rows of 3 hooks each. The hooks vary in size between 95 and 210 microns. *Oncicola signoides (Meyer, 1932) *Oncicola spirula (Olferas, 1819) South American species that is common in captive primates. *Oncicola travassosi Witenberg, 1938 *Oncicola venezuelensis Marteau, 1977 This species was described by a sample infecting the intestine of the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) in Venezuela, where it gets its name. It differs from other species of the genus mainly by its longer lemnisci which have six nuclei. There is no sexual dimorphism, with males ranging in length from 13.5 to 14.4 mm (without proboscis) and 2 mm maximum width and females randing in legth from 15 to 16 mm (also without proboscis) with a maximum width of 1.9 to 2.2 mm. Cystacanths of O. venezuelensis are present in the hemocoel of Caribbean termites (Nasutitermes acajutlae) from St. Thomas and St. John islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands as an intermediate host. Cystacanths were present in Other intermediate hosts including in subcutaneous nodules of lizards (Anolis cristatellus and Anolis stratulus), in the greater omentum of small Indian mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus), and embedded in mesenteries of pearly-eyed thrashers (Margarops fuscatus). The host from the U.S Virgin Islands is yet to be determined. Pachysentis The genus Pachysentis Meyer, 1931 contains ten species.full key to species here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s11686-019-00080-6 Generally, they look identical to Oncicola apart from the number of hooks on the proboscis. Species of Oncicola have 36 or less hooks whereas species of Pachysentis have more. Specifically, the proboscis is not quite spherical and contains 42 to 102 hooks arranged into 12 longitudinal rows 3 to 12 hooks each. The rows may be regularly or irregularly alternating and straight or crooked. Hooks have tips with or without barbs, and the larger hooks with complex manubria and roots with the remaining spines being rootless. The trunk is fairly wide relative to the length with the anterior half usually wider than the posterior half. The testes are in tandem with at least one located before the middle of the worm. There are eight cement glands compactly arranged each with single giant nucleus used to temporarily close the posterior end of the female after copulation. The eggs have a sculptured outer membrane. Hosts include Brazilian or Egyptian carnivores. Species can be distinguished based on the number and arrangements of proboscis hooks, whether these hooks are barbed, the arrangement of the cement glands, host, and the length of lemnisci. *Pachysentis angolensis (Golvan, 1957) *Pachysentis canicola Meyer, 1931 *Pachysentis dollfusi (Machado-Filho, 1950) *Pachysentis ehrenbergi Meyer, 1931 *Pachysentis gethi (Machado-Filho, 1950)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmb.2016.10.010 url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid;=S1870-34532016000401356 *Pachysentis lenti (Machado-Filho, 1950) *Pachysentis procumbens Meyer, 1931 *Pachysentis procyonis (Machado-Filho, 1950) *Pachysentis rugosus (Machado- Filho, 1950) *Pachysentis septemserialis (Machado-Filho, 1950) Paraprosthenorchis Paraprosthenorchis Amin, Ha and Heckmann, 2008 have a trunk over 200 mm long, ornate proboscis with three non-barbed hooks in each of 16 rows.

Season 1=Episode 1 Thom, a reporter for the local paper is locked in a cell. He begins dictating the story into a tape recorder, stating that he has 12 hours before the sun goes down, 12 hours left to live. The remainder of the season is a flashback to the events leading up to the opening scene. A young man named Eric visits the private sex club known as The Lair. He meets Colin, the club manager. They have sex in a back room and Colin, revealing himself to be a vampire, attacks and kills Eric. Damian, the leader of the vampire group, orders Frankie, the club’s janitor and familiar (wannabe-vampire) to dispose of Eric's body. The next day, Sheriff Trout finds the body, the latest in a string of \\"John Doe murders.\\" Thom meets Frankie, who gives him a necklace Eric had worn. Fellow reporter Laura recognizes the necklace as an amulet from a book detailing myths and legends of the coast. Laura’s boyfriend, Jimmy, resents her taking time with work then with him. Later at home, Thom's jealous boyfriend Jonathan confronts him, then takes the necklace and goes to The Lair in search of Frankie. There Damian attacks Jonathan and leaves him for dead. Episode 2 Jonathan survives the attack and is taken to the hospital, catatonic. Thom and Laura research the history of the Coast further and discuss the possibility of vampires being responsible for the John Doe attacks. At the Lair, Damian works on a portrait of himself which, similar to The Picture of Dorian Gray, he says holds his curse. He and Colin agree to finish off Jonathan. Later, he mystically calls out to Eric, who rises from his table in the morgue. Episode 3 Damian introduces the newly risen vampire Eric to the rest of the Lair's \\"inner circle.\\" Thom tracks Frankie to the club seeking answers about the attack on Jonathan but a terrified Frankie refuses to help. Damien spies Thom's card and telepathically links to him, ordering him to hang himself. Laura intercedes just in time to save Thom. Meanwhile, Damian goes to Jonathan's hospital room to kill him but is interrupted by Thom and Laura. Dr. Belmont and Sheriff Trout, having discovered a stamp on Eric's hand in ultraviolet ink, are startled to discover the same stamp on Jonathan and Thom's hands. Episode 4 A shaken Damian confides in Colin that Thom is the reincarnation of Richard DeVere, the vampire who painted the portrait and who transformed Damian. Damian had driven a stake through DeVere's heart and stolen the painting, which now bore the evidence of his evil deed on its face. Meanwhile, Dr. Belmont injects Jonathan with an experimental drug which revives him, but Jonathan is stricken with amnesia. Back at The Lair, Damian mentally entrances Thom and commands him to his side. Also, Colin enlists Frankie in a plot against Damian. Damian, wavering in his belief that Thom is DeVere reincarnated, takes Thom to see the portrait, only to discover it missing. Episode 5 As Damian worries about the missing painting, the sheriff arrives at the club and momentarily spots Eric. Sheriff Trout warns Damian that he'll be watching him. At the hospital, the doctors see that Jonathan's neck wound is almost completely healed and they discharge him to Laura. Laura, sporting a black eye from her abusive boyfriend Jimmy, takes him home. Damian gathers the family together and accuses one of them of betrayal, demanding the return of the portrait. Privately, Colin sows seeds of doubt about Eric in Damian's mind. Damian takes Thom to the cell and locks him in, then kills Eric by driving a wooden spear through his heart. Eric's body is disposed of and when it's found again, a perplexed Sheriff Trout starts to work on getting a search warrant for The Lair. Back at Thom and Jonathan's place, Colin mystically entrances Laura and sets her off to kill Jonathan. Jonathan dodges the strike. As Laura pursues him, Jimmy enters looking for her and she stabs and kills Jimmy. Sheriff Trout arrives and arrests her. Episode 6 Frankie lures Damian to a store room saying the portrait is there. Colin attacks Damian and seals him behind a brick wall. Colin goes to Thom in his cell and tells him he has twelve hours to live. Sheriff Trout obtains his warrant and he, Jonathan and Deputy Rogers go to search The Lair. Thom concludes his recording and moments later his cell door mysteriously unlocks. He escapes, but not before encountering a vampire. Thom pulls off the vampire's amulet and the vampire disintegrates. Back home, Thom calls Dr. Belmont and learns of Laura's arrest. At The Lair, Sheriff Trout, Jonathan and Rogers split up. Rogers discovers several sleeping vampires, who awaken and attack him. At the jail, Laura tells Thom that Jonathan's gone to The Lair. Thom races over. Colin encounters Jonathan and moments later Trout confronts Colin. Frankie appears and opens fire on the sheriff, who returns fire. Frankie is killed and Trout is gravely wounded. Jonathan grabs a gun and fires on Colin, who, unaffected, vanishes. Thom arrives and spies Trout on the floor. As he tries to help him, Jonathan reveals himself as a vampire and attacks Thom. Season 2=Episode 1 At The Lair, a deputy questions Colin about the shootout. Colin, disappointed to learn that Sheriff Trout survived, points the finger at Frankie. Thom awakens on his floor at home with two bloody puncture wounds on his throat. He showers and then checks his answering machine, hearing a message from Jonathan telling him that they will never see each other again and urging Thom to leave the island. Laura calls Thom from jail, relieved to learn that he's alive. Colin gathers the coven and tells them that he has taken over as their leader. He orders them not to kill any more men to avoid the police investigating the club. Jonathan learns from Colin that he will be taking Frankie's place as the club's messenger and cleanup person. Elsewhere, Ian, a hitchhiker, catches a ride in a pickup. He has sex with the driver, Riley (Brandon Ruckdashel), in his motel room and later, when Riley is asleep, steals the truck, which soon breaks down. Ian staggers from the truck and falls behind it.

Frankie encourages Thom to take Damian's portrait but warns him that because Damian mixed their blood destroying the portrait may destroy Thom as well. Thom discovers Laura's body in the bar and Colin tempts him with immortality in exchange for dosing Damian with an eternal sleeping potion. Jake takes the plant to a field where he encounters the mysterious mainlander, lying in wait for Ian. Damian arrives at the Lair and retrieves the painting, hurling a spike into Colin but missing his heart. The pair struggles with Colin taking the upper hand until Thom plunges the spike through Colin's heart. Damian bites Thom. Ian enters the clearing, where the mysterious mainlander reveals that Ian killed the man's brother and his best friend. Ian mauls Jake and the plant sprays spores on the mainlander, killing him. Trout shoots Ian, who attacks him momentarily before running away. The next morning, Riley discovers the wounded Ian and takes him for help. Season 3=Episode 1 Richie, now doing Frankie's old job at the Lair, finds Colin's amulet on the floor. He sweeps up Colin's ashes and stores them under his bed. Six months later, Thom struggles as the only human in the Lair and with his role as Damian's only blood supply. Damian suggests an \\"open relationship\\" but Thom refuses. Sheriff Trout, missing Ian (who has fled the island suspected of murder), revisits old memories of another young man. He responds to a knock at his door but no one is there. Tim invites Athan, an antiquities researcher newly arrived on the island, to rent Jake's old house (left to Tim). A local picks up Athan later and, after they have sex, Athan transforms into a male gorgon and turns his trick to stone. Damian and Richie secure Damian's portrait in a storeroom. A disused phone in the room rings. Richie answers and states that it's Colin, and he is returning. Episode 2 The sheriff learns from the coroner that the \\"statue\\" has human internal structures. An online search leads him to the myth of Medusa and the gorgons but he dismisses the idea. Later, Trout remembers his young friend and hears another knock at the door but again finds no one there. Thom discovers Damian with another man and breaks off their relationship. Damian instructs Frankie to keep an eye on him. Instead, Frankie tells Thom about a new book of island lore that discusses a ring that protects the wearer from all magic. At The Lair, a man named Tad approaches Damian on behalf of the reclusive Frau von Hess, stating she has plans for the island and wants to work with Damian. Richie receives more calls from Colin and he and a vampire perform a blood ritual with his ashes. Colin is restored. Episode 3 Thom's search for the ring takes him to the local book store where he meets Harris, author of the book Frankie spoke of. Colin takes a job as a bouncer at the Harbor Lights bar. Athan is intrigued by Tim's tattoos, and later goes to The Lair, where he turns another man to stone. Sheriff Trout learns that the statue's fingerprints match the missing man's. Episode 4 Thom meets again with Harris. He learns more about the ring and the two become intimate. Colin formulates a plan to take over the Harbor Light bar. Athan sees his possession by the gorgon in a nightmare. Deputy Miller informs the sheriff that a former island resident named Marcus Stiles — who is apparently connected to the young man in Trout's memories — has been taken into custody; the sheriff hears another mysterious knock with no one there. Thom arrives home to find Richie who, distraught, puts a gun to his own head and pulls the trigger. Episode 5 Richie's gunshot wound is not fatal; Thom rushes him to the hospital, and he survives, but the doctor insists on keeping him there for extended observation. Tad returns with a detailed proposal; Damian seems interested, but also takes an interest in feeding off of Tad. Athan is accused by a Harbor Lights patron of being behind the disappearance of Charlie, the missing man. Colin intervenes, kicking out the accuser, but Athan follows him out to the cab and takes off his glasses, turning the man to stone as the cab driver takes him away. Episode 6 Harris catches Thom breaking into his house for the map leading to the location of the Ring of Erebus and head of Carter Vane. He declines to call the authorities and simply tells Thom to leave. Matty, the owner of Harbor Lights, uncovers the paper trail that highlights the money Colin is embezzling from the books, but decides it is his long-time bartender that is doing the embezzling and fires him, ridding Colin of another rival for control. Damian visits Thom, hoping for another chance with him, but Thom again rejects him. Thom then decides that night to dig up the Ring of Erebus, and finds it — and the head of Carter Vane. Episode 7 One of Colin's underlings is caught by Damian trying to steal his clientele away from the Lair. Damian has one of his own men expose him as a vampire, and later follows him to Harbor Lights, where he spies on Colin and then kills another of Colin's crowd, leaving his calling crowd so Colin knows exactly who did it. Thom takes the ring—and Carter Vane's head—home. When he gets there, he finds Harris, who confronts him, believing he broke into a local museum and stealing documents related to both, and warns him against keeping the head. Thom admits to having the ring and shows it to Harris, but denies having the head and informs him that he wasn't the one who committed the break-in. Meanwhile, Tim finds the diary of Carter Vane in Athan's room, but Athan, who actually broke into the museum, lies to Tim about it, claiming he got it on a loan from Harris. Sheriff Trout confronts the imprisoned Stiles, who denies murdering Dennis. Frankie echoes Harris' sentiments to Thom and advises him to get rid of Vane's head. Later Thom wakes up from a nightmare involving the head to find that the head has moved from where he swore it was last before he dozed off. Episode 8 Colin and Gary discover the body. Matty also sees it but Colin assures him he will handle it. The county prosecutor informs Sheriff Trout that without new evidence he will have to drop the murder charge against Stiles. Frankie advises Thom to lock Vane's head away. Athan confront Harris, demanding the head. Harris agrees to help him find it. Damian arrives at the home of Frau von Hess expecting a business meeting, only to be taken prisoner. Episode 9 Damian is tortured by Frau von Hess's henchmen but she refuses to tell him why she is holding him. Thom contemplates wishing on Vane's head to restore Damien's mortality. Later he visits Richie in the hospital. He agrees to help Richie escape but warns him he can never speak of The Lair. Colin completes his takeover of the Harbor Light from an enthralled Matty. Tim prepares a romantic dinner for Athan as an apology for suspecting him of the museum theft. They make love and Athan describes his curse. Tim is incredulous but agrees to help find the head. Extradition papers for Marcus Stiles arrive. Sheriff Trout decides to confront Stiles one last time. Before he reaches the cell, a mysterious figure murders Stiles, leaving his hanged body to be found by the Sheriff. Episode 10 The prosecutor suspends Sheriff Trout pending an investigation into Stiles's death. Thom returns to The Lair and learns Damian is missing. Returning home, he is confronted by Athan who demands Carter Vane's head. The ring protects Thom from the gorgon. Thom goes to Harris to retrieve the head. Growing impatient, Thom goes to the back of Harris's shop to find that the head has killed him. Frankie finds Damian and convinces him to accept mortality. In Damian's absence, Colin dispatches Gary to lure away the patrons of The Lair. Episode 11 Sheriff Trout is cleared of Stiles's murder and returns to duty. Thom returns home with Vane's head. Damian tries to persuade Tad to free him. Instead Tad exposes him to sunlight but Thom wishes him mortal at the same moment. Damien sets the house on fire and reunites with Thom. Tad tells Frau von Hess of Damien's escape and she dispatches him to see if Damien has discovered a cure for vampirism. Athan and Tim call upon the Oracle of Delphi to find Carter Vane's head but the Oracle rejects them. Richie leaves the hospital rather than undergo hypnosis. Colin spots Damian on television and he and Gary plot to kill Damian and Thom. Episode 12 Thom and Damian share an intimate night together before Damian returns to The Lair to hide his cursed painting, protecting it with crosses. Athan plots to obtain Carter Vane's head over Tim's objections. Later, learning from the Sheriff of the stone bodies, Tim begins to suspect Athan may be telling the truth about his curse. Colin recruits the rest of Damian's patrons to the Harbor Lights. Someone removes Damian's painting from The Lair. Episode 13 Damian and Thom make preparations to leave the island as Colin and Gary plan their deaths. Frau von Hess also plots against Damian. Sheriff Trout is attacked by the young man he once knew, now a vampire. Colin finds Richie outside Thom's home, takes the portrait and kills Richie. Colin shoots Thom and Damian hurls a sharpened cross at Colin. Colin teleports away and the cross pierces Damian's portrait. Athan and Tim arrive. Athan offers to save Thom's life in exchange for Carter Vane's head. Damian agrees and Athan uses his blood to heal Thom's wounds. Athan and Tim depart with the head and Thom's wish is reversed. Thom is healed but Damian is bleeding from a wound corresponding to the damage to the portrait. And Damian is blood-linked to Thom, Colin and all the other vampires sired. So the story behind the portrait was true.

History The temple was built in 1980 by late Mr. N Ragunatha Menon, a prominent and pious person who lived in the town of Kalamassery. For a large period of time the temple existed as a basic concrete structure and housed the shrines of Ganapathy, Subramanian and Navagrahas only. In the year 2000 Menon embarked on a project to build additional shrines for other Gods and Goddesses and also renovate the temple with traditional architecture. Menon died the following year, after which the management of the temple passed onto the hands of his children. The children continued further renovation of the temple, and also set up the Mahaganapathy Temple Trust which would manage the temple. At present the temple is a very popular center of worship for people living in and around Kalamassery, and several festivals and events are conducted throughout the year. Temple structure The temple has a simple construction with the original shrines of Ganapathy and Subramanian (along with the Navagrahas) housed inside two concrete structures located side by side facing west. Between these two structures is located the stairs leading to the more recent elevated structure which houses the shrines of several other Gods and Goddesses. These new shrines were added in the year 2000 and include those for Shiva, Parvathi, Rama, Dakshinamurthi and Chandikeshwara. The entire building covers an area of just around , and there are no outer walls. There is a Peepal tree in front of the Ganapathy shrine. The temple complex includes a ground behind the building. The busy Eloor-Kalamassery road runs just in front of the temple. The space from the temple's front and the road is so short (around 30 feet) that it has earned the deity the dubious nickname of 'Road-side Ganapathy'. Kerala-History Events The devotees refer to elephants as Lord Ganesh's incarnation. It has been the regular annual practice at the Mahaganapathy temple for the last 20 years to conduct a large-scale Ashta Dravya Maha Ganapathy Havana and Aanayoottu on the first day of the Karkkidakom month of the malayalam calendar. Gajapooja also is conducted once every four years.http://www.kottayamtemples.com/vadakkunnatha.php See also * Temples of Kerala ReferencesExternal links * Satellite image of Kalamassery Mahaganapathy temple (Full screen) Category:Hindu temples in Ernakulam district Category:Ganesha temples Category:Tourist attractions in Ernakulam district ","title":"Kalamassery Mahaganapathy Temple"},{"id":"24482768","text":"Epaphrodita is the type genus of praying mantids in the family Epaphroditidae; it had placed previously in the Hymenopodidae.Catalogue of Life: 2009 Annual Checklist Species *Epaphrodita lobivertex *Epaphrodita musarum *Epaphrodita undulata See also *List of mantis genera and species References Category:Mantodea genera Category:Epaphroditidae ","title":"Epaphrodita"},{"id":"24482777","text":"Bulhac may refer to several places in Moldova: *Bulhac, a village in Șumna Commune, Rîșcani District *Bulhac, a village in Cioropcani Commune, Ungheni District ","title":"Bulhac"},{"id":"24482791","text":"Alexăndrești is a commune in Rîșcani District, Moldova.

The genus is common in arctic-alpine environments, but also occurs throughout temperate, subtropical, and even tropical regions. They are commonly known as the map lichens because of the prothallus forming border-like bands between colonies in some species, like the common map lichen (Rhizocarpon geographicum). Taxonomy and phylogeny Together with three small genera (Catolechia, Poeltinula and Epilichen), Rhizocarpon constitutes the family Rhizocarpaceae . Historically, ca 389 names have been used. However, many species concepts are ill defined, many names have been synonymized and new species are regularly being described , so true number of species is not entirely clear as of now, but is estimated to be around 200 Rhizocarpon dinothetes new to Scandinavia, R. Haugan, \\"Graphis Scripta\\" Volym 3 (1) 1990. In molecular work, the genus has also been shown to be paraphyletic, with closely related genera being nested within Rhizocarpon . Common traits With so many species in a morphologically diverse genus it is difficult to say something general about morphology and anatomy and there will inevitably be some exceptions. However, they do share some key traits. They are all crustose and mostly saxicolous (rock-living), with some being lichenicolous (lichen parasites) on other saxicolous lichens. They are all lecideoid, meaning they have apothecia without a thallus margin containing algae. Ascus and ascospores The genus has a distinct type of ascus, the Rhizocarpon-type , which is bitunicate with the inner ascus-wall being slightly apically thickened. Ascospores are considered important characters for determining species within the genus. They are either 2-celled (1-septate) or multi-celled (muriform) and are either hyaline or pigmented (green or brown), often with a characteristic halo (or “perispore”) visible when viewed in a microscope. Asci contain eight, two or rarely one spore .

He became evangelist in Lausanne and, after two dreams with alleged divine origin, decided to found a hierarchic and patriarchal community in Essertines-sur-Yverdon to help poor people, drug addicts, and convert them. Life in the community was devoted to prayer and work. Followers had to sell 30 books per day. They had some commercial production activities in Ticino canton.

He played the role of Loge in Richard Wagner's Das Rheingold at Munich Court Opera on September 22, 1869, with his wife, Therese Vogl, playing the role of Wellgunde. He also played the role of Siegmund in Wagner's Die Walküre, also at Munich, on June 26, 1870. Therese Vogl played the role of Siegmund's sister and lover Sieglinde in the same performance. His Munich debut was as Max in Weber's Der Freischütz. He sang at Bayreuth, Berlin, London and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. At Bayreuth, he played the role of Loge in the first complete Ring cycle on August 13, 1876. His performance in the role caused fellow singer Lilli Lehmann to comment that he was born for the part and that his Loge had never been equalled. His debut at the Metropolitan Opera was in the title role of Lohengrin on January 1, 1890, and he also sang Loge, Siegmund, the title role of Tannhäuser, Tristan in Tristan und Isolde, and Siegfried in both Siegfried and Götterdämmerung at the Met. Heinrich Vogl was also the first performer to play the roles of Loge and Siegfried in London, which he did in the first Ring cycle in London at Her Majesty's Theatre, with Anton Seidl conducting and his wife playing the role of Brünnhilde. His Wagner repertoire included all the leading tenor roles except Walther in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, for which Wagner rejected him for the 1868 premiere on the grounds that, at the age of 23, Vogl was \\"totally incompetent\\". He and his wife Therese were among the first performers to sing the lead roles in Tristan und Isolde, and were highly regarded in these roles. His non-Wagner roles included the title role in Verdi's Otello, Canio in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Aeneas in Berlioz's Les Troyens and the title role of Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini. He was known for his vocal power and stamina, which allowed him to perform Loge, Siegmund and both Siegfrieds from Wagner's Ring cycle on consecutive evenings multiple times. Heinrich Vogl is buried beside his wife in Tutzing, Bavaria.

It is situated in the municipality of Sobrado, about 9 km east of Corredoiras and about 46 km southeast of Betanzos, at an altitude of 540 m above sea level. History The abbey was founded in 952 by Count Hermenegildo Alóitez and his wife Paterna. In 958, the founders transferred the county of Présaras to the monastery and, in that same year, Hermenegildo retired there where he lived as a monk the rest of his life and where he was buried. The abbey was inherited by his descendants and nearly two centuries later, in January 1142, the brothers Fernando and Bermudo Pérez, two of the most distinguished members of the House of Traba, handed it over to the Cistercian monks from Clairvaux. The abbey flourished during the 12th and 13th centuries and was able to undertake the foundations of its own daughter house, Valdedios Abbey in Asturias. Sobrado was also given the supervision of Monfero Abbey after it joined the Cistercian Order. After a period of decline, in 1498 Sobrado was the first abbey in Galicia to join the Castilian Cistercian Congregation. The monumental new Baroque abbey church was dedicated in 1708. Most of the conventual buildings were also rebuilt at this time. The dissolution of the monasteries enforced by the government of Mendizábal in 1835 put an end to the abbey, and the abandoned buildings fell into decay. In 1954 the Cistercian (Trappist) monks of Viaceli Abbey in Cóbreces, west of Santander, began reconstruction, having already refounded and restored Huerta Abbey in 1929, and were able to resettle the monastery with a new community in 1966.  Buildings  Sobrado Abbey monastic buildings The present abbey church, now roofed with a number of domes and cupolas, was built at the end of the 17th century, although the Magdalene Chapel (Capela da Madalena or Capilla de la Magdalena) dates from the 14th century. The sacristy was built by Juan de Herrera. The monastery has three cloisters. The kitchen and the chapter house remain of the medieval monastic buildings.

He is best known as a supporting member on The Super Hero Squad Show and a member of Avengers Academy in the comics. Publication history Reptil first appeared in Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1 and was created by Christos Gage and Steve Uy. Reptil appeared as a regular character in Avengers Academy from issue #1 (Aug 2010) through its final issue #39 (Jan 2013). Reptil appeared in Avengers Arena, a new series by Dennis Hopeless and Kev Walker. Fictional character biography Humberto Lopez is a young boy who had registered with the Fifty State Initiative and was living with his grandfather. When S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist Valerie Cooper was putting together a squad to go after Stegron in his plot to reanimate dinosaur fossils, Tigra was placed in charge of the squad and was told to recruit Humberto to help them. Tigra was worried since Humberto hadn't gone through training yet. When going after Stegron, Humberto explained about his parents and how he got his powers. His parents were paleontologists who dug up a crystallized bone when he was with them in the desert. The medallion had a strange energy in it that had to do with dinosaurs. Under the codename Reptil, Humberto used it to obtain the abilities of any dinosaur by thinking of it and even had an empathy to sense dinosaurs and other reptiles. Upon arrival in Camp Hammond, Reptil went through training for a couple of days. While going through training with different members of the Initiative, Reptil learns the good and bad sides of the Initiative. Tigra tells Reptil that being a hero is a responsibility. Reptil tells her that his parents disappeared a year ago on a dig and that he wants to become a hero to find them. With the help of Baron Von Blitzschlag attaching a device to increase Humbertos's dinosaur empathy, the team locates Stegron. When discovering that Stegron and his dinosaur herd are going to attack a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in South Dakota, Tigra's group intercepts them. However, Stegron took control of Komodo's mind and told her to attack her teammates. Reptil acts hot-headed during the fight and attacks Stegron, but is beaten down. Stegron and his dinosaur herd escape. Reptil suffers a mild concussion and Dr. Cooper tells him that his rash behavior allowed Stegron to escape and he endangered the lives of his teammates. Tigra speaks to Dr. Cooper in private and asks her to give Humberto one more chance to go out on the field. Valerie tells Tigra that if Reptil messes up, then his career with the Initiative would be over. Tigra speaks to Humberto a few days later and reminds him to stay balanced and not to over-commit. She tells him that everyone has problems and that he is lucky enough to be in a position to learn from other's mistakes and his own. When it comes to a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in Wyoming, Stegron's dinosaurs are taken down by a combination of good teamwork and Reptil's abilities. It turns out that Stegron was attacking various S.H.I.E.L.D. bases to locate Moon-Boy (who had been captured from the Savage Land). Stegron was only targeting Moon-Boy so that he can gain control of Devil Dinosaur. Reptil tells Tigra that Moon-Boy is innocent and doesn't deserve this. Tigra tells Reptil there is something they can do but he has to make a tough choice. Tigra tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist and agents that Moon-Boy was eaten by one of the dinosaurs and Reptil was sent home because he just got in the way and was completely useless. What they don't know is that Reptil managed to fly out with Moonboy and take him back to his home to Nevada. Tigra meets Humberto there and they are soon greeted by Ka-Zar and his pet smilodon Zabu. Ka-Zar thanks Tigra and Reptil for bringing Moon-Boy back to him safely and invites Reptil to take Moon-Boy back to the Savage Land. After Moon-Boy is reunited with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents.Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil (May, 2009) Heroic Age Soon after this as part of the Heroic Age event, Reptil is captured and taken to the US and imprisoned in a government facility. Under the orders of Norman Osborn, experiments are performed on Reptil in an attempt to see if enough stress could turn his whole body into a dinosaur until the word of Norman Osborn's fall. As the agents of the H.A.M.M.E.R. began destroying all the evidence about Norman's clandestine and illegal projects, Reptil manages to escape as the agents were ready to murder him. As Reptil escapes the facility he is approached by Justice and Hank Pym who invite him to become part of the Avengers Academy.Enter the Heroic Age #1 (May 2010) Along with the other students, all of them having been somehow affected by Norman Osborn, Reptil is told that they are the most promising of the heroes Osborn sought out. During their first training session, the students notice the staff arguing about them. By accessing secret computer files, the students realize that, rather than because they showed promise, they have been chosen for the academy because the staff believes they have the greatest potential to go rogue and become supervillains.Avengers Academy #1 (June 2010) During a battle, Mentallo takes control of Reptil's mind and forces him to fly headfirst towards the ground. The threat of imminent death allows Reptil to fully transform into a dinosaur. This saves Reptil's life because Mentallo can't control the dinosaur's reptilian mind. However Reptil can not control himself in this form either. His teachers think that his tendency to repress his troubles instead of dealing with them is the reason for his lack of control. They want him to accept help, but he is reluctant to talk to staff of the academy. Since the best superhuman therapist Doc Samson is gone, they ask Jessica Jones to talk to him. He opens up to her and they talk about many of the things that have been troubling him including his parents, but he keeps his concerns about his fellow students and the academy itself private.Avengers Academy #6 (November 2010) When Korvac returns, Reptil and his fellow studies are placed into future versions of their bodies to fight him by Korvac's estranged lover, Carina.

His future self attempts to help Hybrid take over the school in order to ensure a future timeline will exist where he and Finesse have a child.Avengers Academy #25 However, his future self cannot cope with the guilt of killing fellow students, so he contacts Veil and Jocasta, who are able to defeat Hybrid. It is hinted that this particular timeline might still have been saved.Avengers Academy #26 Avengers Vs. X-Men Reptil and the students initially don't take kindly to the junior X-Men, but eventually come to understand the difficult situation that the mutants were forced into by adult superheroes, not unlike their present situation.

Reptil is finally feeling well enough to walk and shape-shift. Hazmat initially tells him not to expend the energy and that they will leave no one behind. Just then, Hazmat activates a cloud of smoke, engulfing the three. When the smoke dissipates, it's revealed that the smoke is trigger scent and X-23 goes feral, attempting to kill Hazmat and Reptil.

Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Reptil wears a crystallized bone medallion that allows him to take on the abilities of different dinosaurs just by thinking about them. He initially cannot fully transform into a complete dinosaur but can shape-shift various parts of his body into different dinosaur appendages like a tail to strike enemies, changing his arms into pterodactyl wings, or having claws like a Velociraptor. However, after briefly possessing the body of his future self in a fight against Korvac, he retains the ability to fully transform. He possesses the strength and ability of whatever dinosaur he is using and his skin always turns red (lime green in Marvel Super Hero Adventures) and scaly whenever he uses his abilities. Reptil also has some empathy abilities with dinosaurs. He can sense other reptiles, but he cannot control them or influence their behavior at this time. His amulet is magical in nature and recently embedded itself into his chest. Not much is known about it except that it is not actually the source of his powers, but only the catalyst that allows him to use them. In other media=Television * Reptil first appears in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"To Err is Superhuman\\", voiced by Antony Del Rio as a child and by Carlos Alazraqui as an adult. Captain America brings him onto the team as its latest member. He does have some doubts after nearly being taken down by Abomination and the Wrecking Crew, but manages to overcome them to rescue Wolverine. In \\"A Brat Walks Among Us\\", he impresses Brynnie Bratton by changing his head into a T-rex's and back multiple times. He also does a play by play for the heroes and villains' struggles to claim Brynnie until Reptil claims her from Whirlwind. In \\"Night in the Sanctorum\\", it is revealed that he lives with his parents and his room is decorated with pictures of every superhero (except for Falcon). In \\"This Forest Green\\", he is talented at making a quesadilla dish called the Reptilla Quesadilla Supremos which he shows to Ms. Marvel. In \\"Tales of Suspense\\" Reptil plays golf with Wolverine against MODOK and Abomination. In \\"Mysterious Mayhem at Mutant Academy,\\" Reptil accompanies Wolverine to Xavier Academy to meet the X-Men. At the same time, Ringmaster infiltrates the school and hypnotizes the X-Men into helping him find the Infinity Fractal. Reptil managed to break the hypnosis on the X-Men. Wolverine and Reptil don't know it yet, but Ringmaster's dowsing rod was later pointing toward Reptil's medallion meaning that his medallion could be a Fractal. This is confirmed in \\"This Al Dente Earth\\" where it turned out that Reptil's medallion was actually an Infinity Fractal sent through time. Reptil gives it up so that the Infinity Sword can be reforged. At the end of the episode, Reptil claims that he couldn't be a hero anymore until saying \\"Brachiosaurus tail\\" turned him into a full Brachiosaurus as Iron Man stated that Reptil's prolonged exposure to the Infinity Fractal caused Reptil to retain his powers.

The film stars William Gargan, Claire Dodd and Douglas Fowley.Wynne 1987, p. 174. Filmed with the cooperation of the U.S. Navy, it was a mild recruiting film in an era when the United States military was gearing up for a future war. Plot U.S. navy pilot Tex Jones (Addison Randall) is stationed on an aircraft carrier and learns that he is a father. He shares the news with his best pals and fellow pilots, \\"Red\\" Furness (William Gargan), Steve Bassett (Douglas Fowley) and Bill Lyons (William Newell). On reaching Naval Base San Diego, the squadron's home port, Tex learns his wife Mary had died. While overwhelmed with grief, Tex wants to look after his son as a navy child, but Mary's sister, Bernice Farrington (Claire Dodd) is intent on taking the baby away. Tex asks Red to take care of \\"The Admiral\\", the name he and Red have tagged the boy, but, when he is driving to the hospital to say goodbye to his wife, he is in a serious car accident. With his dying breath, Tex pledges to his friend Red as the baby's guardian. While Red has cleverly hidden the baby in his bachelor quarters, Bernice, her mother (Claudia Coleman) and their attorney, Mr. Strickland (Douglas Wood), visit Red's commanding officer, Admiral Kingston (George Irving), and persuade him to take them to Red's quarters. Alerted by Kingston, Red hides the evidence of the baby being there and Bill rushes out to find Aunt Minnie (Georgia Caine). While Steve passes the baby through the window to Aunt Minnie, Bernice senses she is out-maneuvered, but is undeterred. Even though she is a pilot, Bernice asks Red for flying lessons, and tries to use the flight as a means of getting information as to her nephew's whereabouts. She also elicits her friend, Daphne Roth (Dorothy Tree) to also see Steve, and try to pump him for the baby's location. Red and Bernice fight over the controls on her flight, and Red has to resort to knocking her out. Meanwhile, Daphne has come through, but Bernice learns why Red is so determined to raise Tex's son as a navy man, and now regrets her machinations. When the Farringtons recover the baby, an angry Red refuses to listen to Bernice's apologies. A week later, as Red is about to ship out, he decides to see the little boy one last time but discovers the baby is in the hospital.

Red takes off in a Navy aircraft in pursuit, and even though Admiral Kingston has to consider him AWOL, he orders six fighter aircraft to follow Red. When he catches up with Vezie, Red persuades the gangster that he has the wrong baby. Coming back to base, everyone assembles in Admiral Kingston's office, where he agrees to not punish Red.

Life Therese Vogl (1877) Vogl was born Therese Thoma in Tutzing, Bavaria, where she also spent the last years of her life. In 1868, she married the leading dramatic tenor Heinrich Vogl and they henceforth appeared on stage together on many occasions. She died in Munich in 1921, having outlived her husband by more than 20 years. They are buried together in Tutzing. Career Vogl studied at the Munich Conservatoire and made her operatic debut at the Karlsruhe Hoftheater in 1865. Her operatic debut at Munich came the following year, in the role of Casilda in a performance of Daniel Auber's La part du diable. She played the role of Sieglinde in Richard Wagner's Die Walküre at the Munich Court Opera on 26 June 1870, with husband Heinrich playing the role of Siegmund opposite her. She also undertook the role of Wellgunde in Wagner's Das Rheingold at Munich on 22 September 1869 – a performance in which her husband played the role of Loge. She sang Munich's first Siegfried Brünnhilde on 10 June 1878, while her husband took the title role. Therese and Heinrich Vogl were among the first performers to play the title parts in Tristan und Isolde, being highly regarded in those roles. She was also the first performer to play the role of Brünnhilde in the UK – at a performance of Ring cycle staged at London's Her Majesty's Theatre, with Anton Seidl conducting and her spouse singing Loge and Siegfried. On the basis of these \\"Ring\\" performances in London, the influential critic Herman Klein described her voice as being a light dramatic soprano, similar to Christine Nilsson's, with a very clear head register and elegant phrasing and diction. Klein also described her final scene as Brünnhilde in Götterdämmerung as \\"thrilling\\". According to Klein, she was one of the finest artists among the early crop of Wagnerian dramatic sopranos but her and her husband's opportunities to appear at the Bayreuth Festival dried up after they quarreled with the Wagner family. She retired from the operatic stage in 1892 as her voice had begun showing signs of deterioration. Her final performance was as Isolde, in Munich.

Life He was born at Mayfield, Sussex, eldest son of Thomas Jenner of that place, and Dorothy, his wife, daughter of Jeffrey Glyde of Dallington. He was educated at Tunbridge grammar school, under Nicholas Grey. In 1665 he became a pensioner of Queens' College, Cambridge, but left without taking a degree. He entered the Inner Temple in 1658, and was called to the bar in 1663, after which he practised chiefly in the court of exchequer. In 1683 Charles II, having withdrawn the charter of the City of London, appointed a Lord Mayor, two sheriffs, and a recorder, who was Jenner. A few days earlier Jenner was knighted, and received an augmentation of arms. In the following January he was made king's sergeant. As king's sergeant and as recorder he took part in the state trials of the next two years, including those of Algernon Sidney and Henry Cornish. In the parliament of 1685 he represented the borough of Rye, until in 1686 be was raised to the bench as a Baron of the Exchequer. With the majority of the judges, Jenner gave judgment in favour of the king's claim to the dispensing power which was raised in the case of Sir Edward Hales. In October 1687 Jenner was appointed one of the three royal commissioners to inquire into the appointment of a president of Magdalen College, Oxford; the other commissioners were Robert Wright and Thomas Cartwright. Jenner's diary of the proceedings survived in the library of Magdalen College. Cartwright sought to have him dismissed from the commission, finding him too moderate if outwardly overbearing to the fellows, and in the end Jenner voted against the expulsions. In July 1688 he was promoted to the common pleas. But the Glorious Revolution soon involved him. On the night of James II's flight Jenner was one of those who endeavoured to escape to France with the king. The king's general pardon to him and money were stolen at this point stolen from his chambers in Serjeants' Inn; and he was captured at Faversham and brought to Canterbury. Early in January 1689 he and others prisoners were committed to the Tower of London, charged with subverting the Protestant religion and the laws and liberties of the kingdom. They were admitted to bail, but the Convention parliament voted that Jenner was principally concerned in the arbitrary proceedings under James, and he was committed to the custody of the sergeant- at-arms. He was released when parliament was prorogued in January 1690. In 1691, when the Act of Indemnity was passed, Jenner was excepted from its provisions, but no proceedings were then taken against him. In November 1691 one of his sons was given into the custody of a messenger of parliament for circulating libels against the right of William and Mary to the crown. Jenner was then charged with having levied fines in James's reign to the amount of £3,000 on dissenters without returning the money into court. Jenner pleaded the general pardon from the king, which had been stolen; special mention was said to be made there of those fines, which had supposedly gone direct to the king. The plea was allowed, and the prosecution failed. Expelled from the bench by William III's government, Jenner resumed his practice at the bar. He died at his house at Petersham on 1 January 1707, and was buried in St Peters Church, Petersham, with a tablet to his memory, with his arms, and an inscription composed by his daughter Margaret, Lady Darnell. Family On 1 January 1661 he married, at the church of St. Mary Woolchurch Haw, in the city of London, Anne, daughter and heiress of James Poe of Swinden Hall, Kirkby Overblow, Yorkshire, by whom he had eight sons and two daughters.

The title means \\"first asēkrētis\\", illustrating his position as the head of the order of the asēkrētis, the senior class of imperial notaries. The post evolved gradually. The first asēkrētis are attested from the 6th century, and several Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople and one emperor, Anastasios II (r. 713–715), were drawn from their ranks.. Aside from possibly anachronistic references to Maximus the Confessor being a prōtasēkrētis under Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641), the earliest confirmed occurrence (as proto a secreta) comes from the Liber Pontificalis for the year 756.. As head of the imperial chancery (the effective successor of the late Roman primicerius notariorum), the position was highly influential: in the 899 Klētorologion of Philotheos, a list of precedence of Byzantine imperial officials, he is placed seventh among the sekretikoi, the financial ministers of the state. From documents and sigillographic evidence, the prōtasēkrētai held the dignities of prōtospatharios, patrikios and anthypatos.. Among others, the Patriarch Photios (858–867 and 877–886) held the post. His subordinates included not only the asēkrētis, but also the inferior class of the imperial notarioi, under their head, the prōtonotarios, as well as the official known as dekanos, placed \\"in charge of the imperial papers\\" according to the De Ceremoniis of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (r. 913–959). The prōtasēkrētis seems also to have been in charge of preparing the imperial chrysobulls. After 1106, however, he was moved from the chancery and assumed judicial duties, heading one of the highest courts of the Byzantine Empire, along with the eparchos, the megas droungarios tēs viglas, the dikaiodotēs, the koiaistōr, the epi tōn kriseōn, and the katholikos, who headed the court for fiscal affairs (dēmosiaka pragmata).. Although the class of the asēkrētis is not attested after the 12th century, the post of prōtasēkrētis survived into the Palaiologan period.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=138274 on 2011-01-02 Description Adults in the Olivella species are usually quite small, hence the genus has the common name \\"dwarf olive\\". Species of Oliva are usually larger, but there are exceptions. The shell of Olivella usually has a keel- like twist at the anterior end of the columella. The wall above it may be concave or have deep furrows. The inner lip can sometimes show a deep callus, and in many cases this extends over the parietal wall to the end of the aperture. This callus formation may extend to the spire but leave the suture open.

It was the first film produced by the King Brothers, launching their career. The film was re-released by Eagle Lion as Gangs, Inc. giving top billing to Alan Ladd, who has a supporting role.  Plot summary  A young girl, Rita Adams, asks her former gangster father why people call him a snitch. He is then gunned down in front of her. She is sent to an orphanage, where her best friends are Mickey Roma and Bob Elliott. Rita grows up be a struggling single girl who lives with best friend, singer Donna, and who has with a drunken boyfriend, Harold De Witt, the son of a rich, powerful man, Clarence. Rita loses her job in a factory when she cannot get bonded. Bob, who is now an aerospace engineer, offers to try to get her work. When Harold drives Rita home on night, he kills a pedestrian in a hit and run while Rita is in the car. Acting on the advice of his father's lawyer, Bruce King, he gets Rita to claim responsibility for the accident, saying that he will be disinherited otherwise and that she will only get probation. She gets sentenced to one to five years in prison. Rita gets out of prison and her friend from the orphanage, Mickey, who now works in organised crime, explains how Harold betrayed her. Rita takes to crime, robbing gullible men. Clarence De Witt wants the police to crack down on organised crime and leads a reform ticket. Jimmy Kelly is a policeman undercover in the gang as Bill Dugan. Kelly/Dugan collects protection money for racketeer Kurt Parrish, who complains that receipts are down because of DeWitt's reform efforts. Mickey, meanwhile, asks Rita to return the letters in Harold's file which prove his guilt, but she has her own plan for revenge and buys radio time to speak out against DeWitt's hypocrisy. This wins her a meeting with Parrish and mobster Lou Wood, and after Rita negotiates a place for herself in the syndicate, she then visits DeWitt with photocopies of the letters. Spurning DeWitt's offer of money, Rita forces him to use his political influence for the syndicate's benefit, prompting Jimmy to observe that Parrish is using votes, or \\"paper bullets\\", to take control. When Mickey learns that the real Dugan is in prison, Jimmy is abducted by Parrish's men, and the ensuing pursuit by the police ends in an accident. Joe persuades the newspapers to print the false information that Jimmy was killed in the crash, which devastates Donna, who has fallen in love with him. Rita then quits the syndicate to marry Bob, but immediately after the wedding she is arrested and indicted along with Parrish, Wood and DeWitt. During the trial, the courtroom spectators are shocked when Jimmy takes the stand, and all four defendants are convicted. As Bob comforts Rita and promises to wait for her, children play at the playground she built as a monument to the innocence of youth.

They needed films for the machines and had a bad experience sourcing films from Cecil B. De Mille which prompted them to get into film production. They had a story written by Martin Mooney about two orphans who grow up into a life of crime. They formed KB Productions and made a verbal deal with Producers Releasing Corporation where they got $19,500 and 50% of the profits. The film was shut at Talisman Studios. It had its production budget doubled. The Kozinsky Brothers knew Jack LaRue from the racetrack (they owned some horses) and liked his performance in A Farewell to Arms; he was cast in the lead. They spoke with Rochelle Hudson about the female lead but did not like it when she arrived at a meeting with her husband and two agents as \\"it reminded them of De Mille\\". They ended up casting the more easy-going Joan Woodbury. The film took six days to shoot. When it was done Monogram offered the brothers $50,000 plus 50% of the profits to have it, as there was only a verbal agreement with PRC. However the Kozinskys went with PRC because \\"our word is as good as our bond.\\"  Soundtrack  * \\"I Know, I Know\\" (by Vic Knight, Johnny Lange and Lew Porter) – sung by Linda Ware * \\"Blue Is the Day\\" (by Maurice Kozinsky, Johnny Lange and Lew Porter) – sung by Linda Ware Reception The movie was highly regarded and was the first film distributed by the Producers Releasing Corporation into the Loew's Circuit. It launched their careers as film producers. Jimmy Fidler wrote that the film \\"proves a buck's worth of entertainment can be made for a dime – by a guy who knows how.\\" Distribution rights later transferred to Eagle Lion who re- released the film as Gangs Inc. The King brothers sued Eagle for breach of contract asking for revenue.

It consists of 78 communes situated in the Dordogne and Haute Vienne départements. The park has a surface area of 1800 square kilometers and is inhabited by 49 661 people.  Geography  The source of the Dronne in the granitic massif of Nexon-Les Cars, eastern highlands The park comprises 5 cantons in the Dordogne: * Bussière-Badil * Jumilhac-le-Grand * Mareuil * Nontron * Saint-Pardoux-la-Rivière and 5 cantons in the Haute-Vienne: * Châlus * Oradour-sur-Vayres * Rochechouart * Saint- Laurent-sur-Gorre * Saint-Mathieu Associated with the 78 founding communes are six other communes, that serve as access points to the park: * Aixe-sur-Vienne * Brantôme * Nexon * Saint-Junien * Saint-Yrieix-la-Perche * Thiviers The two artificial lakes Lac de Lavaud and Lac de Mas Chaban belong to the Charente département, but they are also associated with the park. The park administration is housed in an ancient smithy in the hamlet of La Barde (commune of La Coquille), whereas the visitor center is established in Pageas.  Landscapes  Elevations in the park start at 85 meters along the Nizonne river near La Rochebeaucourt-et-Argentine and reach 556 meters near Courbefy southeast of Bussière-Galant. Due to these differences in elevation the park possesses several different natural habitats like moors near Champagnac-la- Rivière, bocage, meadows near water courses and forests consisting of chestnut and oak. South of Mareuil one encounters heathland and dry grassland. There are also many little pools and lakes. Many brooks and smaller rivers like for example the Arthonnet, the Bandiat, the Charente, the Côle, the Dronne, the Gorre, the Grêne, the Nizonne and the Tardoire drain the parkland. Of all these water courses the Isle is the only river that has its source outside the park's perimeter. The water courses belong to one of the three drainage basins: * the Dordogne in the south of the park * the Vienne in the north and * the Charente in the northwest.  Climate  The climate in the park is temperate, but can show quite pronounced local variations. In the northeast the climate is generally continental, whereas in the southwest it is maritime. Certain protected south-facing slopes can even possess a submediterranean climate. The following climatic diagram shows data averaged over the last five years (2004–2008) from a private weather station (354 meters above sea level) near Milhaguet in the Haute Vienne.Website of Philip Eden with climatic data from Milhaguet Temperature distribution in °C: Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.8) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.3) id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1) id:barra value:rgb(0.6,0.8,0.9) ImageSize = width:600 height:280 PlotArea = left:40 bottom:40 top:20 right:20 DateFormat = x.y Period = from:0 till:20 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify ScaleMajor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:10 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:5 start:0 BackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo BarData= bar:Jan text:January bar:Feb text:February bar:Mar text:March bar:Apr text:April bar:May text:May bar:Jun text:June bar:Jul text:July bar:Aug text:August bar:Sep text:Sept. bar:Oct text:Oct. bar:Nov text:Nov. bar:Dec text:Dec.

The last years have been exceptionally wet.  Geology  Shatter cone from the Rochechouart crater Geologically the park belongs to two very different terranes: the major part northeast of a line Varaignes - Nontron - Saint-Pardoux-la-Rivière - Thiviers consists of Variscan basement rocks of the northwestern Massif Central. The much smaller southwestern part is made up of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks belonging to the Aquitanian Basin. The boundary between the two terrains is outlined by important faults in most places. The downthrown sedimentary block has in general much lower elevations. The basement block has been uplifted fairly recently as shown by the rejuvenation of streams. The basement rocks are mainly gneisses, mica schists and granitoids with occasional outcrops of amphibolites and serpentinites. The sedimentary succession of the Aquitanian Basin starts with a transgression in the Lower Jurassic (Lias) over the basement rocks (usually a conglomerate at the base, followed by arkoses, dolomites and shales). During the Dogger a calcareous reef built from ooids developed. During the Malm dense, micritic limestones were deposited. Afterwards the sea retreated to come back again at the onset of the Cenomanian (Upper Cretaceous). A very warm epicontinental sea chalky sediments were laid down right up to the Maastrichtian. At the end of the Cretaceous the sea finally retreated and the sediments of the Aquitanian Basin started to become continental within the area of the park. During the Alpine and the Pyrenean orogeny (Eocene and Oligocene) the basement of the Massif Central was uplifted and rejuvenated. As a consequence massive alluvial deposits (mainly conglomerates and sandstones) were built out as long tongues onto the lowlands, some reaching almost 50 kilometers in length. Due to the various ice ages, erosion has again increased since the Pleistocene − a good example for this being the Dronne. Since the start of the Pleistocene the river has lowered its bed downstream of Brantôme by almost 100 meters. A geological specialty of the park is the Rochechouart crater, the remnants of a meteorite impact at the end of the Upper Triassic (roughly 200 million years ago). The impact created a crater with a diameter of 21 kilometers and destroyed every form of life within a radius of several hundred kilometers. There is no trace of the original crater left, the only indicators for its existence are ejecta blankets (breccias and suevites), shatter cones and thrust faults.  Minerals in the park  Massive galena coating - quartz vein from the fine-grained hornblende-bearing Piégut-Pluviers Granodiorites Mine du Cantonnier, southeast of Nontron. Wulfenite Besides the common minerals quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, biotite, muscovite as well as calcite, dolomite and gypsum rarer minerals occur, for example actinolite, allanite, andalusite, antigorite, apatite, arsenopyrite, baryte, cassiterite, chalcedony, chalcopyrite, chlorite, chromite, clinopyroxene, chrysotile, cordierite, cyanite, epidote, galena, garnet, goethite, graphite, hematite, hornblende, ilmenite, kaolinite, limonite, magnetite, manganite, marcasite, montmorillonite, prehnite, psilomelane, pyrite, pyrolusite, pyrrhotite, rutile, sillimanite, sphalerite, sphene, staurolite, tourmaline and zircon. Some very rare minerals do exist as well, like anglesite, autunite, beryl, cerussite, covellite, crocoite, greenockite, nontronite, pyromorphite, scheelite, native silver, stibnite and wulfenite, and also extremely rare minerals like chalcolite, dundasite, embreyite, hisingerite, leadhillite, mimetite, ozokerite (pseudo-mineral) and vauquelinite.  Resources  Ultrapure quartz from Saint-Paul-la-Roche In the Piégut-Pluviers Granodiorite existed a quarry near Lacaujamet (commune of Saint-Estèphe, not far from Piégut-Pluviers) that once extracted granodiorite lintels for doors and windows. The Toarcian clays were exploited by numerous small tile factories. The relatively soft Cretaceous limestones (especially the Turonian) were mined in hundreds of small quarries, because they were a much appreciated building stone. All these activities have now almost come to a halt in the park. There are a few quarries still in operation, but they produce mainly gravel for roadworks or limestone flour for agricultural purposes. Many small pockets of pegmatites used to be exploited locally as a resource for the porcelain industry. A curiosity was an ultrapure quartz lens found near Saint-Paul-la- Roche with parallel C-surfaces belonging to a C/S fabric. Originally this fabric was attributed to the Rochechouart crater, but later on its purely tectonic character was confirmed. Meanwhile, the outcrop has been completely exploited due to requests by the computer industry and NASA. In the last two centuries lodes containing lead, zinc and silver were mined near Nontron and Saint-Pardoux-la-Rivière. Iron used to be exploited in the Sidèrolithique - small iron-rich Tertiary deposits. At the base of these iron deposits are manganese-rich layers in karstic depressions and infills. They formed the basis for manganese mining activities that have ceased in the last century. The following metals are known to exist, but have never been mined: * antimony − in pyrite near Bussière-Galant * copper − in chalcopyrite and in covellite near Saint-Pierre-de-Frugie * gold − in arsenopyrite near Bussière-Galant * tin − in cassiterite near Cussac * tungsten − in scheelite near Montibus, commune of Mialet * uranium − in autunite and in chalcolite, commune of Champs-Romain.  Flora  Bee orchid, one of the more than 25 species of orchids found in the Park The park harbours many different biotopes and therefore possesses a very varied flora. Remarkable are the orchids with 25 different known species. Amongst the orchids one finds species like Anacamptis coriophora, bee orchid, Dactylorhiza maculata, fly orchid, frog orchid and pyramidal orchid. Besides the orchids grow chelidonium, common bluebell, cornflower, the carnivorous Drosera rotundifolia, equisetum, Gentiana pneumonanthe, geum, honeysuckle, mentha, Papaver rhoeas, Polygonatum multiflorum and Verbascum thapsus. Mushrooms are quite common as well with taxa like agaricus, boletus, craterellus and truffles. Amongst shrubs and trees thrive Fraxinus excelsior, hazel, malus, Mespilus germanica, oak, Prunus spinosa, Robinia pseudoacacia, sambucus, sweet chestnut and walnut.  Fauna  In the park live over 40 different species of mammals, amongst them beech marten, common genet, European badger, European pine marten, European mink, European otter, fox, garden dormouse, hedgehog, red deer, red squirrel, roe deer and wild boar. Bats comprise on their own 12 different species, amongst them barbastelle, greater horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe bat, pipistrellus, plecotus and whiskered bat. Migrating cranes The birds are represented by 110 species, for example barn owl, black kite, black redstart, black woodpecker, common buzzard, common cuckoo, common kestrel, common kingfisher, common moorhen, European nightjar, European robin, great spotted woodpecker, grey partridge, hen harrier, honey buzzard, hoopoe, jackdaw, little owl, nightingale, shrike and swallow. Amongst the reptiles 12 species have their habitat in the park, e.g., grass snake, Vipera aspis, wall lizard and western green lizard. Amphibians comprise also 12 species like for example agile frog, common frog, common toad, European tree frog, fire salamander and marbled newt. Amongst the fishes there are brown trout, common minnow, European brook lamprey and European bullhead. Also many different invertebrates are present, amongst them Austropotamobius pallipes, freshwater pearl mussel and insects like Caelifera, crickets, Geotrupidae, Lucanus cervus, Lepidoptera and Odonata.

More than 1200 stone tool remnants found near Vayres document the presence of humans from 300 000 years BP onwards (Acheulean) into the Neolithic.Chèvremont, P., Floch, J.P., Ménillet, F., Stussi, J.M., Delbos, R., Sauret, B., Blès, J.L., Courbe, C. und Vuaillat, D. (1996). Carte géologique de la France à 1/50000, Feuille Rochechouart. BRGM éditions. The numerous findings (well over 3000 pieces) near Montoume (commune of Chéronnac) cover Middle Paleolithic, Upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic.  Dwellings  Rock shelters, grottoes and caves in the valley of the Bandiat, the Dronne, the Nizonne, the Tardoire and the Trincou have been occupied since the Mousterian up into the Magdalenian. Examples are: * Brouillaud near La Tour- Blanche − Mousterian and Aurignacian * Font Bargeix near La Chapelle- Montmoreau − Magdalenian * Fronsac near Vieux-Mareuil − Magdalenian * La Jovelle near La Tour-Blanche - engravings of a capricorn and a mammoth - Périgordian? * La Peyzie near La Tour-Blanche - Magdalenian and Azilian * La Tabaterie near La Gonterie-Boulouneix - paleolithic rock shelter, slightly outside of the park * Puyrignac near Champeaux-et-la-Chapelle-Pommier * Rebières near Brantôme - several rock shelters and caves, somewhat outside of the park * Sandougne near La Gonterie-Boulouneix - Mousterian * Villars - 30 engravings and cave paintings (blue horse, capricorns, hunter attacked by a bison) - early Magdalenian (17000 – 15000 years BP) * Teyjat - engravings of bisons, red deer, horses and reindeer - late Magdalenian (~ 10000 years BP) The neolithic open-air sites Montoume and Nouaillas near Vayres document the gradual changeover from hunter-gatherers to a more agrarian/sessile lifestyle. Finds include stone axes, arrow heads, scrapers and whetstones made from quartz or metamorphic schists.  Megalith culture  Dolmen Peyrelevade near Brantôme From the megalithic period there are several dolmen and menhirs left behind in the park. Examples for dolmen are: * Caillou blanc near Rochechouart * Chez-Moutaud near Saint-Auvent * La Côte near Saint-Laurent- sur-Gorre * La Jalinie near Saint-Jory-de-Chalais * La Tamanie near Oradour- sur-VayresMerimée database, French ministry of education * Le Fouret near Condat-sur-Trincou * Peyre d'Ermale near Paussac-et-Saint-Vivien, somewhat outside of the park * Peyrelevade near Brantôme, outside of the park * Peyrelevade near Paussac-et-Saint-Vivien, outside of the park * Pierre Plate near Veaubrunet, commune of Teyjat - remnants Examples for menhirs are: * Chez-Moutaud near Saint-Auvent * Coudert-Ferry near Milhac-de-Nontron * Firbeix near Piégut-Pluviers * Le Fouret near Condat-sur-Trincou * Lescuyras near Saint-Laurent-sur-Gorre * Theil near Gorre The dolmen and menhirs were erected about 3500 BC and are attributed to the Artenac culture. Many stone tools, stone knives, arrow heads and whetstones made from flint have been found nearby. Significant is the first occurrence of plain and adorned pottery fragments.  Early history  The Thermae near Chassenon A Bronze Age settlement near Chalat, commune of Vayres, has so far yielded only insignificant findings. From the early Iron Age date several tumuli and a necropolis. Examples are: * Champ des Mottes near Oradour-sur-Vayres - tumuli * Coudert-Ferry near Milhac-de-Nontron - tumulus * La Motte near Rochechouart - tumulus and necropolis Iron fibulae and iron knives were discovered in geometrically adorned vases that also kept the ashes of the defunct. Several Roman sites are also known, such as the villa foundations near Nontronneau not far from Nontron. Outside the park are the thermae near Chassenon (Cassinomagus) in the Charente département. The park is traversed by the ancient Roman road Via Agrippa that connected Limoges with Saintes. There is a Merovingian necropolis dating back to the 6th century in La Blancherie near Paussac-et-Saint-Vivien at the edge of the park.  Sites of interest  In the Charente département: the reservoirs Lavaud and Mas Chaban.

He helped found Edna Township in Barnes County and served on its township board and as a county commissioner. Early life Albert Booth was born in Waukau, Wisconsin, October 17, 1850, to Elliot and Phercelia (Fitch) Booth. His father was a miner during the Gold Rush of 1849. As a child, the family moved to Syracuse, New York, where he lived until 1869. After returning to Wisconsin, he took up residence in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin where he worked as a machinist and logger for the Hamilton Finley Lumber Company. His father died in Stockton, California, in 1885, and his mother died in Fond du Lac in 1876. Booth was a member of the Masons, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Ancient Order of United Workmen. North Dakota Albert Booth moved to Barnes County on May 24, 1879, where he established a homestead in Section 24 of Township 142N, R60W. Even though it was far from the nearest railroad, he established a successful stock farm where he raised registered shorthorn cattle. He married Eliza Carter of New York in Waupun, Wisconsin on December 17, 1879. They had eight children: Edna, Alice, Elizabeth, Leila, twins Albert and Blanche, Frank, and Roy. Edna (born 1881) was the first white child born in the township, and it was after her that Edna Township is named. Booth also established a rural post office out of his home on July 25, 1882, also originally named Edna, but ultimately named Booth. The post office was discontinued on November 14, 1884. Booth, a Republican, was not particularly active in politics, but did serve both as a county commissioner and chairman of the township board of supervisors. He died in 1914 in Cass County, North Dakota. References This article incorporates text from the Compendium of History and Biography of North Dakota (1900), a publication now in the public domain.

The site is a scheduled monument, classified as a prehistoric defensive hillfort. The hillfort is one of a chain of six hillforts in the Clwydian Range, which are, from north to south, Moel Hiraddug, Moel y Gaer Bodfari, Penycloddiau, Moel Arthur, Moel y Gaer Llanbedr, and Moel Fenlli. Moel y Gaer Bodfari is the lowest of these hillforts, being just above sea level. The hill on which it stands is surrounded by lower land and is strategically situated at the confluence of the River Wheeler and the Clwyd. Offa's Dyke Path passes along the foot of the hill. The fort at Moel y Gaer is one of the smallest of the chain of defensive works found along the Clwydians. It probably dates from the Iron Age, although there is no definitive evidence to establish the exact period during which it was occupied. It has a single entrance on its northern side and is defended by a steep slope on the eastern side of the hill. Excavation started in 2011 and is ongoing as of 2016. The area enclosed by the ramparts is about two hectares. Various anomalies have been targeted in the excavations, including what is possibly a group of pits and other features where the ground seems to have been dug out, as well as what seems to be a roundhouse on a levelled piece of land. Examination of the middle rampart began in 2013, and it seems that there may have been several phases in its construction.

Jspx should not be confused with other technologies using the same name like Oracle Application Framework and XML JSP. Jspx extends Java EE servlets to provide an Object-oriented programming model for HTML declarative code. Jspx can be compared to JSF as a web framework. There are many other Java Web frameworks like Apache Wicket that implement such ideas. History 100px Jspx development initially started in February 2008 as a trial to provide an easier way to develop rich interactive web applications in Java. In July 2008, jspx was introduced to the Java community through java.net. Initially jspx had very limited features, including support for web form based development only. In December 2008, the project moved to SourceForge,http://jspx-bay.sourceforge.net where it has been hosted since. The Name The name was chosen to indicate the next step of JSP technology, despite the fact that jspx is significantly different from JSP in that it does not directly embed Java code in HTML. The suffix X is analogous to ASP.NET pages, which have the extension aspx. The official jspx framework name on sourceforge is jspx-bay. The suffix bay distinguished the framework from an earlier inactive SourceForge project named jspx. On 16 November 2009, the jspx project on SourceForge was purged, and it provides the same content as jspx- bay. Framework Target Jspx aims at providing easy to use, developer- friendly APIs. Based on the idea that web development is mostly about customizing the HTML that is presented based on user-input, jspx offers an object-oriented view layer interface to HTML. Jspx provides a means of implementing a stateful user interface over a stateless protocol (HTTP). JSF provides similar functionality, but requires that developers learn an entire new set of tags. Design Goals 400px Jspx is relatively new, and combines many features and advantages from existing frameworks while eliminating what might be considered disadvantages. Jspx had the following design goals: # Business case Driven Framework Remove boilerplate code and tasks. # Zero configuration Unlike JSF, does not require any external configuration. # Declarative and Imperative code Attributes declared in HTML are accessible by fully object-oriented APIs. # Optional and Default Implementation No need to specify the value of every feature, because they have reasonable default values. # Integration with other frameworks Import existing jsp files into jspx HTML pages. # Portable framework Run on almost every Application Server without extra effort. Comparison with Other Frameworks=ASP.NET Jspx has the following similarities with ASP.NET: # Webform-based framework. # Page life cycle and events. # Page Templates through Master/Content pages. Jspx is different from ASP.NET in the following ways: # Jspx does not require a particular extension for the html file (i.e. aspx). # Jspx uses standard HTML tags. # Jspx provides many extra features (such as Jspx Beans for View-Controller binding). JSF Jspx is similar to JSF in the following ways: # The same goal of providing an object- oriented interface to HTML. # Bean Binding. # Binding to Page properties. Jspx differs from JSF in the following ways: # Uses standard HTML tags. # Does not rely on any external configuration. # Full control of the page life cycle. Jspx can be also compared to many other frameworks, such as Apache Wicket, but jspx uses HTML tags and attributes without an additional XML namespace. Web Development Using Jspx As Jspx is a webform-based framework, for each business case there is one development unit. A development unit in a jspx application consists of two parts: # Declarative HTML code (myPage.htm) # Imperative Java code (MyPageController.java) In addition, the web.xml file must direct traffic to jspx main servlet controller (RequestHandler). Example A hello world example can be implemented in many different ways. The following example demonstrates one of them. ;web.xml jspx-demo JspxHandler eg.java.net.web.jspx.engine.RequestHandler ResourceHandler eg.java.net.web.jspx.engine.ResourceHandler JspxHandler *.html ResourceHandler /jspxEmbededResources/* ;HelloWorld.html ;HelloWorld.java import eg.java.net.web.jspx.ui.controls.html.elements.Label; public class HelloWorld extends Page { Label message; protected void pageLoaded() { if (!isPostBack) message.setValue(“Hello Jspx World”); } public void setMessage(Label message) { this.message = message; } public Label getMessage() { return message; } } Note the following about the example above: # The only configurations required are to register two servlets of jspx; one for the normal requests on the pages, and the second for embedded resources (such as JavaScript and images). # The HTML must be contained within a root element , and must be well-formed XHTML. # The Java code must extend the root Page controller from the jspx page. # The page has life cycle phases as with ASP.NET, with similar names like pageLoaded # The HTML page should point to the Java controller class through the controller attribute of the element. # In the Java controller, in case it is needed to interact with an HTML control, a control of the same type should be declared as a java property with getter and setter, and the property name should be the same as the value of the attribute ID in the HTML control. For the note number 6, the framework is considering using of Dependency Injection to eliminate such limitation and any coupling of HTML and java code. Dependency Injection Jspx build 1.0.9 provided new way of linking HTML controls to Java controls in the page controller. The above example showed the need to add getter and setter for each control. This methodology created the following cons: # Developer has to type a lot of code to link HTML control to Java control. # The Page controller is getting very crowded with irrelevant code. # Coupling between the HTML control and Java Control; as the link is created only if the Java control name is the same as the value of the attribute id in the HTML control. # Any change in the HTML requires changing the getter and setter in the page Java controller. For all these reasons build 1.0.9 is using Java Annotation to link Java objects to HTML. The following example is an alternative to the above one. import eg.java.net.web.jspx.ui.controls.html.elements.Label; public class HelloWorld extends Page { @JspxWebControl(name=\\"message\\") Label msg; protected void pageLoaded() { if (!isPostBack) msg.setValue(“Hello Jspx World”); } } As noted the size of the code is very much reduced. Also it is noted that the annotation @JspxWebControl is using an attribute name which is an optional attribute. The value of this attribute should be the same as the id of the HTML control. This technique removes the coupling between HTML and Java code. Some consider this new feature an insignificant addition to the framework. They use the JspxBean to link the HTML form to Java Model Object, and do not declare server side controls linked to the HTML controls. JspxBean in build 1.0.9 also has been improved, there is no need to create getter and setter for every JspxBean. Forgetting to add getter and setter was a very common mistake causing the developer to loose the link with the HTML. Dependency Injection is used to inject the JspxBeans without the need for getters and setters. Expression Language Support Jspx does not allow Java code inside HTML page. However, in order to satisfy the need of injecting data from the controller; Jspx fully supports Expression Language. Some examples on EL as following: * \${this.customerName}. The keyword this refers to the current instant of the page controller. customerName is the name of the Java property in the controller class. The property should have a getter method as public String getCustomerName() * \${request.parameters.id}. The keyword request refers to the HTTP Servlet Request. parameters refers to the Request parameters. id refers to the parameter name. HTTP Servlet Request attributes can be also accessed as \${request.attributes.id}. * \${session.id}.The keyword session is used to access parameters in the HTTP Servlet Session. * \${var.age}. In Data Item Controls like DataTable and List Table, custom rendering of Data Column can be done by using ItemTemplate. in order to access the current Database record a variable should be declared in the DataTable with name var for example. Then inside the ItemTemplate the values inside the var variable can be accessed as shown in the EL. * \${size(this.username)} JEXL provides static methods to be invoked . * \${user.age>21?'You are OK':'You are minor'} user must be a jspx-bean defined in the Page controller and the expression is checking on the value of the age (member property of the user bean). Limitations and Disadvantages Any framework is evaluated according to different criteria aspects, the following which jspx needs more improvements. # IDE support. Jspx can be developed using any IDE, however there is no direct support for jspx. Developer has to write the event handling manually. # Documentation. Tutorials and examples are found on the official website. There is a section on the website for documentation, however not sufficient. # EL Support. Jspx did not fully support EL language until version 2.0, JEXL is used starting from jspx version 2.0 to fully support EL. Features Jspx offers some powerful features like: # Native support for Ajax through AjaxPanel # Data Controls like DataTable and ListTable. # Integration with JAAS and adding more features.. # Data Binding through JspxBean. # HTML Template through Master/Content Pages. # Client/Server side validation. # Embedded JQuery,JQuery UI, Bootstrap style and many other open source libraries inside. # Embedded JEXL to support EL expressions. External Jar Dependency Jspx tries to minimize external jar dependencies, however there are some essential jars: # commons-fileupload-1.2.1.jar (when using File Upload) # slf4j-api-1.7.2.jar (Mandatory for logging) # poi-3.1-FINAL-20080629.jar (when using Export To Excel) # servlet-api.jar (only during compilation) # commons-io-1.3.2.jar (when using File Upload) # commons-jexl-2.1.1.jar # jcl-over-slf4j-1.7.5.jar slf4j bridge for Commons logging (As JEXL is using it) JDC 2010 Jspx had made its first public appearance at Java Developer Conference 2010 (JDC). Java Developer Conference is the largest Java event in MENA, organized by EGJUG. Jspx Demo Projects 200px Jspx distribution package includes several files beside the binary jar and the source code. Since the first release on sourceforge the distribution included a demo project as a binary war file and a zipped source code. That project was a simple discrete pages showing different features of Jspx. There was no common business module wrapping these pages, beside it had a poor GUI design. Jspx build 1.1.0 add new demo project that facilitates the easy use of jspx to develop common business case of interacting with DB. The demo is using MySQL. Sql script file is separately downloadable. Some of jspx features are used like Master/Content pages, Ajax, DataTable, Validators and web forms. With Jspx 1.2 there were two new demo projects added. One offline Demo was jspx-demo3, that is demonstrating the use of jspx to create simple asset tracking application. The other demo was an online jspx live demo.

Married to Bagyidaw (then, Prince of Sagaing) in 1801, Me Nu became queen when Bagyidaw ascended the throne on 5 June 1819 as the chief queen consort, with the title Namadaw Mibaya Khaunggyi (lit. Queen of the Main Palace\\"). Me Nu was notorious in Myanmar history was killed under the death sentence due to the penalty imposed by the monarch.  Background  Me Nu was born Shin Min Nu on 18 June 1783 at Phalangon village, 5 miles northwest of present-day town of Khin-U. She had only one elder brother named Maung O. She was the great-grand daughter of the hero Bala Thaman who was posted to the Phalangon village fort during the reign of King Mahadhammaraza Dipadi of Nyaungyan dynasty to guard against the danger of Manipuris. Her father was Htaung Thinn Hmu Thiha Kyawswar U Hlote, the son of Thakhin Mun, who was the third daughter of Bala Thaman. Shin Min Nu was born of Thiha Kyawswar U Hlote and his wife Daw Nge. Became the Crown Princess One day during the reign of King Bodawpaya who established Amarapura Royal Palace, a falcon took the sarong of Me Nu who was taking a bath. The falcon dropped the sarong on the left wing of the southern royal palace. In consequences, sarong owner Me Nu arrived in the presence of the king. At that time, she was more than 11 years old. After royal officials conducted investigations, she grasped a chance of serving as a lady-in-waiting at the southern royal palace under the order of the king. Prince Sagaing became the Crown Prince on 6 April 1809. Four years and six months later, his consort Hsinbyume, gave birth to Prince Nyaungyan. Seven days later, she passed away. As Crown Prince Sagaing married with Me Nu in 1813, then she became the Crown Princess. She had got rights of enjoying four villages, 30 horses, 3,000 pei of land plot, five salt farm villages and taxes for four kinds of products as a royal regalia of the Crown Princess. Became the Chief queen consort Crown Prince Sagaing became the seventh king of Konbaung dynasty on 7 June 1819. Crown Princess Me Nu became the Queen of the Southern Palace (Among four queens, the Queen of the Southern Palace was the Chief queen called Agga Mahesi Queen (or) Nanmadaw (Mother of Royal Palace) with the title of Thiri Pavara Mahayazeinda Yadana Dewi on 3 November 1819. Bagyidaw also conferred title Thadoe Minhla Kyawhtin and granted the appendages of Salin to Maung O, elder brother of Me Nu. Rise to power and terminate As Bagyidaw as a soft liner with flippancy, Mei Nu, too prioritized by the King became powerful in the Royal Palace. Me Nu was part of the war party along with Gen. Maha Bandula and her brother Prince of Salin Maung O, in Bagyidaw's court that advocated war with the British.Myint-U 2006: 112 After the disastrous First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826) that left the country crippled, Bagyidaw became increasingly reclusive. Me Nu and her brother became de facto rulers of the country, and they were much feared for their tyrannical rule. Queen Me Nu had three children with Bagyidaw. The eldest daughter passed away in her childhood and the son, Prince of Palaing, died young at 10 due to pox disease in April 1804. The daughter Princess Supayagale was a queen (Queen Hsinbyumashin) of King Mindon and mother of Burma's last queen Supayalat. The female lineage of Nanmadaw Me Nu, Hsinphyumashin and Supayalat in the male- dominated Burmese monarchy is a very interesting one regarding the end of Independence and the monarchy. In February 1837, Crown Prince Tharrawaddy, brother of Bagyidaw, raised a rebellion against Bagyidaw, successfully forcing Bagyidaw to abdicate in April. Tharrawaddy put his brother under house arrest but executed Me Nu and her brother. Established a brick monastery The Queen's Brick Monastery Me Nu established the Me Nu Oak-kyaung (Brick Monastery) was built in 1822 for the royal abbot Nyaunggan Sayardaw U Po. Then offered to the 2nd Nyaunggan Sayardaw U Bok. The monastery was damaged by the earthquake of 1838 but was repaired in 1873 by his daughter Hsinbyumashin. This monastery is one of the finest specimens of Myanmar architecture during the Konbaung Period (19th century). Its architecture is in simulation of wooden monasteries with multiple roofs and a prayer hall of seven-tiered superstructure.

He became an iconic fixture at Galveston casinos such as the Balinese Room.Cartwright (1998), pg. 241. He is considered to be an archetype for the eccentric Texas oilman.  Personal life  West was born to James M. West Sr. and Jessie Gertrude (née Dudley) in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, on September 26, 1903. He would move with his family to Houston when he was two. He had two younger siblings, brother Wesley and sister Mildred. Like his father, he would enter the oil, cattle ranching, and lumber industries. West graduated from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, an institution financially supported by his father who was a Director of the university. He then attended and graduated from the School of Law at the University of Texas at Austin. Outgoing and outspoken, West was a decided opposite of his modest father and earned a reputation for outlandish habits in his business and personal life. West enjoyed his wealth, and enjoyed showing it off. He frequently sported customized monogrammed cowboy boots, large gold belt buckles, and diamond and platinum accessories.Cartwheeler-Dealer.

He gained his nickname “Silver Dollar Jim” due to his tendency to leave large $20 to $25 tips in silver dollars and because he gave them away to strangers on the street. He repeatedly tossed handfuls of silver dollars in restaurants and bars so he could watch the wait staff and others chase after the rolling coins. At parties, he would toss them into pools and laugh as people dove in after them. About five months after his death, executors of his estate found numerous barrels, bags, and other containers full of silver dollars along with a cache of $2 bills worth about $250,000 (or over $2 million in March 2013 dollars) in his basement. He kept a veritable fleet of cars, mostly Cadillacs, at his various homes and in a 3-story parking garage he owned in Houston. He also owned four airplanes including a DC-3 and a Twin Beech.

This, together with the money he had already made, enabled David Jones to found Llandovery Bank, when he was around 40 years old. He had two sons, Evan (who died unmarried, in 1820) and John (who died in 1813). David Jones died in 1839, having amassed a fortune of £140,000, and the provisions of his will provided for the bank to be continued by his grandsons (the sons of John Jones). The eldest grandson, also called David Jones, continued the Llandovery Bank, and his brothers William and John, respectively, founded branches at Lampeter and Llandeilo, under the title ‘David Jones & Co.’. On the death of the three brothers, the three banks, and their sub-branches, became the property of Gerwyn Jones, the son of David Jones and, in 1903, upon the death of Gerwyn Jones, the banks were devised to Mrs Mary Eleanor Geraldine Davies-Evans. In 1909 the goodwill of the banks was sold to Lloyds Bank Ltd., thus ending the existence of the last of the surviving private bank in West Wales. Size of the bank The Black Ox Bank was one of the earliest banks established in Carmarthenshire, and had more branches than any other private bank of its period in the county. The branch at Llandeilo was established by 1842, and by 1887 had moved into a purpose- built building, by J Calder of London, a plain but substantial building with iron-bound doors, denoting security. The original banking hall and vaults remain, and the building is now the office of a financial services company.Llandeilo / The Black Ox Bank , retrieved 26 September 2009 The former ‘Nag’s Head’ hotel, to the left of the bank, was owned by the bank and remodelled in 1887, ‘to be convenient to those waiting to do business’. There was probably no bank of its era which enjoyed more local credit than the Black Ox Bank and it is said that, in the Panic of 1825, when there was a run on many banks across the country, a timid client entered the Black Ox Bank to withdraw his money. The bank, in anticipation of a run against it, had just received a consignment of Bank of England notes, and the cashier, on receiving the cheque, handed over to the client Bank of England bank notes for the amount. The depositor, however, refused to accept the notes tendered and demanded instead, notes of the Black Ox Bank. Bank notes It is not known what denominations of notes the bank issued but, from the existing specimens available, however, it is certain that notes were issued for £1, £2, £5, £5 5s., and £20, each bearing a black ox in the left hand corner. Public confidence in the Bank made it a popular target for counterfeiters from an early date, and some counterfeit notes have also survived.

It mainly affects mature oak trees of over 50 years old of both Britain's native oak species: the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). The disease is characterised by the trees bleeding or oozing a dark fluid from small lesions or splits in their bark. Unlike chronic oak decline, acute oak decline can lead to the death of trees within 4 to 5 years of symptoms appearing. The number of trees affected is thought to number in the low thousands, with a higher number of infected trees being found in the Midlands. It is thought to be caused by a bacterium; it is currently not known which species is involved, but scientists are actively trying to discover what is responsible. At least three genera of bacteria are possibly responsible. In some instances, the disease is accompanied by insects attacking the trees, too, particularly the oak splendour beetle, (Agrilus biguttatus). These are not thought to be the cause of the disease, but rather they are opportunistically taking advantage of already weakened trees; such infestations further weaken and can hasten the death of trees.

It was opened in 1866 and closed in 1962, during which time it was known by three different names. History The first railway to serve Chard was the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) which opened Chard Road on its new Yeovil to Exeter line in 1860. On 8 May 1863 a second station was opened at as the terminus of a branch from Chard Road. A second railway was opened on 11 September 1866 by the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER;). This line terminated at a new station a short distance north of Chard Town and was served by trains from . Eleven weeks later, on 26 November, a connecting line was opened between Chard Town and the B&ER; station, which was known at this time as 'Chard Joint', and the station was then used as the terminus for both railways. Both railway companies provided staff and there were even separate signal boxes controlling train movements at each end of the station The LSWR was built to standard gauge but the B&ER; was a broad gauge until 19 July 1891. From 1 January 1917 the Great Western Railway (GWR, which had amalgamated with the B&ER; in 1876) took over the operation of trains on the LSWR branch. This allowed some economies to be made, although the trains to Taunton and Chard Junction were still mostly advertised as separate services. In 1923 the LSWR became a part of the larger Southern Railway (SR). The SR platform and sidings were removed by the end of 1927 and the following year their signal box was closed. It was renamed as plain 'Chard' on 1 March 1928, but it appeared as such in GWR timetables before that date. 1948 saw the SR and GWR nationalised as British Railways and from 26 September 1949 it was known as 'Chard Central'. Passenger trains were withdrawn from both branches on 10 September 1962. Public goods traffic continued until 3 February 1964 but goods trains still ran until 3 October 1966 to serve a private siding. After this all track was lifted. Description The station was built in stone and brick in one of the styles favoured by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, although he was not the engineer of the line as he died seven years before it was opened. The platform and offices were on the west side of the line, the side closer to the town centre. A train shed spanned the main platform and track. A terminal platform was provided at the north end for trains to Taunton, and at the south end for LSWR services. A goods shed was situated in the yard to the north west of the station and a private siding was provided behind it for B.G. Wyatt on the site of the Chard Canal wharf. A loop at the north end of the station allowed locomotives to run around their trains at the end of their journeys. The GWR signal box was on the east side of the line alongside the loop, and the LSWR one was west of the line at their end of the station. The station building and train shed still stand and are in use as commercial premises, and is a Grade II listed building. Locomotive shed A locomotive shed was provided opposite the north end of the passenger platform when the station opened. Built in brick, it was long and wide, covering just one track. A wooden platform outside the shed was used to store coal for the locomotives. A turntable was provided on its own siding south of the shed. The shed was closed as a depot on 14 July 1924 although the shed line remained in place until 1933 and the turntable until November 1935. Two GWR locomotives were allocated to Chard in 1901, a 517 Class 2-4-0T and a 1076 Class 0-6-0ST.

She taught in Berlin until she moved to the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena in 1960, where she founded the Kartvelologian faculty. After her retirement she worked for two years at the Tbilisi State University in Georgia. She published books and many articles in journals, such as Bedi Kartlisa. Revue de Kartvélologie. Towards the end of her life, Pätsch translated many pieces of Georgian literature, such as Shota Rustaveli's poem \\"The Knight in the Panther's Skin\\". She worked diligently for cultural exchanges between the German Democratic Republic and Georgia. She even had the Georgian alphabet engraved in the stairwell of her home in Jena, where she also had built a guest house for such visitors as Konstantine Gamsakhurdia.

American Pekin are most commonly used to breed mulards due to the breed's high meat production. Like many interspecific F1 hybrids, mulards are sterile, giving them the nickname mule ducks. While it is possible to produce mulards naturally, artificial insemination is used more often with greater success. The term mulard or moulard is generally reserved for offspring where the parental drake is a muscovy and the duck is a pekin. When the drake is a pekin, the offspring tend to be smaller and are called hinnies. Husbandry and production The mulard is commercially produced on farms for meat and foie gras. The white muscovy and Pekin are the two most common purebred, commercially farmed ducks. Hybrids of the two are hardier and calmer, in addition to exhibiting natural hybrid vigor. The incubation period of the hybrid eggs is between the mallard and muscovy, with an average of 32 days. About half of the eggs hatch into mulard ducks. Mulards tend to combine certain traits of the parent breeds. Due to their muscovy heritage, they produce leaner meat than Pekins; females tend to be raised for meat while males are used for foie gras. Like muscovy ducks, mulards have claws on their feet, but do not fly and perch; instead, they prefer to stay on water, as Pekins do. Traditionally, foie gras was primarily produced with geese, but in the 1960s the majority of farmers began to use mulards. Geese are more expensive to maintain than ducks (they are larger and more aggressive), and the more temperamental muscovies did not accept the process of gavage (force feeding) as readily as Pekins, causing the quality of the foie gras to suffer. This problem was avoided by the introduction of mulards. These hybrids have also become extremely common in countries where foie gras is not produced. Today in France, the leading foie gras producer and consumer, the use of hybrid ducks outnumbers the use of geese. In 2007, there were 35 million mulard ducks raised in the country, compared with only 800,000 geese. In addition to Europe and the United States, mulards are widely raised throughout Southeast Asia.

It principally deals in financial instrument markets that handles securities as well as market derivatives.  History  The Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX) was established under the Financial Futures Trading Law of Japan in April 1989. The TFX was created to be an exchange of for financial originated products. That April, the TFX held a membership organization with the capital supplied by large financial institutions around the world. By June 1989, the TIFFE was trading on three-month Euryen futures, three-month Eurodollar futures, and Japanese Yen-US Dollar currency futures. By April 2004, the TFX was demutualized and integrated to support corporate power, and the Financial Futures Trading Law was abolished. In lieu, the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law was revised and the Securities and Exchange Law was enacted in September 2007. With the new law, the TFX adds onto the growth of Japanese financial markets by catering to investors, as well as advocating the development of new lines of products. A TFX committee explored the idea of using a centralized counterpart to clear OTC derivatives, but reached the conclusion that TFX is the most likely institution for clearing OTC derivatives, since ”it is the only exchange in Japan that specializes in trading and clearing financial derivatives”. Its current CEO is Nobuyuki Kinoshita.  Alliances  The alliances that the Tokyo Financial Exchange share includes Euronext.liffe, in which the two signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to develop efficient procedures of both markets. This contract entails that three-month Euroyen futures traded on LIFFE will be transferred to the TFX at the close of LIFFE’s trading day. Another alliance the TFX possesses includes the Shanghai Futures Exchange, established May 27, 2005. Both parties signed a MOU agreement, covering information exchange on regulatory framework and market structure, financial futures products and marketing, and system infrastructure. Both parties nonetheless agree to occasional meetings on the executive and staff level.

The photograph of one of the huts with a blue tarpaulin protecting the deteriorating structure helped galvanise interest and activism among concerned computer scientists. The initial outreach was followed up with an active Twitter presence that attracted even more followers and interested parties. Bletchley Park staff also engaged with other Web 2.0 (i.e. user-generated) technologies such as Facebook and Twitter. At the end of 2015, Black published a book about the process, Saving Bletchley Park, initially funded via Unbound, that became the fastest crowdfunded book of all time. everywoman says Black \\"embodies the traits of a modern leader\\", particularly in regard to social media use.

The site is a scheduled monument, classified as a prehistoric defensive hillfort. The hillfort is one of a chain of six hillforts in the Clwydian Range, which are, from north to south, Moel Hiraddug, Moel y Gaer Bodfari, Penycloddiau, Moel Arthur, Moel y Gaer Llanbedr, and Moel Fenlli. Description Moel y Gaer hillfort is surrounded by steep slopes to the north, west, and south. To the east the approach is almost level and is where the main entrance is sited. There is also a non-functional entrance to the west. Most of the fort is surrounded by a double bank and ditch, with additional banks to the northeast, near the entrance, across the ridge connecting the hill to the higher ground leading to Moel Famau. The hillfort is approximately oval, measuring about north-south by west-east. The main enclosure is a rounded triangle with an area of , with an annex to the north of , giving a total area of . At a height of up to Moel y Gaer is much lower than the other hillforts in the chain and is also unusual in that it is not sited on the ridge of the range. However, it is in a commanding position over the Vale of Clwyd. The site has suffered from some agricultural damage in the 1980s and also some damage from sheep and rabbit warrens. Excavations and surveys The hillfort was investigated in 1849 by W. Wynne-Ffoulkes. He dug a number of small trenches and concluded that the eastern entrance had been paved and that the inner rampart was built of stone or fronted with stone. He also found an area with large amounts of highly burnt stone. Various artefacts discovered at the site have since been lost. More recently, in 2007, a topographic survey was carried out for the Heather and Hillforts Project. The survey identified 15 roundhouse platforms within the enclosure, along with possible evidence that the inner rampart was faced with stone at some time during the site's occupation. The survey also found evidence of a major period of burning, with fragments of burnt stone in several places and also a block of vitrified material. In 2008 a geophysical survey was carried out as part of an \\"Archaeology Uncovered\\" event, with members of the public carrying out the field work. The work included magnetic susceptibility, fluxgate gradiometer, and resistivity surveys. The surveys identified a number of possible features, including a potentially paved path and a number of potential lines of stone walls. In 2009 a team from Bangor University, in collaboration with the Heather and Hillforts Project, excavated two trenches at the site. The excavations also acted as a field school for students from Bangor and from the University of Vienna, Austria, and as a community archaeology project. The study tentatively suggests that Moel y Gaer hillfort had at least two phases of occupation, an Early Iron Age phase, when the inner rampart was built, and possibly a second (Middle or Late Iron Age) phase, when the outer ramparts were built. Conservation The hillfort seen from the path to Moel Famau from Bwlch Pen Barras As well as being a scheduled monument, the hillfort is also protected and managed as part of the Heather and Hillforts Project. The project includes six hillforts: the four most southerly of the hillforts in the Clwydian Range (Penycloddiau, Moel Arthur, Moel y Gaer Llanbedr, and Moel Fenlli) and also Moel y Gaer Llantysilio and Caer Drewyn.

He was inspired by the work that had been done at the German Bauhaus and in 1937 was invited to teach photography at the New Bauhaus being founded by Moholy-Nagy in Chicago. After World War II, he spent many years teaching at Indiana University. His students included Jerry Uelsmann, Jack Welpott, Robert W. Fichter, Betty Hahn and Jaromir Stephany. Smith was often involved in the cutting edge of photographic techniques: in 1931 he started experimenting with high-speed flash photography of action subjects, and started doing color work in 1936 when few people considered it a serious artistic medium. His later images were nearly all abstract, often made directly (without a camera, i.e. like photograms), for instance images created by refracting light through splashes of water and cliché verre images with corn syrup on a glass plate. However, although acclaimed as a photographic teacher, Holmes' own photographs and other images did not achieve any real recognition from his peers. At the end of his career, Smith questioned the value of photographic education, noting that unlike, say, a medical degree, a degree in the fine arts didn't lead to some useful role in society.

Military service Smith was born in Aldershot, and educated at King's College School, Wimbledon, where he joined the Officers' Training Corps and was reportedly a crack shot, captaining his school rifle team at the annual schools competition at Bisley. He enlisted at the outbreak of war in the Public Schools Battalion, before being commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant of the Army Service Corps in December 1914. Smith served with the Wessex Divisional Train, going to France in March 1915. Smith qualified as a pilot on 24 May 1916, and on 14 June was seconded to Royal Flying Corps, and appointed a flying officer. He was posted to No. 6 Squadron to fly the Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2d. He wrote home to his father in October 1916; :\\"A letter by way of a change this time. Things have been happening with a vengeance since I returned. I daresay you heard from the aunts about some of ‘em: my observer getting a \\"Blighty\\" in the leg; fellows being blown to pieces by bombs, etc., etc. Well the day after I brought down Captain Duff wounded, I went up in the same machine on a \\"Shoot\\" with another observer, and got it in the neck properly from \\"Archie\\": my propeller was smashed, petrol tank punctured [emptied itself all over my observer's feet in about 2 seconds!], both main spars of the two top planes split right through, engine cowl pierced and about 27 holes in other parts of the machine. This was all from 2 practically simultaneous bursts dead over the machine, and they sounded like the crack of doom! However, we managed to struggle painfully back to the aerodrome, feeling jolly lucky that there was enough propeller left to drag us back and also that the spare petrol tank was intact [machine is still in the process of rebuilding!!]...\\" He was appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain on 22 December 1916. Despite piloting a grossly obsolescent two-seater reconnaissance aircraft, Smith, and his observer Air Mechanic 2nd Class Backhouse, scored his first victory on 17 March 1917, destroying a German Albatros D.II fighter over Becelaere. On 1 May 1917, piloting RE-8 \\"4196\\" with Observer Lieutenant Hayman, Smith was attacked by five Albatros scouts, and wounded in the right heel during the engagement. This was referred to in a letter sent to his father from Second Lieutenant Waight, in May 1917: :\\"He was attacked by five hostile machines, all firing as hard as they could go. Unfortunately, Phillip could not reply as both his and the Observer's gun jammed, and were therefore helpless. Phillip did the only thing possible under the circumstances and endeavoured to out manoeuvre his opponents, which he did with wonderful skill. An unlucky shot hit Phillip in the right heel, which must have been very painful when he used the rudder controls. However he kept going until his engine was hit in the carburettor and engine bearers, which, of course, forced him to land. In spite of his wound he made a perfect landing. He was taken to the dressing station ... He is known by many officers outside the Flying Corps for the many brave deeds he has performed at various times, which he considers very ordinary things. He was, without a doubt, a very brave man, and that means a very great deal in the Flying Corps ... He has been recommended four times for a decoration and all in this Squadron are intensely annoyed as he has not got it up to the present...\\" Smith was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1917. Recovered from his wound, Smith transferred to No. 46 Squadron flying the Sopwith Camel in March 1918. He shared a pair of claims on 16 March 1918, being aided by George Thomson. After another claim on 24 March, he shared his final victory, an Albatros C, on 2 April with Lieutenants Donald MacLaren and Alexander Vlasto, and Second Lieutenant Roy McConnell. :\\"Whilst on C.O.P. at 5,000 feet over Courcelles,There are many places called Courcelles, and several of them are in the area of fighting. It may be impossible to determine where this combat took place. Captain Smith fired 50 rounds at 200 yards range at E.A. who was flying West at 1000 feet above him. E.A. turned East and dived. Captain Smith and the other pilots got on his tail and dived down on him firing about 750 rounds at a range varying from 50 to 100 yards. E.A. then dived vertically as if hit and Captain Smith overshot him, the other pilots, with the exception of Lieutenant McClaren, pulled out. He fired another 100 rounds at 50 yards range and the E.A. went down out of control and crashed S. of Courcelles.\\" His commanding officer at No. 46 Squadron, Major R. H. S. Mealing, described Smith as \\"wonderfully brave, perhaps too brave\\". Twice he had returned with his Camel badly damaged by ground fire; \\"D6407\\" on 27 March and \\"D6489\\" on 30 March. On 6 April 1918, flying Camel \\"D6491\\", he led a ground attack mission with Lieutenants R. K. MacConnell, J. R. Cole, and V. M. Yeates. They attacked troops and transports near La Motte, dropping sixteen Cooper bombs and firing some 450 rounds of ammunition. However, Smith did not return and was last seen by MacConnell at 15.30 hours over La Motte. Smith fell to the guns of a Fokker Dr.I flown by Manfred von Richthofen. The Red Baron's combat report read, \\"...The English plane which I attacked started to burn after only a few shots from my guns. Then it crashed, burning near the little wood northeast of Villers Bretonneux, where it continued burning on the ground.\\" He was listed as \\"missing in action\\" by the Air Ministry. After the war Smith's father, determined to find his son's remains, travelled to France with former Camel pilot Donald Gold, who had witnessed the shooting down of Smith's aircraft. Although they were successful in locating and mapping the crash position and found several pieces of the Camel's wreckage, he was unable to discover any trace of his son.As Smith has no known grave he is commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial. Smith was later featured in No. 46 Squadron comrade Victor Maslin Yeates' wartime classic novel Winged Victory as the character 'Beal'.

The following players must meet both of the following two criteria: # Have played at least one TT Pro League game. Players who were signed by Pro League clubs, but only played in lower league, cup and/or international matches, or did not play in any competitive games at all, are not included. # Are considered foreign, i.e., outside Trinidad and Tobago, if he is not eligible to play for the Trinidad and Tobago national team. More specifically, * If a player has been capped on international level, the national team is used; if he has been capped by more than one country, the highest level (or the most recent) team is used. These include Trinidad and Tobago players with dual citizenship. * If a player has not been capped on international level, his country of birth is used, except those who were born abroad from Trinidad and Tobago parents or moved to Trinidad and Tobago at a young age, and those who clearly indicated to have switched his nationality to another nation. Clubs listed are those for which the player has played at least one Pro League game and seasons for those in which the player has played at least one Pro League game. Note that seasons, not calendar years, are used. For example, \\"2010–13\\" indicates that the player has played in every season from 2010–11 to 2012–13, but not necessarily every calendar year from 2010 to 2013. Therefore, a player beginning with the 2010–11 season should always have a listing under at least two years — for instance, a player making his debut in 2011, during the 2011–12 season, will have \\"2011–12\\" after his name. In bold: Players who have played at least one Pro League game in the current season (2013–14), and the clubs they've played for. They include players who have subsequently left the club, but do not include current players of a Pro League club who have not played a Pro League game in the current season. :Details correct as of end of 2013–14 season. Next update will remove all players from withdrawn teams and that have left their clubs from Bold status, and add newly admitted teams' players. This will be undertaken on the first day of the 2014–15 season in September 2014. { class=\\"toc\\" align=center  Contents Antigua and Barbuda  Bahamas  Barbados  Belize  Botswana  Brazil  Canada  Colombia  Dominica  Dominican Republic  England  Grenada  Guyana  Haiti  Jamaica  Japan  Nigeria  Puerto Rico  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Saint Lucia  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  Scotland  Sierra Leone  South Africa  South Sudan  Suriname  United States  Venezuela External links } Antigua and Barbuda * Marcus Ambrose – Morvant Caledonia United – 2009 * Peter Byers – San Juan Jabloteh, Central FC – 2007–08, 2012–13 * Ranjae Christian – Joe Public – 2000 * George Dublin – Joe Public, Tobago United – 2002–08 * Gayson Gregory – San Juan Jabloteh, Joe Public – 2001–03, 2006, 2008, 2010–11 * Akeem Thomas – Morvant Caledonia United – 2012–14 * Elvis Thomas – Morvant Caledonia United – 2012–13 * Vashami Allen -

The line closed in the 1960s as part of the Beeching cuts. History Barlow station (1961) A line connecting Goole to the rail network via Selby (Brayton) was put before parliament in 1845 (\\"Brayton and Goole Railway\\"), proposed by George Hudson and the York and North Midland Railway (Y&NMR;); the line was rejected and another rival scheme, the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway (later part of the L&YR;) was accepted by parliament in the same year, becoming Goole's first rail link. At the time of the branch's construction Goole was served by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;), Selby by the North Eastern Railway, and Drax by the Hull and Barnsley Railway. However a bottleneck at the two-track Selby swing bridge on the already busy East Coast Main Line from London to Scotland meant that freight trains were often delayed, the building of the line was therefore desirable since it offered another path to the port of Hull via Goole for the coal and other freight that was exported via the port at that time. Construction of the railway began in 1907, with Baldry & Yerburgh chosen as contractors, and A.C. Mitchell and W.J. Cudworth acting as the NER's engineers. The line was built as a doubled tracked railway, with much of it being built on embankments. Freight traffic did not meet expectations and the line was reduced to single track after 1923. The line was closed in 1964.The track from Brayton junction as far as Barlow station remained open, serving a railway tip, and later being used for training track maintenance vehicle operators. Source Railway Memories No. 14 Selby and Goole. Stephen Chapman Route The line can be considered to begin at Thorpe Gates Junction Signal box; where the new line branches off to the right from the line of the former Leeds and Selby Railway when approaching from the west towards Selby, it then crossed over the former East Coast Main Line by an overhead bridge. A branch from Selby then met the line from the north; somewhere east of Brayton. Three intermediate stations were served Barlow station, Drax Hales station,The village of Drax now having two stations until 1923 with Drax Abbey railway station and Airmyn and Rawcliffe station. The line reached Goole via a junction onto the 1910 diversion of the original L&YR; line. The Selby and Goole joined at Oakhill junction and then ran on the line, where it joined the NER's \\"Loop line\\" section of the Hull and Doncaster Branch (1869) at Potter's Grange junction just west of Goole station.Ordnance Survey Sheets 237SE, 252NE Rolling stock Initially passenger services railway was operated with steam railcars consisting of tank engine and carriage couple, the engine being designed by Edward Fletcher, later LNER Class G5s were used. Later Sentinel railcars were used, and Diesel multiple units operated the line before closure. Line following closure Site of Drax Hales station (1992) North- west of the crossing with the Hull and Barnsley Railway only parts of the embanked trackbed remain, the bridges and track having been removed. The line to Barlow continued to be used to the WD depot and was extended in October 1966 to provide connection to Drax Power Station when it was being built. That section became Barlow Common nature reserve in 1986. The crossing with the Hull and Barnsley now forms the southern perimeter of Drax Power Station, which is fed from the H&BR.; South-east of the crossing little remains – the route of the line is now mostly replaced by the A645 road.

It crosses the marshy channel that connects Hart Lake and Crump Lake in a remote area of Lake County in eastern Oregon, United States. It was later incorporated into the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road which was completed in 1872. The wagon road eventually became the subject of scandal and litigation ending with a United States Supreme Court decision in 1893. The Stone Bridge and the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Today, the Stone Bridge is located on land claimed by the State of Oregon under riparian rights. The wagon road adjacent to the Stone Bridge is owned by the United States Government and is administered by Bureau of Land Management.  Camp Warner  In 1865, the Army decided it needed a fort near the Warner Lakes to facilitate the interdiction of Indian raiding parties passing through the area. Army scouts from Fort Vancouver selected a site along Honey Creek on the west side of the Warner Lakes in what is today Lake County, Oregon. In 1866, a unit of the 14 Infantry Regiment was sent from Fort Boise to establish the fort. The 14th Infantry came by way of Fort Harney, arriving on the east side of the Warner Lakes in late summer. The Army was unable to cross the chain of lakes which stretched more than seventy miles north to south. After several skirmishes with Indians, the soldiers decided to build Camp Warner on the east side of the lakes. The camp was sited poorly and its construction was hasty. As a result, the men had a very difficult winter, losing one sergeant who froze to death during a snow storm.\\"Stone Bridge and the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road\\", National Register of Historic Places Inventory – Nomination Form, National Register of Historic Places, United States Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, D.C., 13 August 1974.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Stone Bridge\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 916. In the spring of 1867, the 14th Infantry was replaced by a company of the 23 Infantry Regiment. In February, General George Crook visited Camp Warner. Crook directed that the camp be moved to the Honey Creek site west of the lakes. To get the Army's wagons and equipment across the Warner wetlands, forty men under the command of Captain James Henton were assigned to build a bridge across a narrow, marshy channel between Hart Lake and Crump Lake. Shortly after the bridge was begun a second detachment was sent ahead to construct the new fort. The bridge was completed that summer and the soldiers moved into the new camp, which was named Fort Warner.Bach, Melva M., \\"Camp Warner Moved to Honey Creek – 1867\\", History of the Fremont National Forest, Fremont National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Lakeview, Oregon, 1981, p. 14. By 1869, the Indian raids in south-central Oregon had ended and a treaty had been signed. With no Indian raiders left in the area, Fort Warner was abandoned in 1874. While the fort is gone, the Stone Bridge the Army built to cross the Warner wetlands still exists.  Bridge structure  The Stone Bridge was the first large structure built in the south-central part of Oregon. It was constructed between 16 May and 24 July 1867 by forty men from the 23 Infantry Regiment under the supervision of Captain James Henton. The site chosen for the bridge was a narrow marsh that connects Hart Lake and Crump Lake, two large lakes at the southern end of the seventy-mile long chain of lakes and wetlands known as Warner Lakes. The Stone Bridge is actually a quarter mile long causeway rather than a traditional bridge. It was constructed by hauling basalt boulders and smaller rocks from nearby Hart Mountain and dumping them into the marsh. When it was completed, the causeway was probably several feet above the water level and was wide enough for wagons to pass over it. The Army abandoned the crossing in 1874 when it closed Fort Warner and left the area. In the meantime, the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road had begun using the Stone Bridge to cross the Warner Lakes. However, the road company never maintained it. After the military road was abandoned, local ranchers used the causeway as a cattle crossing for many years. Eventually, the causeway settled into the soft marshy ground, disappearing beneath the water. Today, the Stone Bridge is completely underwater except during periods of drought. As a result, it is very difficult to find.  Road construction  Oregon Central Military Wagon RoadBetween 1865 and 1869, the United States Congress awarded land grants to the State of Oregon to pass on to companies constructing military wagon roads. The roads were intended to facilitate the movement of Army units within the state and promote settlement along the routes. Congress eventually authorized the construction of five military wagon roads in Oregon. The first military road was approved by Congress on 2 July 1865. Known as the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road, it was to run from Eugene, Oregon to Fort Boise in Idaho.\\"Oregon Central Military Road\\", Oregon State Office, Bureau of Land Management, United States Department of Interior, Portland, Oregon, 17 September 2009.\\"Oregon History: Uncle Sam's Handiwork\\", Oregon Blue Book, Oregon State Archives, Office of the Secretary of State, State of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 17 September 2009.\\"Unblushing Land Frauds; The President Sends Information to Congress How Big Chunks of the Public Domain Have Been Stolen by Wagon Road Companies in Oregon\\", New York Times, New York, New York, 21 March 1888.\\"United States v. California & Oregon Land Co., 148 U.S. 31 (1893)\\", United States Supreme Court decision, Washington, D.C., decided 6 March 1893. The Civil War had drained the United States treasury and the State of Oregon did not have a tax base sufficient to support road construction so the government financed the military road projects with land grants. Private companies were specifically chartered to construct the roads. Congress allowed the construction companies to claim three sections of land for every mile of road they built, every odd numbered section in a swath covering three miles (5 km) on either side of the road. As ten-mile (16 km) sections of road were completed, the companies could claim up to thirty sections of land along the route as payment. Once the tracts were patented, the company could sell or lease the land to recover the cost of construction and create profits for its investors. As a result, road surveyors laid out routes designed to pass through as much well watered, desirable land as possible. For example, when the Oregon Central military road reached the summit of the Cascade Mountains, it turned south through the upper Deschutes River country into the Klamath Basin to Fort Klamath. It then followed the Williamson and Sprague Rivers, claiming large parts of the Klamath Indian Reservation. The Oregon Central road meandered through the Goose Lake Valley, over the Warner Mountains to Camp Warner (west of the present day community of Plush). From Camp Warner the Oregon Central Military Road went across Warner Valley east crossing north of Beaty's Butte, across the south end of Catlow Valley. The road crossed Steen's Mountain through Long Hollow (near the present day community of Fields) going on to Camp C. F. Smith on Whitehorse Creek. From Camp C. F. Smith the Oregon Central Military Road continued northeast to the Owyhee River crossing (present day Rome)where it connected to an existing wagon road from Winnemucca, Nevada.\\"The Deadliest Indian War in the West\\", Gregory Michno\\"The Wars for the Pacific Northwest\\", Peter CozzensBeckham, Stephen Dow and Florence K. Lentz, \\"The Dalles-Boise Military Road\\", Rocks and Hard Places: Historic Resources Study, John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior, Seattle, Washington, 2000.  Scandal and litigation  On 12 January 1870, Oregon's Governor, George L. Woods, certified to the United States Secretary of the Interior that the road was complete. This allowed the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road Company to claim property along the route.“Decision of Court in relation to Military Road through the Klamath Reservation”, Annual Reports of the Department of the Interior for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1898: Indian Affairs, Washington, D.C., p. 552. However, most of the Oregon Central roadway was nothing more than a rudimentary trail. In reality, the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road was a giant scam, designed to acquire public lands at little or no cost to the road company's investors. Nevertheless, the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road Company claimed a total of of public land. The company was able to patent before lawsuits ended the fraud. Legal disputes kept the ownership of these lands in question for decades, preventing honest settlers from claiming land grants for farms and ranches. In addition, the company paid no taxes while the land claims were disputed. At the same time, the value of the land and its timber, minerals, and grazing potential continued to increase as the property rights were passed from one investor group to the next. Finally, newspaper reports of the fraud compelled Congress to investigate. This led to a major court case, known as the United States versus the California and Oregon Land Company. That case was decided by the United States Supreme Court on 6 March 1893. As a result, the United States Government was able to reclaim the unpatented lands; however, title to patented lands remained in private hands. Eventually, the land passed into the hands of the Oregon Valley Land Company, which subdivided it into 14,000 lots and parcels. The property was finally sold in a nationally advertised auction held in Lakeview, Oregon in 1909. The company sold a total of . Many of the properties included a separate lot in the town of Lakeview along with the rural land purchase. Many buyers bid on land without actually seeing it. As a result, the company was able to sell thousands of acres of dry, worthless land during their week-long auction. As a result, very few purchasers ever lived on their property or received economic benefits from it.Richard Engeman, Oregon Historical Society, “Lake County Court House”, The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, 2005  Route  Route of the Oregon Central Military Wagon RoadThe Oregon Central Military Wagon Road was a circuitous wagon trace designed to capture government land grants rather than link destinations. Today, Oregon Route 58 (also known as the Willamette Pass Highway) follows the first leg of the Oregon Central military road from Eugene over the Cascades to Central Oregon.Oregon, 1879, David Rumsey Map Collection, Rand McNally and Company, 3 October 2009. At that point, the original road headed south through northern Klamath County past what is now the community of Chemult. It followed the Williamson and Sprague Rivers before turning east into Lake County. The road passed over Drews Gap and followed Drews Creek through the north end of the Goose Lake Valley, along what is Oregon Route 140 today. It then crossed the Warner Mountains and entered the Warner Valley, crossing over the Warner Lakes at the Stone Bridge between Crump Lake and Hart Lake. The road continued south of Hart Mountain, through what is today the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge. The road crossed the Catlow Valley and then Steens Mountain. It continued through Harney County, entering Malheur County near the Whitehorse Ranch on the east side of the Pueblo Valley. From there the road follows Crooked Creek northeast, passing near what is now Rome, Oregon. From there it ran along Jordan Creek to Silver City, Idaho.  Historic Site  The Stone Bridge and the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road were historically important projects undertaken by the United States Government and the State of Oregon. Because it is a unique military and transportation history site, the Stone Bridge and an adjacent section of the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 8 November 1974. Despite this designation, both are very difficult to find. A marker was placed at the east end of the Stone Bridge in 1975; however, the causeway itself is only visible when the water level in the adjoining lakes drops to a low level. Some sections of the military road have become part of Oregon's modern road network while crude dirt roads follow the route in other places; however, most of the original road has completely disappeared.\\"Stone Bridge and the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 24 September 2009.

Murchadh was also a descendant of Brion macEchach Muigmedoin King of Connacht who was son of Eochaid Muigh Meadhoin mac Muiredach 122nd High king of Ireland who fathered the UiNeill dynasty and Brion's famous half brother Niall of the Nine Hostages. According to the genealogies, Murchard's great-great-great-great grandson was Flaithbheartaigh mac Emhin, whose grandson, Muredach Mór Ua Flaithbheartaigh, apparently became the first to bear the surname.

His voice is preserved on a number of recordings made for the Ultraphon and Supraphon labels. Biography At the age of six he lost both his parents and grew up in Lemberg (then Poland) where his uncle played in the theatre orchestra. He simultaneously studied at the philosophy faculty of the University of Lemberg and at the Lemberg Conservatory (singing and composition with Stanisław Niewiadomski and Mieczysław Sołtys). In 1911 he made his professional opera debut at the Lviv Opera as Colline in Giacomo Puccini's La bohème. In the season 1913-1914 he sang at the Great Theatre in Poznań. During the 1916-1919 he was the member of Studio Piotrowsky, Teatr Stołeczny and Teatr Wielki in Warsaw. In 1915 he made also his opera directing debut with an expressionistic performance of The Tales of Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach. In 1921 Munclinger left Poland to join the Slovak National Theatre in Bratislava where he was committed until 1924. At this theatre he staged numerous premieres, among them the famous Slovak premiere of Káťa Kabanová in 1923 in the presence of Leoš Janáček who appreciated Munclinger's performance as the best at that time. During his engagement in Bratislava Munclinger married the actress Lenka Honty. After his Vienna tour in 1925 Josef František Munclinger was engaged as a soloist at the Vienna State Opera. He signed already the contract but shortly after signing he preferred the offer of cooperation by the new Opera chief at the National Theatre in Prague Otakar Ostrčil and became for more than 25 years (between 1925 and 1951) a significant opera stage director and singer of this prominent Czech stage. He sang the Magician in the world premiere of Jaromír Weinberger's Schwanda the Bagpiper on 27 April 1927 as well as the role of the second apprentice in the Czech premiere of Alban Berg's Wozzeck on 11 November 1926. In 1942 he starred in the world premiere of František Škroup's Columbus (composed in 1855). Among the other roles he performed Basilio in The Barber of Seville, Beneš in Dalibor, Chrudoš in Libuše, Gian Francesci in La Juive, the Grand Inquisitor in Don Carlos, Herrmann in Tannhäuser, Kecal in The Bartered Bride, Malina in The Secret, Marbuel in The Devil and Kate, Mephistopheles in Faust, Ramfis in Aida, Scarpia in Tosca, Tonio in Pagliacci, Vodník in Rusalka, and Volfram Olbramovič in The Brandenburgers in Bohemia.Archive of the National Theatre in Prague Since the 1920s Munclinger worked as a guest artist at the opera houses and concert stages in Budapest, Vienna, Berlin, Paris, Poznaň and Warsaw. After his retirement from the National Theatre in Prague in 1951 he was also active as a teacher at the Janáček Academy of Music and Performing Arts in Brno where he stimulated and helped to establish the first opera directing department. He tutored numerous Czech and Slovak opera directors. Josef Munclinger also wrote books on dramatic art (e.g. Hercova tvář a maska), translated and wrote opera librettos, worked as scenic designer and upgraded the Czech stage directing with technical news like projected scene or sound amplifiers.

It was written by the series' creator, executive producer and lead actress, Tina Fey and directed by series producer Don Scardino. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on October 30, 2008. Guest stars in this episode include Will Arnett, Marceline Hugot, and Megan Mullally. Liz Lemon (played by Fey) is being evaluated by Bev (Mullally) as a part of the adoption process while Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) returns from his job in Washington D.C. and tries to retake his position from Devon Banks (Arnett) at General Electric. Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) grows angry with Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) for not compensating her for voice acting work on his successful adult video game. \\"Do-Over\\" has received generally positive reception from television critics. According to the Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by 8.7 million households during its original broadcast, becoming 30 Rock's highest-rated episode, until the December 2008 episode \\"Christmas Special\\". \\"Do-Over\\" was nominated for an Art Directors Guild Production Design Award for \\"Single-Camera Television Series\\". Plot As Liz Lemon is returning to studio 6H, the TGS with Tracy Jordan studio, she meets Jack Donaghy returning from Washington. Jack tells her that he intends to get his old job back and Liz tells him of her upcoming adoption evaluation. When he confronts Devon Banks in his office, Devon offers Jack a position in the mail room, laughing, but Jack accepts. Jack later tells Liz of his plan to work his way back to his old job through honest means, though Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot) shows a sexual interest in Jack he could leverage into a quicker promotion. When he discovers that Devon is planning to shut down GE, Jack, with Liz's help, convinces Kathy to hire him as her business adviser. Devon, realizing that he has been beaten, decides on a new path to securing his financial future: hurling himself in front of a series of moving cars so that he can sue the drivers. Tracy Jordan's pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer, has been very successfully released since it was developed in the previous episode \\"Cooter\\". He shows off a large royalty check and Jenna Maroney grows angry that she has not been compensated for her voice acting work in the game. Liz convinces him to make it up to her, and everyone else who helped him with the video game, by buying them presents. However, while everyone else receives extravagant gifts such as Frank getting gold-plated nunchucks and Pete getting a chinchilla fur coat, Jenna only gets a coupon for free hugs and decides to sue Tracy. Following a home evaluation, Bev from the adoption agency comes to work with Liz where she checks the safety of the studio and interviews the TGS cast and crew including Jenna, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), and Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden). The workplace evaluation goes badly, with many of the interviews reflecting badly on Liz or the safety of the studio for a child. However, before Bev files her report she sustains a head injury and forgets that she has done the evaluation. Liz gets the crew to help her \\"do over\\" the evaluation, hoping for a better result. Production Will Arnett reprised his role as Devon Banks in this episode. \\"Do-Over\\" was written by series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey, making it her thirteenth writing credit. The episode was directed by series producer Don Scardino, making it his fourteenth for the series. \\"Do-Over\\" originally aired in the United States on October 30, 2008, on NBC as the season premiere episode of the show's third season and the 37th overall episode of the series. In September 2008, it was announced that actress Megan Mullally would guest star on 30 Rock. In this episode of 30 Rock, Mullally played Bev, a woman evaluating Liz Lemon as part of the adoption process. Actress Marceline Hugot made her fifth appearance as the character Kathy Geiss, the daughter of Don Geiss (Rip Torn), in the series. Comedy actor Will Arnett reprised his role as Devon Banks for the fourth time. Four filmed scenes from \\"Do-Over\\" were cut out from the airing. Instead, the scenes were featured on 30 Rock's season three DVD as part of the deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy plans to seduce Kathy so that he can get his old job back. The next scene, after Jack tells Liz he plans on reclaiming his former job back, Liz asks him how he will be able to get inside the 30 Rock building, as he does not have his employee ID card. Jack tells her you can do anything if you walk with confidence, which he does, and is permitted inside. Liz tries to do the same, but the guard asks her for ID, which she shows. In the third scene, Liz and Bev talk to NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth is fascinated with the adoption process, and says that his own mother worked two jobs as an animal control person for the state and selling meats door-to- door. The final scene, Liz introduces Bev to Tracy in the \\"do over\\". Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, \\"Do-Over\\" was watched by 8.7 million households in its original American broadcast, and became the highest-rated episode of the series, until the December 11, 2008, episode of 30 Rock \\"Christmas Special\\". It earned a 4.1 rating/10 share in the 18–49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 4.1 percent of all 18- to 49-year- olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. \\"Do-Over\\" was nominated for an Art Directors Guild Production Design Award for \\"Single-Camera Television Series\\". IGN contributor Robert Canning reviewed the episode, saying it \\"[set] the bar for the rest of the season\\" and was \\"filled to capacity with comedy.\\" Jeremy Medina of Paste magazine commented that \\"Do-Over\\" was \\"sort of like the first day of school after summer vacation: sort of awkward at times, but fast and buoyant and warmly familiar all the same.\\" Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote \\"...this episode manages to do what the show has always done, mix crazy, almost surreal humor with a genuine (not manufactured) heart.\\" TV Guide contributor Matt Mitovich enjoyed \\"Do-Over\\", and enjoyed Jack's story of trying to reclaim his job, along with Jack and Liz pretending to be a couple in front of Kathy. The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin opined that premiere episodes \\"tend to be 30 Rock's Achilles Heel. But the show comes roaring out of the gate with 'Do-Over', a show that definitively breaks the premiere jinx.\\" He said that the \\"frenetic farcical plotting\\" of Megan Mullally's character—in which she endured a disastrous trip to the 30 Rock studios, bumped her head, and lost her memory—\\"felt a little sitcommy but the laughs kept coming\\". In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode an A- grade rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger felt that the element's towards Jack getting his old job back were \\"fairly labored\\", but noted that Liz's adoption plot was \\"more solid from start to finish\\". He was complimentary towards the Kathy Geiss character, observing that her actions in the episode were \\"all frighteningly funny\\", and enjoyed Mullally's guest spot. In conclusion, Sepinwall said that this was not the best from the 30 Rock staff, but \\"they had some things they felt obligated to deal with, and there was more than enough comedy genius that I can't really complain.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2008 American television episodes Category:30 Rock (season 3) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Tina Fey ","title":"Do-Over"},{"id":"24484325","text":"Juan Manuel Insaurralde (born October 3, 1984) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays for Colo-Colo as a defender.

After an announcement of her nomination by the Blue House in May 2017, Kang faced hard opposition from the opposition parties before and during her nomination hearing at the National Assembly due to allegations, such as address fraudhttps://www.upi.com/S-Korean-diplomat-apologizes-for-using-fake-address- for-daughter/6991496073214/ and the nationality of her oldest daughter. Opposition was partly composed of claims that she lacks experience dealing directly with global powers - the U.S. in particular. During her hearing, she asked for understanding given that she was unable to manage her children in detail as a working parent, did not share finances with her husband to support her parents as their oldest child, and lived abroad for a long time.

The site is a scheduled monument classified as a prehistoric defensive hillfort. The hillfort is also protected and managed as part of the Heather and Hillforts Project. The project includes six hillforts: the four most southerly of the hillforts in the Clwydian Range (Penycloddiau, Moel Arthur, Moel y Gaer Llanbedr, and Moel Fenlli), this hillfort and Caer Drewyn. Description The defensive works at Moel y Gaer comprise a roughly oval area measuring about east-west by , enclosing approximately , and consist of a single rampart and a discontinuous ditch, with a single entrance on the eastern side. The stone bank is up to high externally and internally, and the ditch to the north is wide. The summit reaches above sea level. A track crossing the site from east to west, used by pedestrians and drivers of off- road vehicles, presents a threat to the archaeological remains. Excavations and surveys As part of the Heather and Hillforts Project a topographic survey was commissioned, which took place between December 2006 and January 2007. The survey recorded the remains of 11 roundhouse platforms within the enclosure, concentrated on the eastern side. A geophysical survey followed in 2009, which identified more possible roundhouses, along with possible internal tracks and two potential rectangular structures. In 2010 an archaeological excavation identified two roundhouses of about diameter from different periods of occupation, and the results showed preservation of significant archaeological deposits in the interior of the hillfort, but also the fragile nature of the resource.

In April 2004, as Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Administration), Sunday Ehindero was involved in an investigation of a case where human bodies and skulls were found at the Okija Shrine in Anambra State. Inspector General of Police In January 2005, Inspector General Tafa Balogun was forced to resign after it was revealed that he was under investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He was replaced by Sunday Ehindero. In February 2006, Sunday Ehindero said the Force would send a bill to the National Assembly to amend police Act to remove gender bias. He also expressed pleasure that the Supreme Court judgment had declared that police lawyers could prosecute criminal cases in any court in Nigeria. In May 2006, after a pipeline explosion at Inagbe beach on the outskirts of Lagos, Ehindero called for Communities and officials to play a greater role in securing the pipelines. In August 2006, Sunday Ehindero spoke at a meeting attended by officials of the National Orientation Agency (NOA), the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC). He said the police were concerned with control of corruption in the society and within the police itself. He said his administration has started addressing the second issue through improved pay to policemen. On the first issue, he said he was taking steps to educate the National Union of Road Transport Workers to resist N20 illegal extortion. He also voiced support of community partnership in policing. In September 2006, IGP Sunday Ehindero was subject to over three hours of searching questions by the Senate. He noted that police roadblocks were not by his orders. He said the duplication of anti-corruption commissions like the EFCC and the ICPC were not needed as the police could handle the jobs. In December 2006, Sunday Ehindero said the police had bought 30 armoured vehicles to combat crime in Lagos, Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers states. In March 2007, Ehindero said he was confident that the police could cope with any problems that might arise in the forthcoming national gubernatorial and presidential elections. Earlier he had noted that 80,000 weapons and 32 million rounds of ammunition had been procured for the police. Also in 2007, he announced that more than 10,000 officers would be sacked in an attempt to root out dirty cops. He said that the previous IGP Mustafa Balogun, later convicted on corruption charges, had employed thousands of officers with criminal records. On 9 April 2007, three weeks before newly elected President Umaru Yar'Adua was sworn-in, Ehindero recommended promotion of the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Nuhu Ribadu from commissioner of police to assistant inspector general. In August 2008, questions on the subsequent demotion of Ribadu were challenged on the basis that the original promotion was \\"illegal, unconstitutional, null and void, and of no legal effect.\\" Post-retirement After his retirement in 2007, Sunday Ehindero faced a probe over a N21 million Naira fraud, N2.5 billion of police cooperative money, N300 million police funds and the source of money for allegedly building about eight magnificent houses. His passport was seized. When interrogated by the acting Inspector General of Police, Mr Mike Okiro, the Commissioner of Police in charge of Budget Mr John Obaniyi said that money found being smuggled out of police headquarters was being taken to Ehindero. In April 2008, the ICPC interrogated Ehindero on how money meant to buy arms and ammunition for the police allegedly ended up in his private accounts. He stated that the money was provided by Goodluck Jonathan, then state governor of Bayelsa State and later vice-president, at his request. It was placed in police accounts and he did not see any of it.

As Prince of Shwedaung and Dabayin, he was entrusted by the king to manage the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom, and when necessary, to lead the Royal Army against enemies. Thado Minsaw is best known for his conquest of Arakan (now Rakhine State) in 1784–1785 and the subsequent removal of Mahamuni Buddha from Mrauk-U to Amarapura.Myint-U 2006: 109–110 He also led the successful defense of Tenasserim (Taninthayi) coast in 1792 in the war with Siam. The crown prince also led the revitalization of Burmese theater in the late 18th century by bringing a group of young artists to his court. Thado Minsaw died at age 45 in 1808, and was succeeded as crown prince by his son Prince of Sagaing (later King Bagyidaw). The rest of Konbaung kings traced lineage to him. Early life Thado Minsaw was born Maung Paw ( ) to then Prince of Badon (later King Bodawpaya) and his third wife Me Lun Thu (later Queen of Northern Palace) in 1762 in Shwebo. On 26 March 1781, Maung Yit was granted Shwedaung in fief by King Singu, a first-cousin of his, and became known as Prince of Shwedaung. On 13 July 1783, nearly a year and a half after his father Bodawpaya ascended to Burmese throne, Prince of Shwedaung, just 21, was made crown prince, and was granted Dabayin and Taungdwingyi in fiefs. Crown prince=Conquest of Arakan Thado Minsaw's first major assignment as crown prince was to lead the Burmese invasion of Arakan, an independent kingdom in the west, separated by the Arakan Yoma mountains. In October 1784, Thado Minsaw as commander-in-chief led an expedition force consisted of four divisions, totaling 30,000 men (including 2500 cavalry and 200 elephants). Three divisions crossed the Arakan Yoma from three different passes with Thado Minsaw's division crossing the mountains from its Minbu base. The fourth was a flotilla which came up from the Indian Ocean coastline from the erstwhile British base at Negrais. On the last day of the year, the Burmese forces captured the Arakanese capital Mrauk-U, ending nearly five centuries of Arakanese independence.Myint-U 2001: 14Harvey 1925: 267 Twenty thousand people were deported to populate the king's new capital Amarapura. In the looting and destruction that followed, much of Arakan's cultural and intellectual heritage was lost. The royal library was burned to the ground. The country was annexed and ruled through four governorships, each backed by a garrison. The Mahamuni Buddha, the very symbol of Arakanese sovereignty, was forcibly brought back to Amarapura. Administration Though still in his twenties, Thado Minsaw came to be relied upon by his father for both domestic and military affairs. In late 1785, Thado Minsaw was entrusted to govern in Amarapura while the king personally led a large scale invasion of Siam. After the invasion, which ended in total failure, Bodawapaya handed over managing the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom to Thado Minsaw, and concentrated on religion. Defense of Tenasserim The crown prince was called on to service again in 1792 when the Siamese again invaded Tenasserim, the coastal region directly west of Bangkok. The Siamese forces, which also invaded the region in 1787, successfully captured Tavoy (Dawei) this time in March 1792, and laid siege to Mergui (Myeik). Thado Minsaw as commander-in-chief of a 10,000 strong force first marched down to Burmese held Martaban (Mottama) at the north of Tenasserim coast as his forward base. By December 1792, Thado Minsaw was able to drive out the Siamese from Tavoy and relieved Mergui which the Burmese governor had successfully held. Thado Minsaw left a portion of troops to guard the southeastern frontier.Phayre 1967: 213–220 Theater The crown prince was also instrumental in revitalizing Burmese theater. In the 1780s, he brought together a circle of innovative young artists in his private court, including Maung Sa, the future Myawaddy Mingyi U Sa. In 1789, a Royal Commission consisted of princes and ministers was charged with translating Siamese and Javanese dramas from Thai to Burmese. With the help of Siamese artists captured from Ayutthaya in 1767,Brandon 1967: 27 the commission adapted two important epics from Thai to Burmese: the Siamese Ramayana and the Enao, the Siamese version of Javanese Panji tales into Burmese Yama Zatdaw and Enaung Zatdaw. Death Crown Prince Thado Minsaw died at Amarapura at age 45 on 9 April 1808. He had 22 queens, 32 sons and 26 daughters. Although he was not to be king, the crown prince was father of two future kings, Bagyidaw and Tharrawaddy. The rest of Konbaung kings traced lineage to him.

She had a lengthy career at the Bavarian State Opera where she particularly excelled in coloratura soprano roles. She is best remembered today for portraying Brangäne in the world premiere of Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde in 1865 and Helmwige in the premiere of Wagner's Die Walküre in 1869. Biography Born in Frankfurt am Main, Deinet studied under Elise Seebach before making her professional opera debut at the opera house in Frankfurt as Gabriele in Conradin Kreutzer's Das Nachtlager in Granada in 1861. Later that year she became a principal artist at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden where she had her first big successes during the 1861–1862 season. In 1862–1863 she sang at the Bremen Theater. In 1863, Deinet was appointed to the Bavarian State Opera where she remained until her retirement from the stage fifteen years later. Her first assignments at the house were Isabella in Giacomo Meyerbeer's Robert le diable, the Queen of the Night in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Magic Flute, and Leonora in Giuseppe Verdi's Il trovatore. On 10 June 1865 she created the role of Brangäne in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde under the baton of Hans von Bülow. She also created the role of Helmwige (one of the Valkyries) in Richard Wagner's Die Walküre on 26 June 1869. While performing in Munich, Deinet met actor Ernst von Possart (1841–1921) and began a romantic relationship with him in the mid-1860s. The couple were married in 1868, after which the soprano performed under the name Anna Deinet-Possart. Among the many roles she sang at the Bavarian State Opera were Konstanze in Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail, Marie in Gaetano Donizetti's La fille du régiment, Susanna in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, Inez in Meyerbeer's L'Africaine, and Venus in Wagner's Tannhäuser. On 1 August 1878, she gave her final opera performance. In 1875, Deinet's daughter Ernestine von Possart (1875–1946) was born. Her daughter was married to operatic tenor Robert Hutt and also had a highly successful career as an operatic soprano, using the stage name Ernesta Delsarta. In 1883, she divorced Von Possart, but the couple reconciled and were remarried in New York City 1888. From 1894–1905, her husband served as the director of the Bavarian State Opera.

The music – in one form or another – occupied Busoni at various times between the years 1904–17. Busoni arranged the suite from incidental music which he was composing to accompany a production of Gozzi's play. The suite was first performed in October 1905, while the play with his incidental music was not produced until 1911. In August 1916 Busoni had finished composing the one-act opera Arlecchino, but it needed a companion work to provide a full evening's entertainment. He suddenly decided to transform the Turandot music into a two- act opera with spoken dialog. The two works were premiered together as a double-bill in May 1917.Dent, p. 233; Beaumont (1985), pp. 240–241. Original titles of the suite and its movements The original German title [with its English translation] is:Busoni (1906)The English translation of the titles was aided by reference to Betteridge, The New Cassell's German Dictionary. :Orchestersuite aus der Musik zu Gozzis Märchendrama \\"Turandot\\" :[Orchestral Suite from the Music to Gozzi's Fairy Tale Drama \\"Turandot\\"] The titles of the eight movements as published in 1906 are: In 1911 Busoni composed Verzweiflung und Ergebung (\\"Despair and Resignation\\", BV 248a) as an additional movement to be played between nos. VII and VIII. Even later, after completing the opera Turandot in 1917, he replaced the Funeral March of No. VIII with Altoums Warnung (\\"Altoum's Warning\\", BV 248b). The musicologist and Busoni scholar Antony Beaumont has stated that the final version of the suite, including both of these later additions, is the \\"definitive\\" version.Beaumont (1985), p. 85. Instrumentation 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (3rd doubling English horn), 3 clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon); 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba; timpani, percussion (glockenspiel, triangle, tambourine, covered drum, bass drum, tam- tam); 2 harps; chorus: female (unison) ad lib.; strings. BV 248a and b instrumentation: as for BV 248 except without chorus.Kindermann, pp. 229-231Beaumont (1985), p. 76.Roberge, pp. 32-33. Choice of Gozzi's Turandot Carlo Gozzi (1720–1806) Antony Beaumont has suggested that Busoni's decision to compose incidental music for Carlo Gozzi's play may have been prompted by the impending centennial (in 1906) of the playwright's death. Gozzi's Turandot, which first appeared in 1762, is the most well-known of his ten fiabe (fairy tales) written between 1761 and 1765.All Music Guide, 2008. See ClassicalArchives.com. Accessed 29 September 2009. The action takes place outside a city gate of Peking and inside the Emperor's palace. Turandot, is a proud, cruel Chinese princess who refuses to marry any suitors unless they can answer three impossible riddles. When they fail, she has them executed. But Calaf, Prince of Astrakhan, manages to woo her (\\"Turandot or death!\\"), answers the riddles, and wins her hand in marriage. The play was originally written to be performed in the small theatre of San Samuele in Venice, and was deliberately written in the commedia dell'arte style as a reaction to the more modern, realistic plays of his rival Goldoni.Ashbrook and Powers (1991), pp. 44 and 58 Busoni was very fond of fantastical and magical tales: his immediately preceding work was the Piano Concerto Op. 39 BV 247, which included music from an unfinished adaptation of Adam Oehlenschläger's Aladdin.Dent, p. 148 Composition of the Turandot music Busoni prepared some sketches of incidental music for Gozzi's Chinese fable as early as 1904,Dent, p. 152. but did not apply himself exclusively to the task until the summer of 1905, when he remained alone in Berlin, while his wife Gerda and the children were away in Godinne, Belgium.Couling, p. 204. During this period of concentrated work, from June to the middle of August, he went more or less chronologically through the play, composing music for those places where Gozzi explicitly called for it and also wherever his theatrical instincts suggested it could enhance the drama. The themes and melodies Busoni chose for the Turandot music were based solely on oriental motifs of Chinese, but also Persian, Turkish, and Indian origin. He used as his source a book by the distinguished music critic and historian August Ambros, who had championed Busoni as a child prodigy.Dent, p. 22. Beaumont shows how almost all the thematic material in the Turandot music is drawn from Volume I of Ambros' Geschichte der Musik.Ambros (1862) In all, there are 34 manuscript sheets of sketches and orchestrations for the Turandot music in the Busoni Archive.Kindermann, p. 229 He sketched out thirteen numbers for the play and orchestrated them almost immediately. Realising that a production of the play with his music was going to be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to mount, he also arranged the music into a concert suite of eight movements, the Turandot Suite.Beaumont (1985), pp. 80-84. Some of the music in the manuscripts is also designed for melodramas to be used with the play: each of the three riddles is preceded by enigmatic brass chords; initially Kalaf's replies were meant to be sung, although Busoni eventually dropped this idea. In a letter to his mother dated 21 August 1905, Busoni wrote: > I have remained in Berlin all the time and have, as always, been very busy. > On this occasion with a new score which I completed the day before > yesterday. Babbo [Daddy] will be pleased to hear that I have made a new > attempt at a theatre work, but in an unconventional way; not with an opera > but with descriptive music for a spoken drama. > The play I have chosen for this purpose is an old dramatized fairy tale, a > tragicomedy by our own Carlo Gozzi.

Performance history of the suite Before he had even finished composing the Turandot music, Busoni was arranging for a concert performance of the suite. On 10 July 1905 he wrote to Egon Petri about a concert he was to conduct in Amsterdam which was to include not only the Piano Concerto with Petri as soloist, but also a performance of the Turandot Suite: > Mengelberg has been here [Berlin] and a plan has been drawn up for me to > conduct my 'Concerto' (everyone stubbornly retains the final o) in > Amsterdam, and for you to play it. I had been engaged as piano-player for > the concert – when M. suddenly received an invitation to America. > The programme would be > 1) Concerto > Interval > 2) [Liszt's] Concerto pathétique for 2 pianos > (you and I) > 3) Suite from the music to 'Turandot' > > This twice on succeeding days, probably at the end of October. > Before I finalize, scribble your assent. > > The financial outlook is poor – they only want to pay for a head-waiter – > who is then supposed to tip the kitchen boy out of his own pocket. > Should the idea appeal to you, I can offer you one third, which amounts to > 200 fl.Beaumont (1987), p. 75. In the event, the first performance of the completed Turandot Suite took place at the Beethovensaal, Berlin on 21 October 1905, with Busoni conducting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. The concert also included the German premiere of Hector Berlioz's Les nuits d'été. Busoni also conducted the Suite in Berlin on 13 Jan 1921, at one of a series of concerts of his own music organised by the musical periodical Der Anbruch.Dent, p. 255. Turandot as incidental music Max Reinhardt in 1911 Berlin production Busoni was keen to have the incidental music performed along with Gozzi's play as he had originally conceived, and by early October 1906 at the latest had approached the actor- director Max Reinhardt about a production. Reinhardt accepted, and a performance was scheduled for 1907. Busoni also tried to get a production started in London, but was initially unsuccessful. He wrote to Egon Petri about these results on 6 October 1906: \\"The Deutsches Theater [Reinhardt's theater] wants to perform Turandot in the spring. An attempt at this Chinoiserie in London has been abortive. The abortion of my heavy load.\\"Originally \\"Ein Durchfall meiner Leibesfracht\\", a pun on the word \\"Durchfall\\", which can mean \\"flop\\", \\"failure\\", or \\"diarrhea\\". Letter to Egon Petri dated Amsterdam, 6 October 1906, and footnote. Beaumont (1987), pp. 79-80. As is often the case in such a complex undertaking, the German production encountered various delays and difficulties. Busoni refused to allow changes to the score: the required 60-piece orchestra, unusually large for a play, inflated the prospective budget enormously and immediately became a major problem. Furthermore, Reinhardt's career had soared from 1905 onwards, and he was creating, lighting and acting in new productions in two theatres at an astounding rate. He was an incredibly busy man, and everything would have to be completely ready for a speedy production. Another significant problem was the lack of a suitable German version of Gozzi's Italian play. The dynamic young writer Karl Vollmöller who was to do the translation was also extremely busy on other less literary projects. From February to April 1908 he was attached as a reporter to the Zust automobile race team in the 1908 New York- Paris Great Race, from New York through Siberia and Russia, Poland, Germany and France to Paris. His race reports were published in the NY Times, which gave front-page coverage to the event. He had also been jointly developing an aeroplane with his brother Hans from late 1904 onwards, and in 1910 Vollmöller flew their No.4 prototype a record 150 km non-stop from Canstatt (now Stuttgart) to Lake Constance. He did eventually make an adapted translation of Turandot in 1911, which he dedicated to Busoni.Vollmöller (1911)Vollmöller (1913) Max Reinhardt by Emil Orlik The artist Emil Orlik who had been working with Reinhardt since 1905, was to design the sets and costumes. He had recently returned from a two-year journey to the Far East and was considered the leading German expert on chinoiserie. In the end Orlik was unable to participate in the production, and the sets and costumes were done by Ernst Stern.Beaumont (1985), p. 84. Orlík did, however, provide the cover for Breitkopf & Härtel's 1906 score of the Turandot Suite (see above).Beaumont (1985), p. 82. In addition to these obstacles, Busoni himself had been undergoing a personal change. In 1906 he focused much of his attention on what was to become a highly influential essay: the Outline of a New Aesthetic of Music (completed in November 1906 and published in 1907).Beaumont (1985), p. 89. And from September to December 1907 he was composing the Elegies, BV 252, which marked a major turning-point in his musical development.Beaumont (1985), p. 101. From February 1906 to October 1911 he composed his first opera, Die Brautwahl (\\"The Bridal Quest\\", BV 258), an enormously lengthy and ambitious \\"musical-fantastic comedy\\" based on a tale by E. T. A. Hoffmann. The music of the opera is an eclectic mix, with quotations from other composers, such as Rossini and Mozart, and others more obscure. Its composition spans the years when Busoni's style was evolving rapidly, and the music of the opera incorporates it all.Couling, pp. 246-253. Although Busoni had refused to cut the score of his music for Turandot or reduce the size of the orchestra, he did agree to a Reinhardt request for more music. In 1911 he composed Verzweiflung und Ergebung (\\"Despair and Resignation\\", BV 248a) to be played between acts IV and V; he also added it between nos. 7 and 8 of the already lengthy Turandot Suite.Kindermann, p. 230. His compositional growth during the intervening years is revealed in the new piece: Antony Beaumont describes the opening half as \\"one of the finest passages in all of the Turandot music.\\" Alessandro Moissi as Calaf. Max Reinhardt's production of Turandot, Berlin, 1911. Vollmöller's Turandot with Busoni's music was finally first performed at the Deutsches Theater, Berlin, on 27 October 1911, with a very expensive orchestra conducted by Oskar Fried.Beaumont (1985), pp. 76, 84.Couling, p. 245. Reinhardt was a hugely innovative director with the Deutsches Theater at his disposal, and Turandot was given plenty of publicity. An entire issue of the house magazine, (Blätter des Deutschen Theaters) was given over to the production. There were contributions from Busoni, Orlik, and Stefan Zweig among others. Theatrical reviews of the production were mixed, one (justifiable) criticism being that the music from a 60-piece orchestra did not so much highlight as paint over the action. The music was thought not to be in the service of the play, but at times in service of itself (like Beethoven's Egmont or Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream). A brief second-hand account of Reinhardt's production appears in a letter from Puccini of 18 March 1920 to his librettist Simoni: > Yesterday I talked to a foreign lady who told me about a production of this > work in Germany with a mise-en-scene by Max Reinhardt, executed in a very > curious and novel way [...] In Reinhardt's production Turandot was a tiny > woman, surrounded by tall men, specifically chosen for their height; huge > chairs, huge furnishings, and this viper of a woman with the strange heart > of an hysteric.Ashbrook and Powers (1991), pp. 56-57. Puccini's biographer > Michele Girardi (Puccini: his international art (2000), Chicago University > Press) confirms that Puccini hadn't actually seen the production. London production Vollmöller and Reinhardt's next venture together was the hugely successful production of Vollmöller's religious mime play The Miracle, which in opened in London on 23 December 1911 at the Olympia exhibition hall. It was made into a full-colour feature film with the same name by Joseph Menchen and Michel Carré with some of the original named cast, which premièred at Covent Garden with a continuous symphonic score by Engelbert Humperdinck on 21 December 1912. The English theatre director Sir George Alexander was a man similar to Reinhardt. He was an equally active actor-manager who ran the St James' Theatre, London and played hundreds of roles in his career. Alexander was at the first performance of Turandot in Berlin, acquired the rights to it and brought Reinhardt's entire production to London in 1913.Carter (1914), p. 245 Jethro Bithell made an authorised English translation of the Gozzi-Vollmöller play. Turandot (with Stern's scenery and costumes, and Fried conducting) opened on 8 January 1913 at the St James's Theatre, London. However, Busoni had not been to any rehearsals, and when he attended the first performance he was appalled. Johan Wijsman (the dedicatee of the Berceuse, BV 252), had made an unauthorised reduced version of Busoni's score for a 20-piece theatre orchestra. The producer had inserted music by other composers alongside Busoni's own, and the orchestra was out of tune. Busoni left in a rage after the second act and went to listen to Saint-Saëns' symphonic poem Le Rouet d'Omphale at another concert.Dent, pp. 198-199. Carter, who had also seen the Berlin production, was very complimentary about the music. \\"quote\\" He also commented that the inferior lighting arrangements in the St. James' Theatre affected the production most. ref Carter book After a fortnight Busoni had calmed down: in a letter to H.W. Draber, 21 Jan 1913, he wrote: > St. Saëns (and Rimsky K.) also contributed to the Turandot music (because > mine was insufficient) - which was played in Varieté style by a 20-piece > orchestra. The success was great!! The newspapers are captivated. > Fascinating! How should one defend oneself?Beaumont (1987), p. 158 In a letter on the same day in 1913 to his wife Gerda, Busoni said he had considered going to court over the affair, but realised the season would have been over before the case was finished. He also wonders what Gerda thinks about an opera in Italian based on Gozzi's play.Ley, p. 217-218. Letter to Gerda, dated London, 21 Jan 1913.

Possessing a powerful voice with a wide vocal range, she tackled roles from both the soprano and mezzo-soprano repertoires. She is best remembered today for portraying several roles in the first complete presentation of Richard Wagner's The Ring Cycle at the very first Bayreuth Festival in 1876.\\"Die Sängerinnen und Sänger bei der Uraufführung des ganzen Rings 13. – 17.8.1876\\" (Archived 27 February 2012 at the Wayback Machine), by , August 2004.

Saur Verlag Biography Schefsky made her professional opera debut in 1868 at the Bavarian State Opera as Orfeo in Christoph Willibald Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. She was one of the leading artists at that house up through 1883 and was the favorite performer of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. While there she notably sang the role of Amneris in the Munich premiere of Giuseppe Verdi's Aida in 1877. Wagner heard Schefsky perform in Munich and was very impressed by her vocal and dramatic abilities. He invited her to take part in the first presentation of the complete Ring Cycle at the Bayreuth Festival in 1876. At the festival she premiered the role of the second Norn in Wagner's Götterdämmerung on 17 August 1876 and sang the role of Sieglinde in Wagner's Die Walküre on 14 August 14, 1876. In 1882 Schefsky portrayed Magdalena in the United Kingdom premiere of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London under the direction of Hans Richter. After leaving the employ of the Bavarian State Opera in 1883, she sang at the Opéra national du Rhin and the Vienna State Opera in 1883/84. She spent her last few years on the stage performing at the Berlin State Opera and the Oper Frankfurt. Among the many roles she sang on stage were Azucena in Verdi's Il trovatore, Fidès in Giacomo Meyerbeer's Le prophète, Frau Reich in The Merry Wives of Windsor, Gertrude in Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet, Maddalena in Verdi's Rigoletto, and Sieglinde in The Ring Cycle. After retiring from the stage in the early 1890s, Schefsky taught singing in Munich. She died there in 1912 at the age of 69.

Plot  Rural Finland at the end of the 19th century: 19-year-old Anna-Liisa, daughter of farmer Kortesuo, is preparing her wedding to Johannes Kivimaa. A few days before the official announcement of the wedding, she receives the visit of Husso, the mother of Mikko who was a farmhand at the Kortesuo farm. She tells her that Mikko, who now owns a log-floating firm, is coming back and wants to marry her. When Anna-Liisa refuses, Husso reminds her how four years earlier she had helped her hide the body of the baby born from her relationship with Mikko, whom she had accidentally killed. Mikko, supported by Husso, threatens Anna-Liisa to reveal her secret if she refuses to marry him. When Johannes demands that he stops bothering Anna-Liisa, he threatens to kill him. The arrival of Anna-Liisa parents put an end to the fight but when Anna-Liisa repeats that she will never marry Mikko, Husso reveals to her shocked parents what happened four years ago. Anna-Liisa confesses everything. Her father, beside himself with rage and disappointment, initially wants to kill her, but soon calms down. The following day, Anna-Liisa tries to drown herself to join her dead baby but she is saved by Johannes. After praying God, she knows what she must do. She says she forgives everybody including Mikko and accepts to marry him. On the wedding day, she appears dressed entirely in black. She confesses to the whole assembly what she has done and declares she is ready to receive the punishment she deserves.

He was instrumental in the growth and prosperity of the San Joaquin Valley. Helm was vice-president of the Fresno Bank of Central California, and the president of the Fresno Canal and Irrigation Company. Early life Frances Newman and William Helm about 1869 Helm was born in the province of Ontario, Canada on March 9, 1837, about forty miles above Montreal, on the St. Lawrence River. He is the son of George and Mary (Oliver Helm), both of whom were born in Scotland. Brought up on the home farm, Helm acquired an education in the district schools, and under his father's instruction. Helm left home in 1856 to Wisconsin for three years engaged in lumbering and operating a sawmill on the Chippewa River. In 1859, Helm sailed from New York City to San Francisco, California by way of Panama. He traveled to Sacramento and searched for gold in Placer County but soon found it unprofitable. He spent the next three years as a butcher, first in Foresthill, Todds Valley, and then in Bear river in Placer County. He saved his money and decided to raise sheep for a living. In 1865 he married Francis Sawyer Newman, and they had seven children together. Fresno, California William Helm House Helm brought his wife and his sheep to Fresno county, which was then a vast space of open land, before the railroad came through the valley. He was one of the earliest settlers to experiment with growing wheat. Helm was the largest individual sheep grower in Fresno County. In carrying his wool to market at Stockton, he used three wagons, each drawn by ten mules, and spent twelve days in making the round trip. When the railroad came through the valley in 1872, it was a great benefit to Helm. At Dry Creek, on section four, Helm bought a ranch six miles northeast of Fresno. He acquired up to 2,640 acres, paying one dollar an acre. He bought additional land to establish a winter camp for his sheep on the present site of the Fresno court house. His herd increased rapidly, at one time owning 22,000 head of sheep. In 1881, because of a growing family, Helm bought the block bounded by Fresno, R, Merced and S Streets from Louis Einstein. He built his home there in 1881 where it stood for 71 years. As their daughters married, Helm gave them parts of the block on which to build their homes. The Fresno Community Hospital was built on this block in 1959. In 1901, Helm testified as a character witness in the murder trial of a friend named James Brown, whom Helm stated that he had known since 1886. Death Agnes Jean Helm with her grandfather William Helm Helm died on April 10, 1919, at the age of 82, following a lingering illness that left him bedridden for seven months. He died at the home of his daughter, Jessie Marie Helm. Helm, California was named after William Helm.

She was the former Dutch 36-gun frigate Jason, built in 1770 at Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Her crew mutinied and turned her over to the British in 1796. She then served the Royal Navy until she was wrecked in 1801. Mutiny In 1796 Jason, under the command of Captain Gerardus Donckum, was part of a Dutch squadron that had sailed from Texel in February. She encountered difficulties and had to put into Drontheim, Norway for a refit. On 31 May 1796, Jason captured and sank the British merchant ship Maryann, which was on a voyage from Nevis to Greenock, Renfrewshire. Following this action, political disagreement and bad treatment aboard led some of Jasons crew to mutiny. They locked the captain and his followers below deck, and sailed into Greenock on 8 June. Captain John K. Pulling, of the 18-gun brig-sloop , accepted the mutineers' surrender there. When Jason surrendered she had more than 200 men aboard, so a \\"great party\\" from the Sutherland Fencibles marched from Glasgow to Greenock to take possession of the frigate. British service The Admiralty commissioned Jason as the 32-gun frigate Proselyte, and appointed Captain John Loring in September 1796 to command her. In British service she carried twenty-six 12-pounder guns and six 6-pounders. Shortly after her commissioning, on 20 February 1797, she sailed for Jamaica. On 4 June Proselyte captured the French privateer Liberté on the West Indies station. Liberté was armed with six guns but had only 13 men aboard her when Proselyte captured her as the rest of the privateer's crew were away in captured vessels. George Fowke received his promotion to Post-captain on 9 July 1798 and in December took command of Proselyte. Proselyte was part of the British fleet under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell that constituted the naval part of the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in August 1799. On 8 August the British captured the Dutch hulks Drotchterland and Brooderschap, and the ships Helder, Venus, Minerva, and Hector, in the New Diep. So many vessels, or rather their crews, shared in the prize money that the share of an ordinary seaman was only 6s 8d. This amounted to about five days' wages. Proselyte was also present for the surrender of the vessels of the Batavian Republic in the Vlieter Incident. The surrender occasioned a further distribution of prize money but the London Gazette did not publish any amounts. On 28 August Proselyte captured the Prussian hoy Zeeluft. On 11 October 1800 Proselyte and the hired armed cutter Fly captured the Proteus. The next day Proselyte captured the small French cutter Victor et Natalie, off Havre. She was sailing from Dieppe to Cancalle in ballast. Then on 1 December Loire, Proselyte, and Fly captured the Danish brig Fortuna. Fowke sailed for the Leeward Islands in February 1801. In March Proselyte participated in Rear Admiral Duckworth's successful attack on the islands of St. Bartholomew and St. Martin. Proselyte, Hornet and Drake stayed at St. Martin to secure the island and to embark the garrison on 26 March, while the rest of Duckworth's force went on to St Thomas. Duckworth ordered Proselyte and Hornet to relieve Unite from the task of protecting the two newly captured islands so that Unite might escort the prisoners to Martinique and arrange and escort a convoy from there for Great Britain. Prize money for the \\"sundry articles of Provisions, Merchandize, Stores, and Property afloat\\" was available for payment on 14 January 1804. Loss While under the temporary command of Lieutenant Henry Whitby, Fowke not being on board, Proselyte was wrecked on 4 September 1801. She was on her way from St. Kitts into port at St. Martin when she struck the \\"Man of War Shoal\\" in view of Philipsburg. Fortunately, boats from Philipsburg saved all the crew. A court martial on aboard HMS Magnanime at Fort Royal, Martinique, on 7 November 1801 found Whitby guilty of negligence for not heeding the warning about the danger of the reef; the court sentenced him to a reduction in rank. The board also dismissed the master, Luke Winter, from the Navy. Whitby had left him in charge of the navigation and ignored the local standing orders, which specified where the shoal was and the bearings vessels were to follow when entering port. Wreck site Proselyte is now a popular dive site for visitors to St. Martin. She lies on her starboard side in approximately of water, just beyond the mouth of Great Bay at Philipsburg. Numerous cannon, ballast bars, barrel hoops and anchors are scattered around the wreck on the ocean floor, all heavily encrusted with coral, which has made the \\"Proselyte Reef\\" a popular dive site. The Sint Maarten Museum has put many artifacts retrieved from Proselyte on display. Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References  Rotterdams jaarboekje (1900).

New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that material that is not obscene may nonetheless be harmful for children, and its marketing may be regulated. Background Under New York Law it was illegal to willfully sell to a minor under 17 any picture which depicts nudity, is harmful to minors and any magazine which taken as a whole is harmful to minors. Sam Ginsberg and his wife operated Sam's Stationery and Luncheonette in Bellmore, Long Island. In it they sold magazines including those deemed to be pornographic. He was prosecuted from two informants who testified that he personally sold two 16-year-old boys the magazines containing pornographic images of women, both called \\"Sir\\", and, \\"Mr\\" Annual. It was insisted upon by their parents to buy them so they could lay the grounds for persecution. He was tried in Nassau County District Court and found guilty. The court had found that the pictures were harmful to minors under the law. The conviction was upheld by the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court of New York and was denied an appeal to the New York Court of Appeals. Ginsberg argued before the court that the State of New York did not have the power to classify two different sets of the population in regards to obscene material and that it was an unconstitutional deprivation of liberty. He cited Meyer v. Nebraska, Pierce v. Society of Sisters and Prince v. Massachusetts, in all of which cases the court sided with the minors. Opinion of the Court Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the court. The court rejected Ginsberg's argument that New York had deprived minors of their liberty. The court found that it was well within the state's power to protect minors and that just because the material is not classified as obscene to adults it may still be regulated with minors. Dissent Justice Douglas wrote a dissent where he strongly objected to the majority's decision. He found the First Amendment to be an absolute that harbored no exclusion for the obscenity that the rest of the court had found. While he admitted that the material that had been sold to minors could be harmful, Douglas was concerned that the ruling would set a precedent that could be perpetuated to \\"protect\\" other segments of society from anything the government might deem obscene. He finished by saying the definition of obscenity is impossible to determine because it is highly subjective and laments that the court is forced to sit as the nation's board of censors.

Most medical radiation scientists work in imaging clinics and hospitals' imaging departments with the exception of Radiation Therapists, who work in specialised cancer centers and clinics. Educational requirements A Medical Radiation Scientist must graduate from an accredited Bachelor of Medical Radiation Science or Bachelor of Applied Science in Medical Radiation Science program in order to register and practise in Australia. Even though there are bachelor's programs in Medical and Cardiac ultrasound but these are often offered at the graduate level as a certificate, postgraduate diploma, or master's degree for the Bachelor of Medical Radiation Science graduates. Graduates from the medical radiation sciences possess a good understanding of nuclear physics, quantum physics, radiation physics, wave physics, medical terminologies, pathology, oncology, radiobiology, mathematics, anatomy and physiology, and are highly skilled in the operation of complex electronic equipments, computers, and precision instruments which often cost millions of dollars. Diagnostic radiographers Radiographers produce diagnostic images with various types of radiation, including x-rays, whilst ensuring the patient is safely exposed to radiation. Nuclear medicine radiographers Nuclear Medicine Radiographers use gamma rays produced from short-lived radioisotopes that emit radioactive tracers to investigate trauma and disease such as cancer, heart disease and brain disorders.

Possessing a powerful voice with a wide vocal range, she sang a broad repertoire that encompassed Italian, French, and German opera. High points from her stage repertoire included the title heroine in Vincenzo Bellini's Norma, Agathe in Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz, Leonore in Fidelio, Rachel in Fromental Halévy's La Juive, and Valentine in Giacomo Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots. She is best remembered today for portraying several roles in the first complete presentation of Richard Wagner's The Ring Cycle at the very first Bayreuth Festival in 1876. Biography Born in Mannheim, Grün studied singing in her native city with Hofkapellmeister Vincenz Lachner. She began her career as a member of the opera chorus at the Nationaltheater Mannheim in 1857. In the early 1860s, she began appearing as a soloist at the house. In 1862, she was committed to the Oper Frankfurt and from 1863–1864 she sang at the Oper der Stadt Köln. She was a member of the opera house in Kassel in 1864–1866 and she was a principal artist at the Berlin State Opera from 1866–1869. After further studies with Francesco Lamperti in Milan, Grün sang at the Staatsoper Stuttgart from 1870–1871. In 1872, she gave successful performances at the Vienna State Opera and the Nationaltheater Mannheim. In 1873 she was committed to the Teatro Comunale di Bologna where she portrayed Elisabeth in the Italian premiere of Wagner's Tannhäuser. After further appearances in Frankfurt and Mannheim, Grün was committed to the opera house in Coburg from 1875–1877. Richard Wagner had heard Grün perform in operas in Frankfurt and Mannheim and admired her abilities. He invited her to take part in the inaugural Bayreuth Festival in 1876 in the first presentation of the complete Ring Cycle. She premiered the role of the third Norn in Götterdämmerung on August 17, 1876 and portrayed the role of Fricka in Die Walküre on August 14, 1876. The following year she sang in concerts in London under Wagner's baton. Grün retired from the stage in 1877 after marrying the Imperial Russian Baron, pianist and composer Login Sadler. However she still continued to perform in concerts under the name of Friederike Grün-Sadler, having a particular triumph in Riga in 1888. The couple lived together in Saint Petersburg for many years.

October/December 1983. Buenos Aires, Argentina Jorge Asís (full name Jorge Cayetano Zaín Asís) is an Argentine writer and politician born 3 March 1946 in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires province. Biography Asís was born in Avellaneda, a working/middle- class suburb of Buenos Aires, to a family of Syrian immigrants. From his youth he was drawn to literature and political activism. Among his first major books is Los reventados (\\"The down-and-out\\"), a novella about sundry characters seeking to make easy money in the context of Juan Perón's return to Argentina in 1973. Some characters witness the 20 June 1973 Ezeiza massacre, which is narrated from their point of view. During the 1970s, Asís (using the nom de plume Oberdán Rocamora) published a daily column in the daily Clarín, in the tradition of Roberto Arlt. In 1978, he reported (as Rocamora) from the South American rally where he ran as co-pilot of a stock Citroen car. Asís rose to fame in 1980 with Flores robadas en los jardines de Quilmes (Flowers stolen in the gardens of Quilmes), where he relates the adventures of several young people experimenting with sex, careers, and politics in 1970s Argentina, centered around the narrator's relationship with a young woman from Quilmes, who eventually decides to leave the country. The book was dedicated to Haroldo Conti, who was already a \\"desaparecido\\" at the time, and included bolder than accepted political statements in the era of the military junta's dictatorship. That book became the first part of a trilogy named Canguros (lit. \\"Kangaroos\\") that dealt with everyday life in Greater Buenos Aires, sometimes from a lumpenproletariat perspective. In 1984, Asís released Diario de la Argentina (\\"Argentina's Newspaper\\"), a roman à clef about his days in Clarín. Major newspapers were not thrilledLa fracturación del campo intelectual argentino. Un caso emblemático: Jorge Asís - Dra. Nidia Burgos, Departamento de Humanidades, Universidad Nacional del Sur to have their inner conflicts aired in public, and (informally) boycotted Asís and his work for several years. During the 1980s, Asís became more involved in politics. He regularly attended meetings with intelligence operatives, which became the basis for the 1987 novel Partes de inteligencia (\\"Intelligence Reports\\"). During Raúl Alfonsín's presidency, Asís gravitated towards the Justicialist Party, and specifically supported presidential candidate Carlos Menem. When Menem became President of Argentina in 1989, Asís was appointed to several government and diplomatic posts, including ambassador to UNESCO, Secretary of Culture, and ambassador to Portugal. After Menem's ten years as president, Asís remained in politics, and became a sought-after commentator in print, radio and TV, where his rich language and his flamboyancy set him apart from the more formal tone of most politicians. In the 2007 presidential election, Asís ran for vice president sharing a ticket with Jorge Sobisch, a former governor of Neuquén province. The ticket attained approximately 1.6% of the national vote, finishing in sixth place. The social realism of his earlier works was seen by some critics as \\"collaborationism\\" with the dictatorship, owing to the success of Flores robadas en los jardines de Quilmes during the regime.Gregorich, Luis (1987).

From 1861 to 1862, she was committed to the Staatsoper Hannover and she performed at the Stadttheater Regensburg from 1862 to 1865. She returned to Darmstadt in 1865, where she remained for the next twelve years, performing under the name of Louise Jaide. In 1872, Richard Wagner heard Jaide perform in Darmstadt and was very impressed by her vocal and dramatic abilities. He invited her to take part in the first presentation of the complete Ring Cycle at the Bayreuth Festival in 1876. This was the first time that the third and fourth operas in the Ring cycle, Siegfried and Götterdämmerung, were heard. Jaide played Erda in Siegfried at its première on August 16, 1876, and she played Waltraute in Götterdämmerung at its première on August 17, 1876. She also sang the role of Waltraute in Wagner's Die Walküre as part of the first complete Ring cycle on August 14, 1876.

His was first noticed after publishing poems and short stories in a grotesque style, which invited comparison with a friend of his, Jakob van Hoddis. Indeed, there were claims of imitation: while Hoddis created the style, Lichtenstein has enlarged it, it was said. Lichtenstein played with this reputation by writing a short story, called \\"The Winner\\", which describes in a scurillous way the random friendship of two young men, wherein one falls victim to the other. By using false names he often made fun of real people from the Berlin literary scene, including himself as Kuno Kohn, a silent shy boy; in \\"The Winner\\" a virile van Hoddis kills Kuno Kohn at the end of the story. Lichtenstein admired the style of the French writer Alfred Jarry not only for his ironic writings, but like him he rode his bicycle through the town.

Background In June 1828, Gran Colombia declared a state of war on Peru under allegations that it had fomented a rebellion against Colombian forces in Bolivia. Gran Colombia's leader, Simon Bolivar, also demanded the payment of a debt of several million pesos resulting from the Peruvian War of Independence; and the cession of the northern provinces of Jaén and Maynas. The consequent Peruvian declaration of war against Gran Colombia occurred on 3 July 1828 when the Peruvian government, under President Jose de La Mar, ordered a mobilization of its ground and naval forces. Battle On 2 July 1828, the Peruvian corvette Libertad armed with 24 guns and a crew of 124 men under Captain Carlos Garcia del Postigo (a Chilean-born officer under the service of the Peruvian Navy), sailed towards Guayaquil with orders to cross the Gulf and guard the entrance to the Guayaquil River. On 31 August 1828, the Peruvian vessel was intercepted by two Gran-Colombian warships, the schooner Guayaquileña and the corvette Pichincha, commanded by Irish-born Captain Thomas C. Wright. Captain Wright, aboard the Guayaquileña, inquired to the commander of Libertad about his activities in Gran-Colombian waters, but suddenly the Peruvian corvette opened fire, starting a close-quarter artillery duel, during which the Peruvians almost boarded the Guayaquileña; meanwhile, the Pichincha stayed away and didn't participate in the combat. At the peak of the struggle, the Gran- Colombians ships suddenly retreated towards Guayaquil and were pursued closely by the Libertad. The pursuit ceased when the Libertad was forced to return to tend the wounded and bury the dead. The Peruvians lost 15 killed and 28 wounded, while the Gran-Colombians suffered 24 killed and 36 wounded. Ships involved The Libertad was a corvette originally named General Brown, purchased from Chile in January 1826 for 25 thousand pesos under the name General Salom, that started its service for the Peruvian Navy as a transport vessel, and on 6 March 1827 was finally named Libertad. On 8 January 1828, the Commander-in-Chief of the Peruvian Navy, Rear Admiral José Pascual de Vivero, established a budget of 7,354 pesos to convert the Libertad into a warship, initially armed with 22 12-pounder guns taken from the corvette Limeña. On 14 May 1828 the Chilean officer Carlos García del Postigo Búlnes was assigned as commander of the vessel. The schooner Guayaquileña was armed with twelve 12-pounder guns, and was under the command of Lieutenant Claudio Johnston. Among the officers on board were two future Ecuadorian presidents, ensign José María Urvina and midshipman Francisco Robles. The Pichincha was under the command of Captain Archibald Taylor. Aftermath After this encounter the Peruvian Navy, composed at that time of 16 warships and transports, among them the frigate Presidente, started a naval blockade ordered by the Peruvian government on 19 September 1828, of the entire Gran Colombian Pacific coasts. This was from Machala (Ecuador) to Panama. Thanks to this action the Gran Colombian Navy was unable to use its main ports in the Pacific.

A vote for a party might result in the loss of seats in parliament, or the party might gain extra seats by not receiving votes. A \\"Negative vote\\" is a voting system, which allows a voter to indicate dislike for a candidate without boosting another - in order to have one vote deducted from his/her least-preferred candidate's vote total. The effect that a vote for a party might result in the loss of a seat is contrary to the requirement that every vote in a democratic election should have the same weight. It also violates the requirement that the vote may not explicitly run counter to the intention of the voter. Germany The phenomenon of negative vote weight occurred in several past federal elections in Germany, including the election in 2009. The negative vote weight could occur in a state where a party had overhang seats. In such states, in many circumstances a vote for a party will not increase its national seat total (MMP allocations are calculated at the national level in Germany), but may increase the proportion of the party's national seats to be allocated to the state where it already had overhang seats (overhang seats being allocated at the state level). This effectively decreased the party's total seat count, and a voter would have been better served by not voting for that party. However, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled on 3 July 2008 that this was unconstitutional, as a negative vote weight is incompatible with the constitutional guarantee of equality and directness. Accordingly, the election law was changed in February 2013.Bill amending the Federal Election Law. 11 December 2012. Retrieved 25 December 2012. Other  Negative vote weight is possible in national elections in the Czech Republic and Romania. It can also occur in some of the Austrian states' local elections. In both cases, however, the incidence is lower, and the effect is less pronounced than in Germany. Referendums Negative vote weight can occur in popular referendums that have a vote quorum (where the proposed change is considered only if a minimum number of people vote). A vote against the proposal can cause the quorum to be satisfied and thus result in the acceptance of the proposal. For this reason, some popular referendums aim for an approving quorum where the proposed change is only considered if a minimum number of people vote for the proposal.

She made her professional opera debut in 1870 at the Court Theater of Neustrelitz. Subsequent engagements took her to the Municipal Theater of Szczecin and the Bavarian State Opera. In 1873 Haupt became a principal soprano at the Court Theater of Kassel where she remained through 1877. At that house she excelled in the coloratura soprano repertoire, portraying such roles as Ännchen in Der Freischütz, Elvira in I puritani, Frau Fluth in The Merry Wives of Windsor, and Marie in La fille du régiment. She also sang a few mezzo-soprano roles like Urbain in Les Huguenots and Venus in Tannhäuser. After marrying the famous Wagnerian tenor Georg Unger (1837–1887), she appeared on the stage as Marie Unger-Haupt. Haupt's participation in the first presentation of the complete Ring Cycle at the Bayreuth Festival in 1876 was the pinnacle achievement of her career. This was the first time that the third opera in the ring, Siegfried, was heard and Haupt created the role of the Forestbird when it premiered on August 16, 1876. She also sang the roles of Freia in Wagner's Das Rheingold and Gerhilde in Wagner's Die Walküre on August 13, 1876 and August 14, 1876, respectively.

The track was built in 1990 by Owner/Operator Boone Coleman. The track hosts weekly racing events throughout the summer months, including the classes, Late Model, Modified, Limited Late Model, and Bomber. In 2009 the track hosted its first televised event, The \\"Big Red Book\\" River Days Rumble, featuring the Lucas Oil Late Model Series. The series made two appearances at the track in 2010, featuring one televised event, the two day \\"Pepsi 75 – River Days Rumble\\" paying $20,000 to the winner. In 2012 the 'crown jewel' racing event, The Dirt Track World Championship, was hosted at the speedway. The race, the thirty-second annual running of the event, paid $50,000 to the winner and was televised on the SPEED Network and sanctioned by the Lucas Oil Late Model Series. The announcement was made during the D.T.W.C. weekend that the thirty-third annual hosting of the event would also take place at the speedway under Lucas Oil series sanction. The DTWC now pays $100,000 to win and Brandon Sheppard of New Berlin, IL is the defending champion (2019).  Track history  The track is built on a site that once housed a Shawnee Indian campground, but the Shawnee were run off the land by white settlers. On June 3, 1799 the town of Alexandria was founded on the site. The town would eventually be moved to what is currently known as Portsmouth, Ohio in 1813 because of multiple floods. As time went on the site was converted into farmland. Current owner Boone Coleman purchased the land in the 1970s. In the summer of 1990 Coleman began excavation on the site, when asked about his intentions he replied \\"My son Tim has a racecar and no place to practice!\\" Boone later decided to try to recover some of the money he spent building the track, and installed grandstands and the first season kicked off in late 1990, only two races were held that year. The first full season of racing was held at PRP in 1991. In 1992 the grandstands and concession areas at the track were destroyed when vandals took one of the tracks dozers on a rampage. The track crew was able to rebuild the track and was ready to race again within two weeks. In 2000 the track was converted from a one-third mile to three-eights mile.  Track records  The current track record at Portsmouth Raceway Park in the Late Model class is held by Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series driver, Scott Bloomquist at a 13.840 The track record at the old one-third mile track was set by local businessman and driver RJ Conley in his popular #71C at 13.595.

Harmony Comps. & Elecs., Inc., 846 F. Supp. 208 (E.D.N.Y. 1994), was an Eastern New York District Court decision regarding copyright infringement and breach of license agreement. Microsoft Corp. (referred to as \\"Microsoft\\" below) filed the lawsuit against Harmony Comps. & Elecs., Inc. (referred to as \\"Harmony\\" below) and its president, Stanley Furst (together referred to as the \\"defendants\\" below), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and treble damages. The defendants did not contest the plaintiff's claim that Harmony sold Microsoft's products without any licenses or authorization, or that they sold Microsoft's products stand-alone, which violated Microsoft's license agreement. Instead, the defendants argued that their action was protected by the first-sale doctrine 17 U.S.C §109(a) (1977). After reviewing the facts, the court found that the defendants' action constituted copyright infringement, and that the first-sale doctrine did not apply since the defendants failed to prove that the Microsoft products they sold were lawfully acquired. The court also ruled that the defendants breached Microsoft's software license agreement by selling the products stand-alone. Background The defendants sold Microsoft's copyrighted products, including Microsoft MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows software programs, without license or authorization. Furthermore, they sold such products either stand-alone or loaded on computer hard disks. They continued their activity despite of Microsoft's notification letters of illegality on April 19, June 16, July 14, and September 14, 1993. According to Robert Wanezek, Program Manager of Microsoft's Replication Group, and Lee Gates, Microsoft's Software Design Test Engineer, twenty-one pieces of counterfeit products were found on defendants' premises. Microsoft hired private investigators, who were then able to purchase various Microsoft products from the defendants. Other customers who bought Microsoft's products from the defendants called Microsoft's Piracy Hotline to question the legitimacy of Harmony's sales. The defendants denied that any of their products sold were counterfeit. They argued that even if any of the Microsoft products were counterfeit, they purchased them in the good faith that such products were genuine. Furthermore, they argued that their selling of Microsoft products was protected by the first-sale doctrine and thus the copyright infringement claim did not hold. Holding Without an evidentiary hearing, the court ruled that the copyright infringement was likely to hold in this case based on the facts that the defendants were never licensees of Microsoft's and therefore were unauthorized to distribute any of Microsoft's products. The court found it unnecessary to verify the genuineness of the Microsoft products sold by Harmony. Furthermore, the court cited ISC- Bunker Ramo Corp. v. Altech, Inc., 765 F. Supp. 1310, 1331 (N.D.Ill. 1990) (\\"there is no such thing as a bona fide purchase for value in copyright law\\") and ruled that Harmony's good faith argument did not hold. The fact that the defendants ignored Microsoft's four notification letters proved that they were not \\"innocent infringers\\". The first-sale doctrine did not apply to this case, since the defendants failed to trace the \\"chain of title\\" and establish a proof of first sale. The court reasoned that \\"in civil actions for copyright infringement, the defendant has the burden of proving that the particular pieces of the copyrighted work that he sold were lawfully made or acquired\\" and that \\"the fact that defendants bought their Microsoft Products from another party does not by itself establish a first sale\\". As to the fact that Microsoft's \\"undercover investigator\\" traced some of the products sold by Harmony to two of Microsoft's licensees, the defendants still violated Microsoft's license agreement, which required that licensees \\"shall distribute Product(s) only with [licensee's] Customer System(s)\\". (The \\"Customer System\\" here means a \\"single user computer system\\".) Harmony's selling the product stand-alone breached Microsoft's license agreement.

However, others believe that the early fathers actually tried to increase the dignity of women. Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature 1895 ed. John McClintock and James Strong. \\"Women\\". The patristic era, which extends roughly from 150 AD to 500 AD, is claimed to be harsher than the Middle Ages themselves in attributing social roles to women, hence the expression patriarchy used by modern-day feminists. Anthropological perspectives=Aristotle's views on women Aristotle believed that women are colder than men and thus a lower form of life. His assumption carried forward unexamined to Galen and others until the 16th century. Male activity and female passivity Some people view that the Church Fathers' views were like that of the classical Greeks and Romans. In the classical age, which shaped patristic views, male sexuality and power were closely associated, and female sexuality was associated with passivity. Church Fathers opposed to practice of independent female ascetism because it threatened to emancipate women from men. To take one's pleasure was to be virile, to accept it servile.[4] However, others view that the Fathers actually believed in the dignity of women. \\"The teaching of the most enlightened of the fathers was. undoubtedly to. the effect that there was no natural inferiority in the woman to the man. Theodoret (Grcee. Affect. Curat. book 5) insists emphatically on their exact equality, and says that God made woman from man in order that the tendencies and action of both might be harmonious. Sometimes, indeed, he observes, woman has been found superior to man in encountering adversity (Migne, 83:836). Chrysostom (Hoern. 61:3) says that no one is more fit to instruct and exhort her husband than a pious woman. This conception differed, however, materially from that of Plato (Repub. 5:455), in that while the Greek philosopher sought to obliterate the ordinary distinctions between the sexes, the Christian father held that nature assigned to woman her special and distinct province of activity. Chrysostom, in a passage of singular beauty, gives us a comparison between the duties of the wife and those of the husband, the former being represented as in some respects the more dignified; for while the husband is described as engaged in the rougher work of life, in the market or the law-courts, the wife is represented as remaining at home and devoting much of her time to prayer, to reading the Scriptures, — καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ φιλοσοφίᾷ. When her husband returns, harassed with his labors, it is her function to cheer and to soothe him, so that he again goes forth into the world purified from the evil influences to which he has there been exposed, and carrying with him the higher influences of his home-life (In Joann. Hom. 61; Migne, 59:340).\\"Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature 1895 ed. John McClintock and James Strong. \\"Women\\". Ecclesiastical roles Throughout the Patristic age, women held a variety of positions in Church office and performed ecclesiastical duties. Despite recurrent opposition of women in office by various Councils and Church fathers like Tertullian, women were influential in shaping the hierarchy of Christianity. By the end of the 6th century, the Church officially recognized three orders of women: deaconesses, widows and virgins. The surviving evidence also suggests the existence of female presbyters and even bishops, the extent of which is unclear because of the scarcity of remaining records. Deaconesses In the Eastern Church, women were being ordained as deaconesses from the 3rd century to at least the 7th century, from Armenia to Gaul. By the 3rd century, the office of deaconesses was well attested by the Didascalia Apostolorum. The office was further classified in the Council of Nicaea as well as the Apostolic Constitutions of the 4th century in which the ordination ceremony for the deaconess is outlined, confirming its place as an order supported by the Church. Evidence for female deacons in the West emerges in the 5th century but few inscriptions survive as a result of several synods’ efforts to eliminate them. The female diaconate in the West certainly existed, though was not widely accepted. Moreover, it was subject to local interpretations and was often confused with the order of widows. Although the role of the deaconess was liturgical in nature, it remained limited to duties considered improper for a male to perform, such as instructing women, assisting women in disrobing and anointing their body in the holy rite of baptism. Widows and Virgins By the early 3rd century, the qualification for the office of widows was well established and its duties were clearly outlined in various Church Orders. Some inscriptions, such as The Apostolic Tradition reveal that widows were to be ecclesiastically enrolled, but not ordained. Others, like the Testamentum Domini explicitly state that widows were to have an ordained office, with duties surpassing the usual service of prayer. Regardless of the status they were granted, the Church irrefutably held widows in high esteem. In contrast, virgins were not considered church offices, nor were they appointed by ordination. In some areas however, they were considered members of the clergy and part of the ecclesiastical order, like those of Tertullian’s Carthage and other African congregations. Presbyters Repeated attempts were made by councils to eliminate the order of female presbyters. Their existence, albeit small in quantity, is indicated through epigraphical and literary evidence. Documented incidences of female presbyters are limited, with records suggesting they were most common in the Montanist movement in the East and the Priscillianist movement in the West. Although both movements were later deemed heretical, evidence also exists to support the presence of female presbyters within the “orthodox” Church. A letter from Pope Gelasius from the end of the 5th century acknowledges their sacerdotal duties in Southern Italy and Sicily, whose communities and bishops evidently accepted these positions. Some argue that perhaps their governing role in communities as presbyters assigned women the authority to teach and exercise sacramental and liturgical functions. Nevertheless, the precise responsibilities of female presbyters remains largely unclear. Bishops The early Church largely succeeded in excluding women from this office. Despite this, some Christian groups like the Montanists did appoint women as bishops. Latin inscriptions from Italy and Dalmatia certainly suggest their presence there as bishops in the 5th and 6th centuries. As a result of sparse epigraphical evidence, it is arguable whether women exercised the role of bishop in other areas and Christian groups. Image of women as seen by theologians=Woman as the root of all evil Tertullian's views on women went further: \\"The curse God pronounced on your sex still weighs on the world. …You are the devil's gateway…. You are the first that deserted the divine laws. All too easily you destroyed the image of God, Adam. Because you deserved death, it was the son of God who had to die\\".Tertullian, \\"On Women's Clothing\\", 1:1 St Jerome, the well known Biblical scholar and translator of the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate) had a simple view of women. To him \\"woman is the root of all evil.\\"Vivian, Philip. 1911. The Churches and Modern Thought: p284 Like most early Christian theologians, Jerome glorified virginity and looked down on marriage. His reasoning was also rooted in Genesis: \\"Eve in paradise was a virgin ... understand that virginity is natural and that marriage comes after the Fall.\\"Knight, Honest to Man: p120 Firmilian tells of a woman who went into an ecstasy and came out a prophetess. \\"That woman who first through marvels or deceptions of the demons did many things to deceive the faithful, among other things... she dared to do this, namely that by an impressive invocation she feigned she was sanctifying bread, and offering a sacrifice to the Lord.\\"In Epistle 75. 1-5 to Cyprian, Women as the weaker sex John Chrysostom, bishop of Constantinople at the beginning of the 5th century, said of biblical women that they \\"were great characters, great women and admirable…. Yet did they in no case outstrip the men, but occupied the second rank\\" (Epistle to the Ephesians, Homily 13). Commenting on , Chrysostom said that \\"the male sex enjoyed the higher honor. Man was first formed; and elsewhere he shows their superiority…. He wishes the man to have the preeminence in every way.\\" Of women he said that \\"The woman taught once, and ruined all. On this account therefore he saith, let her not teach. But what is it to other women, that she suffered this? It certainly concerns them; for the sex is weak and fickle, and he is speaking of the sex collectively.\\" (1 Timothy, Homily 9). Augustine elevated the contempt of women and sex to a level unsurpassed before. To him, women's inferiority to men was so obviousRanke-Heinemann, Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: p55 that he felt that he had to ask the question: \\"Why was woman created at all\\".Phelips, The Churches and Modern Thought: p203 He concluded that woman was created purely for procreation and for nothing else.Ranke-Heinemann, Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: p77 The expulsion of Adam and Eve from paradise, according to him, was purely the fault of Eve.Ranke-Heinemann, Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: p185 Women as creatures of lust Gregory of Nazianzus, the Bishop of Constantinople had this to say about women, \\"Fierce is the dragon and cunning the asp; But women have the malice of both.\\" According to the theologian Origen, women are worse than animals because they are continuously full of lust.Ranke-Heinemann, Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: p51-52 Origen does not approve of the sexual act even in marriage and taught that although widowers can remarry, they are by no means crowned for this. He also argued in his commentary on that female prophets never spoke publicly in the assembly. St. Clement of Alexandria had such a contempt for women that he believed such a feeling must be universal. He wrote, in his book Paedagogus that in women, \\"the consciousness of their own nature must evoke feelings of shame\\". He also suggested that women should also fetch from the pantry things that we need.Ranke-Heinemann, Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: p127,130 Gregory of Nyssa taught that the sexual act was an outcome of the fall and that marriage is the outcome of sin. Specific prohibitions against female demands=Council of Elvira The c. 4th century council of Elvira made some canons (church law) restricting women concerning divorce, adultery and abortion: * Canon 8: Women who have left their husbands for no prior cause and have joined themselves with others, may not even at death receive communion. * Canon 9: A woman of the faith who has left an adulterous husband of the faith and marries another, her marrying in this manner is prohibited. If she has so married, she may not at any more receive communion—unless he that she has left has since departed from this world. * Canon 63: If a woman conceives in adultery and then has an abortion, she may not commune again, even as death approaches, because she has sinned twice. Infanticide In his First Apology Justin Martyr cautioned that it was wicked to dispose of children through exposure to the elements, given that almost all those who are exposed were raised to prostitution.A Brief History of InfanticideMartyr, Justin. \\"First Apology\\" - Chapter XXVII Guilt of exposing children Prostitution Justin also added a warning against consorting with prostitutes because it was possible that one \\"may possibly be having intercourse with his own child, or relative, or brother\\" unknowingly, due to the practice of infant exposure. Women in heretical movements A number of minority movements, deemed heretical by the wider church, gave a more prominent place to the ministry of women and in some cases allowed them to participate in the priestly ministry. These include Montanism in the 2nd and 3rd century, the Quintillians and Collyridians in the 4th century, and Priscillianism in the 4th century. These heretical sects provided occasion for the institutional church to condemn the ecclesiastical ministry of women.

The raid was the final action in a series of engagements fought by the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean against the Dutch naval forces in Java, and it completed the destruction of the Dutch squadron with the scuttling of three ships of the line, the last Dutch warships in the region. The British squadron—under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew—sought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal Javan port of Batavia. In the summer of 1806, British frigates reconnoitred Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging Pellew to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships. Prior to the Batavia raid however, Dutch Rear-Admiral Hartsinck had ordered his ships of the line to sail eastwards, where they took shelter at Griessie, near Sourabaya. On the morning of 5 December 1807, a second raiding squadron under Pellew appeared off Griessie and demanded that the Dutch squadron in the harbour surrender. The Dutch commander—Captain Cowell—refused, and seized the boat party that had carried the message. Pellew responded by advancing up the river and exchanging fire with a Dutch gun battery on Madura Island, at which point the governor in Surabaya overruled Captain Cowell, released the seized boat party and agreed to surrender the ships at anchor in Gresik harbour. By the time Pellew reached the anchorage, however, Cowell had scuttled all of the ships in shallow water, and Pellew was only able to set the wreckage on fire. Landing shore parties, the British destroyed all military supplies in the town and demolished the battery on Madura. With the destruction of the force in Griessie, the last of the Dutch naval forces in the Pacific were eliminated. British forces returned to the region in 1810 with a large scale expeditionary force that successfully invaded and captured Java in 1811, temporary removing the last Dutch colony east of Africa. Background In 1804, at the start of the Napoleonic Wars, a powerful French squadron operating from Batavia harbour on the Dutch island colony of Java attacked a large and valuable British merchant convoy sailing from China near the Straits of Malacca in the Battle of Pulo Aura.Clowes, p. 336 The French attack was a failure, but the threat posed to British trade passing through the Strait of Malacca by French or Dutch warships had been clearly demonstrated. Determined to eliminate this threat, the commander of Royal Navy forces in the Indian Ocean—Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew—ordered frigates to reconnoitre Dutch naval activity in the East Indies during the summer of 1806. The Dutch maintained a small squadron in the region under Rear-Admiral Hartsinck, principally intended to operate against pirates, consisting of three 68-gun ships of the line, three frigates and a number of smaller vessels. Despite the obsolete nature of many of these ships, they nevertheless constituted a threat to British trade and Pellew's frigates raided Dutch harbours and merchant shipping extensively during their patrols.Gardiner, p. 81 At the Action of 26 July 1806, a Dutch convoy sailing along the southern coast of Celebes was attacked and defeated by one of Pellew's reconnaissance frigates, HMS Greyhound. Among the captured ships was the Dutch frigate Pallas and two large merchant vessels.Clowes, p. 386 Three months later, the frigate HMS Caroline entered Batavia harbour itself, seizing the Dutch frigate Maria Reigersbergen at the Action of 18 October 1806.James, p. 267 These successes encouraged Pellew to conduct a larger scale operation, launching a major Raid on Batavia harbour on 27 November 1806. As his large squadron sailed into the bay, the surviving Dutch ships were driven on shore to avoid capture, boarding parties under Admiral Pellew's son Captain Fleetwood Pellew completing the destruction by setting the wrecks on fire.James, p. 268 A number of vessels, including all of the Dutch ships of the line, had escaped the raid. Hartsinck had sought to divide his forces shortly before Pellew's attack and consequently sent a number of vessels eastwards along the Javan coast under an American-born Dutch officer named Captain Cowell. Cowell's force eventually sheltered in a protected anchorage at the town of Griessie near Sourabaya, to the west of Batavia. There the squadron rapidly deteriorated so that one ship of the line—Kortenaar—had to be broken down into a sheer hulk and two others—Pluto and Revolutie—were disarmed, their cannon transferred into batteries on shore.James, p. 357 Admiral Pellew was unable to return to Java early in 1807, as his ships were dispersed on separate operations across the Indian Ocean, some deploying as far west as the Red Sea. However, during the summer responsibility for the blockade of the French island bases of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France (now Mauritius) passed from Pellew to Rear-Admiral Albemarle Bertie at the Cape of Good Hope and Pellew was once again free to concentrate against the remainder of the Dutch squadron.Gardiner, p. 82 During the absence of his main force, Admiral Pellew had sent two frigates into Javan waters: Caroline under Captain Peter Rainier and HMS Psyche under his son Captain Fleetwood Pellew. These ships rapidly established the location and the state of the Dutch ships of the line, and then separated to raid Dutch merchant shipping, Psyche having considerable success at Semarang on 31 August when Captain Pellew destroyed two Dutch vessels, and captured three, including the Dutch 24-gun corvette Scipio, which the British renamed Samarang.Henderson, p. 81. Pellew at Griessie When news of the Dutch whereabouts reached Admiral Pellew at Malacca, he immediately assembled a force from nearby warships, including his flagship under Commander George Bell, ship of the line under Fleetwood Pellew,[Note A] the frigates Caroline under Commander Henry Hart and under Captain Archibald Cochrane and the small vessels HMS Victor under Lieutenant Thomas Groube, HMS Samarang under Lieutenant Richard Buck, HMS Seaflower under Lieutenant William Fitzwilliam Owen and under Lieutenant Thomas Langharne. The squadron was accompanied by the Indiaman , which carried 500 men from the 30th Regiment of Foot under Lieutenant-Colonel Lockhart for any landing operations that might be required.Clowes, p. 240 Sailing from Malacca on 20 November, Pellew's squadron passed along the Javan coast for 15 days, reaching Panka Point on 5 December and sending a boat under a flag of truce into Griessie with instructions for the Dutch commander to surrender his ships. Captain Cowell refused, and ordered the boat party to be arrested. He then sent a Dutch officer aboard Culloden to inform Pellew of his actions. In response, Pellew determined to attack the port and ordered that Culloden and Powerful be lightened by the removal of unnecessary stores to enable them to sail into the shallow straits. On 6 December, the British squadron moved steadily towards Griessie through the Madura Strait, coming under fire from heated cannonballs from a battery of nine cannon situated at Sambelangan on Madura Island. Returning fire with his full squadron, Pellew rapidly silenced the battery without loss or significant damage to his ships and as the squadron approached Griessie, a message from the civilian governor in Sourabaya reached Pellew, reversing Cowell's orders, releasing the captured boat party and unconditionally surrendering the ships in the harbour.James, p. 358 On 7 December, Pellew agreed formal terms for the surrender of Revolutie, Pluto, Kortenaar and the Dutch East Indiaman Rustloff that were anchored in Griessie. However, when British boats entered the harbour it was discovered that Cowell had issued orders for all four ships to be scuttled, their wrecks protruding from the shallow water. Unable to remove the ships, Pellew ordered their remains burnt, while British landing parties spread throughout the town, burning the military stores and destroying the cannon that had been removed from the ship. Another landing party took possession of the remains of the battery at Sambelangan and demolished it. British operations were complete by 11 December and Pellew then ordered the squadron to withdraw and return to India.Gardiner, p. 83 Aftermath The final operation of Pellew's Java campaign, completed with minimal casualties on either side, saw the eradication of the Dutch naval presence in the East Indies for the remainder of the war. With the Dutch removed, British attention turned to the French Indian Ocean islands, which were blockaded and captured during the Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811.Gardiner, p. 97 Once Mauritius had been captured, British forces returned to the East Indies, expeditionary forces overwhelming the Dutch defenders on several islands, Java falling last.Gardiner, p. 107 By that time, Pellew was serving in the Mediterranean and British control of the Indian Ocean was assured, the British remaining in possession of the East Indies until they were returned to the Netherlands following the capture of Napoleon and the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 signed at the Convention of London.Gardiner, p. 110 The East Indies were handed over in 1816 after Napoleons final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Notes 1. ^ The former commander of Powerful, Captain Robert Plampin, had returned to Britain in 1807 due to ill health. Pellew's father subsequently ensured his son's elevation to command the ship of the line. Captain Pellew's command was temporary and the following year, once his father had moved to command the Mediterranean Fleet, he was transferred to the frigate .

Journal Of International Migration And Integration, 17(1), 95-113 During the same period of time, this was independent Tibet even the 14th Dalai Lama was approved by China to be exempted from lot-drawing process using Golden Urn in 1940.1940年2月5日，国民政府正式颁发命令：“青海灵童拉木登珠，慧性湛深，灵异特著，查系第十三辈达赖喇嘛转世，应即免予抽签，特准继任为第十四辈达赖喇嘛。此令。”http://www.livingbuddha.us.com/view-a4a452dadc42426184aa073f08dd26fb.html The official religion of Tibet which was formally incorporated into the jurisdiction of China in the Yuan Dynasty in the 13th century, was Buddhism Tibet.Dhussa, R. C. (2009). Tibet: A Nation in Exile. American Geographical Society's Focus On Geography, 52(2), 1-6. In 1950, China occupied Tibet causing the Tibetan government to also be under Chinese jurisdiction. Throughout the years, culture and religion took an impact from Chinese control which was expressed through the ruination of religious statues of Tibet and the destruction of buildings that represented the Tibetan culture In 1959, around 87,000 were killed during Chinese rule. Tibetans that practiced their religion were killed. At least 80 000 Tibetans and the Dalai Lama left Tibet to Nepal but were denied access.Raska, J. (2016). Humanitarian Gesture: Canada and the Tibetan Resettlement Program, 1971-5. Canadian Historical Review, 97(4), 546-575. Then they found refuge in India. India took them, however had difficulty to give imperative services and help needed to Tibetan refugees. However, there were more migration patterns towards India in the 1980s and 1990s. During the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees in 1951, India did not sign this convention. This entailed that Tibetans living in India had little rights and hence tried to find another place for resettlement.  Nomadic lifestyle  Tibetan's nomadic lifestyle was notably present when China had a significant control over the geographical area of Tibet, the Chinese occupation. Therefore, Tibetans started to move and not submitting to this control. This means Tibetans were being displaced within their borders. Tibetan resettlement to Canada In 1970 and 1971, 240 Tibetan refugees settled into Canada from India. The resettlement of Tibetan refugees was viewed by the Canadian government as a pilot project to evaluate what the country would do in the future regarding refugee aid. It was after a direct plea from the Dalai Lama to Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1966 that launched Canada's slow process to bring 60 families into their country. The first Tibetans to arrive from the resettlement group were Tsering Dorjee Wangkhang and Jampa Dorjee Drongotsang when they landed in Toronto on October 15, 1970. The two settled in Batawa, Ontario where the first Tibetan community was planned to be located. Wangkhang and Drongotsang both started working at the Bata shoe factory. Factory owner Thomas Bata had gone to India, one of the countries where Tibetans were exiled, and took the initiative to employ three to four refugees in his company.Dubinsky, Karen, et al. Canada and the Third World: Overlapping Histories. University of Toronto Press, 2016. In 2007, a two-year immigration program to bring 2,000 Tibetan refugees to Canada was organized by Prime Minister Stephen Harper after a plea by the Dalai Lama. The first 21 Tibetans flew from India to Vancouver International Airport and were expected to settle into the Toronto, Ottawa, Vancouver and Sunshine Coast areas.Bradley, A. (2010). Beyond Borders: Cosmopolitanism and Family Reunification for Refugees in Canada. International Journal Of Refugee Law, 22(3), 379-403.  New home in Canada and integration process  Canada originally declined Tibetan refugees to settle as a group, however this changed with consultations and national meeting with the Prime minister, Pierre Elliot Trudeau. This involved the one of the previous high commissioners to India called James George. James George's impact on Pierre Elliot Trudeau helped immigration officials to be more lenient with refuge policies for Tibetans. In the 1960s, the Canadian government accepts Tibetan refugees under a few conditions. These conditions were set under the Tibetan Refugee program. This was an experimental program that would let 228 Tibetans enter Canada quickly and at a lower cost. It took a decade for the first Tibetan migrants to set foot in Canada. The Canadian government officials did not want Tibetans to settle in a group but on individual basis and family basis. This means that only young families and single people coming as laborers were approved to seek refuge in Canada. Additionally, Canadian immigration officials were concerned about Tibetans nomadic lifestyles and establishing/settling themselves as a group. This would pose a challenge on the integration process. If group settlement had been approved, the integration process would have been much more difficult and permanency of integration would also be a challenge for newcomers and pose issues on the governmental level. Canadian immigration officials were worried that it would pose problems. Such problems were isolation and dependence within members of the same ethnic community. Additionally, learning one of the official languages of Canada was another problem that could arise and could affect integration directly (Logan & Murdie, 2014). Moreover, immigration officials chose younger Tibetan immigrants over older immigrant groups because integration would be easier regarding the process of learning one of the official languages. Therefore, finding a job and reaching out if one needs help or services would also be affected positively.Batarseh, R. C. (2016). Inside/Outside the Circle: From the Indochinese Designated Class to Contemporary Group Processing. Refuge (0229-5113), 32(2), 54-66. Tibetan immigrants were also selected from towns and villages because knowing their nomadic lifestyle, immigrant officials wanted Tibetans that had sedentary patterns. Tibetans also needed to have a certain level of high education. Integration was facilitated through “group processing” which involves refugees and the state work together to aid resettlement into Canada.  Parkdale, Toronto  The neighbourhood of Parkdale in Toronto contains the largest concentration of Tibetan immigrants and refugees in Canada. As of the 2006 Canadian Census, around 11% of Parkdale residents were of Tibetan ethnicity, comprising 1,985 persons (62% of Toronto's total Tibetan population and 42% of Tibetans in all of Canada). According to global population estimates, this makes the Parkdale Tibetan community the largest outside of Tibet and its surrounding area.https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/global-nomads- emergence-tibetan-diaspora-part-i Most of the housing in the area consists of high-rise apartment buildings and single-family homes. Compared to much of the Toronto core, rent prices in Parkdale are affordable, and the area provides many amenities and services to recent immigrants and at-risk populations. Additionally, public transit offers accessibility to the city centre of Toronto.  Culture and community  Parkdale's existing Tibetan community and cultural institutions encourage the continued immigration of Tibetans to the neighbourhood, with 64% of Tibetan immigrants citing the existing presence of other Tibetans as a major factor in their decision to settle in the area. Little Tibet is centred around a series of blocks on Queen Street West, consisting of a number of Tibetan restaurants and shops with diverse influences from India, Nepal and China.  Family reunification concerns  Within Parkdale, a significant concern among Tibetan Canadian families is reunification with their relatives. Tibetans living in Canada that have already obtained permanent residency have found difficulty bringing their family members into Canada. Many of the relatives that have been unable to come to Canada live in Nepal and India. Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) states that the Nepalese government is blocking Tibetan peoples that found refuge in Nepal after 1989 from exiting the country. India imposes that Tibetans must have a valid Identity Certificate to exit the country, and the process of obtaining this document can take several years.
