Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that state juries may convict a defendant by a less- than-unanimous verdict in a felony criminal case.. The four-justice plurality opinion of the court, written by Justice White, affirmed the judgment of the Oregon Court of Appeals, and held that there was no constitutional right to a unanimous verdict. Although federal law requires federal juries to reach criminal verdicts unanimously,Fed. R. Crim. P. 31. the Court held Oregon's practice did not violate the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury and so allowed it to continue. In Johnson v. Louisiana, a case decided on the same day, the Court held that Louisiana's similar practice of allowing criminal convictions by a jury vote of 9‚Äì3 did not violate due process or equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.. Justice Powell, in his concurring opinion, argued that there was a constitutional right to a unanimous jury in the Sixth Amendment, but that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not incorporate that right as applied to the states. This case is part of a line of cases interpreting if and how the Sixth Amendment is applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment for the purposes of incorporation doctrine, although the division of opinions prevented a clear-cut answer to that question in this case. Apodaca v. Oregon was overruled by Ramos v. Louisiana (2020)..  Background on non-unanimous jury verdicts  Federal law requires that juries return a unanimous verdict‚Äîone that all members of the jury agree upon‚Äîin criminal trials. While most states follow the same requirement for felony convictions, at the time when Apodaca reached the U.S. Supreme Court, neither Oregon nor Louisiana required state court juries to return unanimous verdicts. Oregon created its rule in 1934 by state constitutional amendment.Voters' pamphlet, State of Oregon special election (May 18, 1934), https://digital.osl.state.or.us/islandora/object/osl%3A64497/datastream/OBJ/view.\\"Introduction and Measure Listings, 1902-2018,\\" 2019-2020 Oregon Blue Book: Almanac & Fact Book, https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Documents/elections/initiative.pdf. Specifically, as long as at least 10 jurors on a 12-member jury agreed, the jury could render a verdict of guilty or not guilty.Voters added a provision that allows \\"that in the circuit court ten members of the jury may render a verdict of guilty or not guilty, save and except a verdict of guilty for first degree murder, which shall be found only by unanimous verdict.\\" OR. CONST. art I, ¬ß 11. The Louisiana Legislature passed a similar \\"Majority Rule\\" law in 1880, allowing for jury verdicts of 9‚Äì3, which was later ratified at its 1898 constitutional convention.\\"Timeline: Louisiana's split-verdict jury law and its racist, white supremacist roots,\\" The Advocate (Apr. 7, 2011), https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/courts/article_5db560ac-3a8e-11e8-b5de-874f8cdde5a5.html In 2018, Louisiana voters passed a constitutional amendment that ended their practice of non-unanimous juries.Amended Louisiana Constitution, Art. I, ¬ß 17. When Apodaca was overruled by Ramos v. Louisiana in April 2020, Oregon was the only state that still allowed non-unanimous jury verdicts for felonies (although first-degree murder convictions require a unanimous jury verdict).  Facts and procedural posture  Robert Apodaca, Henry Morgan Cooper, Jr., and James Arnold Madden, were convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, burglary in a dwelling, and grand larceny, respectively, in separate trials in Oregon state court.Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 405‚Äì06. All three juries returned non- unanimous verdicts: Apodaca and Madden's juries voted 11‚Äì1 to convict, and Cooper's jury voted 10‚Äì2. They appealed their convictions to the Court of Appeals of Oregon, arguing that they were entitled to have the jury instructed that jurors must unanimously agree to convict.State v. Plumes, 1 Or. App. 483, 484 (1969), aff'd sub nom. Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972). The Court of Appeals of Oregon, sitting in banc, affirmed their convictions. In doing so, the court relied on a previous Oregon Supreme Court case, State v. Gann, 254 Or. 549 (1969), that had upheld the provision of the Oregon Constitution allowing the 10‚Äì2 jury practice as not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.State v. Gann, 463 P.2d 570 (1969). The Oregon Supreme Court denied review, and the three sought review in the U.S. Supreme Court. In Johnson v. Louisiana (a case decided by the Supreme Court on the same day as Apodaca), a criminal defendant in Louisiana raised the same issue: whether a less-than- unanimous jury verdict in state court criminal cases violates a defendant's constitutional rights.Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, Oral Argument,https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970/69-5035. Frank Johnson was convicted of armed robbery by a Louisiana state court jury verdict of 9‚Äì3, which was permissible under Louisiana law. However, unlike in Apodaca, where petitioners argued that this practice violated their Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial (as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment), the petitioner in Johnson raised Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and due process claims. The Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed his conviction, holding that a 9‚Äì3 jury verdict did not violate his equal protection or due process rights.State v. Johnson, 255 La. 314 (1970), aff'd, 406 U.S. 356 (1972). Johnson petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review. Both Apodaca and Johnson were argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on March 1, 1971, and reargued on January 10, 1972.Apodaca v. Oregon, Oyez, https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/69-5046; Johnson v. Louisiana, Oyez, https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970/69-5035. Arguing the case for the state of Oregon were Jacob Tanzer and Lee Johnson; both would later serve on the Oregon Court of Appeals. The Court decided both cases on May 22, 1972, and upheld the Oregon and Louisiana non-unanimous jury convictions.  U.S. Supreme Court decision and reasoning  First, the Supreme Court held that the constitutional right to trial by jury found in the Sixth Amendment (made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.) was not violated by a less-than-unanimous jury verdict in state criminal court.Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 414. The Court likened jury unanimity to the 12-person requirement for juries. In Williams v. Florida, decided just four years before Apodaca, the Court held that Florida's refusal to impanel more than six members for a jury trial did not violate the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. Although the Court in Williams recognized a long common law tradition of having 12-member juries, it stated, \\"[w]e conclude, in short, as we began: the fact that the jury at common law was composed of precisely 12 is a historical accident.\\". The Court in Apodaca drew parallels between the 12-member requirement and the unanimous requirement: both \\"arose during the Middle Ages and had become an accepted feature of the common-law jury by the 18th century.\\"Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 407. And yet neither a 12-member jury nor jury unanimity, the Court held, were constitutional requirements. In its reasoning, the Court recognized, as it did in Duncan and Williams, that the purposes of a jury included to \\"safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge,\\" and to inject into the trial \\"commonsense judgment of a group of laymen.\\"Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 410. But the Court found that these purposes could still be accomplished even if a jury returned a less-than-unanimous verdict. Moreover, the Court reasoned, requiring unanimity would simply produce more hung juries.Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 411. The Court also rejected the argument that unanimity would protect the reasonable-doubt standard. If some jurors voted to acquit, the petitioners argued, they could not have been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But the Court rejected the idea that this requirement is found in the Sixth Amendment, because the reasonable-doubt standard arose after the Constitution was written and is instead rooted in due process.Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 410-11. Second, the Court also held that jury unanimity is not mandated by the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement that racial minorities not be systemically excluded during voir dire, the process by which jurors are chosen for a trial.Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 404. Petitioners had argued that allowing non- unanimous jury verdicts skirts the requirement to not exclude minorities because the majority could simply out-vote minority members of the jury by 10‚Äì2 or 11‚Äì1. In rejecting this argument, the Court first said that defendants do not have a right to have members of their community on their particular jury, but rather that minority members simply cannot be systematically excluded from juries. Next, the Court said that even if racial minorities found themselves in a jury minority, the rest of the jury would hear their voices and that there is \\"no proof for the notion that a majority will disregard its instructions and cast its votes for guilt or innocence based on prejudice rather than the evidence.\\"Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 413-14.  Concurrences and dissents  The four-justice plurality decided that federal and state juries should operate in the same way‚Äîand that the constitution does not require jury unanimity in either court system. The four dissenting justices agreed that federal and state juries should abide by the same rules‚Äîbut argued that the constitution does require jury unanimity. Justice Powell concurred with the plurality opinion, determining that the Sixth Amendment mandated jury unanimity in federal trials but not in state trials, because he found that the Fourteenth Amendment did not incorporate that right as applied to the states. Because the Court's decision garnered support from only four justices‚Äîa plurality, rather than a majority‚ÄîJustice Powell's narrower concurrence controls, and is what must be followed by state courts.. Because Apodaca and Johnson presented the same question, the Court decided both cases on the same day and some of the justices' opinions apply to both cases. In Apodaca, Justice White wrote the plurality opinion of the court, which was joined by Chief Justice Burger, Justice Blackmun, and Justice Rehnquist.Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 404 (White, J., plurality opinion). Justice Stewart dissented, and Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall joined that dissent.Apodaca, 406 U.S. at 414 (Stewart, J., dissenting). Similarly, in Johnson, Justice White wrote the opinion of the Court,Johnson, 406 U.S. at 357 (White, J., opinion). and Justice Stewart filed a dissenting opinion, which Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall joined.Johnson, 406 U.S. at 397 (Stewart, J., dissenting). There were five other written opinions that applied to both Apodaca and Johnson. Justice Blackmun and Justice Powell each wrote a concurring opinion; and Justices Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall each wrote a dissent (Justice Douglas's dissent was joined by Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall; Justices Brennan and Marshall joined each other's dissents).For Mr. Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion, see 92 S.Ct. 1635. For Mr. Justice Powell's opinion concurring in judgment, see 92 S.Ct. 1635. For Mr. Justice Douglas' dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall joined, see 92 S.Ct. 1643.

For Mr. Justice Marshall's dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brennan joined, see 92 S.Ct. 1651.  Controversial history  Recent scholarly debate has focused on the historical origins of Oregon and Louisiana's less-than- unanimous jury practices. Oregon's constitutional amendment was put on the ballot a year after a lone holdout juror prevented a Jewish man from being found guilty of murdering a Protestant one. On Nov. 25, 1933, the day after the jury convicted on the lesser offense of manslaughter (resulting in a three-year sentence), The Morning Oregonian \\"railed against the juror in an editorial tinged with racist undertones and nativist fervor,\\" in which the editors wrote that \\"the vast immigration into America from southern and eastern Europe, of people untrained in the jury system, have combined to make the jury of twelve increasingly unwieldy and unsatisfactory.\\" Previous editorials around the same time \\"bemoaned 'mixed-blood' jurors and lamented the role that some immigrants played on juries, questioning their 'sense of responsibility' and 'views on crime and punishment.'\\" The Oregon constitutional amendment passed on May 18, 1934. In the 1990s, an Oregon study found that too few minorities were called for jury duty, even fewer served on juries, and preemptory challenges were being used based on race.Amy Saack & Aliza B Kaplan, \\"Overturning Apodaca v. Oregon Should Be Easy: Nonunanimous Jury Verdicts in Criminal Cases Undermine the Credibility of Our Justice System.\\" Rochester, NY. (citing \\"The Oregon Supreme Court Task Force on Racial/Ethnic Issues in Judicial System, May 1994 Report (1994), https://digital.osl.state.or.us/islandora/object/osl:25704). Furthermore, other studies show that non-unanimous juries make it more likely that minority members on a jury can be out-voted.Amy Saack & Aliza B Kaplan, \\"Overturning Apodaca v. Oregon Should Be Easy: Nonunanimous Jury Verdicts in Criminal Cases Undermine the Credibility of Our Justice System.\\" Rochester, NY. (citing American Bar Association, \\"Principles for Juries and Jury Trials with Commentary,\\" at 24 (2005) (‚ÄúA non-unanimous decision rule allows juries to reach a quorum without seriously considering minority voices, thereby effectively silencing those voices and negating their participation.‚Äù)). The Supreme Court in Apodaca had considered this issue, but hypothesized that the majority would still carefully consider the objections of minority jurors before overruling them. The Court lent further support to the states' non- unanimous jury verdict systems by saying that they helped prevent hung juries with holdouts who refuse to convict‚Äìor acquit. Because this rule can go either way, it could benefit some defendants who will be acquitted of a crime instead of having to go through another trial. Louisiana's legislature changed its Code of Practice to allow for non-unanimous jury verdicts in 1880, during the Jim Crow era. Louisiana's white land owners struggled to replace free slave labor, and the state began leasing convicts to plantation owners. During the 1898 Louisiana constitutional convention, the Louisiana legislature ratified the split verdict law, making it possible to convict defendants on a jury verdict of 9‚Äì3. This, in turn, created more convicts (especially freed blacks), and thus increased the numbers available for for-profit convict leasing. Louisiana officially ended its non-unanimous jury verdict system by constitutional amendment in 2018. Scholars and politicians had argued that Oregon should also end its practice.Amy Saack & Aliza B Kaplan, \\"Overturning Apodaca v. Oregon Should Be Easy: Nonunanimous Jury Verdicts in Criminal Cases Undermine the Credibility of Our Justice System.\\" Rochester, NY. On April 20, 2020, the Supreme Court overruled Apodaca v.

Since a MPS drives much factory activity, its accuracy and viability dramatically affect profitability. Typical MPSs are created by software with user tweaking. Due to software limitations, but especially the intense work required by the \\"master production schedulers\\", schedules do not include every aspect of production, but only key elements that have proven their control effectivity, such as forecast demand, production costs, inventory costs, lead time, working hours, capacity, inventory levels, available storage, and parts supply. The choice of what to model varies among companies and factories. The MPS is a statement of what the company expects to produce and purchase (i.e. quantity to be produced, staffing levels, dates, available to promise, projected balance). The MPS translates the customer demand (sales orders, PIR‚Äôs), into a build plan using planned orders in a true component scheduling environment. Using MPS helps avoid shortages, costly expediting, last minute scheduling, and inefficient allocation of resources. Working with MPS allows businesses to consolidate planned parts, produce master schedules and forecasts for any level of the Bill of Material (BOM) for any type of part.  How an MPS works  By using many variables as inputs the MPS will generate a set of outputs used for decision making. Inputs may include forecast demand, production costs, inventory money, customer needs, inventory progress, supply, lot size, production lead time, and capacity. Inputs may be automatically generated by an ERP system that links a sales department with a production department. For instance, when the sales department records a sale, the forecast demand may be automatically shifted to meet the new demand. Inputs may also be inputted manually from forecasts that have also been calculated manually. Outputs may include amounts to be produced, staffing levels, quantity available to promise, and projected available balance. Outputs may be used to create a Material Requirements Planning (MRP) schedule. A master production schedule may be necessary for organizations to synchronize their operations and become more efficient. An effective MPS ultimately will: * Give production, planning, purchasing, and management the information to plan and control manufacturing * Tie overall business planning and forecasting to detail operations * Enable marketing to make legitimate delivery commitments to warehouses and customers * Increase the efficiency and accuracy of a company's manufacturing * Rough cut capacity planning MPS issues: * Width of the time bucket * Planning horizon * Rolling plan * Time fencing * Schedule freezing  Production plan  An example of a master production schedule for \\"product A\\".

Ural-batyr or Ural-batƒ±r (, pronounced , from Ural + Turkic batƒ±r - \\"hero, brave man\\") is the most famous kubair (epic poem) of the Bashkirs. It is telling of heroic deeds and legendary creatures, the formation of natural phenomena, and so on.Round table of the magazine \\"Belsky open spaces\\" : the reality of the myth. To the 100th anniversary of the opening of the epic \\" Ural-Batyr¬ª The Ural Mountains It is analog many similar epics (the Anglo- Saxon Beowulf, the Germanic Nibelungenlied, the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh, or the Finnish/Karelian Kalevala). The epic poem propagates the idea of the nation's eternal life and the ability of man to vanquish evil. Plot Based on the Turkic and Iranic folk song traditions, the poem narrates about the heroic deeds of Ural-batyr. Ural is born to an elderly couple, Yanbike and Yanbir√∞e.T√ºrk S√∂ylence S√∂zl√ºƒü√º (Turkish Mythological Dictionary), Deniz Karakurt, (OTRS: CC BY-SA 3.0) Yan (from Persian word ÿ¨ÿßŸÜ jan, meaning \\"soul\\"), and Yanbir√∞e means \\"Given Soul\\", while Yanbike means \\"Woman of Soul\\" . Ural evinces from his very infancy all the features of a legendary hero, such as unflinching courage, honesty, kindheartedness, empathy, and great physical strength. Unlike his cunning and treacherous brother Shulgan (see Sulgan-tash), Ural is an eager enemy of the evil and of Death which personifies it. Having matured, Ural sets out on the quest for Death, with the desire to find and destroy Him. On his way, he meets with various people and legendary creatures and is often deferred by long adventures; in all cases, his actions serve to save lives or quell the evil. Riding his winged stallion Akbuthat (or Akbuz At; White-Grey Horse),Kafkas Nart Destanlarƒ±nda At Motifi, Ufuk Tavkul he saves young men and women prepared for sacrifice by the tyrannical Shah Katil from imminent death, tames a wild bull, destroys an immense number of devs, marries the legendary Humai (from Persian ŸáŸÖÿß€å Humay), a swan-maid, and finally smites the chief dev (from Persian ÿØ€åŸà div) Azraka, whose dead body is said to have formed Mount Yaman-tau in the South Urals. Ural-batyr perishes in his final grapple with the devs, as he is forced to drink up a whole lake where they had hidden from him, but he leaves his sons to continue his initiative.  History  The poem, originally existing solely in the oral form of a song, was set in the written form by the Bashkir folk poet Mukhamedsha Burangulov in 1910. This story is very ancient, and reminds of some of stories from Babylon and Sumer. The epos reproduces some pre- Biblical story about Kain and Abel. There are traces of Iranian civilization in Bashkort and Tatar cultures, as some words and names of cities and people. The epic was transmitted orally from generation to generation by storytellers - sesens. In 1910, Mukhamedsha Burangulov recorded an epic from two kuraist musician) and sesens (poet), Gabit Argynbaev (‚âà 1850 - 1921) from the –∞ul(village) of Idris and Khamit Almukhametov (1861 - 1923) from village of Malyi Itkul (volost Itkulskaya of the Orenburg province).Researchers believe that M. Burangulov came to sesens more than once, wrote down the epic in parts. Researchers found that both storyteller came from the Burzyan clan. Both sesen well knew the area around the Shulgantash cave (Kapova cave) and Lakes Shulgankul, Yylkysykkankul (they are described in the epic). Gabit- sesen‚Äôs grandfather Argynbay moved from the highlands of Burzyan to the steppe region. Both sesen were in kinship. There are known other versions of the epic. A fairy tale of the same name in prose was recorded in 1956 by Ismagil Rakhmatullin in the village of Imangul in the Uchalinsky district of Bashkorostan by researcher Akhnaf Kharisov (published by him in the same year). The version, conventionally referred to as an \`\` etiological myth , was recorded in 1984 from Shamsia Safargalina in the village of Gabbas, Zianchurinsky district of Bashkortostan. In 1968, the epic \\"Ural-Batyr\\" was published in the Bashkir language in the journal \\"Agidel\\" in 1968 with abbreviations (prepared by B. Bikbai and A. Kharisov). In 1972, the first full publication in the Bashkir language took place ‚Äî in the first volume of the book series ‚ÄúBashkir Folk Oeuvre‚Äù. In 1975, it was published in the first volume of the collection ‚ÄúHeroic Epic of the Peoples of the USSR‚Äù in the series ‚ÄúLibrary of World Literature‚Äù (translation by A. Kh. Khakimov, I. S. Kychakov, A. S. Mirbadalev), and also in the series ‚Äú The Epos of the Peoples of the USSR ‚Äù(per. A. Kh. Khakimov, N. V. Kidysh-Pokrovskaya, A. S. Mirbadalev) in abbreviated form. For the first time, the profound originality of the epic ‚ÄúUral-Batyr‚Äù was announced in the works of A. A. Petrosyan. She was the first of the researchers to discover a plot similarity between the Bashkir epic and the Sumerian-Akkadian epic about Gilgamesh. But she came to the conclusion that there are deep differences in the ideological and artistic concepts of these works: ‚ÄúThe main motive of the epic‚Äú Ural-Batyr ‚Äùis that man is stronger than all that is , good is indestructible. The Babylonian epic rests on another idea - everything from the will of the gods. '' The philosopher Damir Valeyev considered the epos ‚Äúa source for studying the history of social consciousness and social thought of the Bashkirs‚Äù. There are several translations of the epic into Russian - both interlinear and poetic. Translations into Russian were made by several writers and poets. The prose arrangement of the epic was performed by the writer Aidar Khusainov, the poetic translation into Russian was done by the poet Gazim Shafikov. In 2003, a gift edition of the epos was published in Ufa in three languages (Bashkir original, Russian translation by G. G. Shafikov and English translation by S. G. Shafikov). In 2006, Ural-Batyr was published in German, translated by the doctor of philology Aliya Taysina (Germany) (Ural-Batir: Das baschkirische Volksepos in der √úbersetzung von Alia Taissina mit Illustrationen von Rais Khalilov. Taschenbuch: 108 Seiten, Auflage: 1, Sprache: Deutsch, , ). Mount Iremel. The epos \\"Ural-Batyr\\" has also been translated into other languages of the world (Abkhazian, Hebrew, Turkish, Chuvash , French and others). In 2007, the original text of the Ural-Batyr was first published (–®–∞–∫—É—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –®. –†. ¬´ –ë–∞—à–∫–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π —ç–ø–æ—Å ¬´–£—Ä–∞–ª-–ë–∞—Ç—ã—Ä¬ª. –ê—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–Ω—ã–π –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫ –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑. –£—Ñ–∞: –ì–∏–ª–µ–º, 2007). In 2013, the Ural-Batyr was published in three books, in Bashkir and Russian (translation by A. Kh. Khakimov), in Bashkir and French (translation by R. K. Garipov), in English and Bashkir (translation by Z. A. Rakhimova) languages. All previous publications of the epic contained distortions. The reasons for the uncritical publication of the epic lie in the Soviet practice of distorting monuments of folk art, in the persecution of Bashkir scholars (Mukhametsha Burangulov was twice arrested and was in prison). The manuscript of the epic is lost. The decisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the Bashkir party organization banned a number of folklore monuments. However, despite the repression, the epic ‚ÄúUral-Batyr‚Äù miraculously survived. After his release, M. Burangulov fought for the right to be creative and defended the works of Bashkir folklore. The original in a typewritten copy in Latin script (verses with prosaic inserts) with several handwritten corrections (probably by M. Burangulov himself) is stored in the Scientific Archive of the Ufa Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Scientists continue to study the epic \\"Ural-Batyr\\" in-depth at the intersection of archeology, ethnography, linguistic folkloristics. Along with folklorists, the Bashkir archaeologists, linguists, philosophers, and ethnographers also studied the epic Ural-Batyr (G.B. Khusainov, D.Zh. Valeev, Z.Ya. Rakhmatullina, A. Kh. Davletkulov, Z.G. Aminev , F. B. Sanyarov, G. Kh. Bukharova, V. G. Kotov). In 2011, the bibliographic index ‚ÄúBashkir National Cubair (Epic)‚Äú Ural-Batyr ‚Äù‚Äù was released, which presents a list of materials reflecting the results of a comprehensive study of the epic (publications from the publication of its text in a journal version in 1968 to our time). In Bashkortostan, much is being done to popularize the epic. The performance ‚ÄúUral-Batyr‚Äù was staged at the Bashkir Academic Drama Theater named after M. Gafuri, the popular science film ‚ÄúIn Search of Akbuzat‚Äù was created, the tourist project ‚ÄúThe Golden Ring of Bashkortostan: the roads of the epic‚Äú Ural-Batyr ‚Äùwas developed. Every year, a contest is held for the best reciters of the epic in Bashkir and other languages. Performances based on the epic are included in the repertoire of the Bashkir State Puppet Theater (in Bashkir and Russian). In 2010, by order of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation, the director and screenwriter A. Lukichev shot the animated film Ural-Batyr based on the Bashkir epic (14.01 min., Moscow). The epic \\"Ural-Batyr\\" is one of the \\"Seven Wonders of Bashkortostan\\". The epic is included in the TURKSOY List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Agidel River (Belaya)  URAL-BATYR (content)  The theme of the legend, despite a significant element of fairy-tale fantasy, is heroic-epic. Introductory part Ural-Batyr is clearly divided into several parts. In the introductory part of the work, the most ancient strata are preserved: echoes of the legends of the global flood, the revival of life on earth after the flood, the first couple of people that laid the foundation for the human race. Old men Yanbeerde and Yanbeeke with their sons (Shulgan and Ural) settle on a small patch of land surrounded on all sides by the sea. Assistants to Yanbeerde and Yanbeeke are animals: gyrfalkon , lion, pike. Ural sometimes turns to birds and animals for advice. Ural and Schulgen personify two opposing principles - good and evil - which lead an irreconcilable struggle between themselves. Before going hunting, parents drink the blood of animals, which gives them strength. Parents forbid them to do this until they become Yegets (adult fellow). *How Schulgen violated his father's ban Schulgen went against the ban of his father and drank the blood of animals. *How Yanbeeke and Yanbeerde returned home Parents return from hunting, bring a lot of game. Ural asks his father how he managed to kill a deer. The Urals finds out that there is Death. But in these places Death did not appear. There is no power that can kill a person. It turns out that there are still other people on Earth (contrary to the beginning of the epic). *How Yaneerde discovered that someone drank from shells and what came of it Yanbeerde was terribly angry with his sons when he learned that one of them had tasted blood from a shell. He brutally beat Shulgan. *What animals and birds said when they gathered at the call of Yanbeerd–µ Yanbeerde cannot recover from the shock. Ural delivers a speech in front of animals and birds. He offers to stop offending the weak, stop eating each other's meat. Then Death will remain alone and it can be destroyed. The crow is not afraid of Death. It offers the weak themselves to seek the path to salvation, to hide in a safe place. *How the white swan was caught Yanbeerde and Yanbeeke began to hunt with their sons. Among the prey is a white swan (totem for the Bashkirs). This is the daughter of the Sun, Homay, her father is the heavenly king of birds Samrau (in Iranian mythology Semurg). The swan promises to show the path to the Living Spring (Yenshishma, water). Ural stood up for the bird. But the old man and his sons did not manage to know the way to the Living Spring (water). Yanbeerde gives his sons powerful lions and sends them to look for the way to the Living Spring (water). If they meet Death on the way, they must cut off its head and bring her home. (There are many mineral springs, water, in the Urals) Part 1 *Ural and Schulgen meet the old man and cast lots Years passed. The brothers have matured. Once he met on his way an old man with a long staff. The brothers asked the old man to show them the way to the Living Spring. He indicated two roads: to the right is the land of King Samrau (the land of eternal happiness and good), and to the right is the land of King Katil (the land of eternal grief and evil). Shulgan decided to go to the kingdom of Samrau (although he fell to another lot ). Ural had to go to the kingdom of Katil. *How Ural Batyr came to the country of padishah Katil In the kingdom of Katil, Ural meets unfortunate people who tell him about the atrocities of the cruel king (the old woman, her daughter, the old man). Then he himself sees Katil donate people to the lake and to the fire (Perhaps these were the memories of the Bashkirs about the brutality of foreign invaders). *How Ural Batyr met Padishah Katil\`s daughter Ural meets a huge crowd of naked people, guards beat them with whips. Katil\`s daughter chooses Ural as her husband, gives him a Golden Apple. Ural refuses to become her husband. Slaves carry King Catilus, seated on a throne. He is very fat, like a fat boar. His eyes are bloodshot. In the legend there is no scene of the struggle of Ural with the padishah Katil. Ural fights one on one with its huge bull, and then - with the four strongest heroes of the padishah. In a duel with a bull, Ural bend horns, and they remain forever bent; the hero knocks out the upper tooth to the bull, and he will never grow back; he tears the hooves of the animal, and they never grow together (an etiological motive). The hero says that now the bull and his tribe will become slaves of man. Katil and his guard scatter in an unknown direction. The people are asking Ural to marry the daughter of Katil and become their padishah. Mount Yamantau. 1640 –º Part 2 *How Ural-Batyr met Zarkum Ural- Batyr meets Zarkum, the son of the King of serpents Kahkaha, who wants to marry the daughter of King Samrau. Zarkum gives Ural the secret of his father.At the request of Zarkum, he broke off the deer horns and Zarkum swallowed the deer. Zarkum turned into a handsome young man. He wants to marry Homay. *How Ural-Batyr and Zarkum arrived in the serpent kingdom In the palace of Kahkaha, a snake with nine heads wants to swallow Ural. But Ural hit it the main head with a sword and the keys fell out. Ural hit other heads and eight heroes came out from there, swallowed by a snake. The key to the palace of secrets fell from the heart of the serpent. *How Ural-Batyr entered the palace of secrets Ural opened the palace with a magic key, saw a girl on the throne, took the magic staff of Kahkaha. Kahkaha calls all the snakes for help. But Ural Batyr defeated them. Kahkaha pretended to admit defeat. Ural allows people to elect themselves the new ruler (Algur). The old hero Algur asks Ural to marry a beautiful girl (Gulistan) from the palace and leave his offspring to the people (¬´Tul alu¬ª, getting the hero‚Äôs genetic material to strengthen the folk is an ancient tradition). Part 3 * Schulgen meets a handsome young man Shulgen (Ural\`s brother) met a handsome forever young man picking flowers and was glad that he would soon be in the country of eternal happiness and youth. *How did Schulgen get to a happy country Schulgen got to happy countrie, wanted to catch fish, but saw that no one was attacking each other here, everyone was living peacefully. Schulgen decided to go to the Living Spring and arrange a lunch here on his way back. Urals. Maunt Kumardak *How Schulgen met Zarkum Schulgen met the handsome young man again.

He tricked Shulgen into going into the kingdom of Azraka, the king of divas, fantastic giants. *How Shulgen and Zarkum arrived in the kingdom of Padishah Azraka Zarkum agrees with Azraka secretly from Shulgen on how to kill Ural. To do this, you need to seize the winged horse Akbuzat. The divas who tried to bring Akbuzat to Azraka\`s palace were thrown by the horse high into the sky. So there was Constellation Yetegan (the Constellation of the Big dipper). If the daughter of the king of birds Samrau falls in love with Shulgen, then she will give him Akbuzat and a magic sword. The divas need them to destroy Ural, the worst enemy of the divas. *How Shulgen entered the palace of the padishah of divas Azraka Azraka warmly welcomes Schulgen, treats him in his palace, gives rich gifts. Shulgen is offered to marry the \\"daughter\\" of Azraka. But it‚Äôs actually Ayhƒ±lu , the daughter of Samrau (the king of birds), captive of Azraka. *As Azraka spoke with Shulgen and Zarkum Azraka tells Shulgen and Zarkum about the magic horse Akbuzat, a damask sword that is not given to everyone and the most beautiful girl in the world - Homay. Zarkum and Schulgen decide to go in search of them in order to become stronger than everyone else. *How Shulgen and Zarkum met Homay Divas brought Shulgen and Zarkum to the kingdom of Samrau. They ended up in a flock of birds (girls). One of them is Homay. She throw Shulgen and Zarkum into different pits. Homay recognizes Shulgen and scoldes him for choosing a snake as his friend. To become free, Schulgen must learn to choose his friends, open his heart to love. *How Homay met Ural- Batyr Homay joyfully meets Ural.Ural- Batyr did not recognize her. He asks to show him the way to the Living Spring. Homay asks to find an unusual bird, promises to give him the horse Akbuzat and a magic sword. *How Ural Batyr found an unprecedented bird Ural goes in search of the unusual bird and finds an amazing bird. She turns into a fish, then a bird, then a girl. This is Aihylu. She tells her story, promises hero her horse Harisay (Yellow) . Ural brings Aihilu to the palace of her father, King Samrau. Samrau sends Aihylu to her mother Ai (Moon, Selene) so that the divas do not find her. *How the Ural-Batyr learned that his love is Homay Ural- Batyr recognized the swan saved by him in the mistress of the palace. He asks Homay to fulfill his promise. Homay goes to his father. Padishah Samrau allows his daughter to give Ural the horse Akbuzat and damask sword. He wants to marry Ural to his daughter Homay. She must give birth to a hero like the Urals. Samrau asks to release Shulgen on the occasion of the wedding of Ural and Homay. *How did the Ural-Batyr and Shulgen meet Ural is happy seeing his brother. Homay does not tell him that Shulgen came to the kingdom of Samrau with Zarkum, that he is friends with the divas. Shulgen intendes to take away the winged horse, the magic sword and the Padishah\`s daughter Homay from Ural . At a festival hosted by Homay, men must show their strength.The Padishah's daughter will choose a winner as her husband . *How Ural-Batyr and Shulgen competed on the Maidan At the call of Homay, Akbuzat (the winged horse) descends from the sky. A damask sword is attached to his saddle. How beautiful was this unusual horse! Heroes must raise a huge stone. Shulgan was unable to raise the stone. Ural Batyr easily lifted the stone and threw it high into the sky. The stone was lost sight of until evening. The Ural caught this stone just as easily and threw it strongly towards the kingdom of Azraka. *How Schulgen regained his wife Shulgan hates deeply his brother. Ural sees the misfortune of his elder brother, but does not know what was going on in his soul. Together with Homay, they persuade Padishah Samrau to marry Shulgen on Aihylu. Aihylu falls from the sky to the ground like a ball of fire. The wedding continues. Homay and Aihylu are endowed with the properties of peri- traditional female images in Turkic mythology. The crane (Aihylu) is a totem of the Bashkir people *How the Ural-Batyr gave his staff to Shulgen and what came of it Shulgen asks Ural to give him the magic staff, then striking with the staff on the ground, disappears. Water pours from the bowls and floods everything around. Zarkum turns into a huge fish and swallowed Homay. The sun (mother of Homay) ceases to shine without Homay. Akbuzat blocks the way to a turbulent stream, Zarkum releases Homay from his mouth. Ural- Batyr learns that his brother has become an enemy. The sun is shining again, because Homay is saved. *Zarkum and Shulgen again at the padishah of divas Shulgen and Zarkum returned to the kingdom of Azraka. Azraka recognized his staff in Shulgen‚Äôs hand and decided to return it in any way. Azraka, Zarkum, Kahkaha, Shulgen decided to start a war against Ural and Samrau. *How the war with the divas began From all sides divas attacked the earth. There was water all around, the sky was all on fire. Ural said goodbye to Homay, jumped on Akbuzat, picked up his magic sword and went to war with the padishah of divas, to save the life on earth. *How did the padishah Azraka find his end Ural- Batyr fought for a long time with the padishah of divas Azraka. The faithful horse Akbuzat has repeatedly saved the hero during the battle. Ural- Batyr hit with a damask sword and cut Azraka in two. He screamed and his body fell into the sea. At this point Mount Yaman-tau (the Terrible Mountain) grew. Where Ural rode on a horse, the water receded, a mountain rose. People who miraculously escaped during the flood began to settle here. *Ural- Batyr meets his sons For many years, Ural Batyr fought with the divas. Their bodies became mountains. People are trying to establish life in these mountains, sticking out in the middle of the sea. Ural are pursuing the remaining divas, suddenly a small detachment of eight people appears. One of the youths takes off his helmet and greets Ural- Batyr. *What did his sons tell the Ural Batyr Young men call names of their mothers. Ural-Batyr hugs its sons: Nugush (Gulistan\`s son), Yaik (son of daughter Katil), Idel (son of Homay). With them was the son of Shulgen and Aihylu- Hakmar. Sons tell Ural how they learned about their father. Nugush destroyed Zarkum himself, the son of the serpent king. Aihylu sent her son (riding a horse Harysay) along with Idel. Ural is glad that he had assistants in the fight against Death and Evil. *How was Kahkaha defeated Kahkaha ravages human dwellings for many years. No one could handle him. He learned about the death of Azraka and Zarkum. I decided to come out of the ground and check what is happening on the ground. He believed that Ural died during the flood. But Ural-Batyr, together with his sons, attacked Kahkaha and cut him to pieces. The heroes built a new mountain out of Kahkaha\`s body, dividing the sea into two parts. *The battle with Shulgen Shulgen led the army of divas and snakes. He has Kahkaha's magic staff in his hand, that staff fired with fire. But Ural-Batyr dodged, hit the staff with a damask sword, the magic staff exploded and the magic sea immediately disappeared. Divas hid in a fright of someone somewhere. Ural- Batyr seized Shulgen and tied him. Hakmar (Shulgen\`s son) wanted to chop off Shulgen‚Äôs head, but the Urals did not allow him to do this. *The trial of Schulgen The trial of Schulgen. Ural reminds him of how he disobeyed his father and his mother; he had drunk the blood of animals, despite the ban. Evil then settled in the heart of Schulgen, he began to be friends with snakes and divas and harm people, responded to Good with Evil. Shulgen asks for permission to wash his face in lake water. He asks Ural to forgive him again, promises to be a friend of people. For the sake of his father and mother, Ural forgive Schulgen for the last time and let him go. *How the Ural- Batyr met the immortal Everyone rejoices in victory. The Ural- Batyr invites everyone to defeat Death, collect water from the Living Spring (water) and distribute it to people. But an old man appears who drank water from the Living Spring (water) and is forced to live forever. He is suffering greatly.The old man says that people don\`t need to drink Living water, –ænly Good can be eternal. The great meaning of life was revealed to Ural. With one mighty sip of water he collectes water from the Living Spring (water) and does not drink it, but irrigates lifeless land. Suddenly everything turns green, flowers bloom. May our land shine, may our country be worthy of love, says Ural- Batyr. The swan (Homay) is a totem of the Bashkir people *Schulgen starts evil deeds again Schulgen found out that there was no longer the Living Spring (water) and decided to start harming people again. In the underworld, he began to collect divas and kites under his own authority. People enjoyed a happy life for a short time, people began to disappear again. Shulgen went against the people again. Ural- Batyr decided to punish Shulgen and destroy all the divas. He drank a lake in which divas hid. Together with water, he drank all the snakes and divas that began to gnaw at his heart and liver. Ural spat out that lake, itself fell without strength. Divas were destroyed by the sons of Ural, but forces left the Hero. Ural-Batyr feels its end is approaching. He bequeaths to his descendants not to take evil in fellow travelers, always take advice from elders, from wise people, give advice to younger ones and help them. (Olono olo itep, Kenesh alyp yorogoz. Kesene kese itep, kenesh birep yorogoz). Bashkirs Do not shun Good, do not give in to Evil! So said Ural- Batyr and died. At that moment, a star fell from the sky and Homay learned that her husband was not alive. She flew in the image of a swan to say goodbye to her beloved. Homay decided not to take off her bird outfit anymore; she promised to lay an egg every year, which would become a white bird. Final part *How swans appeared in the Urals Many years later, Homay flew to the grave of Ural. Her chicks flew with her. People did not touch them. Russian researcher R. T. Ignatiev wrote that the Bashkirs believed: \\"to kill a Swan is a sin, and to kill a Winch is to cry your all life.\\" Came to live in the Urals and the bull of Katil with his herd, submitted to man. Akbuzat led herds of horses. And a glow appeared on the grave of Ural- Batyr - the hero‚Äôs ashes turned into gold. Since then, gold appeared in the Urals. *How rivers appeared in the Urals In the Urals, people, animals and birds became very numerous. Remembering the prohibition of Ural- Batyr, they did not drink water from the lakes. And there weren‚Äôt enough spring water for everyone. Idel wanted to find Schulgen and kill him. But Homay convinced him to find another way to help people. Idel hit the mountain with a magic sword and a spring was born (from Mount Iremel). I ran a stream to the Yamantau mountain, which was cut by Idel into two parts. The gorge formed then began to be called Kyrykty. And the river that Idel obtained is called the people the river of Idel (Agidel). Yaik, Nugush and Hakmar set off to look for new rivers. People settled on the banks of four rivers, called them the names of the batyrs. And their names remained unforgettable. The hero died, but with him, divas, snakes and monsters died. A good deed committed by Ural- Batyr is immortal.  English translation  The first full translation of Ural-batyr into the English language was made in 1999 by Sagit Shafikov, Professor of the Foreign Languages Department at Bashkir State University, Ufa, Russia. It appeared in the local journal called Vestnik Akademii Nauk (\\"Herald of Science Academy\\") and was followed by an improved version which appeared in 2001 in the Watandash (\\"Compatriot\\"). The final version was published alongside the original Bashkir text and the Russian translation in a glossy gift book Ural-batyr in 2003.

The original village of Woodstock is located in Howard County, and also includes portions of Baltimore County and Carroll County. History Thomas Browne explored westward through Anne Arundel county through Clarksville and settled in the area in 1702. The Mt. Pleasant Log home was built by the Brown family in the 18th century. A century later in the civil war, confederate general Bradley Tyler Johnson used Mt. Pleasant to store weapons, dispatch messages and hide from Union troops. Woodstock was founded as a mining town based around its Granite quarries. The B&O; railroad ran through the area with a station built in 1835 for granite deliveries. The postal community was named \\"Davis Tavern\\" when its first post office opened in 1836. Caleb Davis and Peter Gorman were early B&O; contractors. Gorman married Elizabeth Browne of the Brown family, occupied a large farm \\"Good Fellowship\\", sold Granite for buildings and built a large granite house in town. The granite house was the birthplace of Arthur Pue Gorman, which was torn down to build a bridge across the Patapsco in the early 1980s. In 1869, the Jesuit Woodstock College opened on the Baltimore side of the Patapsco River. St, Alphonsus Rodriguez church was built on a section of the institute in 1887‚Äì1968 when it was lost to fire. In 1889, telegraph service was extended to town.

Bayan's father died during the Mongol siege of the stronghold of the Assassins (Hashshashin). While Bayan served in Persia with Hulegu's army, Kublai Khan recalled him. Kublai liked him, but he did not hold commanding rank in the Yuan army. After the success of the Battle of Xiangyang in 1273, Kublai appointed Bayan as the commander of the Yuan army and general Aju agreed the decision. Bayan married the niece of Kublai's Khatun Chabi of the Kunggirat. Bayan of the Baarin is wrongly said to had an Iranian or Persian wife but the biography Xiao wrote on Bayano f Baarin does not mention the ethnicity of the wife and says that it was a wife \\"in Persia\\".  The conquest of southern China  The Song Emperor Duzong died in 1274, and his three-year-old son Zhao Xian became the Emperor Gongdi (reigned 1274‚Äì1276). The Mongols sent Shi Tianze and Bayan on a full-scale campaign against the Song. Shi Tianze died en route. Bayan ordered that Aju head the first column and depart for the Yangtze from Xiangyang, with Lu Wenhuan as fore-runner general; the second column headed by Mang-wu would depart from Yangzhou, with Liu Zheng as forerunner general. Bayan took numerous cities on his march, slaughtered the inhabitants of one town, and killed and captured numerous Song generals. The Song regent and Grand Empress Dowager Xie had no choice but to rely on Jia Sidao for fighting the Mongols. More Song generals surrendered, including Fan Wenhu in Sichuan and Chen Yi in Huangzhou (Huanggang area, Hubei). Hearing that Liu Zheng had died, Jia Sidao experienced a brief ecstasy and led an army of about 130,000 against the Mongols, but he suffered defeat on the Yangtze River. The populace of the Jiangsu areas, around the Yangtze, including Zhenjiang and Jiangyin, deserted their homes in the face of the Mongol attacks. Jia Sidao sent an emissary to Bayan to discuss a truce, but Bayan declined to negotiate. Jia Sidao asked the dowager empress to relocate the Song capital, Hangzhou, but Empress Xie-shi refused to move. Several ministers at the Song court requested that the regent deprive Jia Sidao of his posts, and the Song released former Mongol emissaries like Hao Jing as a good-will gesture. At this point Zhang Shijie of E'zhou (Hubei Province), Wen Tianxiang of Jiangxi and Li Fei of Hunan came to the east to help the Song court. A Song general abandoned Jiankang (i.e. Nanking), and the Mongols took Changzhou and Wuxi. Kublai Khan then sent Lian Xixian and Yan Zhongfan to the Song to discuss a ceasefire. Lian Xixian asked Bayan for bodyguards, but Bayan advised that the more bodyguards Lian took with him, the more the likelihood that the Song Chinese might harm him. Lian obtained 500 soldiers, but once he arrived at Dusong-guan Pass, the Song General Zhang Ru killed Yan Zhongfan and captured Lian Xixian. (The History of Yuan Dynasty states that the Song killed Lian too.) Bayan deplored the Song behavior, and sent another emissary, Zhang Xu, to the Song court, together with a Song emissary; but a Song border general had Zhang Xu killed. Then the Mongols stopped peace talks and attacked Yangzhou on the northern bank of the Yangtze (Changjiang River) and defeated two generals under Li Tingzhi. Jiading surrendered next, and a Mongol fire attack defeated Zhang Shijie's navy on the Yangtze. Wen Tianxiang arrived in Lin'an (Hangzhou, the Song capital), but the Empress Dowager did not take his advice. Jia Sidao was expelled from the capital, and the escort official killed him en route. The Mongols took Taizhou in Jiangsu and slaughtered the inhabitants of Changzhou. In Hunan, Li Fei died, and the Song lost both Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces. After taking over Dusong-guan Pass, the Mongols started to close in on the Song capital. A Song minister called Liu Yue, sent to the Mongol camp to sue for peace, received a rebuff from Bayan, who said that the Song Emperor obtained the throne from a child and would lose it in the hands of a kid. The Song sent Lu Xufu to the Mongols to express a wish to become a Mongol protectorate, but the Mongols declined the proposal. The Song's new prime minister, Chen Yizhong, sent Liu Yue to the Mongols in an attempt to gain acknowledgment as a Mongol vassal, but a Song Chinese civilian killed Liu Yue en route, at Gaoyou of Jiangsu Province. The Mongols then sacked Jiaxing and An'jie of Zhejiang Province. Wen Tianxiang and Zhang Shijie advised that the Song court relocate to the islands ioffshore, but Prime Minister Chen Yizhong decided to send the imperial seal to the Mongols in token of surrender. Bayan demanded that Chen personally come to the Mongols, and Chen fled to Wenzhou, a southern Zhejiang coastal city. Zhang Shijie led his people into the sea. The Song appointed Wen Tianxiang as the rightside prime minister and ordered him to go to the Mongols to seek peace. Bayan arrested Wen after he accused Bayan of invasion. In AD 1276, Bayan took over Lin'an and forced the dowager empress to issue the surrender order. He sent the Song royal family, including the dowager empress and Emperor Gongdi, to Peking. Turk minister Ahmad Fanakati was jealous with Bayan's success and tried to calumniate him that he plundered Chinese commoners.  Later military career  Kublai dispatched his favorite son Nomukhan, another son Kokhcu, M√∂ngke's son Shiregi (Xi-li-jie) and Muqali's grandson An-tong against Kaidu, the grandson of √ñgedei Khan to Almaligh in 1275. Following year, Shiregi defected to Kaidu's side and arrested the prince and An-tong due to another relative Tokhtemur's conviction. Then they sent Nomukhan to Mongketemur of Golden Horde and An-tong to Kaidu. Kublai then ordered prime minister Bayan to counter Kaidu, who had started to close in on Karakorum and rebel princes. Bayan defeated Shiregi and his followers. After that Tokhtemur and Shiregi destroyed unity they sought and turned into robber bands. Shiregi killed Tokhtemur. But he was arrested by his former ally Chagatai prince Sarban. He gave Shiregi to Great khan to spare his life. In 1278,Rene Grousset - The Empire of Steppes the Golden Horde court released Nomukhan and sent him to Yuan dynasty. Rashi ad-Din wrote that Tode Mongke released Nomukhan and expressed his willingness to submit to Kublai after his sons' 10 years hostage in Crimea. But some historians think that Mongketemur released the princes.John Man - Kublai khan Kublai recalled Bayan when Nai-yan (or Nayan, the great grandson of the brother of Genghis Khan) reportedly planned rebellion in the areas between the Onon and Kerulen rivers of Mongolia. Bayan went to meet Nao-yan and failed to persuade Nai-yan. Bayan fled back to the Mongol capital. A Mongol minister recommended to Kublai that pacifying the khanates in the west would lead Nayan to submit. Kublai therefore ordered this minister to go west: and he claimed that Nai-yan had already submitted to Kublai. Hence the khanates all succumbed to Khubilai. After that, Khubilai led an army northward against Nai-yan. Seeing that his Mongol soldiers fraternized with the Nai-yan soldiers, Khubilai adopted the advice of a Chinese in having the Chinese army act as the forerunner column. General Li Ting tricked Nai-yan into a retreat and then defeated Nai-yan's army of 100,000 in a night attack with cannons. Nai-yan was captured and executed. The battle was later reported by Marco Polo to Europe. A remnant of Nai-yan's people then fled to Manchuria and attacked eastern Liaoning Province. The Liaodong Xuanweishi () of the Yuan, Ta-chu (), asked for aid, and Kublai sent his son over. Ta-chu defeated the Nai-yan remnants under Khadan (Descendant of Genghis Khan's another brother) and chased them westward to the Altai. Ta-chu won the title of wan hu. Nai-yan remnants, however, still remained for some time. Bayan received orders to counter Kaidu, who harassed Helin in the west; and Prince Tem√ºr (grandson of Kublai) had the duty of guarding the Liao River area in the east. When a Mongol official defected to Kaidu and attacked Kublai's grandson Kamala (or Gemala) near Hang'aishan Mountain, Kublai would lead a column to the north. Kaidu retreated thereafter. Bayan would continue warfare with Kaidu for some time before he left the post at Helin. Unfortunately, some ministers accused him of Kaidu's desertion. He was sent to China far away from Mongolia for a while. Tem√ºr was appointed a governor in Karakorum and Bayan became a minister.  Later life  Bayan met and swore loyalty to Kublai Khan before the latter's death in 1294. With the support of minister Bayan Kublai's grandson, Timur became Kublai's successor, the Emperor Chengzong after the Yuan court went through a power vacuum for a few months. Bayan died on 11 January 1295.  Popular culture  Bayan was a major character in the novel, and later movie, The Black Rose, written by Thomas B. Costain. In the film he was played with a mixture of culture and menace by Orson Welles. \\"Hundred Eyes\\" is portrayed by Tom Wu in the Netflix series Marco Polo. However, he is depicted as a blind Taoist monk from Wudang whose name is called Li Jinbao in the TV series.

The document asserted the denomination's political neutrality, appealed for the right to publicly preach, and claimed the Witnesses were the victims of a misinformation campaign by other churches. It was prepared by Watch Tower Society president Joseph F. Rutherford and released at a convention in Berlin on June 25, 1933. More than 2.1 million copies of the statement were distributed throughout Germany, with copies also mailed to senior government officials including German Chancellor Adolf Hitler. Its distribution prompted a new wave of persecution against German Witnesses.1974 Yearbook, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1974, pg 102-111. The declaration is controversial among Jehovah's Witnesses and historians. It stated that Jehovah's Witnesses shared the same ethical goals as the Nazi party, and it attacked Hitler's favorite enemies: Jews, Catholics, the USA, Britain and France. The declaration was first read at the 1933 District Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses in Berlin. According to biographer James Penton, the declaration was read in a hall decked with swastikas, and the convention opened with a song that shared the same air as the German national anthem, otherwise anathema for Jehovah's Witnesses. Background From 1922, German Bible Students (Ernste Bibelforscher) were arrested on charges of illegal peddling as they publicly distributed Watch Tower Society literature. Between 1927 and 1930, almost 5,000 charges were laid against members of the group, and although most ended in acquittalsSaarbr√ºcker Landes Zeitung, December 16, 1929, as cited in 1974 Yearbook, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1974, pg 102: \\"Unfortunately the police have been powerless in doing anything about the work of the Bible Students. Arrests made up until now ... have all ended up in acquittal.\\" some \\"severe sentences\\" were also handed down. In November 1931 Bavarian authorities used new emergency ordinances relating to political disturbances to confiscate and ban Watch Tower Society literature. By the end of 1932 more than 2,300 charges against Bible Students were pending. Watch Tower Society president J.F. RutherfordRestrictions tightened with the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Germany's new Chancellor on January 30, 1933. On February 4 he issued a decree permitting the police to confiscate literature \\"endangering public order and security\\" and also restrict freedoms of assembly. By mid-1933 the work of the group‚Äìby then known as Jehovah's witnesses‚Äìhad been banned in most German states, with members accused of being Communists and associating with the Jews in subversive political movements. Members' homes were frequently searched by police for incriminating literature and on April 24 the International Bible Students Association (IBSA) headquarters in Magdeburg was briefly occupied by police. Authorities objected to the influence of religious minorities such as Jehovah's Witnesses because they \\"contributed to the ideological fragmentation of the German people\\", but they also viewed the group as a threat to the mainstream Christian denominations. A Ministry of the Interior decree stated: In June Watch Tower Society president Joseph Rutherford and Nathan Knorr traveled to Berlin to attempt to negotiate the possibilities of continuing preaching activity in Germany. While there, they organized a public convention to be held in Berlin on June 25, 1933 to release a Declaration of Facts, which had been written by Rutherford. They hoped the document would convince Hitler, government officials and the public that Jehovah's Witnesses posed no threat to the German people and the state.] The Declaration would assert the group's political neutrality and protest against the \\"meddling\\" of the Hitler government into the Witnesses' preaching work. It was to be translated into German by branch overseer Paul Balzereit and presented to the conventioners for adoption. Both Rutherford and Knorr left Germany before the convention, held at the Wilmersdorfer Tennishallen, began. Though organizers expected an attendance of 5,000, a crowd of 7,000 arrived. The exterior of the hall was decked with swastikas, possibly placed by members of Nazi SS units who had celebrated nearby the previous day. To the surprise of those attending, the convention opened with a song, Zion's Glorious Hope, which was by then rarely sung at Witness meetings. Set to music composed by Joseph Haydn in 1797, it had been in the Bible Students' songbook since 1905, but avoided since 1922, when the same music was used with new lyrics for the German national anthem. During the convention, the 3,800-word Declaration of Facts was presented to the crowd and accepted by many in attendance. A \\"large number\\" of those attending, however, refused to adopt it and left the convention disappointed, viewing it as weaker than they expected. A 1974 Watch Tower Society publication claimed Balzereit had weakened the German translation of the Declaration, softening criticism of the Nazis, but in 1998 the society repudiated that statement. Some 2.5 million copies of The Declaration, reproduced as a four-page pamphlet, were distributed publicly and a day after the convention, the declaration was sent to Hitler with a seven- page cover letter written by Balzereit in which he assured the Chancellor that the IBSA \\"was not in opposition to the national government of the German Reich\\". The letter added that, to the contrary, \\"the entirely religious, nonpolitical objectives and efforts of the Bible Students\\" were \\"completely in agreement with the corresponding goals of the national government\\". Historian Detlef Garbe concluded that by using subtle wording, Balzereit intended that the letter, while representing the Bible Students' teachings, could also be misinterpreted by the group's opponents. Contents of the Declaration The Declaration was divided into four broad sections: an introduction that broached the issues of opposition and oppression, sections addressing Watch Tower Society literature‚Äîwhich by 1933 was prohibited‚Äîand the League of Nations, and a concluding section called \\"Great Truths\\". Some statements within the Declaration written to highlight commonality with German national ideals subsequently attracted criticism that its authors had attempted to compromise with Hitler's regime and curry favor with the new government. =Introduction= The opening nine paragraphs stated that the members of the organization were peaceable and law-abiding, and were God's \\"witnesses to the truth\\". It further stated that they had been wrongly charged, and wished to present a true and faithful witness to officials about their role in God's purposes, appealing for a fair and impartial hearing. It said the Bible revealed that Satan the Devil was an enemy of God and that, as in Jesus' day, he used religious teachers and priests to distort the truth and foment opposition to his true representatives. The statement said they had been falsely and maliciously accused of receiving financial support from the Jews, insisting: \\"There has never been the slightest bit of money contributed to our work by the Jews.\\" It added: =Our Literature= The Declaration cited the accusation that Watch Tower Society literature constituted a danger to Germany's peace and safety, and suggested the publications had been misunderstood by officials because of the bluntness of much of the language, which had been originally written in the United States for an American readership. It said people in Britain and the United States had suffered, and continued to suffer, from \\"the misrule of Big Business and conscienceless politicians\\" supported by \\"political religionists\\", and the Society's literature had therefore employed plain language to convey that message. It drew parallels with similar oppression from which it said the German people suffered: Nazi book burning in Germany. The Declaration asserted that Jehovah's Witnesses had no political ambitions or involvement, and did nothing to hinder the beliefs of others. It said members of the group had devoted their lives to helping people to properly understand the Bible as \\"the only possible way for the complete relief and blessing for mankind,\\" which would in turn bring benefits to \\"the education, culture and upbuilding of the people.\\" It stated that the Society and its literature therefore posed no menace to the nation's peace and safety because it supported the government's \\"high ideals\\". The Literature section of the Declaration concluded by noting that the Watch Tower Society had for years made persistent efforts to do good for people, often with the help of financial assistance of American members. =League of Nations= The League of Nations meets, 1932.The Declaration said Watch Tower Society statements about the League of Nations had been identified as a further cause for prohibition of preaching and literature distribution. It said, \\"Let us remind the government and the people of Germany that it was the League of Nations compact that laid upon the shoulders of the German people the great unjust and unbearable burdens.\\" It added that Watch Tower Society publications had been critical of the League--which had been hailed by churches as part of God's purpose--because the Society considered the League to be oppressive and unfair, and unable to bring about the relief promised by the Bible. The Declaration further stated that Jehovah's Witnesses had not attempted to exert political influence, and that their criticisms could not be construed as a menace to the government or a danger to national peace and safety. The statement said the \\"political clergy, priests and Jesuits\\" had persecuted Witnesses in North America and Britain, and it warned that the same forces were similarly misrepresenting them to German authorities. =Great Truths= The Declaration summarized the eschatalogical beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses, and said that Germans had suffered misery since 1914, becoming the victims of international injustice. It compared the goals of the organization with \\"the nationalists\\" who \\"have declared themselves against all such unrighteousness and announced that 'Our relationship to God is high and holy'\\" and said German Witnesses \\"fully endorse these righteous principles.\\" The statement praised the German government's adherence to those \\"high ideals\\" and expressed confidence that it would not deliberately resist the Witnesses' preaching work. It stated, \\"We therefore appeal to the high sense of justice of the government and nation and respectfully ask that the order of prohibition against our work and our literature be set aside, and the opportunity be given us to have a fair hearing before we are judged.\\" In conclusion, it requested that the government establish an independent committee to meet delegates of the group to examine its literature and allow the Witnesses to work without hindrance. Aftermath Within days of sending the Declaration to Hitler, Balzereit left Germany and emigrated to Prague. On June 28, 30 Nazi Party storm troopers raided the Magdeburg offices for a second time, hoisting the swastika above the building, closing the factory, sealing the presses and locking the premises. The Ministry of the Interior said the action was designed to prohibit any future activities of the Watch Tower Society in Germany. In late August, authorities transported about 70 tonnes of Watch Tower literature and Bibles in 25 trucks to the city's outskirts and publicly burned them. In some areas the Witnesses defied the ban on their preaching activity, but throughout Germany many believers withdrew from the association and ceased all activity. When copies of the Watchtower and Golden Age began to arrive in Germany by mail from abroad, police ordered the confiscation of mail of known Jehovah's Witnesses. In September 1934 a thousand German Jehovah's Witnesses joined a crowd of 3,500 at an international convention in Basel, Switzerland, organized under the theme \\"Fear Them Not\\". Rutherford urged the German Jehovah's Witnesses to resume their preaching activity and the attendees responded by declaring in a resolution that they would do so on October 7, 1934, regardless of the ban. The resolution also contained a message of protest against their treatment in Germany. The resolution was given to the Swiss press and a copy sent to Hitler, along with a message that read: \\"Your ill-treatment of Jehovah's Witnesses shocks all people on earth and dishonors God's name. Refrain from further persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses; otherwise God will destroy you and your national party.\\" Thousands of telegrams containing the same warning were sent to the Reich government in Berlin from Witnesses in Europe, the United States and Britain on October 8 and 9 until foreign post offices were told to stop sending them because the recipient refused to accept them. Balzereit later returned to Germany to resume his position as branch leader, but attracted criticism from some members over his reluctance to defy bans on public preaching. In May 1935 he‚Äîalong with eight other officers‚Äîwas arrested; at a trial in December that year he denied he had defied official decrees, but was sentenced to 2¬Ω years imprisonment. The following year he was expelled from the Watch Tower Society, with Rutherford explaining in a letter to German Witnesses that he was surprised \\"not one of those on trial at that time gave a faithful and true testimony to the name of Jehovah\\". Rutherford said Balzereit had said nothing to show \\"his complete reliance on Jehovah\\" and the Society therefore \\"will henceforth have nothing to do with him\\". The Society would also \\"put forth no effort in seeking to release them from prison even if it had the power to do anything\\". Historical assessment German historian Detlef Garbe viewed the Declaration as part of the group's efforts to adapt at a time of increasing persecution. He said the use of the Zion's Glorious Hope hymn at the opening of the Berlin convention was an effort to make a good impression with the world and not a coincidence that the song shared the same melody as the German national anthem. He said the wording of the document presented the denomination as an organization with a positive attitude towards the German state and with common interests with the new rulers. Garbe said that in repudiating accusations that the Witnesses had received financial support from the Jews, the group \\"clearly distanced itself from another group under persecution\\". He noted the use of \\"anti-Jewish slogans\\" in the document, which was written less than three months after the boycott of Jewish stores in Germany, but said the Witnesses were not guilty of antisemitism. Yet Garbe said the Declaration's description of the Anglo-American empire as \\"the most oppressive empire on earth\\" did undermine the group's claims to political neutrality. Garbe said later publications of the Watch Tower Society had misrepresented the Declaration as a \\"resolution of protest\\" and had also falsely claimed that Balzereit had \\"watered down\\" the society's publications in his translation of Rutherford's original document. He said the criticism of Balzereit in the Witnesses' 1974 Yearbook was an attempt to place responsibility on the German branch leader for the society's attempts to adapt. Canadian historian Professor James Penton, a former Jehovah's Witness and critic of the group, claimed the Declaration was a compromising document that proves \\"that Watch Tower leaders were attempting to pander to the Nazis, for the Declaration of Facts and the letter to Hitler were in many ways saying exactly what the Nazis themselves were saying\\". Penton said the Declaration's \\"antisemitic\\" statements about Jews mirrored statements made in Hitler's Mein Kampf and Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels' 1927 essay Wir fordernJoseph Goebbels, Wir fordern, Der Angriff, 25 July 1927. as well as those published by Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher as the Jewish boycott began.Audio of Phillip Adams interview with James Penton, Radio National Late Night Live, 23 August, 2005. Penton said Balzereit's letter to Hitler accompanying the Declaration was \\"even more obsequious to the Fuhrer and to Nazi values than the Declaration of Facts\\": In a five-page article in its Awake! magazine in 1998, the Watch Tower Society rejected accusations that it had attempted to curry favor with the Hitler regime or endorsed the Nazi's racist ideology. It said the Witnesses had not decorated the convention venue with swastikas or sung the German national anthem. It said: The Society said the denunciation of \\"commercial Jews\\" in the Declaration \\"clearly did not refer to the Jewish people in general, and it is regrettable if it has been misunderstood and has given cause for any offense.\\" It explained that Jehovah's Witnesses rejected antisemitic views, and that the \\"high ideals\\" they shared with the Nazis were those of family values and religious freedom. Religious scientist Gabriele Yonan, who described the Declaration of Facts as a \\"petition\\", an \\"appeal\\" and a \\"sermon\\", said its text, in the context of the history of Jehovah's Witnesses during the Nazi regime, had nothing to do with antisemitic statements and currying favor with Hitler, adding, \\"These accusations made by today's church circles are deliberate manipulations and historical misrepresentations.\\"\\"Am mutigsten waren immer wieder die Zeugen Jehovas.\\" Verfolgung und Widerstand der Zeugen Jehovas im Nationalsozialismus, published by historian Hans Hesse, Bremen, 1998, page 395 see also: Yonan said the Declaration did not address Hitler as \\"Fuhrer\\" and did not conclude with the words \\"Heil Hitler\\", as was the case at the time in most official church documents addressed to state authorities.Gabriele Yonan, Persecution and Resistance of Jehovah's Witnesses During the Nazi-Regime 1933-1945, pg 340. She said the absence of influence by the antisemitic terminology of the period was evident from the Declarations free use of Old Testament quotations that include the term \\"Zion\\".

The company consisted largely of the remnants of the Chicago Opera Association, a company that produced seven seasons of grand opera in the Auditorium Theatre from 1915 until its bankruptcy in 1921. Chicago Opera Association The Chicago Opera Association produced seven seasons of grand opera in Chicago's Auditorium Theatre from 1915 to 1921. The founding artistic director and principal conductor was Cleofonte Campanini, while the general manager and chief underwriter was Harold F. McCormick. When Campanini died in December 1919 he was replaced by the composer Gino Marinuzzi, who staged his own Jacquerie as the opening production of the 1920‚Äì21 season. In January 1921, operatic diva Mary Garden was appointed music director (or \\"Directa\\" as she styled it) and the recently divorced McCormick promised to pay that year's difference exceeding $100,000, the previous high being $300,000. He planned on this being his last season, and he called in Mary Garden to finish the company with style. The subsequent blow-out season was finished with the hugely expensive world premiere of Sergei Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges, which had been commissioned by the Opera Association. This, and other extravagances on Mary Garden's part, ended the season with a deficit of $1,100,000, most of which was paid for by the McCormick fund. Mary Garden as \\"Directa\\" for one season cost $750,000 more than any single season of opera in Chicago at that time. Coming as it did during a business recession, these deficits bankrupted the company. =Notable singers= *Georges Baklanoff *Charles Dalmor√®s *Alice D'Hermanoy *Hector Dufranne *Florence Easton *Anna Fitziu *Amelita Galli-Curci *Mary Garden *Gustave Huberdeau *Frances Ingram *Nina Koshetz *Edith Mason *Mary McCormic *Carmen Melis *Tamaki Miura *Lucien Muratore *Claudia Muzio *Giovanni Polese *Rosa Raisa *Tito Schipa *Emilio Venturini *Alice Verlet *Olivia Monona Formation of the Civic Opera Company  The Civic Opera was formed by reorganizing the bankrupt of the Chicago Opera Association in 1921. Opera Association general manager Harold F. McCormick resigned and was replaced by utilities magnate Samuel Insull, while sixteen of the eighteen directors were carried over from the old company. The new Civic Opera also fell heir to Mary Garden as musical director as well as all of the costumes, scenery, and other resources of the defunct Opera Association. The Civic Opera Company was Chicago's first real world class Opera Company, it was also a \\"democratic\\" opera company, aiming for a popular audience. Productions were supposed to based upon what the people wanted, though they turned out to be the Italian repertory that the sponsors and the executives favored and the modern French operas beloved of reigning diva Mary Garden, while German works and operetta were sadly neglected. The Civic Opera Company opened on November 13, 1922 with a stunning performance of A√Øda. This was a traditional opera to start with and was obviously the choice of Insull and not Mary Garden, who was the champion of French opera and had a more modern taste in music. Typical of what she would have chosen would have been Pell√©as et M√©lisande, a role Debussy had written for her. This is almost the opposite of Insull's taste in opera, he preferred older pieces in Italian, such as works by Verdi, Puccini, and Rossini. This tension was resolved by having an almost equal number of Italian and French operas a year, contrary to practice at virtually any other opera house outside France, with other languages wildly under represented. Sometimes even Russian operas, such as Boris Godunov, were performed in French.  New Opera House  Originally, like Chicago Opera Association, the Civic Opera Company was housed in the Auditorium theater. This theater was superlative for singing, the acoustics were and are second to none, but there was no back stage to speak of. This limits the productions possible to put on and that can be housed at one point in time, a limit that both Insull and Garden chafed under, so very early on, Insull decided that there would be a new opera house. The new Civic Opera House would be marginally smaller in seat capacity than the auditorium, but this was out-weighed by the back stage space which was to be larger than any other back stage space at that time, and the acoustics were not quite as good as that of the auditorium, but they are still very good. The building of the new opera house was to be semi-financed by Insull, and the rest would be leveraged in with bonds to be held by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The original plan was that the Civic Opera would retire these bonds over the next eighty years with rents from a 28-story office tower above the theatre. Thus they would completely own the building and rentals from the office space would subsidize the Civic Opera Company. In the 1950s the theater became the home of the Lyric Opera of Chicago.  Bankruptcy  This was a magnificent plan and would have worked wonderfully, except that opening night ironically fell on November 4, 1929 (again with a delightful performance of Aida) less than a month after the Black Tuesday stock crash. This catastrophe, coupled with the extravagance of the new house, were body blows at the financial health of the civic Opera, starting a chain reaction. Soon Insull, the financial mainstay, lost control of his utilities and transportation companies and became unable to under-write Civic Opera. Mary Garden, the star-power and resident genius of Civic, never happy with the new opera house, retired abruptly after a performance of Massenet's Le jongleur de Notre-Dame at the end of the 1931/2 season. Finally, on June 23, 1932, Civic Opera declared bankruptcy and was forced to liquidate.

The diocese exercises jurisdiction over the territory embraced by the department of Vaucluse, in the Region of Provence- Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur. The current archbishop is Jean-Pierre Marie Cattenoz, who was appointed in 2002. Established in the 4th century as the Diocese of Avignon, the diocese was elevated to an archdiocese in 1475, with the suffragan sees of the Diocese of Carpentras, the Diocese of Vaison, and the Diocese of Cavaillon. By the Concordat of 1801 these three dioceses were united to Avignon, together with the Diocese of Apt, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Aix. At the same time, however, Avignon was reduced to the rank of a bishopric and was made a suffragan see of Aix. The Archdiocese of Avignon was re-established in 1822, and received as suffragan sees the Diocese of Viviers (restored in 1822); Diocese of Valence (formerly under Lyon); Diocese of N√Æmes (restored in 1822); and Diocese of Montpellier (formerly under Toulouse). On 16 December 2002, the see ‚Äì officially Archdiocese of Avignon (-Apt, Cavaillon, Carpentras, Orange, and Vaison) ‚Äì lost its Metropolitan status and became instead a suffragan see of Marseille. In 2009 its name was changed to Archdiocese of Avignon, the secondary titles being suppressed. History There is no evidence that either Saint Rufus, disciple of Saint Paul according to certain traditions the son of Simon of Cyrene, or Saint Justus, likewise held in high honour throughout the territory of Avignon, was venerated in antiquity as bishop of that see. The first bishop known to history is Nectarius, who took part in several councils about the middle of the fifth century. Saint Agricol (Agricolus), bishop between 650 and 700, is the patron saint of Avignon. In 1475 Pope Sixtus IV raised the diocese of Avignon to the rank of an archbishopric, in favour of his nephew Giuliano della Rovere who later became Pope Julius II.

Her debut as a writer partly came about after she received a major literary prize for travel writing: The Next Generation. As a result of the grant she lived for twelve years in southern France where she became close to the gypsies, particularly two of the \\"grand\\" families of Reyes and Baliardo. From this research and collaboration, she wrote two important books, Gitani si nasce e si diventa (We Are Born and We Become Gypsies) and El Cante Flamenco (The Flamenco Song), which received support from the Spanish Consulate in Italy and by the Cervantes Cultural Institute. Her meeting with the publisher Salani generated another book, La bambina Babilonia (The Girl Babilonia), which received great success and was awarded numerous prizes. Following this success, she signed with Einaudi Ragazzi, one of the most respected publishers in Italy. In 2006 she published Pao alla conquista del mondo (Pao Conquers the World), and in 2007, Caro Hamid, fratello lontano (Dear Hamid, Distant Brother). They represent a decisive turn in the poetics and direction of this author. In 2008 she published Ibrahim, il bambino del campo (Ibrahim, a Boy in the Field / The Secret Story of Ibrahim). In 2009 she published Il baffo del dittatore (The Dictator's Moustaches) with Mursia editore. In 2010 Caro Hamid, fratello lontano (Dear Hamid, Distant Brother) won the Stefany Gay-Tach√© Award.

Godey, 113 U.S. 89 (1885), was a suit regarding equity of defendants who were trustees of certain property that the complainant was interested in, and which they received and disposed of. The complainant, Ellis Griffith, and his brother, John Griffith, were partners, engaged in the business of cattle raising, and resided in Kern County, California, where they occupied what is called a stock range, a tract of country on which cattle are permitted to roam and graze. It may be termed the feeding ground-the pasture land of the cattle. Although the title to the land constituting the range was in the United States, and the land was not inclosed, the right of the Griffiths to use it for the pasturage of their cattle was recognized and respected by their neighbors and other stock raisers in the county. It had excellent springs, furnishing water to cattle roaming over a large extent of country, and was capable of supporting from one to three thousand head. The property, therefore was of great value.. Background In April 1870, Pedro Altube, a member of the firm of Peres & Co., large cattle dealers in California, who was familiar with Kern county and with the character of the range, desired to purchase it for his firm, and offered for it, with the stock, $12,000. On May 21, 1870, John Griffith died, his heirs were his two brothers, the complainant and Morris Griffith. The partnership property remained in the complainant's possession. It consisted of horned cattle, horses, and the range mentioned. The brother Morris, who would have been a proper party complainant, declined to take part in the suit. Ellis Griffith, the surviving partner, was a man of weak mind, without any knowledge of business, and barely able to read and write. The defendants were the neighbors Godey and Williams. Godey was an old resident of the county, a man of means, and had the entire confidence of the complainant. On the ninth of June, within a month after the death of the intestate, Altube spoke t Godey about purchasing the range, and stated that he would give for it, with the stock, $12,000, the sum he had offered previously in April; but Godey then had no control over the range, and could therefore give no title to it. On July 16, Godey filed a petition for special letters of administration on the estate of the deceased, and on the nineteenth of July he was appointed special administrator On September 17, 1870, the complainant executed a conveyance of his claim of to the defendant Godey for the sum of $ 500. In the bill he alleges that he did not know the contents of the instrument, but signed it at Godey's request, without intending to convey any interest in the range, and that he received no consideration for it. He was not then, nor at any other time, informed of the offer made for the range and stock by Altube, of the firm of Peres & Co. Soon after this conveyance Godey informed Altube that he and Williams would sell him the range and stock for $13,000. Altube accepted the offer on condition that a certain squatter on the land should be removed. They bought off the squatter for $500, and on the seventh of November 1870, Altube paid the $13,000 for the range and stock, which sum was equally divided between them. It was shown that the defendant Williams participated in the fraudulent design. He never paid anything on his bid for the horses and cattle at the probate sale until weeks afterwards, and then less than one- fourth of the amount. It was not until after the cattle and horses were purchased by Altube that he paid the balance, although he knew that the probate sale could be made only for cash, and that the amount bid by him had been reported to the court as cash paid. He also knew that the property did not belong to the deceased, but to the partnership between him and the complainant. The record shows that all the partnership property was sold within six months after the death of the deceased, so as to net over $12,000, and that out of that sum the complainant received only $500. The defendants made a large profit out of the transactions and they were required to account to the complainant, as surviving partner of the deceased, for their unjust gains. This was not done. Decision The error of the lower court arose from treating the possessory right to the cattle range on the public lands-as it was then held by the partnership on the death of John Griffith-as not constituting any property of value which could be recognized as such by the courts, the claimants being both aliens who had never taken any steps to be naturalized. But the constitution of California, then in force, invested foreigners who were bona fide residents of the state with the same rights, in respect to the possession and enjoyment of property, a native-born citizens. Article 1, 17. And the possessory right to the range, though held by aliens, was respected by their neighbors and all cattle dealers of the country, and had a market value, as shown by the price which others were ready to pay for it. The responsibility of trustees does not depend upon the validity of the title of the grantor of the trust property. If the right or interest transferred to them can be sold for a valuable consideration, it is to be treated as property, and corresponding duties devolve upon the trustees with respect to its sale as upon the sale of property, the title of which is undisputed. The decree of the lower court was reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion; and was so ordered.

It's sponsored by Red Hat, part of the JBoss community and closely related to the Drools and OptaPlanner projects in the KIE group. It is released under the ASL (or LGPL in earlier versions) by the JBoss company.  Overview  In essence, jBPM takes graphical process descriptions as input. A process is composed of tasks that are connected with sequence flows. Processes represent an execution flow. The graphical diagram (flow chart) of a process is used as the basis for the communication between non-technical users and developers. Each execution of a process definition is called a \\"process instance\\". jBPM manages the process instances. Some activities are automatic like sending an e-mail or invoking a service. Some activities act as wait states, like for example human tasks or waiting for an external service to return results. jBPM will manage and persist the state of the process instances at all times. jBPM is based on the Process Virtual Machine (PVM) which is the JBoss community's foundation to support multiple process languages natively. The JBoss community currently focuses on using the BPMN 2.0 specification for defining business processes. jBPM also provides various tools, both for developers (Eclipse) and end users (web-based) to create, deploy, execute and manage business processes throughout their life cycle.  Capabilities  jBPM originates from BPM (Business Process Management) but it has evolved to enable users to pick their own path in business automation. It provides various capabilities that simplify and externalize business logic into reusable assets such as cases, processes, decision tables and more. * Business processes (BPMN 2.0) * Case management (BPMN 2.0 and CMMN) * Decision management (DMN) * Business rules (DRL) * Business optimisation (Solver) jBPM can be used as a standalone service or embedded in custom service. It does not mandate any of the frameworks to be used, it can be successfully used in * Traditional JEE applications - war/ear deployments * SpringBoot or Thorntail (formerly known as WildFly Swarm) - uberjar deployments * Standalone java programs Additionally the jBPM offers open source business process execution and management capabilities, including: * An embeddable, lightweight process engine in Java, supporting native BPMN 2.0 execution * BPMN 2.0 process modeling, both in Eclipse (developers) and web-based (business users) * Process authoring, collaboration, monitoring and management through the jBPM console * An web-based authoring environment capable of managing the many assets that compose a business project, including BPMN models, Rules, Forms, Data Objects and more. * Human interaction using an independent WS-HT human task service * Strong and powerful integration with business rules and event processing * Pluggable persistence and transactions based on JPA / JTA. * History logging (for querying / monitoring / analysis).  History  jBPM version 5.0 was the result of a merge of the jBPM project with Drools Flow, a sub-project of the Drools system. Therefore, as of version 5, it also includes powerful business rules and event integration, and support for more advanced, flexible business processes.

It is followed by Panic Spring, which partly continues the actions of its characters. The novel is in large part autobiographical and focuses on the protagonist's childhood in India and maturation in London. Plot summary Walsh Clifton is an Anglo-Indian born of an inter-racial couple. His mother dies during childbirth in the opening scenes of the novel. He is raised in India by his father, John Clifton, and his Aunt Brenda. Walsh is torn between his strong ties to India and his position as a colonial. He appears most comfortable around Indian characters, though they are not thoroughly developed in the novel, and he is regularly discomfited by representatives of European culture and Christianity in particular. He develops a sense of superiority over several Indian characters, typically echoing other European characters, but these feelings are regularly thwarted, often in tandem with challenges to traditional European notions of masculinity. This is compounded by Walsh's increasing awareness of his mortality, symbolized by the human ankle bone he sees in a pyre and his grandmother's morbid fixation on death. Walsh is sent \\"home\\" to England for his education by his father, where he is again caught in a conflict between being English or Indian. The former is often associated with paternal and masculine identity while the latter is frequently tied to maternal and feminine identity. This portion of the novel is largely concerned with his schoolboy experiences, his developing sexuality, and the eventual death of his father, who has remained in India. The protagonist has homosexual experiences, significant dream sequences, and comments on his wide readings. The final portion of the novel consists of a bohemian stage in Walsh's life, set in Soho and outside London. He earns his living on his inheritance and by composing jazz music. Walsh ultimately rejects this lifestyle and concludes the novel with his first love, Ruth, who is terminally ill. She is diagnosed by the same doctor who delivered him and witnessed his mother's death. The Scene The novel is set in Burma, India, London, and non-specific rural locations in coastal England. The most significant set-pieces describe rural India, coastal England, and London at night.

She was the wife of B. V. Karanth and was known for the children's plays that she staged. She became the first ever woman director in Kannada cinema when she directed the film Phaniyamma (1983), which was based on a novel by M. K. Indira. Early life Prema Karanth was born in 1936 in Bhadravathi to a poor family. She lost her father Devoji Rao early. Her mother Kamalamma was diagnosed of tuberculosis and was not even allowed to touch her. Prema spent her early life at Sidlaghatta in the Kolar district and after her mother's death, she was brought up by her grandparents. After completing her schooling, she came to Bangalore to join the St. Teresa's convent as a teacher. She learnt typing and began to teach in primary schools. Prema also started conducting small-time stage plays in the schools she worked in. She was determined not to get married but she changed her mind when she met B. V. Karanth at a friend's place. In 1958, they got married under Arya Samaj rites and moved to Varanasi, where Prema joined the Banaras Hindu University to continue her education. B. V. Karanth later moved to Delhi to join the National School of Drama. Prema accompanied him and joined the Aurobindo Ashram as a teacher. She started experimenting drama in education, and started to teach even subjects like History and mathematics using plays. On her husband's persuasion, she too joined the National School of Drama where she studied dramatics and completed her graduation. After graduation, she worked with the NSD repertory for two years. Career =In drama= Prema Karanth started her career as a dramatist and directed plays like Heddayana, Daithya, Banda Banda Gunavantha and Giant Mama which were mainly oriented towards children. Her plays were mainly those that were written in Kannada or of other Indian languages which were translated to Kannada. She started a children's repertory called as Benaka Makkala Kendra which apart from staging plays like Alilu Ramayana, was also involved in teaching children the art of mime, costume designing and usage of props. This repertory staged its first play titled Alibaba in 1979. She was also a well-known costume designer and has designed costumes for more than 120 plays including Hayavadana, Oedipus, Othello and King Lear. =In cinema= Prema's association with the cinema world started when she was chosen as the costume designer for G. V. Iyer's movie Hamsageethe.Wimal Dissanayake (2004), p83 She was also chosen as the art director for a film Kudre Motte in 1977. Initially associated only with art direction, Prema also tried her hand at film-making. Her first directorial venture was Phaniyamma which was based on a Kannada novel and this film earned her critical acclaim. The film is about the story of a girl who is widowed at a young age and her struggles and courage to overcome the stigma attached to it in a male- dominated society.Gwendolyn Audrey Foster (1995), p206 References Notes Category:Kannada film directors Category:Indian women film directors Category:2007 deaths Category:1936 births Category:People from Shimoga district Category:Kannada dramatists and playwrights Category:20th-century Indian dramatists and playwrights Category:Indian women dramatists and playwrights Category:Women writers from Karnataka Category:20th-century Indian film directors Category:Screenwriters from Karnataka Category:Writers from Bangalore Category:20th-century Indian women writers Category:Film directors from Bangalore Category:20th-century Indian women artists Category:Dramatists and playwrights from Karnataka Category:Recipients of the Rajyotsava Award 2003 Category:20th-century Indian screenwriters ","title":"Prema Karanth"},{"id":"13984101","text":"The London Centre for the History of Science, Medicine and Technology was a partnership of two university departments in London, United Kingdom: *Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London *Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine, Imperial College London Prior to 2010, it also included UCL Centre for the History of Medicine.

Shell description The shells of species in this subfamily are mostly low-spired, subglobose, with few whorls. They are either Haliotis-shaped or non-spiral and limpet-like. They lack an umbilicus. Most species lack an operculum. The aperture is very arge, and through it the interior of the last whorl is entirely visible from below.

A shell keep is a style of medieval fortification, best described as a stone structure circling the top of a motte. In English castle morphology, shell keeps are perceived as the successors to motte-and-bailey castles, with the wooden fence around the top of the motte replaced by a stone wall. Castle engineers during the Norman period did not trust the motte to support the enormous weight of a stone keep. A common solution was to replace the palisade with a stone wall then build wooden buildings backing onto the inside of the wall. This construction was lighter than a keep and prevented the walls from being undermined, meaning they could be thinner and lighter. A gazetteer compiled by archaeologist Robert Higham counted 21 shell keeps in England and Wales. Examples include the Round Tower at Windsor Castle and the majority were built in the 11th and 12th centuries.

It was the first time a husband and wife had been executed together in England since 1700.Dickens, Charles. Little Dorrit. Penguin Classics, 2003, Footnote 10, chapter XVII, p. 975. The novelist Charles Dickens attended the public execution, and in a letter written to The Times on the same day wrote, \\"I believe that a sight so inconceivably awful as the wickedness and levity of the immense crowd collected at that execution this morning could be imagined by no man, and could be presented in no heathen land under the sun.\\" He later based one of his characters‚ÄîMademoiselle Hortense, Lady Dedlock's maid in Bleak House‚Äîon Manning's life. Background Manning was born Marie de Roux in Lausanne, Switzerland, and entered domestic service in England. At first maid to Lady Palk of Haldon House, Devon, she entered the service of Lady Blantyre at Stafford House in 1846. On 27 May 1847 she married publican Frederick George Manning at St James's Church, Piccadilly. Mr Manning's background was chequered; he had worked on the railways, but was discharged on suspicion of being involved in several robberies. After the marriage, Marie continued her friendship with Patrick O'Connor, a gauger in the London Docks. He was also a moneylender who charged extraordinary interest, so had become wealthy. Murder On 9 August 1849, O'Connor dined with the Mannings at their home, 3 Miniver Place, Bermondsey. Following a plan, the Mannings murdered their guest by shooting him at close range in the back of the skull and buried his body under the flagstones in the kitchen, where it was found a week later on the 17th of August when a police officer noticed a damp corner stone on the floor, around which the earth was soft. On the same day Mrs. Manning visited O'Connor's lodgings, Greenwood Street, Mile End Road, stealing the dead man's railway shares and money. She returned the next day to complete the robbery. However, it is apparent that the couple had planned to double-cross each other; Marie fled with most of the loot, Frederick fled with the smaller portion. Miniver Place was named after St Miniver, in Cornwall, the home village of James Coleman, the landlord who resided at 1 Miniver Place. He later gave evidence at the trial. Trial and execution The police discovered O'Connor's remains on 17 August, and soon after apprehended his murderers. Marie was tracked down to Edinburgh, where she was caught after trying to exchange some of O'Connor's property (a listing of his possessions had been published). Frederick was caught on the island of Jersey. They were tried at the Old Bailey on 25 and 26 October 1849. The trial was not one of the most fascinating in terms of legal problems, except that it was argued that the jury had to include people of French or Swiss ancestry in fairness to Marie. During the trial, Frederick said that he \\"never liked him [O'Connor] very much\\".Terry Deary, Horrible Histories: The Villainous Victorians They were found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging, Marie yelling imprecations at the British as a 'perfidious race'. The couple were reconciled shortly before they were executed by William Calcraft at Horsemonger Lane Gaol on 13 November 1849. Reaction Charles Dickens wrote a letter to The Times decrying the 'wickedness and levity' of the mob during the execution.Dickens, Charles. Letters to the editor, The Times, 14 November 1849. He wrote: \\"Sir ‚Äî I was a witness of the execution at Horsemonger-lane this morning. I went there with the intention of observing the crowd gathered to behold it, and I had excellent opportunities of doing so, at intervals all through the night, and continuously from daybreak until after the spectacle was over. \\"I believe that a sight so inconceivably awful as the wickedness and levity of the immense crowd collected at that execution this morning could be imagined by no man, and could be presented in no heathen land under the sun. The horrors of the gibbet and of the crime which brought the wretched murderers to it, faded in my mind before the atrocious bearing, looks and language, of the assembled spectators. When I came upon the scene at midnight, the shrillness of the cries and howls that were raised from time to time, denoting that they came from a concourse of boys and girls already assembled in the best places, made my blood run cold. As the night went on, screeching, and laughing, and yelling in strong chorus of parodies on Negro melodies, with substitutions of \\"Mrs. Manning\\" for \\"Susannah,\\" and the like, were added to these. When the day dawned, thieves, low prostitutes, ruffians and vagabonds of every kind, flocked on to the ground, with every variety of offensive and foul behaviour. Fightings, faintings, whistlings, imitations of Punch, brutal jokes, tumultuous demonstrations of indecent delight when swooning women were dragged out of the crowd by the police with their dresses disordered, gave a new zest to the general entertainment. When the sun rose brightly‚Äîas it did‚Äîit gilded thousands upon thousands of upturned faces, so inexpressibly odious in their brutal mirth or callousness, that a man had cause to feel ashamed of the shape he wore, and to shrink from himself, as fashioned in the image of the Devil. When the two miserable creatures who attracted all this ghastly sight about them were turned quivering into the air, there was no more emotion, no more pity, no more thought that two immortal souls had gone to judgment, no more restraint in any of the previous obscenities, than if the name of Christ had never been heard in this world, and there were no belief among men but that they perished like the beasts. \\"I am solemnly convinced that nothing that ingenuity could devise to be done in this city, in the same compass of time, could work such ruin as one public execution, and I stand astounded and appalled by the wickedness it exhibits. I do not believe that any community can prosper where such a scene of horror and demoralization as was enacted this morning outside Horsemonger-lane Gaol is presented at the very doors of good citizens, and is passed by, unknown or forgotten.\\" Wilkie Collins in his novel The Woman In White (1860) has one of his heroines comment (referring to the fat villain, Count Fosco) that \\"Mr. Murderer and Mrs. Murderess Manning were not both unusually stout people?\\" The novel is set in 1850, a year after the \\"Bermondsey Horror\\".

Born and raised on the Ivory Coast in West Africa in a family with 33 children, he combines French, African and Middle Eastern cuisines. He has appeared on Iron Chef America, and was a contestant on The Next Iron Chef, but was eliminated during the 'Resourcefulness' challenge. Unlike most chefs, he uses his first name professionally, preferring to be referred to as 'Chef Morou' instead of 'Chef Ouattara'. Career Morou moved to Washington, DC in 1988 to study computer science. While at school, he worked as a dishwasher at Francesco Ricchi‚Äôs I'Ricchi. He stayed there for three years, and progressed through stations of the restaurant's kitchen. In 1991, he left I'Ricchi to work under Mark Miller at Red Sage, and rose to be executive chef. In 2002, Chef Morou moved to be executive chef at Signatures and revealed his own style, a combination of French, African and Middle Eastern flavors, though reviews said in retrospect he restrained himself at the location; one reviewer said, \\"Watching Ouattara at Signatures was a little like watching a talented filmmaker turning out commercials, the brilliance of his work confined to discrete bursts.\\" He remained there until it closed in 2005. After consulting and appearing on Iron Chef America, Morou opened Farrah Olivia in the fall of 2006. Freed from the necessity of offering more conventional restaurant fare, Morou began to experiment and gained a reputation for being a brilliant, though inconsistent, chef.Chowhound: Farrah Olivia Farrah Olivia was closed in April 2009 (because of irreconcilable differences between Morou and his landlordBreaking News: Farrah Olivia Is Closing).

Lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who owned the restaurant, frequently used his ownership of the restaurant to offer free meals and fancy fundraisers to sway lawmakers. Morou stated that Abramoff was a good boss who gave him a lot of freedom in the kitchen, but after the scandal was revealed, people with strong political ties did not want to be seen at the restaurant, for fear that people might assume they were being treated by Abramoff. The political 'scene' was more than fifty percent of the restaurant's business, and it was forced to close due to lack of revenue. The investment group Da Vinci Group started arrangements to take over the restaurant, however, in November 2005, Da Vinci pulled out of the deal, and the restaurant was closed.Chef Morou looks to spice things up in Old Town Television appearances *Iron Chef AmericaEpisode IA0315, Flay vs. Morou, 'Battle Frozen peas' *The Next Iron Chef References External links *Morou.com - official website *Farrah Olivia - Morou's restaurant Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American television chefs Category:American male chefs Category:Living people Category:People from Washington, D.C.

He was the vicar in St Peters, Colchester where his daughter, Catherine Marsh, the writer was born. Life =Early years= Marsh, third son of Catherine (born Case) and Colonel Sir Charles Marsh of Reading. He was born on 20 July 1775, and educated at the local Grammar school. He was moved by witnessing the sudden death of a young man in a ball-room and he decided to abandon a military career and become a cleric. He matriculated from St Edmund Hall, Oxford on 10 October 1797, graduated B.A. 1801, M.A. 1807, and B.D. and D.D. 1839. At Christmas 1800 he was ordained to the curacy of St. Lawrence, Reading, and was soon known as an impressive preacher of evangelical doctrines. =Life in the church= In 1801 Thomas Stonor, father of Thomas, Lord Camoys, gave him the chapelry of Nettlebed in Oxfordshire. His father presented him to the united livings of Basildon and Ashampstead in Berkshire in 1802, when he resigned Nettlebed, but retained the curacy of St. Lawrence, which he served gratuitously for many years. The Rev. Charles Simeon paid a first visit to Basildon in 1807, and was from that time a friend and correspondent of Marsh. In 1809, with the consent of his bishop, he became vicar of St. James's, Brighton, but the vicar of Brighton, Dr. R. C. Carr, afterwards bishop of Worcester, refused his assent to this arrangement, and after some months Marsh resigned. Simeon presented him to St. Peter's, Colchester, in 1814. His attention was early called by Simeon to the subject of the conversion of the Jews, and in 1818 he went with him to the Netherlands to enquire into their condition in that country. Ill-health obliged him in 1829 to leave Colchester, and in October of the same year he accepted the rectory of St. Thomas, Birmingham, where from the frequent subject of his sermons he came to be known as ‚ÄòMillennial Marsh‚Äô. Early in 1837 he was appointed principal official and commissary of the royal peculiar of the deanery of Bridgnorth; and in 1839, finally leaving Birmingham, he became incumbent of St. Mary, Leamington. =Later years and legacy= From 1848 he was an honorary canon of Worcester, and from 1860 to his death rector of Beddington, Surrey. Few men preached a greater number of sermons. His conciliatory manners gained him friends among all denominations. He died at Beddington rectory on 24 August 1864. He was married three times: first, in November 1806, to Maria, daughter of Mr. Tilson‚Äîshe died 24 July 1833; secondly, on 21 April 1840, to Lady Louisa, third daughter of Charles, first earl of Cadogan‚Äîshe died in August 1843; thirdly, on 3 March 1848, to the Honourable Louisa Horatia Powys, seventh daughter of Thomas, baron Lilford. Mackenzie Dalzell Chalmers was his grandson. He had five children and the fourth Catherine Marsh lived with him. She would write his biography and before he died she began her success as a published author. Works Besides numerous addresses, lectures, single sermons, speeches, introductions, and prefaces, Marsh printed: :#A Short Catechism on the Collects, Colchester, 1821; third ed. 1824. :#Select Passages from the Sermons and Conversations of a Clergyman [i.e. W.

It handles both structured alphanumeric data, and measures and handles all drawings real time in 3D. It has built-in Cloud functionality so files can be shared on multiple tablets or phones. The standard output of the system can be DXF (AutoCAD), PDF (Adobe) IFC (Industrial Foundation Classes), JPG and PNG and it can be exported to ArchiCAD with the help of a separate module. During the measurement process, Leica, Bosch and Stabila laser distance meters are supported to use, the measured data is transferred to the software via Bluetooth. OrthoGraph I has several features that are unique on the market of building surveying applications. The base of a floor plan needs to be drawn first and after measurements the created floor plans will adjust based on the calculations. Diagonal measurements also allow for mathematical accuracy. The application handles the sketched and measured building-model according to the BIM (Building Information Modeling) concept. It means that it handles a hierarchical location-structure, every placed object has several properties, doors and windows have opening directions, and additionally there is the opportunity to add unique parameter fields with optional information. The system is developed by the Hungarian Company named OrthoGraph. Company history The story of OrthoGraph goes back to 2004 when the first version of the software was launched for PDA devices. In 2011, the iPad version of the app was released and this also meant that a new business model has been emerged. This new version was a major breakthrough both in technological and in business aspects. The company‚Äôs gathered experience had been a good background for developing the iPad application, so from the very first moment, the OrthoGraph became one of the top professional building surveying /CAD application on the market. In 2013, a cooperation agreement has been established between OrthoGraph and Leica, the result of this collaboration was that now several Leica laser distance meter is supported by OrthoGraph, the measurements can be transferred to the app via Bluetooth connection. In the second half of the year, the company decided to exploit the benefits of the mobile technology and the Internet and created their own cloud services. This new technology has made it possible that the first building surveying software that provides the opportunity of real teamwork was born. In the same year, the Bluetooth support of the Bosch GLM 100 C laser distance meter for OrthoGraph became available. For 2014, the number of OrthoGraph users reached 4,500. In August 2014, the OrthoGraph Architect App has been named the gold winner in App of the Year category and silver winner in the Most Innovative Product of the Year‚ÄîSMB category in Best in Biz Awards 2014 International business awards program. In 2015 the main goal for OrthoGraph was to be present on Android. After one and a half year on September 2016 the multiplatform version of the app was published, which was called OrthoGraph I. The completely changed UI was simpler, the features were more advanced to allow more accurate measurements and a faster work process. After 2 months of the release, OrthoGraph I won silver qualification in the \\"Best New Version of the Year\\" category of Best in Biz Awards 2016.

On 1 June Lord Salisbury, the then Foreign Secretary, faced with the alternative of admitting the secret deal,Preparing for extension of the Freedom of Information Act to social housing providers said in the House of Lords that this summary was \\"wholly unworthy of their lordships' confidence\\". On 14 June The Globe printed a complete text of the treaty which Marvin had again provided from memory. On 26 June Marvin was arrested, but was released on 16 July after it was found that he had committed no offence known to English law.

It functions as an umbrella organization for survivor resources, offering both services and advocacy. The American Gathering is active in Holocaust remembrance, education and commemoration programs. From 1983 onwards, the organization has held national reunion events.  History  Benjamin Meed and his wife Vladka Meed helped to organize the first World Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors in Israel in June 1981. Inspired by and an outcome of that event, in 1981, the Meeds and other fellow Holocaust survivors established a North American organization called The American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors and Their Descendants. The American Gathering organized a reunion event for survivors that was held in Washington, D.C. in April 1983. The 1983 event was organized by Hirsch Altusky, Sam Bloch, Fred Diament, Roman Kent, Benjamin Meed, Ernest Michel, James Rapp, Norbert Wollheim and Solomon Zynstein. Over 20,000 survivors and their families attended this first event. The initial focus of the organization was to hold national and local reunions of survivors and their families and to combat isolation that survivors sometimes experienced, even within the wider Jewish community. The 1983 reunion was led by honorary chair, Elie Wiesel, with a speech given by President Ronald Reagan. The American Gathering, located in New York City, is a member of other organizations such as the World Jewish Congress, the World Jewish Restitution Organization, the Jewish Community Relations Council and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. In that capacity, its mission is to use its moral authority to influence issues of importance to the survivor community and to the world Jewish community.  Projects  = Survivors Registry = The Benjamin and Vladka Meed Registry of Holocaust Survivors was established in 1981 to document the names of survivors who came to the Americas after World War II. It is the only registry of its kind. In 1993, it was moved to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM). In cooperation with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the American Gathering continues to manage the database and to seek new registrants via its quarterly newspaper Together and its website, among other venues. The Registry includes over 200,000 records related to survivors and their families and is a resource for Holocaust historians and scholars, as well as families looking for lost relatives. = Holocaust and Jewish Resistance Teachers' Program = Initiated in 1984 by Vladka Meed and jointly administered by the American Gathering and the USHMM, the Holocaust and Jewish Resistance Teachers' Program is a two-week summer program for middle school and high school teachers, both Jewish and non-Jewish alike, on trips to Holocaust sites in Poland and to Israel. Participating scholars come from Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Study Center at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot, and the USHMM in Washington, D.C. to speak with teachers selected for the program. A biannual Alumni Conference of the program's participants further reinforces its goals to foster remembrance and toleration. = Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany = The American Gathering is on the Board of Directors of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, an organization that seeks restitution from the governments of Germany and Austria. The current negotiating committee is composed solely of survivors and chaired by the American Gathering's chairman Roman Kent, the restitution provides health care and assistance to survivors in desperate need. = Together = Founded in 1985, Together is the official publication of the American Gathering. With a circulation of approximately 85,000, it reflects the collective voice of survivors, the second and third generations, and includes news, opinions, information on education, commemorations, events, book reviews, announcements, searches, and articles on history and personal remembrance. Contributors include professional writers, poets, thinkers, historians and Holocaust scholars. = Community outreach = The American Gathering actively assists survivors on a daily basis. Whether it is through sitting on the Claims Conference, Self-Help Boards, manning an office to offer information, applications for assistance or interfacing with other related agencies on behalf of survivors, the American Gathering does its utmost to ensure that survivor issues are addressed. = National Holocaust commemorations and memorials = The collective and individual initiatives of the American Gathering leadership has fostered Holocaust commemoration, remembrance events and the establishment of Holocaust memorials in many communities throughout the United States and in almost every State House in the Union. While the American Gathering continues to sponsor its own annual commemoration program with the Museum of Jewish Heritage and WAGRO, it has been instrumental in the creation of the ongoing Holocaust programs at both the United Nations and the U.S. Congress.

This work supplies poetical descriptions of nearly all the existing remains of ancient people and kingdoms in the old and new world. His next work, produced in 1853, was the Spirits of the Past, a title altered in a subsequent edition to Famous Women and Heroes. The Poetry of Creation followed in 1856, and Pleasure, a poem in the heroic measure, appeared in 1859, with sketches and tales introduced. The Immortals, or Glimpses of Paradise, was composed in 1870 in Cornwall, and is the most imaginative of the author's productions.

This example is from around 1875 Henry Moule (1801‚Äì1880) was a priest in the Church of England and inventor of the dry earth toilet, a type of pail closet. Life =Education and priesthood= Moule, sixth son of George Moule, solicitor and banker, was born at Melksham, Wiltshire, on 27 January 1801, and educated at Marlborough Grammar School. He was elected a foundation scholar of St John's College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. 1821 and M.A. 1826. He was ordained to the curacy of Melksham in 1823, and took sole charge of Gillingham, Dorset, in 1825. He was made vicar of St George's at Fordington in the same county in 1829, and remained there for the remainder of his life. For some years he undertook the duty of chaplain to the troops in Dorchester barracks, for whose use, as well as for a detached district of his own parish, he built in 1846, partly from the proceeds of his published ‚ÄòBarrack Sermons,‚Äô 1845 (2nd edit. 1847), a church known as Christ Church, West Fordington. In 1833 his protests brought to an end the evils connected with the race meetings at Dorchester. =Dry earth closet= Moule's earth closet design, circa 1909. During the cholera epidemics of 1849 and 1854 his exertions were unwearied. Impressed by the insalubrity of the houses, especially in the summer of 1858 (the Great Stink), he turned his attention to sanitary science, and invented what is called the dry earth system. In partnership with James Bannehr, he took out a patent for the process (No. 1316, dated 28 May 1860). Among his works bearing on the subject were: ‚ÄòThe Advantages of the Dry Earth System,‚Äô 1868; ‚ÄòThe Impossibility overcome: or the Inoffensive, Safe, and Economical Disposal of the Refuse of Towns and Villages,‚Äô 1870; ‚ÄòThe Dry Earth System,‚Äô 1871; ‚ÄòTown Refuse, the Remedy for Local Taxation,‚Äô 1872, and ‚ÄòNational Health and Wealth promoted by the general adoption of the Dry Earth System,‚Äô 1873. His system was adopted in private houses, in rural districts, in military camps, in many hospitals, and extensively in the British Raj. =Later years= He also wrote an important work, entitled ‚ÄòEight Letters to Prince Albert, as President of the Council of the Duchy of Cornwall,‚Äô in 1855, prompted by the condition of Fordington parish, belonging to the duchy. In two letters in the Times of 24 February and 2 April 1874 he advocated a plan for extracting gas from Kimmeridge shale. He died at Fordington vicarage on 3 February 1880. =Family= Moule married Mary Mullett Evans in 1824; she died on 21 August 1877. They had eight sons: :Henry Joseph Moule (1825‚Äì1904), watercolour artist and friend of Thomas Hardy :George Evans Moule (1828‚Äì1912), missionary and Bishop of Mid China :Frederick John Moule (1830‚Äì1900), Vicar of St Peter's Church, Yaxley, Cambridgeshire :Horatio Mosley Moule (1832‚Äì1873), short-lived friend of Thomas Hardy :Charles Walter Moule (1834‚Äì1921), librarian and president of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge :Arthur Evans Moule (1836‚Äì1916), missionary & Archdeacon of Mid China :Christopher Cooper Moule (1838‚Äì1839), who died an infant :Handley Carr Glyn Moule (1841‚Äì1920), a well-known theologian and scholar and the Bishop of Durham His grandson Arthur Christopher Moule was a noted sinologist.

It is located on the Tigris river in the western governorate of Nineveh, upstream of the city of Mosul. The dam serves to generate hydroelectricity and provide water for downstream irrigation. At full capacity, the structure holds about of water and provides electricity to the 1.7 million residents of Mosul. The dam's main power station contains four Francis turbine‚Äìgenerators. A pumped- storage hydroelectricity power plant with a capacity of and a run-of-the-river dam downstream with a capacity also belong to the Mosul Dam scheme. It is the fourth largest dam in the Middle East, as measured by reserve capacity, capturing snowmelt from Turkey, some north. Built on a karst foundation, concerns over the dam's instability have led to major remediation and rehabilitation efforts since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  Characteristics  The Mosul Dam is a tall and long earth-fill embankment type with a clay core. The width of the crest is . At an elevation of above sea level, the reservoir, named Lake Dahuk, withholds of water. Of that capacity is active (or useful for power and downstream releases) and is inactive (dead) storage. On the east side of the dam is the service spillway which is controlled by five radial gates and has a maximum discharge capacity of . Further to the east is a fuse- plug-controlled emergency spillway with a capacity. At the toe of the dam on its west side is the main hydroelectric power station (Mosul 1). It contains four Francis turbine generators for an installed capacity of 750 MW. Behind the power station are four surge tanks. Downstream of the dam is the Mosul regulation dam, which serves to regulate the tail-waters of the main dam and to generate electricity as well. The hydroelectric plant (Mosul 2) has an installed capacity of 62 MW with four 15.5 MW Kaplan turbine generators. Immediately upstream of the dam is the 240 MW pumped storage power station (Mosul 3). It serves as a peaking power station by pumping water to small reservoir above Lake Dahuk, storing it, then releasing the water back down to two 120 reversible Francis turbines during peak energy usage. The entire Mosul multi-purpose project has an installed capacity of 1,052 MW.  History  = Before the dam = In 2010, following a massive drought, the ruins of an ancient palace were discovered in the reservoir. The palace, which is approximately 3,400 years old, is believed to have belonged to the Mittani. The first excavation occurred in 2019 by a joint Kurdish-German team. The ruins include a terrace of mud bricks, walls as large as two meters high and two meters thick, wall paintings, and ten clay tablets covered in cuneiform.https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/iraq-palace-drought-scli- intl/index.html?bcmt=1https://pressfrom.info/us/news/world/-293430-iraq- drought-uncovers-ruins-of-ancient-palace.html = Planning = Historical Castle of Aski Mosul before being submerged by the dam's reservoir Development of Iraq's rivers progressed rapidly in the mid-20th century as the country sought to control water resources for agriculture and to prevent flooding in Baghdad. Planning for the Mosul Dam began in the 1950s with the help of Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, a British firm who identified a location in 1953. In 1956, the Iraq Development Council contracted Koljian American to carry out studies for an irrigation dam at the location. The studies were completed the next year when Iraq asked the Harza Company to carry out a similar investigation who recommended a different location in 1960, based on karst foundations for two other recommended locations. In 1962, Iraq sought a third opinion from the Soviet Technoprom Export company who recommended a separate site. A fourth company, a Finland firm, Imatran Voima carried out a study in 1965 and a fifth company, Geotehnika of Yugoslavia, carried out studies in 1972. Based on the findings of all five companies which cited complex foundations, Iraq had a French firm, Soletanch, to carry out in-depth geological studies which occurred between 1974 and 1978. In 1978 the Swiss Consultants Consortium became the official consultants for the dam. = Construction = During Saddam Hussein's rule, the construction of the Mosul Dam began in 1981 by a GermanItalian consortium that was led by Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft. Because the dam was constructed on a foundation of soluble gypsum, the engineers recommended thorough grouting within the foundation before the superstructure was built. Instead, to speed construction of the dam, engineers blanket-grouted deep around the foundation and a curtain directly below the dam. A grouting gallery that would allow continuous grouting of the dam's foundation in order to promote stability was also installed. Construction was complete in 1984 and in the spring of 1985, the Mosul Dam began to inundate the Tigris River, filling the reservoir which submerged many archaeological sites in the region. The power station began generating power on 7 July 1986. Because of significant structural stability issues associated with the Mosul Dam, ongoing grouting and additional construction and repairs are necessary. In 1988, Iraq began construction on the Badush Dam downstream which would serve the primary purpose of absorbing and releasing a Mosul Dam flood wave in the event of a breach. Works were halted in 1991 though due chiefly to UN sanctions. = Demolition concerns during the 2003 invasion = Chute spillway with ski jump section to dissipate the energy of the rushing water In early April 2003, following the invasion of Iraq by a US-led coalition, military intelligence had developed several scenarios, including one in which Iraqi forces would have wired the dam for detonation. This would release the high wall of water, to reach Mosul in about two hours. Subsequent investigation found nearly 500 dam workers to still be at work nearly a month after pay had stopped being distributed. = 2014 takeover of dam by ISIS = For several weeks in July and August 2014, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS or ISIL) held Mosul Dam. On August 7, 2014, the organization captured the dam complex from the Peshmerga. ISIS's control of the dam created fears that its power supply could be restricted or that its water flows to downstream areas would be greatly inhibited. In a less likely scenario, there were worries the dam could be breached, causing widespread flooding and destruction downstream. On August 17, 2014, the Peshmerga and the Iraqi Army launched a successful operation to retake control of the dam from ISIS militants. United States airstrikes assisted the Kurdish and Iraqi military, damaging or destroying 19 vehicles belonging to ISIS, as well as striking an ISIS checkpoint near the dam.  Instability and remediation  The earthen embankment dam is located on top of gypsum, a soft mineral that dissolves in contact with water. Continuous maintenance is required to plug, or \\"grout\\", new leaks with a liquefied slurry of cement and other additives.\\"Mosul Dam Repairs Benefit Tigris Basins\\" , defendamerica.mil, September 2005 More than of material have been injected into the dam since leaks began forming shortly after the reservoir was filled in 1986, and 24 machines currently continuously pump grout into the dam base. Between 1992 and 1998 four sinkholes formed downstream of the dam and a fifth sinkhole developed east of the dam in February 2003 that was filled several times. In August 2005 another sinkhole developed to the east. A September 2006 report by the United States Army Corps of Engineers noted, \\"In terms of internal erosion potential of the foundation, Mosul Dam is the most dangerous dam in the world.\\" The report further outlined a worst-case scenario, in which a sudden collapse of the dam would flood Mosul under of water and Baghdad, a city of 7 million, to , with an estimated death toll of 500,000.\\"Iraqi Dam Seen In Danger of Deadly Collapse\\" by Amit R. Paley, The Washington Post, October 30, 2007 A report on 30 October 2007 by the US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) said that the dam's foundations could give way at any moment.\\"Iraq dismisses Mosul Dam warnings\\" BBC news, October 31, 2007 According to The Economist, \\"One study says that if the dam collapses, Mosul would be submerged within hours. Another warns that half a million Iraqis could be killed by floodwaters, and more than a million forced from their homes. Disease and looting as the floodwaters raced through Baiji, Tikrit, Samarra, and even parts of Baghdad would complete that dreadful scenario.\\" Nadhir al-Ansari, an engineer involved in the building of the dam who is currently Professor of Engineering at the Lule√• University of Technology, Sweden, said that the floodwaters would take four hours to reach Mosul and 45 hours to reach Baghdad, and that more than a million people would be killed if a \\"good evacuation plan\\" were not in place. In 2004, dam manager Abdulkhalik Thanoon Ayoub ordered the dam's water level, which can reach above sea level, to have a maximum of , thus reducing the pressure on the structure. Nevertheless, Iraqi officials maintain that the U.S. government is overstating the risk. The Army Corps of Engineers has proposed that the Badush Dam downstream be completed to serve its purpose of obstructing the large wave that would result if the Mosul Dam collapsed. This has been resisted by Iraqi officials, who note that the current plan for the Badush Dam is US$300 million to provide hydroelectric power and help irrigation while the proposed expansion would cost $10 billion. In 2007, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers developed and executed a US$27 million plan to help continue maintenance and repairs on the dam in the short-term. The Iraq Government was also recommended a long-term solution that includes the construction of deep walls around the dam foundation. The project would cost $4 billion and take approximately four to five years to complete. = Renewed instability concerns = Maintenance had been deferred during the Battle for Mosul Dam due to security concerns, and many workers did not work both because of the risk of attacks by ISIS and lack of pay. Half of the workers who worked at the dam have quit because they had not been paid for more than five months, and budget shortfalls and political infighting between the Kurdish regional government and the central government of Iraq have made it difficult to hire new workers. Together these factors have made Mosul Dam the \\"most dangerous dam in the world\\", because there are \\"almost certainly an unprecedented level of untreated voids\\" in the dam's foundation.\\" Growing instability concerns due to the previous control of the dam by ISIL, and poor security led the Iraq government to award a ‚Ç¨273 million contract to the Italian company Trevi S.p.A. in 2016 to grout and stabilize the dam‚Äôs foundation and to rehabilitate other key infrastructure on the dam. In July 2018, a contract extension was negotiated for an additional ‚Ç¨89 million for a total contract amount of ‚Ç¨363 million ($408M). The contract covers repairs to the dam and the Italian government plans to send 450 additional troops to provide security at the dam site. In January 2016, U.S. General Sean MacFarland warned that the dam might undergo a \\"catastrophic\\" collapse. He added, \\"What we do know is this‚Äîif this dam were in the United States, we would have drained the lake behind it.\\" Maintenance had suffered as ISIL had removed equipment and chased technicians away in August 2014, and the grouting schedule had not been maintained. He indicated that contingency plans are in the works to protect people downstream in case of a collapse. Some Iraqi officials continued to dismiss claims of a potential failure. In February 2016, the Minister of Water Resources, Muhsin al-Shammari, stated \\"The looming danger to Mosul dam is one in a thousand. This risk level is present in all the world's dams.\\" In February 2016, the United States Embassy in Iraq warned of a \\"serious and unprecedented\\" danger of the dam collapsing and suggested that plans for evacuation should be made, as the cities Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra, and Baghdad could be at risk in the event of collapse, and that up to 1.5 million people could be killed due to the ensuing flash floods.BBC News (2015) US warns of Mosul dam collapse in northern Iraq, February 29th The Prime Minister of Iraq, Haider al-Abadi, repeated these concerns, and called for citizens in Mosul to evacuate and move at least 3.5 miles away from the river, a proposal that was criticized by Professor al- Ansari: \\"What are all these people, millions of people, supposed to do when they get 6 km away? There is no support for them there. Nothing to help them live.\\" On February 29, a Trevi spokesman said that the contract had still not been signed. There were concerns that the dam could collapse before the repair works begin. On March 2, 2016, the Iraqi government announced that the contract with Trevi was finalized and signed. A team of Italian specialists from Trevi arrived on April 14 to set up camp for the group of engineers who are expected to arrive within a few weeks. Italian Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti met Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on May 9 to discuss logistics for deploying 450 troops near the frontline with ISIL to protect the workers carrying out repairs on the dam. Trevi started working on the dam in September 2016. The repairs were started in October 2016. In May 2017, Iraqi Minister of Water Resources Hassan Janabi stated that no danger to the dam remained and it was going back to normal operation. Carlo Crippa, the project manager, said the dam structure now showed no significant signs of distress. However, constant maintenance will be necessary, as \\"the rocks of the foundations are prone to dissolution due to the circulation of water.\\" Five waterways that controlled the flow of water into the dam became operational after 12 years, with Janabi saying the water level was at the highest level since 2005.

Two years later the Storting decided to privatize NMD, and sold 17% to the Dutch Apothekers Co√∂peratie, and the state ownership was transferred from the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services to the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry. Also, the medical equipment subsidiary was sold to the Dutch company. In 1999 2% of the company was sold to 223 pharmacies throughout the country. On March 1, 2001 the new Pharmacy Act was established, allowing free establishment of pharmacies in Norway. At the same time the state decided to not have any ownership in NMD, and sold its part, along with the rest of the owners, to Celesio. After the deregulation of market almost all pharmacies have been bought by the three wholesaler groups, and NMD created two subsidiaries, NMD Grossisthandel for wholesale and Vitusapotek to operate the pharmacies.

Life Neild, son of James Neild, prison reformer, was probably born in St. James's Street, London, about 1780. He was educated at Eton from 1793 to 1797, then at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1801, and being awarded his honorary M.A. three years later, as is standard at Cambridge. On 9 Feb. 1808 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. Succeeding in 1814 to the whole of his father's property, estimated at ¬£250,000, he developed into a confirmed miser, and the last thirty years of his life were solely employed in accumulating wealth. He lived in a large house, 5 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, but it was so meanly furnished that for some time he had not a bed to lie on. His dress consisted of a blue swallow-tailed coat with gilt buttons, brown trousers, short gaiters, and shoes which were patched and generally down at the heels. He never allowed his clothes to be brushed, because, he said, it destroyed the nap. He continually visited his numerous estates, walking whenever it was possible, never went to the expense of a great-coat, and always stayed with his tenants, sharing their coarse meals and lodging. While at North Marston, in Buckinghamshire, about 1828 he attempted to cut his throat, and his life was only saved by the prompt attention of his tenant's wife, Mrs. Neale. Unlike other eminent misers ‚Äì Daniel Dancer or Hetty Green ‚Äì he occasionally indulged in acts of benevolence, possessed considerable knowledge of legal and general literature, and to the last retained a love for the classics. He died at 5 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, 30 Aug. 1852, aged 72, and was buried in the chancel of North Marston Church on 9 Sept. By his will, after bequeathing a few trifling legacies, he left the whole of his property, estimated at ¬£500,000, to ‚ÄòHer Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, begging Her Majesty's most gracious acceptance of the same for her sole use and benefit.‚Äô Two caveats were entered against the will, but were subsequently withdrawn. Queen Victoria increased Neild's bequests to the three executors from ¬£100 to ¬£1,000 each, she provided for his servants, for whom he made no provision, and she secured an annuity of ¬£100 to Mrs. Neale, who had frustrated Neild's attempt at suicide. In 1855 Queen Victoria restored the chancel of North Marston Church and inserted a window to Neild's memory.

Background and education He was born in Glasgow the son of John Buchanan of Dowanhill. His brother was the eminent chemist and explorer John Young Buchanan (1844-1925).http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He was educated at Sherborne School and Balliol College, Oxford. He later became a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and was called to the Bar. Political career In 1880 Buchanan unsuccessfully contested Haddington in the 1880 general election but was successfully returned to Parliament for Edinburgh in an 1881 by-election. This constituency was abolished in 1885 and he was elected for the newly created constituency of Edinburgh West as a Liberal Unionist. However, in 1888 Buchanan announced that he supported William Ewart Gladstone's Home Rule policy. He resigned his seat and was elected by a narrow majority as a Gladstonian and Home Ruler the same year. Buchanan lost the Edinburgh West seat in 1892 but returned to the House of Commons in December the same year when he was elected to represent Aberdeenshire East in a by-election. He lost this seat in the 1900 general election and remained out of the House of Commons for the next three years. However, in February 1903 he was returned as the member for Perthshire East, a seat he held until 1910. When the Liberals came to power in December 1905 he was appointed Financial Secretary to the War Office by Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, a post he retained until April 1908. The latter month he was sworn of the Privy Council and made Under-Secretary of State for India by the new Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith. He remained in this post until June 1909. Personal life Buchanan married Emily Octavia Bolitho on 15 August 1888 at Madron, Penzance, Cornwall. He was a noted collector of books and manuscripts.

Life Neville, third son of Richard Griffin Neville, 3rd Baron Braybrooke, was born in Charles Street in the parish of St. George, Hanover Square, London, on 17 March 1820, and was educated at Eton from 1832 till 1837. On 2 June 1837 he was gazetted an ensign and lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, and served with that regiment in Canada during the rebellion in the winter of 1838. On 5 November in that year he had a narrow escape from drowning in the St. Lawrence. On 31 December 1841 he was promoted to be lieutenant and captain, and on 2 Sept. 1842 retired from the service. For some years, aided by his sister, he devoted himself to the study of natural history, and to the investigation of the Roman and Saxon remains in the neighbourhood of Audley End, Essex, and ultimately attained a distinguished position among the practical arch√¶ologists of his day. At one period geology was his favourite pursuit, and he formed a collection of fossils, which he presented to the museum at Saffron Walden. He also brought together a beautiful series of stuffed birds. The most remarkable feature, however, of his collections at Audley End is the museum of antiquities of every period, the creation of his own exertions, and consisting almost exclusively of objects brought to light at the Roman station at Great Chesterford, or at other sites of Roman occupation in the vicinity of Audley End, and at the Saxon cemeteries excavated under his directions near Little Wilbraham and Linton in Cambridgeshire during 1851 and 1852. On 25 March 1847 he had been elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and from time to time he made communications to that body regarding his explorations (cf. Arch√¶ologia, xxxii. 350‚Äì4, 357‚Äì6). To the ‚ÄòJournal of the British Arch√¶ological Association‚Äô he also communicated memoirs (cf. iii. 208‚Äì13). To the ‚ÄòJournal of the Arch√¶ological Institute,‚Äô of which society he became a vice-president in 1850, he was a frequent contributor (Journal, vi. 14‚Äì26, viii. 27‚Äì35, x. 224‚Äì34, xi. 207‚Äì15, xiii. 1‚Äì13). To the ‚ÄòTransactions of the Essex Arch√¶ological Society‚Äô he sent a list of potters' names upon Samian ware (i. 141‚Äì8), and notes on Roman Essex (i. 191‚Äì200). On the death of John Disney in 1857 he was elected president of the society. In March 1858 he succeeded as fourth Baron Braybrooke. He was hereditary visitor of Magdalene College, Cambridge, high steward of Wokingham, Berkshire, and vice-lieutenant of the county of Essex. He died at Audley End on 22 Feb. 1861, having married on 27 Jan. 1852 Lady Charlotte Sarah Graham Toler, sixth daughter of the second Earl of Norbury. She was born 26 Dec. 1826; married secondly, on 6 Nov. 1862, Frederic Hetley, M.D., of Norwood, and died on 4 Feb. 1867.

He is best known for his Judge and Jury Society performances and for his ownership of the newspaper The Town. After being orphaned at a young age, Nicholson was raised by his sisters, and became an apprentice to a pawnbroker. He then opened a series of unsuccessful businesses that often catered to the lower classes of London, selling cigars, wine and jewels. These ventures were frequently unsuccessful, and he often faced insolvency. After a stint in the gambling industry, he began serving as the editor of The Town newspaper. It typically covered scandals in London high society. A public feud later erupted between Nicholson and another editor, Barnard Gregory, who published a competing paper. Nicholson also published other periodicals and several literary works, including an autobiography. After leaving the newspaper industry, Nicholson began operating a hotel. There Nicholson began his Judge and Jury Society performances, which lasted for two decades. These acts mocked and satirised members of London society and the preoccupations of the popular press. Though his acts were derided by some for their crudeness, they were attended by many aristocrats, politicians, and other prominent citizens. He hosted the performances at other venues in London and around England, producing the Judge and Jury Society for almost two decades. Nicholson also staged poses plastiques performances at his establishments. These acts consisted of barely clothed women posing in imitation of well-known works of art. Nicholson catered beverages to a number of racecourses outside of London. He was briefly the owner of Cremorne Gardens. The changes that he made to the pleasure gardens there had a lasting influence on the park's reputation. Though he often encountered financial difficulties, by the time of his death he was known for his frequent acts of generosity to the poor. Childhood and early career Nicholson was born in suburban East London and lived on Hackney Road as a child. He was orphaned at a young age, and moved to Islington to be raised by his two sisters, who ran a school there. They raised him as though he were a child of their own. The income from the school allowed them to live a comfortable lifestyle. He was taught by Henry Butter, a well- respected author who had written a much-read treatise on teaching spelling. As a child, Nicholson was fascinated by clowns, and often spent time watching them. Nicholson moved to Shadwell as a young man, and began working as an apprentice to a pawnbroker. After working in Shadwell for several years, Nicholson moved to Kensington. There he continued working as a pawnbroker until 1830. This occupation exposed him to many lower-class residents of London. In the early 1830s he opened a jewellery store on Regent Street near Leicester Square. He targeted Demimonde customers, whose penchant for conspicuous consumption caused them to frequently patronise jewellers. His business soon failed and he went bankrupt. Nicholson soon incurred significant debts. As a result, he was sent to debtors' prison several times. He later claimed to know the city's debtors' prisons better than anyone else. He was sometimes homeless after being released. Nicholson then began spending much of his time gambling in London. He preferred roulette and billiards. He frequently gambled at suburban racecourses in the summer. In 1836 he married, and soon became a cigar merchant. The cigar shop featured a back room where patrons could drink liquor and gamble. He soon abandoned this venture to begin selling wine at a new location in Leicester Square. Writing In 1837 Nicholson began working as the editor of The Town, a new weekly paper in London. First published in June 1837, it featured sensationalism and semi- pornographic content. It frequently covered the scandals of members of London's high society, but also advocated universal suffrage. It was often criticised, because it openly discussed subjects that its competitors considered obscene. The Town was later targeted by Barnard Gregory, the publisher of The Satirist. Gregory was notorious for publishing reports of scandals or blackmailing people. He published several articles attacking The Town. Nicholson retaliated in The Town, with a series of scathing attacks on Gregory and his paper. Gregory responded by pressing libel charges against Nicholson. The case was not brought to trial due to Gregory's imprisonment on unrelated blackmail charges. Though the feud with Gregory increased the circulation of The Town, the paper's sales diminished after the case was dismissed. The paper soon encountered financial difficulties and closed. In 1838 Nicholson and Last began publishing a more expensive paper known as The Crown. It took a very different focus from The Town, with a more serious tone, and support of Whig politics and the Church of England. Its first issue carried an editorial written by Nicholson under the pseudonym of \\"Censor\\", which attacked The Town for its immorality. This caused some to believe that the serious tone of The Crown was not entirely sincere. The Crown ceased publication in 1840. While serving as the editor of the two papers, Nicholson published two books on boxing. Nicholson began publishing a magazine known as Illustrated London Life in 1843. It released 25 issues before it folded. Garrick's Head and Town Hotel Portrayal of the Judge and Jury Society In 1842 Nicholson opened the Garrick's Head and Town Hotel on Bow Street in the Covent Garden district of London. The hotel eventually became a popular location frequented by many London residents, including city clerks and gamblers. It also attracted many tourists who visited London for its nightlife. After purchasing the hotel, Nicholson hired Archibald Henning to paint large portraits on the side of the building, hoping that they would lure curious pedestrians inside. These portraits depicted showed well-known people, such as The Duke of Wellington and Alfred d'Orsay, attending events at the hotel. The hotel was known for the Judge and Jury Society performances that it hosted. The performances featured Nicholson posing as \\"The Chief Lord Baron\\" and holding mock trials. These trials often focused on well-known scandals or controversial issues and were known for humorous repartee, crude jokes, and biting satire. Frequent subjects featured in the trials included divorces and seductions. Clement Scott once described Nicholson's role in the event as a \\"plebeian Falstaff\\". During the performances, Nicholson wore a judge's wig and robe and was referred to as \\"my lord\\" by the cast. He sat at a raised desk next to boxes for the prosecutor, witness, and jury. In many instances, men would play the roles of women. The audience sat directly in front of Nicholson's desk. Many of the trials satirised and exaggerated the details of well-known divorce cases, and the actors who portrayed the lawyers often mimicked famous lawyers. The testimonies that were delivered during the performances were generally filled with of innuendos and double entendres. The audiences often included well known citizens and occasionally members of Parliament. The Garrick's Head and Town Hotel charged visitors a one shilling fee for admittance. Once inside, each guest was given a glass of grog and a cigar. In 1844 the Judge and Jury Society moved to a new location at the Coal Hole Tavern in Strand. At this location, Nicholson began to hold mock parliamentary debates. He also held events in towns outside of London. During the summers, Nicholson served beverages and set up dancing booths at racecourses. Cremorne Gardens ‚Äô'The Dancing Platform at Cremorne Gardens'‚Äô by Phoebus Levin In 1843 Nicholson purchased a rural sporting arena in Chelsea, London, on the banks of the River Thames, that had opened eleven years earlier. It featured entrances from King's Road and the River Thames. Originally an unremarkable location, Nicholson made drastic changes soon after his purchase, including a large pagoda that was surrounded by a large dancing platform and housed a large orchestra. The facility was surrounded by gardens. Nicholson added refreshment booths and tables so guests could sit and eat at the gardens. While most of the contemporary pleasure gardens were exclusive venues, Nicholson envisioned Cremorne Gardens as a popular amusement park for common people. Nicholson's financial situation soon deteriorated, and he was forced to sell the gardens. By this time Nicholson was well known for the licentiousness of The Town and the Judge and Jury Society performances. Because of this association, Cremorne Gardens also came to represent sexual immorality. Even after he sold Cremorne Gardens, it retained its reputation, and in London the name \\"Cremorne\\" became a general term for sexual excesses. Poses plastiques Coal Hole, 1854 In 1846 Nicholson began showing poses plastiques, a form of tableau vivant, at Garrick's Head and Town Hotel. The acts, which later became a common form of entertainment in London, featured models reenacting a work of art. Nicholson claimed to have been the first person in London to host such an event. The performances were typically scheduled for the early evening, and after performances in the local theatres concluded. At Nicholson's hotel, the models often stood on a revolving stage that overlooked the audience. The stage was illuminated by blue lights, and the room was covered in mirrors. Nicholson stood near the models as they posed and delivered a lecture on art to the audience, most of whom drank and smoked cigars during the performance. He advertised the events as \\"representing Pictures from the Manchester Art Galleries and scenes from all the Principal Tragedies, Dramas, Operas\\". The women were purported to be a musical group known as the \\"Female American Serenaders\\". Many of the titles of the acts suggested that nudity would be on display, such as \\"The Sultan's Favourite returning from the bath\\" or \\"Cupid and Psyche\\". One of the few existing depictions of an event shows two women onstage, unclothed except for a loose skirt below the waist of one, and a sash wrapped between the legs and over the shoulder of the other. Although the poses plastiques were never considered a serious form of art, Nicholson's version has been described as the most low brow form that it took. A writer visiting from France published a critical account of the show, characterising it as a pretentious form of entertainment. It was also criticised by English social reformers, who characterized the acts as a form of prostitution. After Nicholson moved his events to the Coal Hole tavern, the management officially stopped allowing women into the audience in order to fight this perception. However, some women were still able to gain entry to the events. Later performances Nicholson continued to hold events at Garrick's Head and Town Hotel until 1851. That year, he became engaged in a dispute with the management, and moved back to the Coal Hole tavern. He soon encountered financial difficulties, which prompted him to begin performing and receiving a regular salary rather than owning and managing a venue. He often gave three performances per night at the Coal Hole tavern. Nicholson remained at the Coal Hole tavern until 1858, when he moved to the Cider Cellar on Maiden Lane. At the Cider Cellar, he continued staging the Judge and Jury Society and poses plastiques. There he produced one of his most successful events, an 1858 production of a mock trial satirizing the public attention that was given to prostitution. This was a topic that many newspapers were devoting a significant amount of coverage to at that time, and the address given by Nicholson's primary lawyer was later printed and sold well in London. The trial was accompanied by a poses plastiques performance. Later life and family In 1860 Nicholson wrote an autobiography titled Rogue's Progress: The Autobiography of 'Lord Chief Baron' Nicholson. The book covered a variety of events in his life, describing debtors' prisons as well as the Judge and Jury Society. It initially garnered positive reviews from some critics, and was republished in 1965 by Houghton Mifflin. Late in his life he curtailed some of his activities because of ailments such as Dropsy and heart disease. Though he often struggled to stay solvent, Nicholson frequently gave charitably to many poor residents of London. Nicholson died in 1861 while staying at his daughters' house in London. He was buried in Brompton Cemetery in South West London.

Located approximately 3 miles east of Eye, it is within the district of Mid Suffolk. It shares its name with Denham (St Edmundsbury), another Suffolk village. Denham's small population is rather scattered, but chiefly clustered along Hoxne Road and The Street, the latter marked on some maps as 'Denham Street'. Curiously, the parish boundary runs along both these roads meaning the majority of the houses in the parish are at its very edge. After years in planning, a village sign was unveiled near Shingle Hill Corner on 27 September 2008. The Street is one of over 100 roads so named in Suffolk, typically reserved for the main thoroughfare through a 'street village'. The Street in Denham is unusual in that it is now a no-through road, though it is reasonable to suggest that at one time it was the main street for Denham, and presumably led somewhere, perhaps to Redlingfield to the south. The parish church of St John the Baptist is small but full of interest. It stands a little isolated from the main area of settlement, as is common in some East Anglian parishes. Chiefly dating from the 14th and 15th centuries it comprises the nave (with outward bowing walls), chancel, Victorian vestry and redbrick entrance porch. A west tower is thought to have been removed in the early 18th century - the 'new' west wall is chiefly built of red brick. The octagonal font has been restored and is very plain. In the sanctuary is a brass to Anthony Bedingfield, the third son of Sir Edward Bedingfield, 1574, with a palimpsest of Jacobus Wegheschede, c 1500. A bell turret contained a single bell, now to be found by the organ and inscribed I.D. 1614. 3 bells are recorded in 1553, suggesting the west tower still stood at the time. A north chapel has long been removed and the arch blocked in with brick. Here can be found memorials to the Bedingfield family. The building was in a rather parlous state (2009) but since then has been fully repaired chiefly using English Heritage funding. White's Directory of 1844 lists 313 'souls' living in the parish. Apart from farmers, the only trades listed included a corn miller, wheelwright, blacksmith and two beerhouse keepers. By 1937 the situation had changed little except for the disappearance of the miller and addition of a grocery-cum-post office, though the population as of 1931 had fallen to 170. Since then the post office has closed and the only building used for community purposes (apart from the church) is the Village Hall, formerly a guard's hut for Horham Airfield. Indeed, Denham sits amidst an historic landscape of WW2 airfields. Immediately to the east is the site of RAF Horham ('Horrum') airfield (so large that it straddled Denham, Horham and Hoxne parishes), used by the USAAF 95th Bomb Group from 1943 to 1945. Adjacent to Redlingfield Wood in Denham parish is the site of the airfield hospital which has been restored as a museum and a memorial those who served with the 95th in WW2. The Officer's Club at Horham airfield (the 'Red Feather Club', also within Denham parish) has been preserved and like the hospital is occasionally open over summer months. Rumour has it that Glenn Miller, the American Big 'swing' Band leader visited the old Green Man public house in Denham around the time he and his band played at Horham air base on September 10, 1944. Other airfields near Denham included Eye (to the west), Thorpe Abbotts (to the north) and Mendlesham towards the south. References *Kellys Directory to Suffolk (various editions). *Denham Notes.

He was Church of Ireland Bishop of Ossory, Ferns and Leighlin from 1842 to 1874. Early life O'Brien, born at New Ross, County Wexford, in September 1792, was the son of Michael Burke O'Brien, a corporation officer, with the title of deputy sovereign of New Ross, who died in 1826. His mother, Dorothy, was the daughter of Thomas Kough. The father, who came originally from County Clare, was descended, although himself a Protestant, from a Roman Catholic branch of the great O'Brien family, which had been deprived of its property by the penal laws; he was well educated, but more imprudent than provident. The son was educated at the endowed school of New Ross, and entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a pensioner in November 1810. A portion of the cost of his education was defrayed by the borough of New Ross; in September 1826 he refunded the amount, ¬£116, and was voted the freedom of the borough and a gold box. O'Brien obtained a scholarship at Trinity College in 1813, graduated B.A., and took the gold medal in 1815. He was especially distinguished in mathematics. Career In 1820, O'Brien obtained a fellowship of Trinity, and took holy orders. He was awarded the degree of D.D. in 1830. He was one of the six University of Dublin preachers from 1828 till 1842, and became Archbishop King's lecturer in 1833, when the divinity school in the university was thoroughly reorganised. O'Brien maintained through life strongly evangelical views. He was well read in the works of the reformers and their opponents, and in those of Bishop Butler and the Deists. In 1829 and 1830 his university sermons on the reformation doctrine of justification by faith became, when published in 1833, a standard work. As Archbishop King's lecturer, he lectured on ‚ÄòThe Evidences of Religion, with a special reference to Sceptical and Infidel Attempts to invalidate them, and the Socinian controversy.‚Äô Resigning his fellowship in 1836, he became vicar of Clonderhorka, Raphoe, but removed in 1837 to the vicarage of Arboe, Armagh, which he held till 1841. On 9 Nov. 1841 he was nominated Dean of Cork, and instituted on 5 Jan. 1842. On 9 March in the same year he was raised by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel to the bishopric of the united dioceses of Ossory, Ferns, and Leighlin. O'Brien was a daily worshipper in St Canice's Cathedral, but he seldom preached or spoke except at the meetings of the church education society, of which he was an active champion. Naturally opposed to the Oxford Movement, he did what he could to stem its advance in sermons and writings between 1840 and 1850. In 1850 appeared his ‚ÄòTractarianism: its present State, and the only Safeguard against it.‚Äô To the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland O'Brien maintained a well-sustained resistance, and Archbishop Trench acknowledged much aid from his advice in the course of the struggle. When disestablishment came, O'Brien helped to reorganise the church, and moderated the zeal of his evangelical friends in their efforts to revise the prayer-book in accordance with their own predilections. O'Brien died at 49 Thurloe Square, London, 12 December 1874, and was buried in the churchyard of St. Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny. On 19 December Archbishop Trench described him, when addressing the clergy of the diocese assembled to elect a successor in the see, as a fit representative of the ideal anƒìr tetrag≈çnos, i.e. the philosopher's four- square man, able to resist attack from whatever quarter made, and his successor, Dr. Robert Gregg, in his primary charge, spoke of O'Brien's ‚Äòunvarying consistency, calm judgement, and chastened self-restraint.‚Äô His personal appearance was dignified and imposing. He married in 1836 Ellen, second daughter of Edward Pennefather, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland and his wife Susannah Darby, by whom he had eight sons and five daughters. Works O'Brien's chief work, ‚ÄòAn Attempt to explain the Doctrine of Justification by Faith only, in Ten Sermons,‚Äô 1833, was long popular; 2nd ed. 1862, 3rd ed. 1863, 4th ed. 1877, and 5th ed. 1886. His primary and second charges, 1842 and 1845, published in London, and directed in great part against Tractarianism, each went to two or three editions, and the substance of the second was again reproduced in 1847. In 1833 he attacked Edward Irving's views in ‚ÄòTwo Sermons on the Human Nature of our Blessed Lord,‚Äô which were re-published in 1873 with a ‚ÄòPlea from the Bible and the Bible alone for the Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration.‚Äô Among other works were: #‚ÄòThe Expediency of restoring at this Time to the Church her Synodical Powers considered‚Äô, 1843, #‚ÄòThe Church in Ireland: our Duty in regard to its Defence‚Äô, 1866. #‚ÄòThe Case of the Established Church in Ireland‚Äô, with app., 1867‚Äì8; 3rd ed. 1868 and #‚ÄòThe Disestablishment and Disendowment of the Irish Branch of the United Church considered‚Äô, 1869; three editions.

Plot Martin (Hoult), a pharmacist, and Gabriella (Costa), a physical therapy assistant, live in Los Angeles where they both frequently use an online dating app to hookup with people. After a night of bad dates, the two return to the app where they match with each other and agree to meet at a bar. They spend the rest of the night talking and Martin mentions he used to be married. They then go back to Martin's apartment and have sex. Soon after, the two begin a relationship and Gabriella moves in with Martin. On a visit to Martin's parents, his father reveals to Gabriella that his mother has dementia. She also sees various photos around the house of Martin's ex-wife, Bethany and of an unknown girl. At home, Gabriella gets upset that Martin never mentioned his mother's condition or the girl in his childhood photos. He accuses her of being nosy and angrily reveals he had a sister that died when she was 16. They have a heated argument where Gabriella storms out. The next day, an acquaintance invites Gabriella to a dinner party while Martin goes clubbing with his co-workers. They both end up cheating but confess their infidelity the next morning and decide to seek therapy. Through therapy, they decide to begin an open relationship. Gabriella's friend, Blake, invites them both to a party where they spend the night flirting with other guests. Martin bonds with Blake while Gabriella grows close to Blake's boss, an older man named Larry. The couple continues their string of hookups with other people until Gabriella suggests a threesome, to which Martin asks for Blake but Gabriella disapproves because they are friends. Gabriella soon starts spending more time with Larry and his daughter. Meanwhile, Martin discovers Bethany recently had a child. Unsettled, he watches old home videos that he secretly kept. Martin later goes to a bar alone where he runs into Blake. After a night of drinking, he reveals Bethany miscarried when they were together and that he has unresolved feelings for her. The conversation makes Blake uncomfortable and she leaves. Martin returns home immediately to talk to Gabriella but she dismisses him. Later Larry gives Gabriella a necklace, which she later hides from Martin and they have sex. The next morning, Gabriella admits she climaxed during sex with Larry, which unsettles Martin. Gabriella discovers Martin's private messages to his ex-wife and he finds Larry's necklace causing the two to erupt in anger. Gabriella leaves the apartment and moves in with Larry. Larry reveals that in two weeks, he will be leaving on a 2-year business trip around Europe which he invites Gabriella to join him. Martin and Bethany meet up after he sent her the email where she states it's neither of their faults that their marriage didn't work because they were both young and naive. She then says she is happy even though her life has become boring and predictable. They part ways amicably. One night, Larry throws a party where Blake is in attendance which Gabriella demands him to kick her out. He refuses and calls her immature. She then leaves to a club where she seduces two men before breaking down. She returns the next day and tries to talk to Larry but he says he doesn't care and belittles her behavior which causes her to leave him. Eventually, she visits Martin who admits he was never really comfortable with an open relationship. The two reconcile and reassure their love for one another.

Biography Patsy Lewis was born October 23, 1947 in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States, and moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1951. In the early 1960s, Pat, her sister Dianne, and two friends (Betty and Jackie Winston) formed the group, The Adorables, who recorded a record and began singing backing vocals for Golden World Records. Lewis debuted as a solo artist in 1966 with Can't Shake It Loose while also beginning to do outside backing vocals sessions. She met Motown Records' in-house backing group The Andantes, and one day when one of the girls could not make the session for Stevie Wonder's \\"Up-Tight\\", Lewis stepped in and did it as well as several other Motown sessions. She signed to Solid Hit Bound Records and released a string of singles, including \\"Look At What I Almost Missed\\", \\"Warning\\", \\"No One to Love\\", \\"No Baby No\\", and \\"The Loser\\". From the late 1960s on, she became a permanent backing singer for Aretha Franklin, Isaac Hayes and later on George Clinton too. She wrote several songs for Isaac Hayes. Later years In 1989, Lewis as well as The Andantes were among the invited artists to join UK producer Ian Levine's mega-project Motorcity Records, a label formed to record new material on former Motown artists. She became the main backing vocals co-ordinator for the label and did several hundred arrangements while she recorded more than 50 tracks with herself and as a lead singer for the re-formed Andantes. Her single Separation (1991) (co-written by Levine and Billy Griffin) was Single of the Week when reviewed in British soul magazine Blues & Soul. After the label's demise in 1992, she continued to work with Levine on a regular basis. In 1997, she recorded 50 cover versions of selected Motown and Northern Soul classics, although only a handful of tracks have been released on various artists compilations. In 1999, she recorded 76 gospel tracks with Levine for K-Tel. As for the present, Lewis occasionally tours with Martha Reeves's original backing group The Vandellas and most recently performed in Manchester, England in October 2007; where she had also been scheduled to record a new track for Levine's album Disco 2008, an engagement she had to cancel due to health problems.

Osborn was born at Agra, India, on 6 Aug. 1835. His father, Henry Roche Osborn, entered the British East India Company's service in May 1819, and served most of his time in the 54th Native Infantry, but later was lieutenant- colonel of the 13th Native Infantry; he died at Ferozepore in 1849. Military career Robert was educated as a cadet at Dr. Greig's school at Walthamstow, and was appointed ensign of the 26th Bengal Native Infantry 16 Aug. 1854, becoming lieutenant on 31 July 1857. He served throughout the Indian Mutiny campaign of 1857‚Äì1859, and was present in the actions of Boolundshuhur on 27 Sept., and of Allyghur on 5 Oct. 1857. He commanded a detachment of the 4th Punjab infantry at the actions of Gungeree and Puttiallee, was present in various operations against the rebels in the Agra district, served with Colonel Troup's column in Oude in November 1858, and took part in the action at Biswah. From January to May 1859, he was with the Saugor field force under General Whitlock; then he commanded a field detachment in the Ooraie district, and later defeated a party of rebels at Tudhoorkee. In 1859‚Äì60 he was with the Bundelcund field force under Brigadier Wheeler, and for his services received a medal. He was made lieutenant in the Bengal Staff Corps 30 July 1857 and captain 20 Dec. 1865. On 25 Aug. 1859, he became adjutant of the 2nd regiment of Sikh irregular cavalry, a regiment converted into the 12th regiment of Bengal cavalry in 1861, in which Osborn was third squad officer from 4 Nov. 1865 to 17 May 1866. He was captain in his regiment 8 June 1868 to 1872. In the latter year he was appointed tutor to the Paikharah wards, became major 20 Dec. 1873, and retired with the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel on 1 May 1879. He served through the Afghan campaign of that year, but retired after the signing of the Treaty of Gandamak. Writings Osborn was a serious thinker on both religious and political topics. As a young man he enjoyed the friendship of F. D. Maurice and of Charles Kingsley, and occasionally wrote papers in the magazines on Maurice's religious position and influence. While in India, he was a conscientious student of Eastern religions, and spent fourteen years in studying materials for his two works, Islam under the Arabs, 1876, and Islam under the Khalifs of Baghdad, 1877; 2nd ed. 1880. These books are highly valued by serious students. They are considered models of lucid and graceful treatment of a perplexing subject. At the same time, Osborn was always a zealous advocate of the rights of the native Indians, and his retirement from the army was largely due to his dissatisfaction with the policy of Lord Lytton, which, in his opinion, outraged native sentiment and needlessly provoked the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Upon his return from India, he settled at Hampstead, and mainly devoted himself to journalistic and literary work. He became London correspondent of the Calcutta Statesman, and took a leading part in the conduct of the London office of the Statesman, which was published for a few months in 1879 and 1880 with a view to resisting Benjamin Disraeli's policy in India. In The Scotsman, The Nation, and The Contemporary Review, he also wrote much on India and on native claims to popular government. Personal life Osborn was an indefatigable lawn tennis player. He died on Good Friday, 19 April 1889, while engaged playing a match with Ernest Renshaw, the champion of all England, at the Hyde Park, London tennis court in England. He married at Trinity Church, Bayswater, 12 Nov. 1864, to Edith, daughter of the Rev. Gregory Rhodes, by whom he had two daughters. An oil portrait of Osborn was painted by Mr. J. R. Hodgson, R.A., in 1877, and was exhibited in the Royal Academy. It was presented to Osborn by the artist, and it passed on to his family.

History The cathedral was built in 1991 to serve as a replacement for the Old Cathedral of Managua or St. James' Cathedral (Catedral de Santiago). The old cathedral was damaged and thought to be unrestoreable after a 1972 earthquake that destroyed 90% of the city. The new cathedral was designed by the Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta. Construction began around August 1991, and the cathedral was inaugurated on September 4, 1993. The cost of the newly built cathedral was estimated at $4.5 million. The new cathedral has generated much controversy, particularly about its architectural style and finance. The costs were covered partially thanks to the help of American Tom Monaghan, owner of Domino's Pizza. Locals refer to it as La Chichona on account of the plethora of cupolas adorning it which resemble many chichas (Spanish: slang for \\"breasts\\").

These restraints on aerial warfare are covered by the general laws of war, because unlike war on land and at sea‚Äîwhich are specifically covered by rules such as the 1907 Hague Convention and Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions, which contain pertinent restrictions, prohibitions and guidelines‚Äîthere are no treaties specific to aerial warfare. To be legal, aerial operations must comply with the principles of humanitarian law: military necessity, distinction, and proportionality: An attack or action must be intended to help in the military defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a military objective, and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. International law up to 1945 International law relating to aerial bombardment before and during World War II rests on the treaties of 1864, 1899, and 1907, which constituted the definition of most of the laws of war at that time ‚Äî which, despite repeated diplomatic attempts, was not updated in the immediate run up to World War II. The most relevant of these treaties is the Hague Convention of 1907 because it was the last treaty ratified before 1939 which specify the laws of war regarding the use of bombardment. In the Hague Convention of 1907, there are two which have a direct bearing on this issue of bombardment. These are \\"Laws of War: Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV); 18 October 1907\\"Laws of War: Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV); 18 October 1907 available from the Avalon Project at the Yale Law School, entered into force: 26 January 1910. and \\"Laws of War: Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War (Hague IX); 18 October 1907\\".Laws of War: Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War (Hague IX); October 18, 1907, available from the Avalon Project at the Yale Law School, It is significant that there is a different treaty which should be invoked for bombardment of land by land (Hague IV) and of land by sea (Hague IX).International Review of the Red Cross no 323 cites: Charles Rousseau, References p. 360. \\"the a nalogy between land and aerial bombardment\\".

With the rise of aerial warfare, non-combatants became extremely vulnerable and were inevitably collateral targets in such warfare potentially on a much larger scale than previously. Sch√ºtte Lanz SL2 bombing Warsaw in 1914 World War I saw the first time strategic bombing was used when German Zeppelins and aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs on cities in Britain and France.

A few years after World War I, a draft convention was proposed in 1923: The Hague Rules of Air Warfare.The Hague Rules of Air Warfare, 1922‚Äì12 to 1923‚Äì02, this convention was never adopted'. There are number of articles which would have directly affected how nations used aerial bombardment and defended against it; these are articles 18, 22 and 24. The law was, however, never adopted in legally binding formRules concerning the Control of Wireless Telegraphy in Time of War and Air Warfare, from the International Committee of the Red Cross's section on international humanitarian law verified 26 February 2005 as it was criticized by all major powers as being unrealistic. The subordination of the law of air warfare to the law of ground warfare was arguably established by the Greco-German arbitration tribunal of 1927‚Äì30. It found that the 1907 Hague Convention on \\"The Laws and Customs of War on Land\\" applied to the German attacks in Greece during World War I:Laws of War: Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague IV); October 18, 1907 available from the Avalon Project at the Yale Law School, entered into force: 26 January 1910 This concerned both Article 25 and Article 26.

Reynolds. \\"Collateral Damage on the 21st century battlefield: Enemy exploitation of the law of armed conflict, and the struggle for a moral high ground\\". Air Force Law Review Volume 56, 2005(PDF) Page 57/58 Even if the Greco-German arbitration tribunal findings had established the rules for aerial bombardment, by 1945, the belligerents of World War II had ignored the preliminary bombardment procedures that the Greco-German arbitration tribunal had recognized.Javier Guis√°ndez G√≥mez The Law of Air Warfare 30 June 1998 International Review of the Red Cross no 323, p. 347‚Äì363 German Heinkel He 111 planes bombing Warsaw (September 1939) The German bombings of Guernica and Durango in Spain in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War and the Japanese aerial attacks on crowded Chinese cities during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937‚Äì38 attracted worldwide condemnation, prompting the League of Nations to pass a resolutionProtection of Civilian Populations Against Bombing From the Air in Case of War, Unanimous resolution of the League of Nations Assembly, 30 September 1938, verified 26 February 2005 that called for the protection of civilian populations against bombardment from the air. In response to the resolution passed by the League of Nations, a draft convention in Amsterdam of 1938Draft Convention for the Protection of Civilian Populations Against New Engines of War. Amsterdam, 1938, verified 26 February 2005 would have provided specific definitions of what constituted an \\"undefended\\" town, excessive civilian casualties and appropriate warning. This draft convention makes the standard of being undefended quite high ‚Äì any military units or anti-aircraft within the radius qualifies a town as defended. This convention, like the 1923 draft, was not ratified, nor even close to being ratified, when hostilities broke out in Europe in 1939. While the two conventions offer a guideline to what the belligerent powers were considering before the war, neither of these documents came to be legally binding. At the start of World War II in 1939, following an appeal by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the neutral United States, the major European powers, including Britain and Germany, agreed not to bomb civilian targets outside combat zones: Britain agreeing provided that the other powers also refrained. (see the policy on strategic bombing at the start of the World War II). However, this was not honored as belligerents of both sides in the war adopted a policy of indiscriminate bombing of enemy cities. Throughout World War II, cities like Chongqing, Warsaw, Rotterdam, London, Coventry, Hamburg, Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki were struck by aerial bombardment, causing untold numbers of destruction of buildings and the deaths of tens of thousand civilians. After World War II, the massive destruction of non- combatant targets inflicted during the war prompted the victorious Allies to address the issue when the Nuremberg Charter was enacted, establishing the procedures and laws by which the Nuremberg Trials were to be conducted. Article 6(b) of the Charter thus condemned the \\"wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity\\" and classified it as a violation of the laws or customs of war, therefore, making it a war crime. This provision was similarly made at the Tokyo Trials to try Japanese military and civilian leaders for illegal conducts committed during the Pacific War with the enactment of the Tokyo Charter. However, due to the absence of positive or specific customary international humanitarian law prohibiting illegal conducts of aerial warfare in World War II, the indiscriminate bombing of enemy cities was excluded from the category of war crimes at the Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials, therefore, no Axis officers and leaders were prosecuted for authorizing this practice. Furthermore, the United Nations War Crimes Commission received no notice of records of trial concerning the illegal conduct of air warfare. Chris Jochnick and Roger Normand in their article The Legitimation of Violence 1: A Critical History of the Laws of War explains that: \\"By leaving out morale bombing and other attacks on civilians unchallenged, the Tribunal conferred legal legitimacy on such practices.\\" Mushroom cloud from the atomic explosion over Nagasaki (August 9, 1945) In 1963, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the subject of a Japanese judicial review in Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State. The review draws several distinctions which are pertinent to both conventional and atomic aerial bombardment. Based on international law found in Hague Convention of 1907 IV ‚Äì The Laws and Customs of War on Land and IX ‚Äì Bombardment by Naval Forces in Time of War, and the Hague Draft Rules of Air Warfare of 1922‚Äì1923 the Court drew a distinction between \\"Targeted Aerial Bombardment\\" and indiscriminate area bombardment, that the court called \\"Blind Aerial Bombardment\\", and also a distinction between a defended and an undefended city.Wikisource:Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State I. Evaluation of the act of bombing according to international law: Paragraph 6 \\"In principle, a defended city is a city which resists an attempt at occupation by land forces. A city even with defence installations and armed forces cannot be said to be a defended city if it is far away from the battlefield and is not in immediate danger of occupation by the enemy.\\"Wikisource:Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State I. Evaluation of the act of bombing according to international law: Paragraph 7 The court ruled that blind aerial bombardment is permitted only in the immediate vicinity of the operations of land forces and that only targeted aerial bombardment of military installations is permitted further from the front. It also ruled that, in such an event, the incidental death of civilians and the destruction of civilian property during targeted aerial bombardment was not unlawful.Wikisource:Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State I. Evaluation of the act of bombing according to international law: Paragraph 10 The court acknowledged that the concept of a military objective was enlarged under conditions of total war, but stated that the distinction between the two did not disappear.Wikisource:Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State I. Evaluation of the act of bombing according to international law: Paragraph 9 The court also ruled that when military targets were concentrated in a comparatively small area, and where defence installations against air raids were very strong, that when the destruction of non-military objectives is small in proportion to the large military interests, or necessity, such destruction is lawful. Thus, in the judgement of the Court, because of the immense power of the atom bombs, and the distance from enemy land forces, the atomic bombings of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki \\"was an illegal act of hostilities under international law as it existed at that time, as an indiscriminate bombardment of undefended cities\\".Wikisource:Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State I. Evaluation of the act of bombing according to international law: Paragraph 8 Not all governments and scholars of international law agree with the analysis and conclusions of the Shimoda review, because it was not based on positive international humanitarian law. Colonel Javier Guis√°ndez G√≥mez, at the International Institute of Humanitarian Law in San Remo, points out: John R. Bolton, (Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs (2001‚Äì2005) and U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations (2005‚Äì2006)), explained in 2001 why the USA should not adhere to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: International law since 1945 In the post war environment, a series of treaties governing the laws of war were adopted starting in 1949. These Geneva Conventions would come into force, in no small part, because of a general reaction against the practices of the Second World War. Although the Fourth Geneva Convention attempted to erect some legal defenses for civilians in time of war, the bulk of the Fourth Convention devoted to explicating civilian rights in occupied territories, and no explicit attention is paid to the problems of bombardment. In 1977, Protocol I was adopted as an amendment to the Geneva Conventions, prohibiting the deliberate or indiscriminate attack of civilians and civilian objects, even if the area contained military objectives, and the attacking force must take precautions and steps to spare the lives of civilians and civilian objects as possible. However, forces occupying near densely populated areas must avoid locating military objectives near or in densely populated areas and endeavor to remove civilians from the vicinity of military objectives. Failure to do so would cause a higher civilian death toll resulting from bombardment by the attacking force and the defenders would be held responsible, even criminally liable, for these deaths. This issue was addressed because drafters of Protocol I pointed out historical examples such as Japan in World War II who often dispersed legitimate military and industrial targets (almost two- thirds of production was from small factories of thirty or fewer persons or in wooden homes, which were clustered around the factories) throughout urban areas in many of its cities either with the sole purpose of preventing enemy forces from bombing these targets or using its civilian casualties caused by enemy bombardment as propaganda value against the enemy. This move made Japan vulnerable to area bombardment and the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) adopted a policy of carpetbombing which destroyed 69 Japanese cities with either incendiary bombs or atomic bombs, with the deaths of 381,000-500,000 Japanese people. However, Protocol I also states that locating military objectives near civilians \\"shall not release the Parties to the conflict from their legal obligations with respect to the civilian population and civilians.\\" (Article 51, Para 8)https://ihl- databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId;=4BEBD9920AE0AEAEC12563CD0051DC9E The International Court of Justice gave an advisory opinion in July 1996 on the Legality of the Threat Or Use Of Nuclear Weapons. The court ruled that \\"[t]here is in neither customary nor international law any comprehensive and universal prohibition of the threat or use of nuclear weapons.\\" However, by a split vote, it also found that \\"[t]he threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict.\\" The Court stated that it could not definitively conclude whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defense, in which the very survival of the state would be at stake.ICJ: Legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons See also * Aerial bombing of cities * Area bombardment * Carpet bombing * Civilian casualties of strategic bombing * Roerich Pact * Strategic bombing * Tactical bombing * Terror bombing Notes References *Francisco Javier Guis√°ndez G√≥mez, (a colonel in the Spanish Air Force) ICRC: \\"The Law of Air Warfare\\" International Review of the Red Cross no 323, p. 347‚Äì363 *Joan T.

International law Category:Laws of war ","title":"Aerial bombardment and international law"},{"id":"13984691","text":"Former Cathedral of Saint Siffrein, Carpentras Carpentras (Lat. dioecesis Carpentoratensis) was a diocese of the Roman Catholic Church in the Provence region (later part of France), from the later Roman Empire until 1801. It was part of the ecclesiastical province under the Metropolitan, the Archbishop of Arles. The bishop was a major figure in the Comtat Venaissin, and a member of the Estates of the Comtat. He was a direct appointee of the pope.  History  The first historically documented bishop of Carpentras is Constantianus, who was represented at the Council of Riez in 439, of Orange in 441, and of Vaison in 442.Duchesne, p. 272, no. 1. Carpentras was a suffragan see of Arles from 450 to 1475, when it became a suffragan of Avignon. Bishop Siffredus (Sigefridus) (c. 530-540) became the patron-saint of Carpentras.Siffredus, according to legend, derived from a family in Campania, but his name points to northern origins. De Terris, p. 59, note 1, pointing out that the documents begin in the 8th or 9th century. Later 6th and 7th centuries the bishops called themselves bishops of Venasque, with the exception of Boethius, who at Valence in 584 signed the acts of the council as Bishop of Carpentras. This suggests that, after Carpentras had fallen into ruin,The early 5th-century Notitia Galliarum does not mention Carpentras among the cities of the area, perhaps an indication of its decay at the time; cf. Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Chronica minora , I, p. 559. Negative evidence, however, is always problematical. the bishops lived in nearby Venasque.De Terris, Les Ev√™ques de Carpentras. Etude historique, chapter II. Carpentras is not mentioned in the context of the occupation of Provence by the Saracens (Arabs) in the ninth century or the depredations of the Northmen or of the Hungarians (924) in the tenth,Liabestres, pp. 13-14. which may be explained by its depopulation. The bishops of Carpentras are still speaking of the \\"See of Carpentras or Venasque\\" in the late tenth century.Gallia christiana I, Instrumenta, p. 148: in ecclesia Sancti Petri Apostoli sedis Carpentoratensium sive Vendascensium. =The Jews of Carpentras: the Carri√®re= The Synagogue of Carpentras Already by the beginning of the sixth century, there were significant numbers of Jews in the Midi.A survey of the evidence is given by Loeb, pp. 36-38. The bishops, who met at Agde in 507, and those who met at Epaona in 517, considered it necessary to make canons concerning fraternization with Jews even more stringent. One of these was Bishop Julianus of Carpentras. It was already forbidden for clerics to dine with Jews, but the prohibition was also extended to laymen. The earliest reference to a Jewish community in Carpentras is found in a set of community statutes, approved by several prominent rabbis in France, including the Rabbi of Carpentras, who may have been Jacob Tam. These belong to the first half of the twelfth century. At the beginning of the thirteenth century the Jews were expelled from Carpentras, but they returned in 1263.Bardinet (1880), pp. 7-9 Apparently they were able to reach an accommodation with Bishop Raimundus de Barjols, who unfortunately died in February 1275.Loeb, pp. 37-38. S. Kahn, in: Adler & Singer (1907), Jewish Encyclopedia, p. 589 column 1. Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, who ruled Provence in the name of his wife Joan of Toulouse, from 1249 until his death in 1271, was a vigorous persecutor of the Jews. In 1269 he issued an order for a general persecution of the Jews in his domains.Loeb, p. 39. In his Last Will and Testament, he left the Comtat Venaissin to the papacy, and though the rest of his Will was quashed, that one provision was allowed. In 1274, therefore, Pope Gregory X became the ruler of the Comtat, and in 1275 a new bishop of Carpentras was appointed, following the death of Bishop de Barjols. The political climate had changed. On 19 July 1275, the Papal Chamberlain and Provost of Marseille, Berenguer de S√©guret, was appointed sole judge in cases concerning the Jews, to the exclusion of all other magistrates.Collier, p. 20. Bardinet (1880), p. 9. On 28 February 1276, shortly after the Comtat Venaissin became the property of the popes, the Jews of Carpentras entered into an agreement with the Bishop of Carpentras, Pierre Rostaing, in which they agreed to become his vassals in exchange for his protection. They agreed as well to pay to him and his successors a series of specified taxes, but the Bishop agreed not to impose any other additional taxes on them, to guard their property, and to protect them from violence and injustice. The document was signed by sixty-four heads of families.Loeb, pp. 40-46. The details of the provisions are listed by S. Kahn, p. 589 column 2. Carpentras thus became, along with Avignon, Cavaillon, and L'Isle-sur-Sorgue, one of the recognized cities of refuge from antisemitic persecution in the Comtat Venaissin. In 1320, a different Pope, John XXII (Jacques Du√®se), agreed to defend the Jews of the Comtat from the murderous onslaught of the marauding bands of antisemitic shepherds, the Pastoureaux.Malcolm Barber, \\"The Pastoureaux of 1320,\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History Volume 32 (2) (April 1981), pp. 143-166. Papal protection was not, however, without a price. In a bull of 12 April 1320 that same pope revoked the agreement between the bishops of Carpentras and their Jewish community, as he took the temporal power over Carpentras which had belonged to the bishops. The Pope was now the overlord of the Jews. And in 1322 he expelled the Jews and turned their synagogue into a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. This situation lasted for twenty years, until a new Pope, Clement VI revoked John XXII's expulsion order, and granted permission in 1343 for the rebuilding of the synagogue of Carpentras.Loeb, pp. 49-53. In 1343 only 12 heads of families are known, which is down from a figure of 300 heads of families before the expulsion. The synagogue was completed in 1367, and rebuilt in 1741; it was repaired in 1784 and 1899.Loeb, pp. 46-48. S. Kahn, p. 589 column 2. In 1403 Pope Benedict XIII claimed all of the taxes which the Jews had formerly paid to the bishops. Pope Clement VII confirmed their privileges in 1524, and Pope Paul III revoked them in 1539. By virtue of a bull of 26 February 1569, Pope Pius V expelled the Jews from Italian and French territory, which was immediately followed by an order of 3 August 1570 from the Legate of Avignon for them to leave by October. The Rector of the Comtat, however, permitted some of them to remain, and they eventually restored their numbers. The French Revolution brought about their complete emancipation, and after the annexation of the Comtat Venaissin in 1793 they became French citizens.Kahn, p. 590. =Avignon Popes and Carpentras= In March 1313, at the beginning of the Avignon Papacy, Pope Clement V took up residence, with the Roman Curia, in Carpentras, where he stayed until April 1314; but, finding the city inconvenient, he departed for his home in Gascony, where he expected to recover his health, but died shortly thereafter.It was his successor Pope John XXII who settled definitively at Avignon. The popes resided in the Episcopal Palace in Carpentras. Expilly, p. 88 column 1. The comings and goings of the Papal Curia can be followed by noting the places at which their documents were written and signed.For example, Clement V was there in January and February of 1314: Clement V was responsible for the building of the aqueduct of Carpentras.S√©guin de Pazzis, pp. 117-118. Its pipes were made of lead.Expilly, p. 104. Following the death of Pope Clement V, and once the mourning for the deceased pope was ended, the Conclave met in the Episcopal Palace at Carpentras. It began around 1 May 1314. The twenty-three cardinals in the Conclave proceeded at a leisurely pace, though without coming to an agreement on the election, until the Feast of S. Mary Magdalen on Monday, 22 July 1314. The Italian cardinals were supporting Guillaume de Mandagot of Lod√®ve, Bishop of Palestrina, who was a Frenchman and a subject of Philip IV of France. The Gascon cardinals, however, who had been appointed by Clement, and were not French subjects, refused to agree. On 22 July rioting broke out among the entourages of various cardinals, and some Gascons (it is claimed) burned down the palace and much of the city. The cardinals scattered, the Italian ones reassembling at Valence and complaining loudly about the Gascons and demanding that the papal Court return to Rome where a proper Conclave could be held.Martin Souchon, Die Papstwahlen von Bonifaz VIII bis Urban VI (Braunschweig: Benno Goeritz 1888) 35-45. It was not until 28 June 1316, nearly two years later, that the Cardinals reassembled, this time at Lyon, and on 7 August elected Cardinal Jacques Du√®se, who became John XXII. The Comtat Venaissin had been papal property since 1274, a legacy of Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, younger brother of Louis IX of France. The capital, which gave the county its name, had been at Venasque, but in 1320 Pope John XXII transferred the capital to Carpentras. Two years later he engaged in an exchange of properties and powers with the Bishop, making the Pope the temporal lord of Carpentras as well as the Comtat. In 1410 the Consuls of Carpentras received a request from the Consuls of Avignon to borrow Carpentras' heavy artillery and other war machines. In the Great Western Schism, the French had decided to repudiate Benedict XIII of the Avignon Obedience, who had been deposed by the Council of Pisa. They had accepted Alexander V, who had just been elected by the Cardinals who were at the Council of Pisa in June 1409. The leaders of Avignon had besieged the Catalans and Aragonese, led by Rodrigo de Luna, who were holding the Papal Palace for Benedict XIII. With the permission of Cardinal Pierre de Thury, the new Legate of Avignon and Vicar in the Comtat of Pope Alexander V, soldiers were enrolled at Carpentras and sent to Avignon.Expilly, p. 89 column 1. It was not until the end of 1411 that the supporters of Benedict XIII surrendered and departed. =Cathedral of Carpentras= The cathedral of Carpentras was the Church of St. Siffrein, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Siffrein. The foundation charter of the Chapter speaks of the Church of Saint Peter the Apostle: Gallia christiana I, Instrumenta, p. 148: in ecclesia Sancti Petri Apostoli sedis Carpentoratensium sive Vendascensium. The present church, according to E. Andreoli, is the fifth on the site. The first was built in the sixth century; the second in the Carolingian period; the third in the tenth century; and the fourth at the beginning of the thirteenth century, the work of Bishop Geoffroy de Garosse.E. Andreoli, Monographie de l'√©glise cath√©drale Saint-Siffrein de Carpentras, p. 62. The fifth is of the fifteenth century, begun under the patronage of the Avignon pope, Benedict XIII. The first stone was laid in a solemn ceremony on 22 February 1404, the Feast of Saint Peter's Chair, presided over by Archbishop Artaud of Arles, in the name of Pope Benedict XIII. The commemorative inscription survives, on the south wall of the cathedral.De Terris, pp. 188-189, quoting the full text of the inscription. The consecration took place in 1515.De Terris, p. 206, says the consecration took place in 1520. The Cathedral possesses an especially sacred relic, called the Saint-Clou, the remains of one of the nails that was used on Christ at the Crucifixion. According to the legend retailed by Gregory of Tours, two of the nails were given by Saint Helena to her son Constantine the Great, who wore one on his helmet and had the other fashioned into a bit for his horse's mouth (or into a bridle ornament).The story has the approbation of Saint Ambrose of Milan. Andreoli, p. 202. One legend says that Constantine gave the Saint-Clou to Bishop Siffrein's father, involving an anachronism of major proportions.Expilly, pp. 99-100. Its image is found in various places in the Cathedral and on various medieval seals.Andreoli, pp. 198-233. , who points out that there are also nails in Rome, in Paris, in Trier (presented by Helena herself), in Vienna, in Florence, in Milan, in Monza, at the bottom of the Adriatic, and in some twenty-two other places. On the seals, from the 13th century, see: Esquilly, p. 99. The Chapter of the Cathedral was founded in 982 by Bishop Ayrardus, with sixteen Canons. In 1241 Bishop Guillelmus Beroaldi (Beroardus) had to reduce the number of Canons to twelve for financial reasons. Two of the twelve were dignities (dignit√©s, not 'dignitaries'): the Provost and the Archdeacon (founded in 1306). There was also a Capiscol and a Sacristan, and two of the Canons served as Theologial (founded in 1602) and Penitentiary (founded in 1588). The Chapter was obliged, for sacred services, to maintain two cur√©s of the Cathedral, a Master of the Chapel, four choirboys and four mensionarii.De Hesseln, p. 113. Andreoli, pp. 34-35. Saint-Jean- du-Bourg There was a second church of importance in Carpentras, the church of Saint-Jean-du-Bourg, situated inside the fortifications, on the east side of the city. It was governed, like the Cathedral, by a Chapter of Canons, six in number, the Sacristan and five prebendary Canons. The Canons followed the Rule of Notre-Dame du Gr√®s of the Order of Saint-Ruf. The Canons had their monastery outside the city, however, and the church there was dedicated to the Virgin Mary.Hesseln, p. 113. Expilly, p. 100 column 2. =Development of Carpentras= Carpentras appears to have escaped completely the ravages of the Black Death (bubonic plague) in 1348‚Äì1353. It did not suffer an invasion until 1395, and then was free of trouble until 1468. The Dominican friar, Vincent Ferrer, lived and preached in Carpentras from 22 November 1399 to 12 February 1400.De Terris, pp. 185-186. On his death in November 1452, Bishop Georges d'Ornas ordered in his Will that his library be sold, and the proceeds contributed to the building of the new cathedral. A part of the library was sold, but then a number of people, led by the new bishop Michel Anglici and by Roger de Foix the Rector of the Comtat Venaissin, intervened, and determined to preserve the remaining books for the education and training of clerics and of the citizens and inhabitants of Carpentras. To make the books available to the public, those which pertained to liturgy and ecclesiastical matters were chained up in the Choir of the cathedral; the others were placed by Bishop Anglici in one of the chapels, the most important on chains and the rest in cupboards.Expilly, p. 88 column 2. Protestantism right The first Protestant to be found in Carpentras was Claude Baduel, a humanist scholar and a Lutheran, who had been a teacher at the coll√®ge of arts in N√Æmes. He was an acquaintance of Cardinal Jacopo Sadoleto. In 1544, just as Sadoleto and the Consuls of Carpentras were engaged in a search for a new principal for their coll√®ge, Baduel make known his desire to seek a new field for his work outside N√Æmes. His application for the position at Carpentras took the form of an elegantly written Latin treatise on education of the youth, and addressed to Cardinal Sadoleto. He took up the position in September 1544, but in April 1545, the notorious Massacre of M√©rindol in the Vaucluse, some forty miles from Carpentras, occurred. The royally authorized massacre of Waldensians (Vaudois) eventually involved more than twenty-two towns and villages including Cabri√®res, and Baduel decided in December to return to his former position in N√Æmes. The Lutheran movement in the Comtat collapsed.Arnaud, p. 9. In 1562, at the beginning of the Wars of Religion in France, the Huguenot general, the Baron des Adrets, made his descent on the Venaissin from the Dauphin√©, where he had been very successful. He took Caderousse, Orange, Courth√©zon, B√©darrides, and Chateauneuf-du-Pape, all of whose inhabitants had taken flight. He then took Sarrians and Sorgues, intending to use them as a base to attack Avignon, but when he learned that Avignon was fortified and prepared for strong resistance, he aimed instead for Carpentras. He arrived on 28 July 1562, encamped next to the aqueduct, began to lay out siege works. The inhabitants of Carpentras cut their aqueduct to keep Adrets from a water supply, and from time to time threw red soil and foul matter into the Auzon River. In the meantime Fabrice Serbelloni, the nephew of Pope Pius IV and General of the papal troops, arrived in the neighborhood, and the Huguenots were forced to retire on 3 and 4 August.Arnaud, pp. 24-37. Next year, after the Peace of Amboise on 25 March 1563, the Huguenot forces returned, took Monteux, and advanced to Carpentras, but they were driven away with considerable losses.Expilly, pp. 89-90. Other institutions A convent of Dominican friars was founded in Carpentras in 1312. Louis de Vervins, Archbishop of Narbonne (1600‚Äì1628), had been a monk in this convent, and had become its Prior; he was a generous benefactor.Expilly, p. 101 column 1. There was also a convent of Observant Franciscans, one of Capuchins, one of Discalced Carmelites. Of the religious orders for women, there were five convents in Carpentras: the abbey of the Cistercians of Saint Mary Magdeleine and of Saint Bernard, the monastery of the Discalced Carmelites, the Convent of the Visitation, the house of refuge called Notre-Dame de Sainte Garde, and the convent called L'Int√©rieur de Marie.De Hesseln, p. 114. These were all liquidated by order of the French National Constituent Assembly in 1790. A seminary was established for the diocese in 1585, in accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent, by Bishop Jacques Sacrati. Administration and staffing of the seminary was turned over to the Jesuits by Bishop Lorenzo Buti (1691‚Äì1710).Expilly, pp. 101-102. The Jesuits also staffed the Coll√®ge de Carpentras, founded in 1607, where the humanities and philosophy were taught.De Hesseln, p. 114. A hospital for the sick already existed in Carpentras in the time when the Counts of Toulouse owned the Comtat Venaissin.Expilly, p. 103. Bishop Joseph-Dominique d'Inguimbert (1735 ‚Äì 1757) was responsible for the building of the new hospital in Carpentras, beginning in 1750. The hospital was famous for the magnificence of its buildings and for the size of its endowment, one of the largest in France. This hospices became the major depository of abandoned children in the department, due in part to the convenience offered by the regular market at Carpentras. In January 1807 the number of children at Carpentras was 107.S√©guin de Pazzis, pp. 200-201; 207-208. =End of the diocese= Former episcopal palace, Palais de Justice In 1790 the National Constituent Assembly decided to bring the French church under the control of the State. Civil government of the provinces was to be reorganized into new units called 'd√©partements', originally intended to be 83 or 84 in number. The dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church were to be reduced in number, to coincide as much as possible with the new departments. Since there were more than 130 bishoprics at the time of the Revolution, more than fifty dioceses needed to be suppressed and their territories consolidated. Carpentras was one of those which were suppressed, by the French government, not by the canonical authority of the papacy. Its territory was assigned by the government to the new \\"Diocese of Vaucluse\\", with its headquarters at Avignon. All monasteries, convents and religious orders in France were dissolved, and their members were released from their vows by order of the National Constituent Assembly (which action was uncanonical); their property was confiscated \\"for the public good\\", and sold to pay the bills of the French government. Cathedral Chapters were also dissolved.Philippe Bourdin, \\"Coll√©giales et chapitres cath√©draux au crible de l'opinion et de la R√©volution,\\" Annales historiques de la R√©volution fran√ßaise no. 331 (janvier/mars 2003), 29-55, at 29-30, 52-53. In accordance with the Concordat of 1801, Carpentras ceased to be a residential diocese on 29 November 1801, and its territory was canonically incorporated into that of the Diocese of Avignon by virtue of a papal bull.Bull Qui Christi Domini, in Bullarii romani continuatio, Vol. XI, Roma 1845, pp. 245‚Äì249 The former episcopal palace, which had been built by Cardinal Bichi in the 1640s,S√©guin de Pazzis, p. 59. became the Palace of Justice and prison. The cloisters between the palace and the cathedral were demolished in 1829,Andreoli, p. 41. though traces of the arches and vaulting can be seen on the north wall of the cathedral. In 1877, the title of bishop of Carpentras, along with those of other ancient sees, was added to that of the archbishops of Avignon and remained so until 2009. In January 2009 Pope Benedict XVI revived the title (though not the actual diocese) of Carpentras as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 859 The current titular Bishop of Carpentras is Emmanuel Marie Anne Alain Gobilliard, Auxiliary Bishop of Lyon.David M.

He cannot have been consecrated until after the death of Bishop Julianus, which happened after July 529. That would mean, since Caesarius left Lerins to become Bishop of Arles in 502, that Siffredus became a monk at Lerins when he was less than three years old.

Three-fourths of the population of the city were Roman Catholics, but the Church of England possessed twelve churches there besides the cathedral. Oxenden presided over nine dioceses. He assiduously attended to his episcopal duties, generally living within Montreal's Golden Square Mile during the winter, and visiting the country districts in the summer. Ill-health caused his resignation of the bishopric in 1878, and on his return to England he attended the Pan-Anglican synod. From 30 May 1879 to 1884 he was vicar of St. Stephen's, near Canterbury, and from 1879 to 1884 he officiated as rural dean of Canterbury. He died at Biarritz, France, on 22 February 1892. Works The bishop wrote numerous small theological works, which the author's plain and simple language rendered very popular. The Pathway of Safety, 1856, was much appreciated by the poorer classes, and ultimately reached a circulation of three hundred and fifty thousand copies. The Christian Life, 1877, went to forty-seven thousand, and the Barham Tracts Nos. 1 to 49, after running to many editions in their original form, were collected and published as Cottage Readings in 1859. With Charles Henry Ramsden, he wrote in 1858 Family Prayers for Eight Weeks, which was often reprinted. Oxenden's name is attached to upwards of forty-five distinct works. Besides those already mentioned, the most important were: # The Cottage Library, 1846‚Äì51, 6 vols. # Confirmation; or, Are you ready to serve Christ?, 1847; tenth thousand, 1859. # Cottage Sermons, 1853. # Family Prayers, 1858; 3rd ed. 1860. # The Fourfold Picture of the Sinner, 1858. # Fervent Prayer, 1860; fifth thousand, 1861. # God's Message to the Poor: Eleven Sermons in Pluckley Church, 3rd ed. 1861. # The Home beyond; or, Happy Old Age, 1861; ten thousand copies. # Sermons on the Christian Life, 1861. # Words of Peace, 1863. # The Parables of our Lord explained, 1864. # A Plain History of the Christian Church, 1864. # Our Church and her Services, 1866. # Decision, 1868. # Short Lectures on the Sunday Gospels, 1869. # My First Year in Canada, 1871. # A Simple Exposition of the Psalms, 1872. # Counsels to the Confirmed, 1878; ten thousand copies. # Short Comments on the Gospels, 1885. # Touchstones; or, Christian Graces and Characters tested, 1884. # Portraits from the Bible: Old Testament Saints, 1880. # Portraits from the Bible: New Testament Saints, 1884.

Some see CIPs as a meta-process for most management systems (such as business process management, quality management, project management, and program management). W. Edwards Deming, a pioneer of the field, saw it as part of the 'system' whereby feedback from the process and customer were evaluated against organisational goals. The fact that it can be called a management process does not mean that it needs to be executed by 'management'; but rather merely that it makes decisions about the implementation of the delivery process and the design of the delivery process itself. A broader definition is that of the Institute of Quality Assurance who defined \\"continuous improvement as a gradual never-ending change which is: '... focused on increasing the effectiveness and/or efficiency of an organisation to fulfil its policy and objectives. It is not limited to quality initiatives. Improvement in business strategy, business results, customer, employee and supplier relationships can be subject to continual improvement. Put simply, it means ‚Äògetting better all the time‚Äô.' \\" Kaizen Some successful implementations use the approach known as kaizen (the translation of kai (‚Äúchange‚Äù) zen (‚Äúgood‚Äù) is ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù). This method became famous from Imai's 1986 book Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success. * Feedback: The core principle of CIP is the (self) reflection of processes. * Efficiency: The purpose of CIP is the identification, reduction, and elimination of suboptimal processes. * Evolution: The emphasis of CIP is on incremental, continual steps rather than giant leaps. Key features of kaizen include: * Improvements are based on many small changes rather than the radical changes that might arise from Research and Development * As the ideas come from the workers themselves, they are less likely to be radically different, and therefore easier to implement * Small improvements are less likely to require major capital investment than major process changes * The ideas come from the talents of the existing workforce, as opposed to using research, consultants or equipment ‚Äì any of which could be very expensive * All employees should continually be seeking ways to improve their own performance * It helps encourage workers to take ownership for their work, and can help reinforce team working, thereby improving worker motivation. The elements above are the more tactical elements of CIP. The more strategic elements include deciding how to increase the value of the delivery process output to the customer (effectiveness) and how much flexibility is valuable in the process to meet changing needs. PDCA The PDCA (plan, do, check, act) or (plan, do, check, adjust) cycle supports continuous improvement and Kaizen. It provides a process for improvement since the early design (planning) stage of any process, system, product or service. = PDSA = Origins of PDCA comes from the Shewhart cycle, often renamed Deming cycle, of PDSA. Walter A. Shewhart back in the 1920s was working at Western Electric Company with W. Edwards Deming and Joseph M. Juran. Shewhart took the standard academic scientific method of Inductive and Deductive Thinking, used in hypothesis testing, and converted it to a simple notion. When we do something we Plan it, Do it, Study it, and Act on its results. The PDSA cycle. This was a far simpler notion to use and inform the shop floor of Western Electric while building telephones, where many workers would not and could not understand the scientific method. In fact, the PDSA notion could easily be applied to everyday life; driving a car to work. Thus the PDSA cycle was very easy to relate to by Western‚Äôs workforce and gained the buy-in needed. In environmental management The CIP-concept is also used in environmental management systems (EMS), such as ISO 14000 and EMAS. The term \\"continual improvement\\", not \\"continuous improvement\\", is used in ISO 14000, and is understood to refer to an ongoing series of small or large-scale improvements which are each done discretely, i.e. in a step-wise fashion. Several differences exist between the CIP concept as it is applied in quality management and environmental management. CIP in EMS aims to improve the natural consequences of products and activities, not the products and activities as such. Secondly, there is no client-orientation in EMS-related CIP. Also, CIP in EMS is not limited to small, incremental improvements as in Kaizen, it also includes innovations of any scale.Gastl, Ren√©: CIP in Environmental Management , an Abstract of Gastl, Ren√©: Kontinuierliche Verbesserung im Umweltmanagement, 2nd Ed, 2009, vdf, Zurich ISO change from \\"continuous\\" to \\"continual\\" In the late 1990s, the developers of the ISO 9001:2000 standard‚Äîwhich addressed quality management systems and principles‚Äîdebated whether or not to update the use of the word \\"continuous\\" to \\"continual\\". ISO Technical Committee 176 and regulatory representatives ultimately decided that \\"continuous was unenforceable because it meant an organization had to improve minute by minute, whereas, continual improvement meant step-wise improvement or improvement in segments\\". The committee reportedly did not base the change on dictionary definitions or the standard's vocabulary. This change ran contrary to the common usage of \\"continuous\\" in the standard and other prior business management documentation. The concept of 'Continual Improvement' is core of the British Standards Institute's 2019 publication: BS 8624 Guide to Continual improvement: Methods for quantification. BS 8624 describes requirements for 'Continual Improvement' and provides methods and examples of recognized techniques.

Biography  Gaitanides was born as a son of a Greek father and a German mother. He studied in Munich German literature, history and literature. He finished his studies in 1936 with a dissertation (Dr. phil.). His activities during the Second World War are unclear and have differing accounts. He himself stated that he continued his work reporting and publishing for news stations and the Historical Commission of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences,Johannes Gaitanides: Griechenland ohne S√§ulen, neu bearbeitete und erweiterte Auflage, M√ºnchen 1978, S. 315. even that he had emigrated to Greece temporarily for political reasons. However, other accounts claim that he had cooperated during the war as a war correspondent for the government, and as a special Waffen-SS contact.Andrea Reiter: Die Exterritorialit√§t des Denkens: Hans Sahl im Exil, 2007, S. 258, Fn. 151 (online). In his 1940 published work Neues Griechenland (\\"New Greece\\") Gaitanides wrote: \\"[‚Ä¶] in Greece there is no Jewish question, just as in Turkish times Jews held a significant position; their danger is further characterized by their low international status as second-class.\\"Hans Gaitanides: Neues Griechenland.

Zentralverlag, Berlin 1946. After World War II, Gaitanides henceforth called Johannes (instead of the common shorthand form Hans, that the author had used until then), began writing as a freelance journalist for several newspapers and as a political commentator for the Bavarian Radio and television. In the 1970s, he was a senior editor at Donaukurier in Ingolstadt, a newspaper of central Bavaria. His numerous publication on Greece, which he toured regularly through his life, were some of his most significant works. As the works of Jacques Lacarri√®re for French- speaking audiences shaped the image of Greece, Gaitanides' works did the same for the German-speaking public and led to major tourism and interest. His book Greece without columns: representing the history of Greece in modern times, is regarded as a prominent work. His works have been translated into many languages (English, Dutch, etc.). 1964 Gaitanides was awarded the Theodor Wolff Prize, named after the Jewish journalist Theodor Wolff (1868‚Äì1943) who had to flee National Socialist Germany in 1933. Gaitanides died in 1988 in his hometown Schondorf am Ammersee.

His father was younger brother of the first Sir Robert Peel (1750‚Äì1830), and he was thus first cousin of the statesman, the second Sir Robert Peel (1788‚Äì1850). He was sent to Rugby in 1812, and removing to St John's College, Cambridge, graduated B.A. 1821 and M.A. 1824.

He served as Advocate-General of Bengal at Calcutta from 1840 to 1842, and in the latter year, on being promoted to the chief-justiceship of the supreme court at Calcutta, was knighted by patent on 18 May. During 1854 and 1855 he was also vice-president of the legislative council at Calcutta. He gave away in public charity the whole of his official income of ¬£8,000 a year. He was consequently very popular throughout his career in India and on his retirement in November 1855 a statue of him was erected in Calcutta.

Career After completing a Cordon Bleu course, Hamilton-Fairley worked as a chef, and founded and managed her own catering company, Corporate Catering Company. Hamilton-Fairley's vocation for teaching cookery was sparked in 1987 when she began to teach adults how to cook in a number of adult educational centres in London boroughs. = The Kids' Cookery School = Hamilton-Fairley founded The Kids' Cookery School (KCS) in 1995, raising funds to build the purpose-built teaching kitchens in Acton, West London. Children aged 3-16 years old attend for practical cookery lessons, where they learn to cook healthy food from fresh ingredients. Almost 13, 000 children a year are taught at The Kids' Cookery School. The goal of the school is to teach children healthy choices and teach them valuable life skills. Hamilton-Fairley learned that a majority of parents believed teaching children cooking skills is important, however very few actually have the time to teach their own children. KCS offers assisted places and includes children who are disengaged with or excluded from education, or who have disabilities or special needs. The main focus is on savoury food that children will eat, with instruction in safety and familiarity with raw ingredients. In 2009, Hamilton-Fairley's Kids' Cookery School started 'KCS on wheels'. Experienced chefs are sent to communities to bring cooking to children who otherwise might not experience the school. In 2018, Hamilton-Fairley continued to advocate for children learning to cook. She has said that for two decades children were not taught to cook is schools and now they are a generation that lives on junk food. Hamilton-Fairley has been called a children's cooking expert. =Funding= The school is a registered charity and relies on donations from charitable trusts, companies, individuals and government.

History  Takapu Road is one of only three stations on the Kapiti Line not on track built by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR); the other two are Redwood immediately to the north, and Tawa adjacent to the original WMR built station. The WMR built the original route of the NIMT between Wellington and Longburn and it was purchased by the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) in December 1908. The original route between Wellington and Porirua, via Johnsonville and now truncated to the Johnsonville Line, was bypassed in the 1930s by the Tawa Flat deviation. Takapu Road is on the northern section of this deviation. The deviation opened for freight traffic on 24 July 1935 but Takapu Road did not open until passenger services began on 19 June 1937. The line was electrified in June 1940.John Yonge (editor), New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition (Exeter: Quail Map Company, 1993), 16. According to Hoy:Hoy, D.G.

The Wildlife Society,Washington, D.C. either for research purposes or recreation. A common example of this type of activity is bird watching. The process of scientific wildlife observation includes the reporting of what (diagnosis of the species), where (geographical location), when (date and time), who (details about observer), and why (reason for observation, or explanations for occurrence). Wildlife observation can be performed if the animals are alive, with the most notable example being face-to-face observation and live cameras, or are dead, with the primary example being the notifying of where roadkill has occurred. This outlines the basic information needed to collect data for a wildlife observation; which can also contribute to scientific investigations of distribution, habitat relations, trends, and movement of wildlife species. Wildlife observation allows for the study of organisms with minimal disturbance to their ecosystem depending on the type of method or equipment used. The use of equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, may disturb and cause negative impacts on wildlife. Specialized equipment can be used to collect more accurate data. Importance Through wildlife observation, there are many important details that can be discovered about the environment. For instance, if a fisher in Taiwan discovers that a certain species of fish he/she frequently catches is becoming rarer and rarer, there might be a substantial issue in the water that fisher is fishing in. It could be that there is a new predator in the water that has changed the animal food chain, a source of pollution, or perhaps even a larger problem. Regardless of the reason, this process of observing animals can help identify potential issues before they become severe problems in the world. Additionally, through animal observation, those who participate are also actively participating in the conservation of animal life. Oftentimes, the two subjects go hand-in-hand with one another because through the observation of animals, individuals are also discovering what issues animals around the world are currently facing and if there are any ways to put up a fight against them. With more observation, fewer species of animals will become extinct. Research Before one can get started observing wildlife and helping the environment, it is important to research the animal they are choosing to observe. If one simply went into the observation process and skipped the crucial process of obtaining knowledge about the animals, it would be difficult for them to determine if anything was out of the ordinary. Before observing, it would be wise to find out simple information about the animal such as: * What the animal eats - Is the animal a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore? * What animals prey on the animal? * Where does the animal live? * Is the animal dangerous? * Is it endangered? * Does the animal travel in packs or alone? * What are the animal's sleeping habits? Projects and programs devoted to wildlife observation =Projects= There are a variety of projects and websites devoted to wildlife observations. One of the most common projects are for bird observations (for example: e-bird). For those who enjoy bird watching, there are a variety of ways one can contribute to this type of wildlife observation. The National Wildlife Refuge System has volunteer opportunities, citizen science projects, and if one is limiting in time; could purchase a Federal Duck Stamp that donates money to the wildlife refuge lands. In the past few years, websites dedicated to reporting wildlife across broad taxonomic ranges have become available. For example, the California Roadkill Observation System provides a mechanism for citizen- scientists in California to report wildlife species killed by vehicles. The Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch allows reporting of observations of both dead and live animals along roads. A more recent addition to wildlife observation tools are the web sites that facilitate uploading and management of images from remote wildlife cameras. For example, the Smithsonian Institution supports the eMammal and Smithsonian Wild programs, which provide a mechanism for volunteer deployment of wildlife cameras around the world. Similarly, the Wildlife Observer Network hosts over a dozen wildlife-camera projects from around the world, providing tools and a database to manage photographs and camera networks. =Monitoring programs= Monitoring programs for wildlife utilize new and easier ways to monitor animal species for citizen scientists and research scientists alike. One such monitoring device is the automated recorder. Automated recorders are a reliable way to monitor species such as bird, bats, and amphibians as they provide ability to save and independently identify a specific animal call. The automated recorder analyzes the sounds of the species to identify the species and how many there are. It was found that using the automated recorders produced larger quantity and even more quality data when compared with traditional, point-count data recording. While providing better quality, it also provides a permanent record of the census which can be continually reviewed for any potential bias. This monitoring device can improve wildlife observation and potentially save more animals. Using this device can allow for continued tracking of populations, continued censusing of individuals within a species, and allow for faster population size estimates. Live watching and observation =Birdwatching= One of the most popular forms of wildlife observation, birdwatching, is typically performed as a recreational pleasure. Those looking to birdwatch typically travel into a forest or other wooded area with a pair of binoculars in hand to aid the process. Birdwatching has become all the more important with the amount of deforestation that has been occurring in the world. Birds are arguably the most important factor in the balance of environmental systems: \\"They pollinate plants, disperse seeds, scavenge carcasses and recycle nutrients back into the earth.\\" A decrease in the total number of birds would cause destruction to much of the environmental system. The plants and trees around the world would die at an alarming rate which would, in turn, set off a chain reaction that would cause many other animals to die due to the environment change and habitat loss. Birdwatchers on a beach One of the ways that birdwatching has an effect on the environment as a whole is that through consistent birdwatching, an observer would be able to identify whether they are seeing less of a certain species of bird. If this happens, there typically is a reasons for the occurrence, whether it be because of an increase in pollution in the area or possibly an increase in the population of predators. If a watcher were to take notice of a change in what they typically see, they could notify the city or park and allow them to investigate into the cause a bit further. Through this action, birdwatchers are preserving the future for both animal and human life. Subsequently, by taking children birdwatching it is allowing the future generation to understand the importance of animal observation. If children learn at a young age how the environmental system works and that all life is intertwined, the world will be in much better hands. These children will be the ones pioneer conservation movements and attempt to protect the habit for all animals. =Livestreams= Live streams of animal exhibits at various zoos and aquariums across the United States have also become extremely popular. The Tennessee Aquarium has a webcam that allows online viewers to take a look into the happening so their Secret Reef exhibit which consists of reef fish, sharks, and a rescued green sea turtle. Perhaps the most popular animals cams in the United States though come from, naturally, the largest zoo in the United States: The San Diego Zoo. The San Diego Zoo features eight live cams on their website ‚Äì A panda, elephant, ape, penguin, polar bear, tiger, condor, and koala. The purpose of the live streams is to help educate the public about the behaviors of several different animals and to entertain those who might not be able to travel to a zoo. The other notable zoos that have webcams are the National Zoo, Woodland Park Zoo, Houston Zoo, and Atlanta Zoo. Additionally, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History has opened a butterfly and plant observation pavilion. Visitors walk into a large tent and experience a one-of-a-kind situation in which hundreds of rare butterflies from all across the world are inches from their faces. =Collecting data= As is the case with a majority of subjects, one of the best and most effective ways to observe live animals is through data collection. This process can be done through a livestream or in the wild but it is more useful if the data is collected on animals that are in currently in the wild. The ways the data can be collected are endless and it really just depends on what purpose an individual has as to what data would be the most useful. For example, if someone is interested in how deer interact with other animals in a certain location, it would be beneficial for them to take notes and record all of the animals that are native to the area where the deer are located. From there, they can describe any scenarios in which the deer had a positive or negative interaction with the other species of animals. In this instance, it would not really be helpful for the observer to collect data pertaining to the types of food the deer eat because the study is only focusing on the interaction amongst animals. Another example of how collecting data on wildlife would be useful is keeping track of the total number of a certain species exists within a forest. Naturally, it will be impossible to get a definitive number but if an accurate approximation can be made, it could be beneficial in determining if there has been a random increase or decrease in the population. If there is an increase, it could be due to a change in the species migration habits and if there is a decrease, it could be due to an external factor such as pollution or introduction of a new predator. Deceased wildlife observation An example of a wildlife crossing sign =Online systems and mobile apps= Many states have already begun to set up websites and systems for the public. The main purpose behind the movement is so that they can notify other individuals about road-killed wildlife. If enough people fill out the forms located on the websites, the government will become notified that there have been occurrences of a loss of animal life and will take the steps required to prevent it. Typically, the step that is taken is the posting of a wildlife crossing sign that, in turn, allows the public to know where there are common animal crossings. Maine and California are the states that have been the pioneers of this movement and this process has become particularly important on heavily traveled roads as no one would like endanger the animals or themselves. Currently, there is an app (available on both iPhone and Android devices) made specifically for the purpose of identifying road-kill called ‚ÄúMobile Mapper.‚Äù The app is a partner of the HerpMapper website. The purpose of the website is to use the user recorded observations for research and conservation purposes. On average, the cost of repairing a car that has been damaged by a deer or other medium to large-sized animal is $2,000. Even though there is no way that accidents involving animals can completely be prevented, placing more signs about possible animal crossings zones would cause drivers to drive more carefully and therefore have fewer accidents. Economically, this means that more families will be saving money and it could be used in a different way to help contributed to society as a whole. Issues leading to the extinction of animals =Climate change= Climate change is one of the most heavily discussed topics around the world today, both politically and scientifically. The climate that Earth is currently experiencing has been steadily changing over time due to both natural causes and human exploitation. Climate change has the potential to be detrimental to wildlife across the world, whether that be through rising sea levels, changes in temperatures through the years, or deforestation. These are just a few of the examples of the contributing factors to climate change. Climate change is not something that citizens can entirely prevent from happening even if they wanted to. There are many natural causes such as volcanic activity and the Earth's orbit around the sun that are strong contributing factors to the phenomena. There are, however, prevention measures that can be taken to prevent climate change from happening as quickly. The primary way to prevent climate change is for society to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that are present in the atmosphere. This can be done through the improving of energy efficiency in many buildings, the stoppage of deforestation so more carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere, and mode switching. Rising sea levels One of the more notable effects climate change has on the environment is the rising of sea levels around the world. Over the past 100 years, the sea level has risen approximately 1.8 millimeters each year. The steady rise in sea levels can be attributed to the steadily increasing temperatures the Earth faces each year which causes the ice caps and glaciers to melt. This increase in sea level is detrimental to the coastal ecosystems that exist around the world. Polar bear hunting for food The increase in sea level causes flooding on coastal wetlands, where certain animals will be unable to survive due to saltwater inundation. The increase in the total amount of saltwater present in these wetlands could prove to be problematic for many species. While some may simply have to migrate to other areas, smaller ecosystems within the wetlands could be destroyed which, once again, influences the animal food chain. Polar bears are animals that are specifically affected through the process of rising sea levels. Living near the Arctic region, polar bears find their food on ice caps and sheets of ice. As these sheets continue to become fewer in quantity, it is predicted that the polar bears will have a difficult time sustaining life and that by the year 2050, there could be less than 20,000 on Earth. Coral reefs are the primary ecosystem that would be affected through a continuing increase in the sea level: > \\"The coral reef ecosystem is adapted to thrive within certain temperature > and sea level range. Corals live in a symbiotic relationship with > photosynthetic zooxanthellae. Zooxanthellae need the sunlight in order to > produce the nutrients necessary for the coral. Sea level rise may cause a > decrease in solar radiation at the sea surface level, affecting the ability > of photosynthetic zooxanthellae to produce nutrients for the coral, whereas, > a sudden exposure of the coral reef to the atmosphere due to a low tide > event may induce coral bleaching.\\" Coral reef with fish The loss of coral would have a subsequent effect on the total number of fish that exist within these ecosystems. In the Indo-Pacific coral reefs alone, there are in-between 4000 and 5000 different species of fish that have a relationship with the species of coral. Specifically, the numerous different species of butterfly fish that feed on coral within these reefs would be affected if the coral was unable to live due to an increase in sea level. Referring back to the food chain topic, this would then subsequently but directly affect species of snappers, eels, and sharks that use butterfly fish as a primary source of food. If the snappers cannot find any butterfly fish to eat because the butterfly fish are dying due to the lack of coral, it means that the snapper population will decrease as well. The rising of sea level has the possibility to be catastrophic to the coastal ecosystems. =Pollution= Pollution is another crucial threat to animal life, and human life, across the world. Every form of pollution has an effect on wildlife, whether it be through the air, water, or ground. While sometimes the origin and form of pollution is visible and easy to determine, other times it can be a mystery as to what exactly is causing the death of animals. Through constant and consistent observation of habitat analysis, humans can help prevent the loss of animal life by recognizing the early signs of pollution before the problem becomes too large. Ocean and water pollution Map of the area where fishing was affected because of the BP oil spill Pollution can enter bodies of water in many different ways - Through toxic runoff from pesticides and fertilizers, containers of oil and other hazardous materials falling off of ships, or just from debris from humans that has not been picked up. No matter what the form of pollution is, the effects water pollution has on animal life can be drastic. For example, the BP oil spill which occurred in 2010 impacted over 82,000 birds, 6,000 sea turtles, approximately 26,000 marine animals, and hundreds of thousands of fish. While the observation of how animal life was and has been affected by this spill is unique and definitely on the larger scale, it still represents an accurate depiction of how observation can be crucial to animal lives. For example, by observing that a certain species of sea turtle was affected by the oil spill, zoologists and their teams would be able to determine the effects the loss of that sea turtle would have. Another prominent example is how if one day a fisherman goes to a lake that he/she frequently visits and notices two or three dead fish on the surface. Knowing that that frequently does not happen, the fisherman tells his local city officials and park rangers about the occurrence and they find out that a farmer has been using a new pesticide that runs off into the lake. By simply observing what is common and what is not, the effects of some water pollution can be stopped before becoming too severe. Air pollution Smoke coming from a factory Air pollution is commonly associated with the image of billowing clouds of smoke rising into the sky from a large factory. While the fumes and smoke previously stated definitely is a prominent form of air pollution, it is not the only one. Air pollution can come from the emission of cars, smoking, and other sources. Air pollution does not just affect birds though, like one may have thought. Air pollution affects mammals, birds, reptiles, and any other organism that requires oxygen to live. Frequently, if there is any highly dangerous air pollution, the animal observation process will be rather simple: There will be an abundance of dead animals located near the vicinity of the pollution. The primary concern of air pollution is how widespread the pollution can become in a short period of time. Acid rain is one of the largest forms of pollution today. The issue with acid rain is that it affects literally every living organism it comes in contact with, whether that be trees in a forest, water in an ocean or lake, or the skin of humans and animals. Typically, acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are emitted from factories. If it is not controlled in a timely manner, it could lead to loss of life due to the dangerous nature of the composition of the rain. =Deforestation= Deforestation has become one of the most prevalent issues environmentally. With a continuously growing population and not having the space to contain all the humans on Earth, forests are frequently the first areas that are cleared to make more room. According to National Geographic, forests still cover approximately 30 percent of the land on Earth but each year large portions are cleared. With deforestation, there are numerous subsequent side effects. Most notably, the clearing of entire forests (in some instances) destroys the habitat for hundreds of species of animals and 70 percent of the animals that reside in the forest will die as a result. Additionally, deforestation causes a reduction in the total canopy cover which leads to more extreme temperature swings on the ground level because there are no branches and leaves to catch the sun's rays. The way to combat the severe effects on the loss of animal life would be to stop cutting trees and forests down. While this is unlikely and almost impossible to happen, there is another solution: the partial removal of forests. Removing only portions of the forest keeps the environment of the entire forest intact which allows the animals to adapt to their surroundings. Additionally, it is recommended that for every tree that is cut down another one be planted elsewhere in the forest. Economic effects of animal observation =Costs of observation= Typically, the costs of animal observation are minuscule. As previously stated, animal observation can be done on a small or large scale; it just depends what goal an individual has in mind. For example, animal observation can be performed in the backyard of a house or at a local state park at no charge. All one would have to do is take a notepad, phone, or other device to write down their data and observations. On a larger scale, animal observation could be performed at an animal reserve, where the associated costs would be those associated with keeping the animals happy inside the reserve. While it is impossible to pinpoint exactly how much the zoos across the world spend on live streaming, it is estimated to be in the $1,000 range for every camera that is set up. =Costs that observation prevents= Referring back to the example from the \\"Deceased Wildlife Observation\\" section, it becomes apparent how animal observation can save families and the government money. With the average cost of repairing a car that has damage from a large sized animal being $2,000, families and the government could save money by making the public aware that they should proceed with caution in areas where animals have been hit. Water pollution at Maracaibo lake Additionally, approximately $44 million of the $4.3 billion spent on water purity is spent each year on protecting aquatic species from nutrient pollution. It is encouraging that the government is willing to spend the money to help save animals' lives, sometimes the effects of the pollution take effect before they are able to stop them entirely. One million seabirds and hundred thousand aquatic mammals and fish that are killed as a result of water pollution each year and that has its economic effects, both directly and indirectly. Directly, the loss of aquatic mammals and fish has a direct impact on the sales of food. The EPA estimated recently that the effects of pollution cost the fishing industry tens of millions of dollars in sales. Indirectly, the loss of birds causes humans to spend more money on pest control because the food chain is out of order. The small rodents and insects that some birds prey upon are no longer being killed if the birds die. This means more of these pests find their ways into homes which causes more people to call exterminators, therefore setting off a chain reaction. The exterminators then must use insecticides to kill the animals which can have harmful runoff into the ground and local water systems, instead of allowing it to be done naturally by the animal food chain.

Henry Pepys was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1804. He then migrated as a fellow to St. John's College, Cambridge, proceeding to MA in 1807, BD in 1814, and DD in 1840. Pepys was rector of Aspenden, Hertfordshire, from 12 June 1818 to 28 April 1827, and held with it the college living of Moreton, Essex from 16 August 1822 until 1840. On 3 February 1826 he was appointed a prebendary of Wells, and on 31 March 1827 rector of Westmill, Hertfordshire. On the recommendation of Viscount Melbourne he became Bishop of Sodor and Man on 27 January 1840, being consecrated at Whitehall on 1 March and arriving at Douglas, Isle of Man on 27 April. He was installed at St Mary's, Castletown, on 8 May. However, he left the island on 4 May 1841, on being translated to the see of Worcester. In politics Pepys was a Liberal. He voted in favour of the chief Liberal measures and spoke in the House of Lords twice, on ecclesiastical questions of minor importance. Personally he was very popular and also conscientious in discharging his diocesan duties. He was a generous patron of the triennial Three Choirs Festival. Pepys married, on 27 January 1824, Maria Sullivan, third daughter of John Sullivan, commissioner of the Board of Control. She died on 17 June 1885, in her 90th year.

The bishopric was suppressed by the Legislative Assembly during the French Revolution , in the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in September 1790, as part of a systematic effort to eliminate redundant bishoprics in France. By the Concordat of 1801, struck by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII, the diocese of Lescar was not revived, and the territory of the diocese was divided between the diocese of Agen and the diocese of Bayonne.Lescar (Diocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy] Bishops of Lescar =to 1200= * ? c. 506: Saint Julien I.The old prayer book (Breviarium) of the diocese of Lescar states that Julianus was a deacon of the Church of Trier, who was consecrated a bishop by St. Leontius of Trier (died 19 February 446, according to Gams, p. 318). The editors of Gallia christiana (I, p. 1285) argue that Julianus belongs at the beginning of the fourth century. The Breviarium says that Leontius was a native of Aquitaine, which may be a fact or a wish. The Martyrologicum Gallicanum (quoted by Dubarat at p. xviii) also says that Julian took part in the Council of Orange in 441. The name Julius does appear, but no bishopric is named: J.

There are two other places called Blackford in Somerset: one is a village near Wedmore, the other a tiny hamlet in Selworthy parish between Porlock and Minehead. In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 80. On the 1 April 1933 the civil parish was merged with Compton Pauncefoot. Compton Pauncefoot holds a Parish Meeting twice a year and has no Parish Council. The combined parish has approximately 130 residents and around 35 houses in each village. The civil parish is in the Blackmore Vale ward of South Somerset District Council and Somerset County Council. Blackford is designated as a Conservation Area. History In the Domesday Book of 1086 the manor is recorded as held by Turstin FitzRolf.http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk The parish of Blackford was part of the Whitley Hundred. The village has a Reading Room which was given to the church in 1912 by Miss Emily Senior, who sold the land it stands on to the Fidelity Trust Ltd for ¬£25. It is now leased to the Blackford Reading Room Trust to be used as a village hall. Following a programme of works in the 1990s and as part of a millennium project with the aid of lottery and other grants the hall has been completely refurbished. Baron Blackford, of Compton Pauncefoot in the County of Somerset, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1935 for the barrister William James Peake Mason. He had already been created a Baronet, of Compton Pauncefoot in the County of Somerset, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1918. The titles became extinct in 1988 on the death of his great-grandson, the fourth Baron. Geography The stream through Blackford is a tributary of the River Cam (Somerset) and benefitted from works in 1982 to the riverbanks in Blackford to help keep the water moving. Flooding is therefore rarer than previously in Blackford as a result. It travels from Blackford to Compton Pauncefoot and then travels under the A303 to join the Yarlington headwaters. The River Cam flows onto the Royal Naval Station where it joins the River Yeo and the Yeo in turn flows west to the south of Yeovilton and through the town of Ilchester. The river course continues to the west and at Langport becomes the River Parrett. The stream has its headwaters in the hills around Blackford & Compton Pauncefoot together with a number of springs. The main waters come from 3 primary sources: 1. Maperton, 2. Quarry Hill, 3. Sigwells Hill. The first 2 combine in Blackford around the Crossroads/Hollow and further springs contribute at a number of points all the way through both villages. The A303 is nearby and during construction major drainage pipes were laid at intervals that bring significant quantities of water into the stream. This contributes to the rapid rise in the stream during rainfall. Blackford is fortunate that it is relatively high in the watercourse and consequently only local rainfall and runoff comes through the villages. Landmarks The village has a number of notable buildings including: East Hall Farm, West Hall Farm, The Old Rectory, Manor Farm, Belstone Cottage, Chapel Cottage, Old Beams. The telephone box is the iconic K6 Telephone Kiosk and was listed Grade II by English Heritage in July 2008 following a local campaign. There are approximately 2,500 listed telephone boxes in the country. Religious sites The Church of St Michael has 11th- or 12th-century origins, and has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The church is part of the Camelot Group of Parishes in the Diocese of Bath and Wells. The tower was added in the 14th century and there were other changes around that time including the addition of south porch. More recent changes include the 17th century pulpit. There is a screen designed by Frederick Bligh Bond that was added in 1916 and the current organ arrived in 1970. The east window was made by the Charles Eamer Kempe studio and installed in 1882. However the paint flaked and after lengthy discussions and deliberations a replacement was commissioned from John Hayward (who also made the new window in Sherborne Abbey) with the subject 'The Good Shepherd'. There was a Methodist Chapel (built circa 1840) at the end of Chapel Lane and closed in 1947. It is now art of Old Beams curtilage ‚Äî but the roof was removed in the 1960s to allow a better view from the dwelling. Chapel Cottage is the oldest house in the village and is reputed to have been a chapel with cottage attached ‚Äî however there is some doubt over this. The newer, western cottage dates from the 16th Century while the eastern cottage is medieval has a stone spiral staircase and other old features.

She is a former member of the folk ensemble Ando Drom, and a founding member of the electronic/world music group Mitsoura. She has contributed to film soundtracks; in Tony Gatlif's film Gadjo dilo (1997) she provided the voice of an unseen singer pivotal to the story. She has also sung in the films K√≠s√©rt√©sek (2002), Swing (2002), Vengo (2000) (uncredited), and Je suis n√© d'une cigogne (1999). She formed the ensemble Mitsoura that released two albums so far: Mitsoura (2003) and Dura Dura Dura (2008). She has been a guest artist on the albums of other groups, including Fanfare CiocƒÉrlia's Queens and Kings (2007), Bratsch's Rien Dans Les Poches (2000), Besh O Drom's Once I Catch the Devil (2006), GYI! (2005) and Can't Make Me! - Nekemtenemmutogatol (2003). She is a member of the \\"Global Vocal Meeting\\" project.  Early life  M√≥nika Miczura was born in Beretty√≥√∫jfalu, Hungary on 3 November 1972. She has four sisters. Very early, at the age of 5 she lost her father. She spent her childhood in B√©k√©scsaba. The traditional romani- culture had been part of her daily life, at special family occasions (funerals, mournings, pomanas), there was a long tradition of a cappella (without instruments) singing. That is where her exceptional, deep style of performance stood out by the community, however at that time she had no idea what performance arts was about. Her first appearance on stage was at the age of 13 in the J√≥kai M√≥r theatre in B√©k√©scsaba where she was cast to perform in the musical ‚ÄòTwist Oliver‚Äô. During these days, she discovered the world of Indian, Arabic, Persian and Chinese music in the music collection of the local library, which had a huge impact on her. For the recommendation of her teachers, she applied and was admitted to the famous Literature-Drama course at Horv√°th Mih√°ly Grammar School in Szentes. That is where she first performed traditional Romani songs on stage, what she only did in small, family circles before. Those days the Romani folk-traditions were not part of the official Hungarian Folk Music, therefore it was a completely new experience for most non-Romani audience. In the 80‚Äôs, the first cultural Romani clubs, camps were organized where M√≥nika was a regular attendant. They soon discovered her unique, characteristic performing talent, as a result she was invited to be the singer of the Romani-folk band called ‚ÄòAndo Drom‚Äô at the age of 17. After a year of membership, a 3-year break came because she gave birth to her first daughter, M√≥nika. In 1994, she went back to stage and the ‚ÄòAndo Drom‚Äô, which then became an internationally acknowledged worldwide band.  AndoDrom, Mitsoura and collaborations  The ‚ÄòAndoDrom‚Äô band travelled the world and was a regular participant in the most important international folk-festivals. 3 albums were made at that time: Kaj Phirel O Del (1995) Gypsy Life On The Road (1997) and Phari Mamo (1997). As a result, others discovered M√≥nika‚Äôs unusual, unique voice. She was cast for several international movies, theatres and plenty of other music productions asked her for collaboration. That is when she first experienced that her voice and the culture she represents have the ‚Äòraison d'etre‚Äô (the most important reason or purpose for someone or something's existence) when it is grabbed out of its traditionalist comfort- zone and is mixing with the culture of other countries, origins, and the impacts of present age ‚Äòtrends‚Äô. The mid-1990s pop-music culture has also most influenced her e.g. Bj√∂rk, Massive Attack or Portishead. That is when she first had the idea of starting her own band, that could mix all these artistic influences. In 2000, she quit AndoDrom and she looked for new musicians from the most varied musical backgrounds and genres (Etno, Jazz, Classical and ElectronicMusic). That is how Mitsoura was born. M√≥nika Miczura says: \\"My artistic creed, my Ars Poetica is that 'Everything alters me, but nothing changes me.' (Salvador Dal√≠) and also that 'the mixing of cultures is a useful thing' (B√©la Bart√≥k) that is why I am not afraid to mix clean traditions with even contemporary, urban culture, because this is not the dilution of traditions but rather a way to make them alive. In my view, traditions are not museum-wise understood, dusty imprints of a bygone era, but rather possibilities for existing and current forms of expression.\\" The band Mitsoura had released two albums in this spirit: Mitsoura (2003) and DuraDuraDura (2008). They had performed in significant international festivals and concert- theatres (WOMAD, WOMEX, Royal Opera House London, Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux, Fete de la Misique Paris etc.). 2011 was their last time on stage, but after 3 years of creative pause, the Mitsoura is working on a new album-material. On December 16, 2014, it was reported that Miczura has filed a civil suit in Manhattan supreme court, naming Beyonc√©, Jay Z and Timbaland as co-defendants in a copyright infringement suit. Her lawyers allege that a recurring section of the song Drunk in Love is a digitally manipulated excerpt from the 1995 track Bajba, Bajba Pel√©m.

Early life Rizzoli was born in Milan on 31 October 1889. Orphaned at a young age and raised in poverty, he rose to prosperity. He apprenticed in the printer trade and later became an entrepreneur in his twenties. Career In 1927, Rizzoli founded company A. Rizzoli & Co. (later RCS MediaGroup). In 1927 Rizzoli acquired Novella magazine, a bi-weekly primarily for women that reached a circulation of 130,000 copies, from Mondadori an independent publisher who specialized in books and magazines. After his initial purchase, he added several new publications including Annabella, Bertoldo, Candido, Omnibus, and Oggi e L'Europeo. In 1949 he began publishing books including both classics and popular novels. He purchased Cartiera di Lama di Reno in 1954, the foundation for what would become an Italian publishing empire. His operations were moved in 1960 to a complex on Via Civitavecchia in Milan. He was amongst the first producers of daily newspapers within the relatively newly established nation of Italy. Active in film, he produced Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960) and 8¬Ω (1963), as well as French films such as Une Parisienne (1957). In 1964 Rizzoli opened the original Rizzoli International Bookstore in New York City at 712 Fifth Avenue, designed by architect Ferdinand Gottlieb. The bookstore was featured in various Hollywood films, most notably, Woody Allen's Manhattan and Falling in Love with Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep. He also produced the controversial documentary film Africa Addio. A museum about Rizzoli's life and career is located at Villa Arbusto within the guest house of that place, at Lacco Ameno.

Early life Perrin was born in Waterford, the son of Jean Baptiste Perrin (fl. 1786). Jean Baptiste, a Frenchman, had come to Ireland to seek a living: he set himself up as a teacher of French, and earned his living mainly as a private tutor to wealthy Irish families. Louis Perrin was educated at the diocesan school at Armagh. Removing to Trinity College Dublin, he was elected a Scholar there in 1799, and graduated B.A. in 1801. At the trial of his fellow-student, Robert Emmet, in 1803, when sentence of death was pronounced, Perrin rushed forward in the court and warmly embraced the prisoner. He devoted himself with great energy to the study of mercantile law; in Hilary term 1806 was called to the bar, and was soon much employed in cases where penalties for breaches of the revenue laws were sought to be enforced. When Watty Cox, the proprietor and publisher of 'Cox's Magazine,' was prosecuted by the government for a libel in 1811, O'Connell, Burke, Bethel, and Perrin were employed for the defence; but the case was practically conducted by the junior, who showed marked ability in the matter. He was also junior counsel, in 1811, in the prosecution of Sheridan, Kirwan, and the Roman Catholic delegates for violating the Convention Act. In 1832 he became a bencher of King's Inns, Dublin. Politics He was a Whig in politics, supported Catholic emancipation, and acquired the sobriquet of 'Honest Louis Perrin.' On 6 May 1831, in conjunction with Sir Robert Harty, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dublin City. Being unseated in August, he was returned to the House of Commons for Monaghan at the general election on 24 December 1832, displacing Henry Robert Westenra, the previous Tory member. At the next general election, in 1835, he came in for the city of Cashel, on 14 January 1835, but resigned in the following August, to take his seat on the bench. In the House of Commons he strove to prevent grand jury jobbery, and made an able speech on introducing the Irish municipal reform bill; and he was untiring in his efforts to check intemperance by advocating regulations closing public houses at eleven o'clock at night. From 7 February 1832 to February 1835 he was Third Serjeant, from February to April 1835 First Serjeant, and on 29 April 1835, on the recommendation of the Marquis of Normanby, he succeeded Francis Blackburne as Attorney-General. While a serjeant he presided over the inquiry into the old Irish corporations, and on his report the Irish Municipal Act was founded. After the death of Thomas Burton Vandeleur, he was appointed a puisne justice of the Court of King's Bench, on 31 August 1835. In the same year he was gazetted a privy councillor. He was most painstaking in the discharge of his important functions; and, despite some peculiarities of manner, may be regarded as one of the most able and upright judges who have sat on the Irish bench. He resigned on a pension in February 1860, and resided at Knockdromin near Rush, County Dublin, where he frequently attended the petty sessions. He died at his residence Knockdromin House, near Rush, on 7 December 1864, and was buried at Rush, on 10 December. Knockdromin was destroyed in an arson attack in 2011. Family He married, in April 1815, Hester Connor Stewart, daughter of the Rev.

It was designed in the mid-19th century by Richard Upjohn and his son Richard M. Upjohn in the French Gothic Revival architectural style. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and designated a National Historic Landmark eight years later. It is also a contributing property to the Downtown Albany Historic District. The church was established at the behest of Queen Anne in 1715. The church still has a silver communion service set given to it by her. It was the first Anglican congregation north of New York City and west of the Hudson River. A building was erected shortly after the church was established, housing it for the rest of the 18th century. In 1758, George Howe, 3rd Viscount Howe, was buried here after his death leading an attempt to recapture Fort Ticonderoga during the French and Indian War. His grave remains in the current church, making him the only British peer buried in the United States. The original building was replaced in 1803. That building yielded to the current structure almost 60 years later, with the tower making it complete in 1876. It is often considered one of the elder Upjohn's best-known works, although his son was largely responsible for designing the tower, its most distinctive feature. The interior includes some original Clayton & Bell stained glass windows and sculpture by Louis Saint-Gaudens. Building St. Peter's is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of State (New York State Route 5) and Lodge streets. It is near the western boundary of the Downtown Albany Historic District, to which it is also a contributing property. The terrain slopes up toward the west, rising from the flood plain of the Hudson River a quarter-mile (500 m) to the east towards the higher ground on which much of Albany's more modern development has taken place. The surrounding neighborhood is a densely developed urban core, with other historic buildings nearby. To the east, across Lodge Street, is a modern building with a parking garage attached to its north end. North of it, across Pine Street, is the 1867 Italian Renaissance Revival St. Mary's Church, the home of Albany's oldest Roman Catholic congregation, and like St. Peter's listed on the National Register both as a contributing property and individually. North of the church are two older buildings, one housing some city government offices. Northwest of the church are the small Corning Park and Albany's city hall, outside the historic district but on the Register as well. West of the church along the north side of State are the Guild House, its parish hall, and smaller, older commercial buildings. A block further is Lafayette Park and New York's state capitol, a National Historic Landmark like St. Peter's. Facing the building on the south side is a vacant lot and some more older commercial buildings, one of which houses the local extension of the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Opposite the church at the southeast corner of State and Lodge are the offices of Albany County's information-technology department and the state comptroller. More parking garages separate them and the large Times Union Center arena to their south. =Exterior= The church itself has walls of Schenectady bluestone with trim of New Jersey sandstone. Shed-roofed additions are on either side of the main block. A square tower rises from the southeast corner, with a narrow octagonal tower on its own southeast carrying a spiral staircase. In the rear is a small octagonal chancel. Decoration on the facades is French Gothic in character. A small projecting main entrance portico has a gabled top with a rosette in the apex topped by a cross. It is flanked by two small miniature versions set on stone pillars. At the corners octagonal stone spires rise, with round smooth columns supporting gables that rise to a conical roof with a folial finial. At the second story, set off by a large water table, are four narrow lancet arched windows, with a rosette in their transoms. A molded stone course connects their springlines. Above them is a large rosette window with a small lancet-arched window in the gable apex. At the roofline is a modillioned cornice. The area behind it on the roof is trimmed in copper; the rest of the roof shingled in slate. It is pierced by five gabled dormer windows on either side, also topped in copper. Bell tower In the lower three of the tower's five stages is a single narrow lancet-arched window. The shorter fourth stage has three small windows recessed behind an intricate set of smooth round columns and Gothic arches. Above them the fifth stage has corresponding narrowed 9-foot-tall (3 m) louvered vents in a similar treatment. Closeup of belfry, with alt=A closeup view of the upper section of the church's tower, with a cityscape behind it. A tall modernistic building is at left; a tower with a red peaked roof is at right The belfry, with six tons (5.4 tonnes) of bells inside, is 30 feet (10 m) tall. The three lancet windows on its faces are divided by molded shafts and topped by arches supported by sculpted heads. Above a decorative foliated frieze is the parapet, with arched openings, surrounding the roof. Three gargoyles, each weighing 3 tons (2.7 tonnes) and projecting out eight feet, project from the three corners. The corners are further topped with square turrets with a miniature version of the upper tower treatment. The octagonal southeast spire has a similar window treatment to the upper stages of the tower. At the top it has a gabled hood above it. The conical roof ends in a double Dutch cross above the rest of the tower. =Interior= Center aisle mosaic, designed by Jacob Adolphus Holzer The church's interior is finished in black walnut. The columbarium is in the base of the bell tower off the main entrance. It has a mosaic floor decorated by Jacob Adolphus Holzer in various religious motifs. Its aisles are on either side of the nave, which is decorated with the flags of the Episcopal Church and a variety of state and national ensigns representing the church and the city's history. St. Mark's Chapel is off to one side for smaller services and ceremonies. Along the walls of the apse are six stained glass windows. Each depicts two angels in the transom and a scene from the life of St. Peter below. There are smaller windows in the aisles. In the chancel a brass rail separates the choir from the rest of the sanctuary. The altar is of Caen stone, raised seven steps above the floor. The front features recessed round arches and tinted marble columns. Behind the stone reredos depicts two angels in front of a cross, sculpted in relief, praying over the retable. Above them another cross tops the reredos. A credence table, also of Caen stone, with a recessed arch enclosed in a square and sculptured corbels on its exterior molding, is on the south wall. Across the chancel the pulpit rises from the crypt, made of red Carlisle sandstone in the Venetian Gothic style. In the middle the lectern takes the form of an angel standing on a globe. History St. Peter's has had three buildings throughout its history. =1701‚Äì1803: First church= After taking Albany from its Dutch founders in 1664, the British assumed the military responsibility of protecting it against a possible French incursion from the north via the newly renamed Fort Frederick, which sat just above the stockaded settlement. But for the rest of the 17th century they otherwise left no imprint on the city's cultural life. Residents still largely spoke Dutch and attended the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1701 the Church of England established the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts to promote its growth in the colonies. One of its missionaries, The Rev. Thomas Barclay, came to Albany three years afterwards. Although the city's Dutch establishment was somewhat disturbed by this, his primary intended audience was the Iroquois tribes to the north and west of the city and the British garrison. He soon established the city's first Anglican parish. By 1710, Barclay was reporting back to the Society that his efforts had been successful. \\"A great many Dutch children, who at my first arrival were altogether ignorant of the English tongue, can distinctly say our catechism, and make the responses at prayers,\\" he wrote. However, the Iroquois were largely either resistant to converting or in the depths of alcoholism, so he warned that any other missionaries should be prepared for a difficult task. Two years later, Queen Anne sent the parish a silver communion service set. Barclay began to seek out land for an actual church. In 1714 Governor Robert Hunter granted Barclay a license to begin collecting funds for the church, and personally gave all the stone and lime necessary. The citizens of Albany donated ¬£200. Every soldier at the fort gave money, and all but one citizen of Schenectady contributed. A site just below the fort, at Chapel and Yonkers (today's State) streets, was chosen, one block east of the current location. Construction was delayed when the city council objected to the royal grant of land that belonged to the city. The following year the council again stopped construction when it appeared that the building had encroached on neighboring public land. Barclay and others were arrested and released on bail; Hunter refused the council's request to revoke the building permit. alt=A painting showing a small stone church with a gambrel roof, seen from the rear, with a fort on a hill in the background The small stone church with a gambrel roof was completed and opened in 1717. It was the first Anglican church in New York west of the Hudson River, and the first north of the city of New York. The first entries in its records were made the following year. Barclay continued to serve as the church's rector until he became ill in the mid-1720s. A letter requesting an assistant for him also asked that such person speak clear English as \\"Mr. Barclay spoke so broad Scotch that it was difficult to understand him.\\" John Milne was sent from England; he formally succeeded Barclay in 1728. Next year he reported that the church had at least 100 regular congregants, with more coming at Easter.Reynolds, 193‚Äì202. In 1731 the church was damaged by a fire; it was repaired in two weeks.Reynolds, 211. It was one of several that led the city council to improve the city's firefighting capability over the next several years. Thomas Barclay's son Henry became rector in 1738. Swedish botanist Peter Kalm visited Albany in 1749 during one of his travels in North America. He noted St. Peter's as one of the city's distinctive buildings, referring to it in his writings as the \\"English church.\\" It was distinguished from the \\"Dutch church\\" by its lack of the steeple it has been depicted as having; a steeple was built two years later under the new rector, John Ogilvie.Reynolds, 240‚Äì245. alt=A golden triangular marker set amidst triangular green stone tiles. Engraved on it is \\"George Augustus Viscount Howe\\" in large type, and in smaller type below \\"Is buried beneath this pavement ... Killed near Ticonderoga July 6, 1758\\" In the 1750s the city lived under threat of invasion as the French and Indian War, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War, broke out. When the French captured Fort Ticonderoga at the south end of Lake Champlain, refugees from the outlying areas began flocking to the city. During an attempt to retake the fort in 1758, Lord Howe, commander of the British forces, was killed in action. He died in the arms of Philip Schuyler, one of his junior officers and a close friend, who would later fight against his former comrades as a general in the Continental Army and serve as one of the state of New York's first U.S. senators. After Schuyler brought Howe's body back to his home in Watervliet, the general was buried at St. Peter's.Reynolds, 254‚Äì55. He is interred in a vault under the steps of the current church, the only British peer buried in the United States. The British victory at the Plains of Abraham outside Quebec City in 1759 turned the tide of the war. Four years later, the Treaty of Paris turned France's North American colonies over to the British. With no military threat remaining, the city's stockades were dismantled and it began to grow. St. Peter's applied for a charter from King George III; it was granted by Governor Henry Moore later that year and signed by the church leadership in 1769.Reynolds, 264. After the Revolutionary War of the next decade led to American independence, the church was rechartered by the New York State Legislature. Following that, in 1790, the church and the city made a land deal. The city got from the church the land it had been on, the royal grant of which had led to such fierce opposition at the beginning of the century, which the city now needed to expand and extend State Street. In return the church got the land where the present church and its predecessor were built, one block to the west, where the fort had long since been dismantled.Reynolds, 376. =1803‚Äì1859: Second church= After almost a century in its original home, the church had grown and was ready for a new building. Philip Hooker designed a stone Federal style building, facing south, with a tall steeple. It was started in 1802 and completed the following year, at a cost of $26,767 ($ in modern dollars). The church had to sell the three lots to its west in order to raise the money.Reynolds, 395‚Äì6. In 1822, it began seeking a builder for the steeple.Reynolds, 436. Seven years later, it sold the remaining lots on the block to the city for construction of the first city hall and county government buildings.Reynolds, 479. alt=A black-and-white photograph of a church with a tall steeple, seen from its left across the street For much of the second quarter of the 19th century, the church's rector was Horatio Potter. In 1854, after 21 years at St. Peter's, he was chosen as the new bishop of the Diocese of New York. The well-attended consecration ceremony took place at the church.Reynolds, 584. An organ, the first in the church's history, was installed in 1812. It necessitated the hiring of an organist, and blowing the bellows was added to the sexton's duties. In 1835 the church spent $3,000 ($ in modern dollars) to a Boston builder for a new one with two manuals and 24 stops. In 1840, the church vestry was reported as having considered whether to build another house of worship for workers on the waterfront. This reflected the city's growing population and industrialization as a result of the opening of the Erie Canal 15 years earlier. It does not appear that anything came of these discussions.Reynolds, 539. =1860‚Äìpresent: Third church= By the late 1850s structural problems with the second church were becoming apparent. A new design was commissioned from Richard Upjohn, an English immigrant who had helped introduce the Gothic Revival style for Episcopal churches with Manhattan's Trinity Church, also a National Historic Landmark, in 1846. He worked on the design with his son, Richard M. Upjohn, introducing a distinctly French Gothic sensibility that had not been present in the earlier church. The old church was demolished in 1859. Construction immediately began on its replacement after the cornerstone was laid on June 29, St. Peter's feast day. The completed structure cost $61,532 ($ in modern dollars.); it was opened and consecrated in 1860. The former organ was conveyed to St. George's Episcopal Church in Schenectady; Johnson & Son built the replacement. In 1868 the newly formed Episcopal Diocese of Albany met in convention at St. Peter's to choose a bishop and William Doane, rector of St. Peter's, was chosen on December 3, he was consecrated as such on February 2, 1869 in St. Peter's.Reynolds, 658 Doane began to focus on erecting a permanent cathedral for the new diocese, and accordingly All Saints' Cathedral was built three blocks to the west, at Elk and South Swan streets, was built over the 1880s. Its original, grander plan remained incomplete; the later construction of the State Education Department building on the rest of the block ensured that it will remain so. The current rector is Paul Hartt. The church's tower, at the time of completion, had only been tall, with a temporary roof. In 1875, a bequest from the family of parishioner George Tweddle made it possible to complete it, and the younger Upjohn obliged. The Tweddle bequest also paid for the bells, cast at the Meneely Bell Foundry in nearby Troy. Ten years later the chancel was expanded, and a new altar and reredos, designed by Upjohn as well, with angels sculpted by Louis Saint-Gaudens, were added, followed by the pulpit a year later. By 1880, the 1860 organ had seriously deteriorated. It was rebuilt by Hook & Hastings. In 1885 stained glass windows by the London designers Clayton & Bell were installed. Services and programs Holy Communion is offered on Sunday and Wednesday mornings. A later Sunday service alternates each week between Communion and Morning Prayer. Sunday school is also held at the same time. Both children and adults sing in the church's 40-member choir. The former are enrolled in the church's choir school, which has a state charter and is affiliated with the Royal School of Church Music. Every week they receive training and lessons in addition to singing at services; the repertoire spans five centuries. Several times a season they perform major pieces, such as oratorios, sometimes with orchestral accompaniment. The choir has traveled to England to perform several times. The church's ministries include its altar and flower guilds, as well the Sunday school teachers. Volunteers from the congregation also serve as lay eucharistic ministers, lectors and ushers. The church also operates, in conjunction with other Albany-area churches and the Capital City Rescue Mission, an overflow homeless shelter during the winter.

As an advocate he was remarkable for the energy of his manner and the simplicity of his language. Before a common jury he was usually invincible, but met with fewer successes before special juries. He succeeded Baron Gurney as a Baron of the Exchequer on 28 January 1845, and sat until failing health obliged him to retire on 2 November 1856. He was knighted at St. James's Palace on 23 April 1845. Though not deeply read, he proved a sensible judge, while his blunt courtesy and amiability made him popular with the bar. He died at 59 Portland Place, London, on 10 February 1862, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery. His widow, Augusta, died at 61 Queen's Gardens, Hyde Park, London, on 16 February 1885, aged 88.

William Drury, the Vicar of Kirk Braddan, over the patronage of St Thomas' Church, Douglas, which was closed for over a year as a consequence.John Gelling, 'A History of the Manx Church 1698-1911' pages 109-115 Powys was unpopular among most of the Manx clergy due to his High Church views, and contentious nature. After his health began to decline in 1873, he spent much time in England, and his episcopal duties were undertaken by other bishops on Powys' commission. He printed two charges, A Pastoral Letter to the Congregation at Warrington, 1848, and two sermons. Death and legacy He died of cancer at Bewsey House, Bournemouth, on 31 May 1877, and was buried at Warrington on 5 June. He married, on 21 February 1833, Percy Gore, eldest daughter of William Currie of East Horsley Park, Surrey, and had issue: Horace (d 1857); Percy William, rector of Thorpe-Achurch, Northamptonshire; Henry Lyttleton, lieutenant-colonel of the Oxfordshire light infantry; and five daughters.

It is sometimes called the Wedgwood Memorial Institute, but it is not to be confused with the former Wedgwood Memorial College in Barlaston. It achieved Listed building status (grade II starred) in 1972.Listed buildings in SOT Wedgwood Institute, Queen Street, Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, photographed in May 2008 National Academy of Design, New York (1863‚Äì65). Built in the same decade as the Wedgwood Institute, it was another example of a Gothic Revival building modelled on the Doge's Palace Construction and opening The Wedgwood Institute was funded entirely by public subscription from 1859 onward, the estimated cost at the time being ¬£4,000, and was constructed between 1863 and 1869. It was named after the potter Josiah Wedgwood, and it stands on the site of the former Brick House pottery works which Wedgwood had rented from 1762 to 1770. Brick House was the second of his pottery works in the town of Burslem, the first being at the Ivy House works. A small part of the old Works was incorporated into the fabric of the new Institute. The foundation stone of the new Institute was laid by then Chancellor of the Exchequer William Ewart Gladstone on 26 October 1863; the building itself opened 21 April 1869. The School of Art and Science opened in October 1869; the Free Library opened in 1870; their cost being by the levy of a penny rate (i.e.: a local universal property tax) under the Public Libraries Act. Decorative scheme The style of architecture chosen was Venetian Gothic, which had been popularised by John Ruskin. The basic design is by an architect called Nichols, but the elaborate decorations which form an integral part of the facade were designed by Robert Edgar and John Lockwood Kipling. Kipling, the father of the famous writer Rudyard Kipling, emigrated to India in 1865 while the building was still under construction, and the fa√ßade was not completed until 1871. It is an ornate building coated with numerous inlaid sculptures, ceramics and a series of zodiac mosaics, the latter executed by Signor Salviati.Josiah Wedgwood Memorial Institute (sculpture) Over the entrance is a tympanum with portrait medallions of three people connected with Wedgwood's projects: these are John Flaxman, the sculptor, Joseph Priestley, the scientist and discoverer of oxygen, and Thomas Bentley (1730‚Äì1780), a business partner of Wedgwood. Above the tympanum is a statue of Josiah Wedgwood. The statue is in the middle of a frieze. Around the upper storey is set a series of twelve terracotta panels to illustrate the months of the year, and above them mosaics of the corresponding signs of the zodiac.Josiah Wedgwood Memorial Institute (sculpture) at Burslem Around the middle of the building are ten terracotta panels depicting processes involved in the manufacture of pottery. The cresting at the top of the facade recalls the Doge's Palace. Later history of the Institute The art students remained in the Institute until 1905 when Burslem School of Art was provided with its own building directly opposite the Institute. The local public lending library in the Institute moved across the road to the Burslem School of Art in 2008current address and then was closed by the Council about 18 months later. The Institute was at one time as an annexe for Staffordshire University and more latterly for Stoke-on-Trent College. In 2009 it was used for an exhibition and lectures.British Ceramics Biennial Conservation and new uses for the Institute The building is on the Heritage at Risk Register due to its poor condition although there are plans to address the problems and bring it back into use. The Prince's Regeneration Trust and the Burslem Regeneration Company have been working together to develop a viable new scheme for the Institute. In 2012 The Prince's Regeneration Trust set up a project team with English Heritage, the Prince's Charities and Stoke-on-Trent Council. Working together, the team produced a design which will conserve the original 1860s building and revive the Institute's raison d‚Äô√™tre of supporting enterprise and delivering education. Phase One Works The Prince's Regeneration Trust carried out the first stage of the Institute's restoration between February and September 2015. The building work was done by contractors William Anelay Ltd. Costing approximately ¬£850,000, this has safeguarded the structure of the building and made the Institute's ground floor available for temporary public use, such as office space, community events and exhibitions. The first phase was made possible with funding from the European Regional Development Fund, the Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic England and Stoke Council. Main Phase Works The main works aim to transform the building into an enterprise hub and centre for start-up businesses. The Prince's Regeneration Trust estimates that the Institute could provide space for around 20 to 25 businesses, creating up to 150 jobs for local people, as well as room for business meetings, professional training and mentoring and community facilities. Subject to further funding being secured, work on the main phase of the project is expected to start in spring 2017, with the fully redeveloped Institute due to open in 2018-19.Regeneration Trust Wedgwood Institute project page People associated with the Institute The building has played its part in the lives of many famous local people such as the scientist Oliver Lodge, the writer Arnold Bennett and potters such as Frederick Hurten Rhead and William Moorcroft.

From 1992 to 1997 he taught at the Academy of Social Sciences, studied in Washington, DC, and was director of the Mongolian Ministry of Defense's Institute for Strategic Studies. From 1997 to 2001 he was the chairman of the Mongolian Presidential office, and from 2001 to 2005 he was Mongolia's Ambassador to Russia.  Political career  Bayar joined the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) in 1988. He became General Secretary of the MPRP in 2005 and was ‚Äì by 377 to 229 votes ‚Äì elected Chairman of the MPRP at a party congress in October 2007, defeating incumbent Miyeegombyn Enkhbold.

According to some sources, after his resignation he moved to the US and bought several properties on his daughter and relatives names. Later it was found that he has several offshore accounts. It is believed that he still has influences on MPP which is confirmed by a leaked video footage in which he gives advice to Miyegombo Enkhbold, the official head of the party, for his presidential election speech preparation. =2008 state of emergency= On 1 July 2008 Nambaryn Enkhbayar, President of Mongolia of that time announced State of Emergency in the midnight after the riot was over. During his announced State of Emergency the police chased civilians and shot four civilians to death from their backs and severely injured a dozen of civilians to life disability in streets different from demonstration or riot location. Also the police arrested approximately 1000 people in street or from random locations whether connected to the riot or not and imprisoned them including children and women without legal advocacy and inhumanely and degradingly treated them with torture involved as they claimed and later released some of them and sentenced some of them. Victims, and their families, civil societies claim the responsibility to Nambaryn Enkhbayar who announced the state of emergency in the middle of night - uncustomary hour of announcing state of emergency and shooting civilians without weapons in streets by chasing them and shooting them from their backs in random locations. A wounded teenager to lifelong disability and witnesses confirmed that they were shot by the police. The police is the state enforcement agency under the government, thus President Nambaryn Enkhbayar, Prime Minister Sanjaagiin Bayar and Minister of Justice Munkh-Orgil have been blamed by the victims, their families, and civil societies for the deaths. = Declining health and resignation = Bayar was admitted to a hospital in Ulan Bator in October 2009. Because of his declining health, Bayar announced his resignation in a letter to Mongolia's parliament one week later on 26 October 2009. A meeting held two days later confirmed that the Mongolian parliament had accepted his resignation. Bayar apologised to those who had voted for him. Norov Altankhuyag, the First Vice Prime Minister, temporarily moved up as Bayar's replacement. Bayar then was replaced by S√ºkhbaataryn Batbold on 29 October 2009. On 8 April 2010, Sanjaagiin Bayar read his written request to resign from the chairmanship of former communist party Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party due to declining health reasons to the conference of the party and then was replaced by S√ºkhbaataryn Batbold for the position on the same day from the party conference.

It was introduced as a result of the hotel industry mimicking the airline industry, which sets price by forecasting demand. There are several interpretations and executions of BAR in the hotel industry. Sheryl E. Kimes defines BAR pricing is an \\"attempt to reduce confusion and to guarantee that the guest is quoted the lowest available rate for each night of a multiple-night stay.\\" Galileo, a Global Distribution System provider, defines BAR as \\"a rate available to the general public that does not require pre-payment and does not impose cancellation or change penalties and/or fees, other than those imposed as a result of a hotel property's normal cancellation policy.\\" However, some hotels include \\"fenced\\" rates as part of their BAR strategies. Rate Parity The practise of hotels and their distributors agreeing to sell rooms at BAR rates is known as Rate Parity. Rate parity is widely employed in the hotel industry although in recent years its value has been questioned. In 2010, the United Kingdom's competition authority, then known as the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), opened a formal investigation into the practise of rate parity after it received a complaint by an Online Travel Agent (OTA), Skoosh. Since the OFT's investigation, numerous European states have challenged the legal status of rate parity (as a form of price fixing or resale price maintenance) including United Kingdom, Switzerland, and France. In February 2014, a judge in a Texan court dismissed a rate parity class action suit. In September 2014, an appeal tribunal overturned a proposal by Expedia, Booking.com, and IHG, to change their rate parity practices. The proposal had been accepted by the United Kingdom's competition authority, the Office of Fair Trading, but was overturned after an appeal by price comparison site, SkyScanner, and online travel agency, Skoosh. In July 2015, the France became the first country in Europe to ban rate parity clauses in contracts, after the French National Assembly enacted the final vote of the ‚ÄòLaw Macron‚Äô and instructed the deletion of any rate parity clauses from contracts between hoteliers and Online Travel Agents. In Dec 2015, Germany's Bundeskartellamt court prohibited Booking.com from continuing to apply its BAR or 'best price' clauses and ordered the hotel booking portal to completely delete the clauses from its contracts and general terms and conditions as far as they affect hotels in Germany. Consumer views Cornell University School of Hotel Administration carried out a study surveying the reactions of 153 travelers to BRG pricing. Respondents explained that being given the best available rate for every night of their stay was more fair than paying a single blended rate for a multiple-night stay.

Early years De Jaeger was born in Vienna. He worked for the Free French Film Unit during World War II and joined the BBC in July 1943, working as a sub-editor on news for Central Europe. He became a television cameraman in 1948. He was the first BBC newsreel cameraman to film outside the United Kingdom. April Fools 1957 The idea for the April Fool came from his school days, during which a teacher had once said \\"Boys, you are so stupid, you'd believe me if I told you that spaghetti grew on trees\\". He developed the idea with producer David Wheeler and it was approved by the editor of Panorama, Michael Peacock. A silent film was recorded in Castagnola in Switzerland in March and a commentary written by Wheeler was added by respected broadcaster Richard Dimbleby. Personal life De Jaeger left the BBC in 1959 to become a freelancer. He died in London in May 2000.

It is analogous to tools such as Make and Ant. History ASDF was originally designed and written in 2001-2002 as a successor for a previous program, mk-defsystem, taking advantage of Common Lisp features such as CLOS and pathname support. It has since expanded to become the default build tool for Common Lisp programs. It is now used as the basis for Common Lisp library build systems, and dependency managers, such as Quicklisp, cl-build, and Debian's Common Lisp Controller. (Note: ASDF-Install is obsolete.) Most maintained, open-source Common Lisp libraries are buildable and installable through ASDF. Uses Installing and building open-source systems defined with ASDF is now made relatively easy thanks to Quicklisp. In cases where the user is forced to install ASDF libraries by hand, as may still happen, the user will be forced to first download and unpack the library in a location recognized by the user's source-registry, which has sensible defaults (at least on Unix) and can otherwise be configured. Creating and defining systems installable though ASDF is done through the creation and placement of one or more system definition (.asd) files at the root of a directory containing the files that make up the system. The system definition file must contain at least one call to defsystem, a lisp form in which are defined all of the components and dependencies of the system. ASDF is capable of automatically compiling and loading lisp source code, as well as automatically building and linking C programming language (also known as C source code). It contains hooks to allow for definitions of alternate compilers and complex treatment of custom components.

A dolphin striker (an older term for a martingale boom or simply a martingale; sometimes called a striker) is a small vertical or near vertical ancillary spar spanning between the bowsprit and martingale thereby redirecting the tension in the forward end of the martingale slightly more vertically. This vertical component is necessary to more effectively oppose the forestays' mostly upward tension on the forward end of the bowsprit than would be the case in the absence of the dolphin striker. Around 1813 some large sailing vessels experimented with double strikers: these had two downward-pointing spars forming an inverted V in the middle of the bowsprit. However, the practice was short-lived as it did not seem to provide any additional benefit. The dolphin striker's length was typically half the length of the spritsail yard or, when spreaders were used, the same length as one spreader. On a catamaran such as the Hobie 16 and the Tornado where the mast is stepped on a beam between the hulls the dolphin striker provides support for the beam in order to support the mast load.

Hotel Chocolat is the only company in the United Kingdom to grow cocoa on its own plantation. History Hotel Chocolat, Monmouth Street, Covent Garden, London Hotel Chocolat, Boar Lane, Leeds Angus Thirlwell, CEO of Hotel Chocolat In 1988, Angus Thirlwell and Peter Harris began designing and selling mints as \\"MMC\\", before moving to chocolates, some six years later. Rebranded as \\"Geneva Chocolates\\", the current co-founders of Hotel Chocolat adapted trade to the catalogue-based world and before long, had steered towards the name \\"Chocolate Express\\". In 1998, the Chocolate Tasting Club was launched in Britain; as of 2014, it has around 100,000 members. To date, the Tasting Club has trialled over 1,500 different recipes. As detailed on their website, the Chocolate Tasting Club sends out boxes to customers all over the country each month. In 2003, Chocolate Express rebranded as Hotel Chocolat and launched its first retail store in the centre of Watford. The company then grew initially to having four stores in the East Anglian area, with stores in Milton Keynes, Cambridge and St Albans opening between 2005 and 2006. Today, the company has over 70 around the UK. In 2006, the company officially acquired the Rabot Estate in Saint Lucia, and is, to date, the only company in the UK to own its own cocoa plantation. This plantation is one of the reasons given for the company choosing not to be Fair Trade-accredited, as only smallholdings are allowed. In 2011, Hotel Chocolat opened its Boucan Hotel in Saint Lucia. The hotel sits on the Rabot Estate which is perched high up between the Piton mountains. The hotel currently has six lodges and a cocoa-inspired Boucan Restaurant. In November 2013, Hotel Chocolat opened two UK restaurants, Rabot 1745 in London's Borough Market, and Roast + Conch in Leeds. In August 2017, Hotel Chocolat opened its first stores in the Republic of Ireland in Dundrum, Dublin. Rabot Estate, St. Lucia The Rabot Estate is in the south west of St Lucia, near Soufri√®re, the colonial French capital. St Lucia lies in the cocoa belt which girdles the earth, plus or minus 20 degrees latitude from the Equator. The estate is divided up into 16 different cort√®s or areas of terroir, with names steeped in colonial history, such as L‚ÄôHermitage, Ti Jardin, Marcial, Mathilde and Rameau. The cocoa trees of Rabot Estate are primarily Trinitario species rich in Criollo genes, and with new trees continually being planted, record quantities of cocoa are being harvested. The Rabot Estate is part of Hotel Chocolat‚Äôs 'Engaged Ethics' Cocoa Programme (HCCAPEE). Over a hundred new jobs have been created since the estate‚Äôs opening, and with prices guaranteed to be 30‚Äì40% above the world market price of cocoa, as well as being paid within a week of selling their crops, local farmers are provided with a secure income.

Also called party tapes or video compilations, this phenomenon comes from the days of Betamax and VHS, when home editing and duplication became possible for the masses. Video mixtapes are distributed on VHS or DVD, or by one of the many distribution methods the internet has to offer. The concept and \\"feel\\" of a video mixtape is derived from the audio mixtape phenomenon.  Content  Video mixtapes usually contain short clips from various sources. Favorite sources include \\"home-shopping channel and public-access television bloopers, scenes from sleazy splatter B-movies, amazing news footage, bizarre pornography, strange homemade video projects, extreme sports, disasters and mishaps captured on film, or foreign television gone mad. There has never been a set criteria for the footage that video enthusiasts collect.\\"  Mixtapes and internet culture  The emergence of high-speed internet provided an easy and cheap means to download and swap videos online. The ability to edit videos with free software on consumer computers no longer requires an expert to produce mixtapes. Most modern video mixtapes are released on DVD and through internet download. This can be in the shape of an ISO image of the DVD, video file, and streaming video. It is an unwritten rule to use as few \\"Internet movies\\" as possible, as these are usually of bad quality (having many compression artifacts) or too widely available (and thus insufficiently obscure or exclusive). Certain video mixtape groups take an approach to producing and releasing their mixtapes similar to how the scene treats their releases. A group can consist of several members: suppliers, editors, and runners who release the VMT on a website once they are released.

In 1988, with the loss of its sixth form, it was renamed the William Gee School for Boys. In 2001 the latter merged with the girls-only Amy Johnson High School as Endeavour High School, before closing permanently in 2015.  History  Hull Grammar School was founded around 1330 and endowed in 1479 as part of a chantry chapel by Bishop John Alcock (of Rochester, Worcester, and Ely), later Lord Chancellor and founder of Jesus College, Cambridge. Originally conducted by a chaplain (priest) endowed to sing Masses for Bishop Alcock's soul, the School flourished till its revenues were seized at the Protestant Reformation under the Chantries Act 1547. The people of Hull objected and eventually re√´stablished the school, which was appropriated by the Crown in 1586. The following year, Queen Elizabeth I granted the school house and associated property to Luke Thurcross, the mayor, who in 1604 entrusted his interest in the school and gardens to four trustees, to act on behalf of the mayor and burgesses. The appointment of masters was placed in the hands of the Hull Corporation, and by charter of James I, the right of presentation was secured to them. An exhibition of ¬£40 to Cambridge University was endowed in 1627 and augmented in 1630, with another scholarship of ¬£60 a year to Clare College, Cambridge. The poet Marvell was a pupil in this era, and his father Rev. Andrew Marvell a master. In 1892 the endowments produced about ¬£80 a year, for which the master taught the Classics free, but the scholars paid for other subjects under Town Council regulations. The Education Act 1944 placed the school under a local education authority, as part of the government's 'secondary education for all' policy. In 1969 the school became comprehensive.Hull City Archives, Hull Grammar School Records, 1750‚Äì2002 The local government reorganisation of 1974 saw education transferred from Hull City Council to the newly created Humberside County Council. In 1988, the grammar school lost its sixth form and was renamed the William Gee School for Boys, merging with the nearby Amy Johnson School for girls in 2001 to form the Endeavour High School. This last was subsequently placed under special measures and finally closed in the summer of 2015. The name Hull Grammar was acquired by a new and completely unconnected private school, which opened under that name in 1989, only to merge with Hull High School in 2005 to form the Hull Collegiate School.  Location  In 1486 a schoolhouse was built for Bishop Alcock's chantry foundation in the Market Square of Kingston upon Hull, on South Church Side opposite Holy Trinity Church. This fine old brick pile now houses the interactive 'Hands-on History' Museum. Around 1578, the building having fallen into decay, Alderman William Gee (thrice Mayor of Hull) opened a subscription for the purpose of repairing it. This resulted in the erection of a new school, in which Alderman Gee was joined by the Corporation of Hull, who added a second storey, which was used as an exchange and assembly room. Alderman Gee not only contributed ¬£80 and 20,000 bricks, but also left two houses in the 'Butchery' (now Queen Street) for the school's benefit. From inscriptions on three stones in the wall, the rebuild appears to have been completed in 1583 at a cost of ¬£600. This building was purchased in 1875 by the vicar of Holy Trinity Church, who had it restored and converted into a mission room and choir school. From 1875 to 1891 the grammar school rented temporary premises, but in the latter year a new and commodious building was erected on Leicester Street, officially opened by the Mayor of Hull on 27 January 1892. The new school was built in the Collegiate Gothic style, of red brick with stone dressings. In the 20th century, the school moved onto Bishop Alcock Road in the Bricknell Avenue area of Hull. It remained there until 1988.

Over the years there has been tremendous growth in the private security industry, not only in South Africa, but also in the rest of the world. The private security industry in South Africa is among the largest in the world, with over 9,000 registered companies, 450,000 registered active private security guards and a further 1.5 million qualified (but inactive) guards; many times more than the available personnel of the combined South African police and army. Studies have shown that South Africa had 2.57 private security personnel for every police employee. This is attributed by some to the country's relatively high levels of crime to a lack of public funds from Parliament towards the South African Police Service (SAPS) or to an increasing trend in many countries towards government outsourcing of certain security functions. Others have suggested the number of high-wealth individuals in South Africa in comparison with the rest of Africa has led to the growth of the industry.  Regulation  The private security industry in South Africa is regulated by the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority, based in Centurion, Gauteng. The authority was established by the Private Security Industry Regulation Act 2001 and commenced operations in 2002. The authority has wide-ranging powers relating to the operation of private security companies in South Africa. Private security companies are required by law to be registered with the authority.  2006 private security strikes  Street violence occurred during the 2006 security strike. In 2006, private security personnel went on strike across South Africa. The strike lasted 96 days and cost the industry more than a million working days. The strike was supported by the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union and 15 other trade unions. The striking workers looted and damaged property, and committed violent crimes.  Criticism  The Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference criticised the private security industry in a 2012 briefing paper. The paper argued that the prevalence of private security in South Africa \\"perpetuates fear\\". The paper also noted that the private security industry \\"only protects the select and privileged group that can afford to pay for security services\\" and \\"exacerbates the divide between the wealthy and the poor\\".http://www.cplo.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BP-313-The-Private- Security-Industry-Dec-2012.pdf  References  Category:Crime in South Africa Category:Law enforcement in South Africa Category:Private security industry ","title":"Private security industry in South Africa"},{"id":"13985542","text":"The Cour nationale du droit d'asile (formerly Commission des recours des r√©fugi√©s) is the French administrative court which was set up to review appeals from decisions of the OFPRA, granting, refusing or withdrawing refugee status (see right of asylum) and subsidiary protection.

DSSResources.COM, World Wide Web, http://DSSResources.COM/history/dsshistory.html, version 2.8, May 31, 2003. IFPS was marketed by Execucom, an Austin-based company started by Wagner. The company was acquired by Comshare in 1991.COMSHARE BOOSTS UK ROLE WITH BUY OF EXECUCOM FROM MPSI, Computer Business Review, March 12, 1991 IFPS was available for a variety of platforms, including IBM mainframes (VM/CMS), DEC VAX, various flavors of Unix, DOS-based PCs and Macintosh Computers (named \\"Mindsight\\"- running on two floppies). There were a number of versions, from about 1985, including optimization and a data area for storing data separately from models. IFPS seems to have been an important inspiration for the Javelin financial modeling application. Some parts of the IFPS approach were later used by Lotus's Improv- like the separation of model logic and data. Difference to spreadsheet software (Lotus 1-2-3 and later Excel): Mainframe and PC/Mac versions of IFPS completely separated the logic model (connections between variables) and the data. Both were bound together by data placeholder (like \\"earnings in Year1\\" in the logic model - to easily run scenarios . (Spreadsheet) columns were represented by Name1, Name2, name3 etc. The model logic was written in lines with placeholder- oriented text ( \\"earnings=sales- costs\\" etc.). Comment lines on the model could be included anywhere with //. IFPS mainframe versions also allowed to simulate stochastic events by providing a range of probability distributions. The IFPS approach made it easy to communicate complex models even to laymen and managers. IFPS was eventually out-competed by spreadsheets. \\\\---- IFPS was an essential financial model- development tool for long range planning and strategic planning, popular business practices in the 1980s. As an \\"English-like\\" language, IFPS made it very simple to express relationships among financial concepts without having to worry about sequential logic, as the program would figure out dependencies among variables. This allowed for simple creation of both financial and managerial accounting statements. I was fortunate to work with IFPS for over ten years as an analyst at Champlin Petroleum aka. Union Pacific Resources. I also attended seminars and conferences put on by Gerald Wagner and his team at EXECUCOM. I believe it was the rise of risk management in the commodity industries over \\"assumption-based\\" techniques like long range planning, rather than spreadsheets per se, which contributed to IFPS loss in popularity.

Medieval Studies XLVI: 245‚Äì65.Alison Weir, Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy (London, U.K.: The Bodley Head, 1999), page 82. Early years Henry was born in Windsor Castle during the reign of his paternal grandfather, Henry III of England. On 3 August 1271, Henry's older brother John died in the custody of their paternal granduncle Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. His death left Henry the eldest surviving child of Edward and second-in-line to the throne of England. Henry III died on 16 November 1272. Edward became King of England and Henry his heir apparent. In 1273, Henry was betrothed to Joan I of Navarre. Death When Henry lay dying at Guildford in 1274, neither of his parents made the short journey from London to see him. He was tended by his grandmother, Eleanor of Provence, who had raised him during the four years his parents were on Crusade. The queen dowager was thus at that moment more familiar to him than his parents, and the better able to comfort him in his illness. Since Henry was always sickly, the gravity of his illness was perhaps not realised until it was too late for his parents to reach him. He died of natural causes and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Background and education Elliot was the second son of Emma Eleanor Elizabeth (n√©e Hyslop) and William Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 3rd Earl of Minto. Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto, was his elder brother and the Honourable Hugh Elliot his younger brother.thepeerage.com Arthur Ralph Douglas Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound At age four his leg was amputated as the result of a fall. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh and Trinity College, Cambridge. Political career Elliot was elected to the House of Commons for Roxburghshire in 1880 as a Liberal, and held that seat until 1892, having joined the Liberal Unionists when the Irish Home Rule split the Liberal Party in 1886. After his defeat by the Liberal candidate at the 1892 general election, he did not stand again in Roxburghshire, and at the 1895 general election he stood in the City of Durham, losing by 3 votes to the sitting Liberal MP, Matthew Fowler. After Fowler's death in 1898, Elliot won the resulting by-election, though with a margin of only 65 votes. He was re-elected in Durham at the 1900 general election with a much bigger majority, but his support of free trade then brought him into conflict with the Durham Constitutional Association (the local Conservative and Liberal Unionist organisation), some of whose members were backing John Waller Hills as an alternative for the next election. Elliot resigned from the Durham Constitutional Association in February 1905, and contested the general election in January 1906 as a \\"Free Trade\\" Liberal candidate, with the support of the local Liberal Association. In a straight contest between Elliot and Hills (who had been adopted as the Conservative and Liberal Unionist candidate), Hills took the seat with 60% of the votes. He served briefly as Financial Secretary to the Treasury under Arthur Balfour between April and October 1903. Apart from his political career he was also editor of the Edinburgh Review. Family Elliot married Madeline Harriet Dagmar, daughter of Sir Charles Lister Ryan, in 1888. They had two sons, of whom only the youngest reached adulthood. Madeline died in January 1906. Elliot lived for many years in Freshwater, Isle of WightAccording to an inscription in St Agnes‚Äô Church, Freshwater Inscription in memory of Arthur Elliot and remained a widower until his death in February 1923, aged 76.

He was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and served as a Senator for Western Australia from 1938 to 1959. He held ministerial office in the ALP governments of the 1940s, serving as Minister for External Territories (1941‚Äì1943), Social Services (1943‚Äì1946), Health (1943‚Äì1946), and Trade and Customs (1946). Early life Fraser was born in Forres, Morayshire, Scotland and educated locally. He emigrated to Australia and married Ellen Simmons in April 1912 in Perth. He was turned down for military service during World War I and instead returned to a position at the Royal Arsenal in London, where he had worked before emigrating. After the war he returned to Perth as a motorman with the Western Australian Government Tramways and he became an officer of the Tramway Employees' Union. Political career Fraser became a member of the State executive of the Australian Labor Party in the 1920s and he was a member of Perth City Council from 1929 to 1937. He was elected to the Senate in the 1937 election. He was appointed Minister for External Territories in the Curtin ministry in October 1941. In September 1943, he became Minister for Health and Minister for Social Services and was responsible for implementing the Labor government's ambitions to expand social security programs. In June 1946, he became Minister for Trade and Customs (losing the Social Services portfolio) on the death of Richard Keane, but was not re-elected to the ministry in November 1946. As a backbencher, he became a forceful critic of Labor leader, H. V. Evatt, whom he regarded as unelectable, and seconded a motion to declare the party's leadership positions vacant in October 1954. He retired from parliament in 1959. Personal life Fraser died in the Perth suburb of Victoria Park in 1961, survived by his wife, two sons and one of his two daughters. During World War II, his three sons served in the army. One was captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Singapore and another died as a prisoner of war in Germany.

This term is commonly confused with an inotropic effect, which refers to a change in the force of contraction (e.g. in heart muscle ) produced by transmitter substances or hormones. Examples This term could be used to describe the action of acetylcholine on nicotinic receptors, glutamate on NMDA receptors or GABA on GABAa receptors.

The motivation for biointerface science stems from the urgent need to increase the understanding of interactions between biomolecules and surfaces. The behavior of complex macromolecular systems at materials interfaces are important in the fields of biology, biotechnology, diagnostics, and medicine. Biointerface science is a multidisciplinary field in which biochemists who synthesize novel classes of biomolecules (peptide nucleic acids, peptidomimetics, aptamers, ribozymes, and engineered proteins) cooperate with scientists who have developed the tools to position biomolecules with molecular precision (proximal probe methods, nano- and micro contact methods, e-beam and X-ray lithography, and bottom up self- assembly methods), scientists who have developed new spectroscopic techniques to interrogate these molecules at the solid-liquid interface, and people who integrate these into functional devices (applied physicists, analytical chemists and bioengineers).Biointerfaces, Editors: Dietmar Hutmacher, Wojciech Chrzanowski, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2015, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-78262-845-3 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: * Neural interfaces * Cells in engineered microenvironments and regenerative medicine * Computational and modeling approaches to biointerfaces * Membranes and membrane-based biosensing * Peptides, carbohydrates and DNA at biointerfaces * Pathogenesis and pathogen detection * Molecularly designed interfaces * Nanotube/nanoparticle interfaces Related fields for biointerfaces are biomineralization, biosensors, medical implants, and so forth.  Nanostructure interfaces  Nanotechnology is a rapidly growing field that has allowed for the creation of many different possibilities for creating biointerfaces. Nanostructures that are commonly used for biointerfaces include: metal nanomaterials such as gold and silver nanoparticles, semiconductor materials like silicon nanowires, carbon nanomaterials like graphene or carbon nanotubes, and nanoporous materials. Due to the many properties unique to each nanomaterial, like size, conductivity, and construction, various applications have been achieved. For example, gold nanoparticles are often functionalized in order to act as drug delivery agents for cancers because their size allows them to collect at tumor sites passively. Also as an example, the use of silicon nanowires in nanoporous materials to create scaffolds for synthetic tissues allows for monitoring of electrical activity and electrical stimulation of cells as a result of the photoelectric properties of the silicon. The orientation of biomolecules on the interface can also be controlled through the modulation of parameters like pH, temperature and electrical field. For example, DNA grafted onto gold electrodes can be made to come closer to the electrode surface on application of positive electrode potential and as explained by Rant et al., this can be used to create smart interfaces for biomolecular detection. Likewise, Xiao Ma and others, have discussed the electrical control on the binding/unbinding of thrombin from aptamers immobilized on electrodes. They showed that on application of certain positive potentials, the thrombin gets separated from the biointerface. = Silicon nanowire interfaces = Silicon is a common material used in the technology industry due to its abundance as well as its properties as a semiconductor. However, in the bulk form used for computer chips and the like are not conducive to biointerfaces. For these purposes silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are often used. Various methods of growth and composition of SiNWs, such as etching, chemical vapor deposition, and doping, allow for the properties of the SiNWs to be customized for unique applications. One example of these unique uses is that SiNWs can be used as individual wires to be used for intracellular probes or extracellular devices or the SiNWs can be manipulated into larger macro structures. These structures can be manipulated into flexible, 3D, macropourus structures (like the scaffolds mentioned above) that can be used for creating synthetic extracellular matrices. In the case of Tian et al., cardiomyocytes were grown on these structures as a way to create a synthetic tissue structure that could be used to monitor the electrical activity of the cells on the scaffold. The device created by Tian et al. takes advantage of the fact that SiNWs are field-effect transistor (FET)-based devices. FET devices respond to electric potential charges at the surface of the device, or in this case the surface of the SiNW. Being a FET device can also be taken advantage of when using single SiNWs as biosensing devices. SiNW sensors are nanowires that contain specific receptors on their surface that when bound to their respective antigens will cause changes in conductivity. These sensors have the ability to be inserted into cells with minimal invasiveness making them in some ways preferable to traditional biosensors like fluorescent dyes, as well as other nanoparticles which require target labelling.

Biography Prendergast was the son of Sir Jeffery Prendergast, born at Clonmel in 1769, who was in the service of the East India Company, becoming colonel of the 39th native infantry in 1825. Sir Jeffery served in the Mysore War, was knighted in 1838, promoted to the rank of general in 1854, and died in 1856, having married in 1804 Elizabeth, daughter of Hew Dalrymple of Nunraw. Thomas was nominated a writer in the British East India Company's service on 23 June 1826, and became assistant to the collector of Tanjore, Madras presidency, in 1828. He was acting head assistant to the collector of Nellore on 16 Jan. 1829, and head assistant on 9 Feb. 1830. In 1831 he became acting sub-collector and joint magistrate of Nellore, in 1833 acting assistant judge at Guntoor, and on 8 Aug. 1834 assistant judge of Tinnevelly, where he remained until 1838. He was afterwards for many years collector and magistrate at Rajahmundry until his retirement on the annuity fund in 1859. On his return to England he settled at Cheltenham, and soon became totally blind. Despite this misfortune, he devoted himself to literary work, and invented what he called the mastery system of learning languages, based on the process pursued by children in learning to speak. By frequently repeating conversational sentences Prendergast had himself acquired the Madras vernacular, Tamil, and Telegu. His system was to some extent a development of the Ollendorffian, but Prendergast elaborated its details on original lines. His success was considerable, and the various manuals in which he practically expounded his views went through numerous editions. He died at Meldon Cottage, The Park, Cheltenham, and was buried in the new cemetery on 18 November. His son, Sir Harry Prendergast, G.C.B., V.C., was commander in Burma in 1883‚Äì6.

A cattle crush (in UK, New Zealand, Ireland and Australia), squeeze chute (North America), standing stock, or simply stock (North America, Ireland) is a strongly built stall or cage for holding cattle, horses, or other livestock safely while they are examined, marked, or given veterinary treatment. Cows may be made to suckle calves in a crush. For the safety of the animal and the people attending it, a close-fitting crush may be used to ensure the animal stands \\"stock still\\". The overall purpose of a crush is to hold an animal still to minimise the risk of injury to both the animal and the operator while work on the animal is performed. Construction A portable crush Crushes were traditionally manufactured from wood; this, however, was prone to deterioration from the elements over time, as well as having the potential to splinter and cause injury to the animal. In recent years, most budget-quality crushes have been built using standard heavy steel pipe that is welded together, while superior quality crushes are now manufactured using doubly symmetric oval tubing for increasing bending strength, bruise minimisation and stiffness in stockyard applications. In Australia, the steel itself should ideally be manufactured to High Tensile Grade 350LO - 450LO and conform to Australian Standards AS 1163 for structural steel. Cattle crushes may be fully fixed or mobile; however, most crushes are best classified as semipermanent, being potentially movable but designed to primarily stay in one place. A cattle crush is typically linked to a cattle race (also known as an alley). The front end has a head bail (or neck yoke or head gate) to catch the animal and may have a baulk gate that swings aside to assist in catching the beast. The bail is often adjustable to accommodate animals of different sizes. This bail may incorporate a chin or neck bar to hold the animal's head still. A side lever operates the head bail to capture the animals, with the better types having a rear drop-away safety lever for easier movement of the cattle into the bail. Usually, smaller animals can walk through the head bails incorporated in crushes.Doyle, Philip W., Beef Cattle Yards, NSW Dept. of Agriculture, 1979 Scanning and weighing crush with timber and belting sides to increase the accuracy of ear tag scanning. Lower side panels and/or gates of sheet metal, timber or conveyor belting are used in some cases to ensure animals' legs do not get caught and reduce the likelihood of operator injury. At least one side gate is usually split to allow access to various parts of the animal being held, as well as providing access to feed a calf, amongst other things. A squeeze crush has a manual or hydraulic mechanism to squeeze the animal from the sides, immobilizing the animal while keeping bruising to a minimum. A sliding entrance gate, operated from the side of the crush, is set a few feet behind the captured animal to allow for clearance and prevent other animals entering. Crushes will, in many cases, have a single or split veterinary gate that swings behind the animal to improve operator safety, while preventing the animal from moving backwards by a horizontal rump bar inserted just behind its haunches into one of a series of slots. If this arrangement is absent, a palpation cage can be added to the crush for veterinary use when artificial insemination or pregnancy testing is being performed, or for other uses.CHUTES and ACCESSORIES Retrieved on 16 April 2009 Older crushes can also be found to have a guillotine gate that is also operated from the side via rope or chain where the gate is raised up for the animal to go under upon entering the crush, and then let down behind the animal. A crush is a permanent fixture in slaughterhouses, because the animal is carried on a conveyor restrainer under its belly, with its legs dangling in a slot on either side. Carried in this manner, the animal is unable to move either forward or backward by its own volition.Conveyor Restrainer Retrieved on 4 September 2008 Some mobile crushes are equipped with a set of wheels so they can be towed from yard to yard. A few of these portable crushes are built so the crush may also be used as a portable loading ramp. A mobile crush must incorporate a strong floor, to prevent the animal moving it by walking along the ground. Crushes vary in sophistication, according to requirements and cost. The simplest are just a part of a cattle race (alley) with a suitable head bail. More complex ones incorporate features such as automatic catching systems, hatches (to gain access to various parts of the animal), winches (to raise the feet or the whole animal), constricting sides to hold the animal firmly (normal in North American slaughterhouses), a rocking floor to prevent kicking or a weighing mechanism. Specialist crushes AELEC, Tamworth, New South Wales. Specialist crushes are made for various purposes. For example, those designed for cattle with very long horns (such as Highland cattle or Texas Longhorn cattle) are low-sided or very wide, to avoid damage to the horns. Other specialist crushes include those for tasks such as automatic scanning, foot-trimming or clipping the hair under the belly, and smaller crushes (calf cradles) for calves. Standing stocks for cattle and horses are more commonly stand-alone units, not connected to races (alleys) except for handling animals not accustomed to being handled. These stand-alone units may be permanent or portable. Some portable units disassemble for transport to shows and sales. These units are used during grooming and also with veterinary procedures performed with the animal standing, especially if it requires heavy sedation, or to permit surgery under sedation rather than general anesthesia. For some surgical procedures, this is reported to be efficient. These units also are used during some procedures that require a horse to stand still, but without sedation. There are two different types of specialised crushes used in rodeo arenas. Those for the \\"rough stock\\" events, such as bronc riding and bull riding, are known as bucking chutes or rough-riding chutes. For events such as steer roping, the crush is called a roping chute. The rough-riding chutes are notably higher in order to hold horses and adult bulls, and have platforms and rail spacing that allows riders and assistants to access the animal from above. These chutes release the animal and the rider through a side gate. A roping chute is large enough to contain a steer of the size used in steer wrestling and may also have a seat above the chute for an operator. The steer or calf is released through the front of the chute. Hoof trimming crush A hoof trimming crush, also called a hoof trimming chute or hoof trimming stalls, is a crush specifically designed for the task of caring for cattle hooves, specifically trimming excess hoof material and cleaning. Such crushes range from simple standing frameworks to highly complex fixed or portable devices where much or all of the process is mechanised. Many standard crushes now come with optional fitting kits to add to a non-foot trimming crush. Integrated weighing systems In recent years, crushes are often integrated with weighing systems. The crush provides the ideal opportunity to weigh and measure the animal while it is safely contained within the unit. History Many cattle producers managed herds with nothing more than a race (alley) and a headgate (or a rope) until tagging requirements and disease control necessitated the installation of crushes. In the past the principal use of the crush, in England also known as a trevis, was for the shoeing of oxen. Crushes were, and in places still are, used for this purpose in North America and in many European countries. They were usually stand-alone constructions of heavy timbers or stone columns and beams. Some crushes were simple, without a head bail or yoke, while others had more sophisticated restraints and mechanisms; a common feature is a belly sling which allows the animal to be partly or wholly raised from the ground. In Spain, the crush was a village community resource and is called potro de herrar, or \\"shoeing frame\\". In France it is called travail √† ferrer (plural travails, not travaux) or \\"shoeing trevis\\", and was associated with blacksmith shops. Although the word travail derives from Latin tripalium, \\"three beams\\", all surviving examples but that at Roissard have four columns. In central Italy it is called a travaglio, but in Sardinia is referred to as , or \\"the machine for shoeing the oxen\\". In the United States it was called an ox sling, an ox press or shoeing stalls. In some countries, including the Netherlands and France, horses were commonly shod in the same structures. In the United States similar but smaller structures, usually called horse shoeing stocks, are still in use, primarily to assist farriers in supporting the weight of the horse's hoof and leg when shoeing draft horses.

It was written and directed by Ted Braun and produced by Don Cheadle, Mark Jonathan Harris and Cathy Schulman. Executive Producers included Jeffrey Skoll, Omar Amanat, Dean Schramm, Diane Weyermann, and Matt Palmieri. The film is a call to action for people all over the world to help the ongoing crisis in Darfur. Darfur Now premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released in the United States and Canada on November 2, 2007. Summary Darfur Now follows the story of six individuals, who are tied together by the same cause: the crisis in Darfur. These individuals include Don Cheadle, an Oscar-nominated actor using his celebrity status to draw attention to the issue, as well as Adam Sterling, a 24-year-old waiter and activist urging Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign a bill to keep California funds from investing in companies with interests in Sudan, and Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. Then there's the ones actually situated in Darfur: Hejewa Adam, a woman whose baby was beaten to death by Janjaweed attackers who now fights in the Sudanese Liberation Army; Ahmed Mohammed Abakar, a displaced builder and farmer who now serves as leader and head sheikh of a camp of 47,000 other displaced Darfurians; and Pablo Recalde, leader of the World Food Program in West Darfur.

Biography Ogle, fourth son of John Ogle of St. Clare, near Ightham, Sevenoaks, Kent, was born on 16 April 1851, and educated, with other pupils, under his father at St. Clare. He matriculated at the University of London in June 1869, and then devoted himself to the study of architecture, becoming a pupil of Frederick William Roper of 9 Adam Street, Adelphi, London. He was a contributor to the ‚ÄòBuilder,‚Äô and in 1872 he both obtained a certificate for excellence in architectural construction and was admitted an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Soon afterwards he visited Rome, and in August 1875 went for some months to Athens, where he worked in the office of Herr Ziller, the royal architect. While thus engaged, the proprietors of the ‚ÄòTimes‚Äô newspaper accepted an offer of his services as their special correspondent in the war between Turkey and Herzegovina and the neighbouring provinces, and he accompanied the Turkish force against the Montenegrins. The letters written by Ogle from Montenegro and the Herzegovina, from Greece, from Crete, and from Thessaly, are full of picturesque details, brightened by a kindly humour. While residing at Volo, on the gulf of Thessaly, Ogle learned, on 28 March 1878, that an engagement was imminent between the Turkish troops and the insurgents occupying Mont Pelion and the town of Macrynitza. He at once proceeded to the scene of action, without arms and with a cane in his hand. The battle took place, and was prolonged to the following day, when Ogle, unable to obtain a horse to return to Volo, slept at Katochori on 29 and 30 March. On 1 April his headless body was found lying in a ravine, and identified by a scar on the wrist and a blood-stained telegram in his pocket- book addressed to The Times. The body was taken on board H.M.S. Wizard, and conveyed to the Pir√¶us, where it was accorded a public funeral on 10 April. It was claimed that Ogle was assassinated by order of the Turkish commander, Amouss Aga, in revenge for reflections made on his pillaging a village. A report was circulated that the correspondent was aiding the insurgents. In a parliamentary paper, issued on 18 June, Ogle is blamed for imprudence in venturing among the belligerents, and his death was attributed to a wound received while retreating with the insurgents after the second battle of Macrynitza; but these statements were denied by friends.

When she was fifteen she entered the Leipzig Conservatory in Germany, where she was a pupil of Adolph Brodsky, the Russian violinist. Upon graduation, she was awarded with a prize for her musicianship and skill. The prize was not annually awarded, but rather reserved for musicians who were especially deserving.  Musical career  After graduating in 1889, she made her professional debut at the Academy of Music in Toronto, Canada. This was a momentous performance, as it was also the inaugural performance of the institution's new theater. She headlined the performance, which also included Fannie Bloomfield-Zeisler, an American pianist, and two other Canadians, Contralto Moran Wyman, and tenor Whitney Mockridge.Gardiner, Jessica. 2006. \\"‚ÄúThe amusement world‚Äù: Theatre as social practice in eighteen- nineties Toronto.\\" Order No. NR77599, University of Toronto (Canada), .

This hiatus was brief, as she began performing again in 1903, and formed the Nora Clench Quartet in 1904 with Lucy Stone as second violin, Cecilia Gates on viola, and May Mukle on Cello. Their first concert in June 1904 included works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Alexander Borodin.\\"CURRENT EVENTS AND CONCERT NOTES.\\". 1904 The Violin times : a monthly journal for professional and amateur violinists and quartet players 11, no. 128: 101. The Nora Clench Quartet only lasted a few years, but in that time it received high praise for its performances. The Violin Times offered high praise for the quartet in its premiere performances that took place in January of that year at London's Aeolian Hall, stating that their interpretation and expression of Hugo Wolf's quartet in D minor was admirable.\\"CURRENT EVENTS AND CONCERT NOTES.\\". 1905 The Violin times : a monthly journal for professional and amateur violinists and quartet players 12, no. 134: 1-4, . The same Times article illustrated how Clench continued performing as a soloist as well, playing a violin sonata together with Percy Grainger on the piano. Though the quartet was appreciated, its final performances came in 1907, as documented by the Violin Times. These performances included quartets from Mozart, Schumann, and the premiere of Max Reger's Quartet in D minor.\\"THE NORAH CLENCH QUARTET.\\". 1907 The Violin times : a monthly journal for professional and amateur violinists and quartet players 14, no. 161: 51, . These final performances were also praised, with the Times describing a large and appreciative audience in attendance. Nora Clench retired in 1908 when she married Arthur Streeton. Three years later, their son Charles Ludwig Oliver Streeton was born. At the time of the marriage, Clench was still held high renown, while her new husband was still relatively unknown as an artist. Over the course of the ensuing years, this began to change. By the time they moved to Australia in 1924, she was almost completely unknown, while Streeton gained greater renown. His growing fame ultimately led to knighthood in 1937, giving her the title of Lady Streeton. By the time she died in Toorak, Victoria, Australia in 1938, she was known only for her relationship to Streeton among their contemporaries.

Its unusually short bonnet reportedly contained the smallest V4 engine ever commercialized in a small family car Nearly 23,000 of the Ardeas produced were standard bodied saloons but between 1940 and 1942 approximately 500 Ardeas were manufactured with lengthened bodies and a squared off rear cabin for use in Rome as taxis. After the war more than 8,500 commercial adaptations of the Ardea known as 'furgoncini' (light van versions) and the 'camioncini' (car based light trucks) were also produced. The third series Ardea, produced from 1948, was the first mass-produced car with a 5-speed manual transmission. Ardea was named either after Ardea town (Lazio), or Via Ardeatina, Roman road leading from Rome to that town. The cabin Instrumentation included a centrally mounted speedometer, the fuel level and the oil pressure. A third dial directly below the driver's sight line was a clock, unusually on this size of car. The three floor pedals followed the pattern still 'conventional' for a manual transmission car (clutch, brake, gas) but to the left of the clutch pedal was a small foot-operated dipper switch for the headlights. Control knobs lined up along the base of the fascia included a hand throttle. Lancia Ardea Early Italian images of Ardea interiors confirm that Lancias of the period were still right hand drive, a position elsewhere taken to imply driving on the left side of the road. However, right- hand drive is practical even where drivers drive on the right-hand side of the road as it allows a better view of the edge of the road, which is useful when driving on rough roads in mountainous districts. This did mean that drivers of cars with centrally located floor mounted gear shifts, such as the Ardea, needed to learn how to shift with the left hand. During the 1920s Italian leader Benito Mussolini required all Italian drivers to drive on the right, but Lancia would continue, through the 1950s, to supply right hand drive cars in areas viewed by other automakers as left hand drive markets. History Four versions of the Ardea were built: * 1st series, produced between 1939 and 1941, 2,992 built. * 2nd series, produced between 1941 and 1948, 4,438 built. 12 Volt electric system introduced. * 3rd series, produced between 1948 and 1949, 3,600 built. 5-speed gearbox introduced. * 4th series, produced between 1949 and 1953, 11,700 built. New cylinder head, aluminium, higher compression ratio, more power: 30 bhp. Variants Alongside the type 250 4-door saloon other body variants of the Ardea were offered. =Chassis= The Ardea was offered as bare chassis (type 350) between 1939‚Äì1941 to be bodied by independent coachbuilders. The chassis had the 2440 mm wheelbase of the saloon. =Ardea furgoncino and camioncino= The Aurelia chassis type 550 van (furgoncino, literally \\"small van\\") was built in 9 examples already in 1941, but regular production begun only in 1945. The Ardea chassis type 650 pick-up (camioncino, literally \\"small pickup\\") was introduced in 1948. In 1949 they were upgraded to fourth series specifications (5-speed gearbox and more powerful 101B engine), and continued to be built until they were superseded by equivalent versions of the Appia in 1954. Unlike on the earlier Augusta, whose commercial variants were bodied by third-party coachbuilders, these Ardeas were factory-built by Lancia. =Tass√¨ Roma= The Tass√¨ Roma, chassis type 450, was an Ardea derivative with special 6-window saloon body, intended for use as a taxicab. It paired the Ardea's running gear with a larger chassis (longer wheelbase and wider tracks) which allowed for better passenger accommodation. From 1939 to 1941 about 500 were made‚Äî501 or 511 depending on the source.

Life Rose, eldest son of James Rose, barge-owner, of Tooley Street, Southwark, was born in London on 1 May 1782. He received a presentation to Westminster School, and became king's scholar in 1797. He was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, but did not take a degree. According to the DNB, he was elected to Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1801, but poverty prevented him from completing his education there, and it was not until 1835 that he took his M.A. degree as a member of Trinity College, Oxford. On 5 May 1809 he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple, and commenced attendance in the common-law courts and on the northern circuit. Rose was a witty man, and his first success is attributed to the publicity he attained by the composition while in court, when Lord Eldon was the presiding judge, of the following verse: :Mr. Leach made a speech, :Angry, neat, and long; :Mr. Hart, on the other part, :Was right, but dull and long. :Mr. Parker made that darker :Which was dark enough without; :Mr. Cook quoted his book, :And the Chancellor said I doubt. In May 1827 he was named a king's counsel, and in the same year became a bencher of his inn, of which he was reader in 1834 and treasurer in 1835. The misfortune of his father's bankruptcy attracted his attention to the bankruptcy branch in chancery, where he obtained a fair practice. He published ‚ÄòReports of Cases in Bankruptcy decided by Lord Eldon,‚Äô vol. i. 1812, reprinted 1813; vol. ii. 1816, reprinted 1821; this book was continued by J. W. Buck. In 1813 he published ‚ÄòAn Inquiry into the Nature of Trading as a Scrivener.‚Äô On 5 Dec. 1831 he was sworn in as one of the four judges of the court of review, which had jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases, and on 7 Dec. was knighted at St. James's Palace. On some change being made in the court of review, Lord Cottenham gave Rose on 7 Dec. 1840 the lucrative and comparatively easy post of a mastership in chancery, which he held till the masterships were abolished on 1 Feb. 1858; he then retired on his full salary of 2,500l. a year. Rose was the first chairman of the Law Life Insurance Society in 1844, and attended the board meetings until 1859. On 5 June 1834 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and later on became a fellow of the Geographical Society. He was one of the old school of wits. Many of his jokes were of a professional character, and referred to legal proceedings long since obsolete; others, however, related to general matters, and were remarkable for their readiness and originality. To Westminster School he always felt grateful, and with it kept up a friendly connection; he was a steward of the anniversaries in 1827, 1833, and 1848, a constant attendant at the plays, and sometimes aided in the preparation of the prologue and epilogue. He died at Brighton on 3 Dec. 1873, having married Anne, daughter of Captain Robert Pouncey.

A member of the Home Rule League, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Cork City from 1872 to 1876.  Career  Ronayne, youngest son of Edmond Ronayne, a glass-maker of Cork, was born at Cork in 1822. After an education at Hamblin and Porter's Grammar School in Cork, and instruction from Mr. O'Neill in practical surveying, he entered the office of Sir John Benjamin McNeill, civil engineer of London and Glasgow. He was first engaged in the design and construction of the main arterial lines of railway in Ireland, and then on one half of the Cork and Bandon Railway. In 1853 he proposed furnishing Cork with water by the construction of a lake near Blarney, but this was not carried out. On 4 March 1856 he became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. From 1854 to 1859 he was in California, where he superintended hydraulic works, bringing down the waters of the Sierra Nevada to the goldfields by means of canals and aqueducts. After returning to Ireland he became a contractor, and executed the Queenstown branch of the Cork and Youghal railway. On the completion of that work, he laid out the Cork and Macroon railway. He took payment in shares, and thus occupied the unusual position of engineer, contractor, and the largest proprietor. He subsequently suggested to the government the construction of a dock in a bay near Monkstown, but the Haulbowline site was finally adopted. On 10 December 1872 he was elected in a by-election to represent Cork City in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, after the death of John Francis Maguire. He was re-elected at the 1874 general electionWalker, op. cit., pages 115‚Äì116 and retained the seat until his death. He died at Rinn Ronain, Queenstown, on 7 May 1876, and was buried in Father Mathew's cemetery, Cork, on 11 May. He married, in 1859, Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Stace Wright, commander R.N.

Life Rothery was born in London. His father was William Rothery, chief of the office of the King's Proctor in Doctors' Commons. Henry was educated at St. John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1840, as nineteenth wrangler in the mathematical tripos, and M.A. in 1845. After leaving the university he entered Doctors' Commons, and from 1842 practised in the ecclesiastical and admiralty courts. On 26 November 1853 he was appointed registrar of the admiralty court. Soon after, he became registrar of the Privy Council in ecclesiastical and maritime cases. In 1860 he was made legal adviser to HM Treasury in questions and proceedings arising out of the slave trade. On account of his large experience gathered in the court of Admiralty, in 1876 he was appointed commissioner to inquire into the causes and circumstances of shipwrecks, and to conduct investigations into casualties at sea. He began his duties towards the close of 1876. His inquiries indicated many preventible causes of maritime losses.The Times, 3 Aug. 1888 p.10, 6 Aug. p.9, 8 Aug. p.9 His judgments on fire at sea in coal-laden vessels, on certain methods of stowing grain, on ship stability, and on overloading were especially valuable. =Tay bridge disaster= Original Tay Bridge from the north Fallen Tay Bridge from the north He chaired the public inquiry into the Tay Bridge disaster, when an express train was lost by the collapse of the bridge across the Tay estuary on the night of December 28, 1879. He was assisted by the Chief inspector of Railways, William Yolland and William Henry Barlow, President of the Institution of Civil Engineers. The inquiry sat initially in Dundee to hear eyewitness accounts of the accident, and then at Westminster Hall in London for expert evidence. They produced their final report in June 1880, and concluded that the bridge was \\"badly designed, badly built and badly maintained\\". Although they all agreed on the root causes of the disaster, his fellow judges Yolland and Barlow produced their own final report which hesitated in placing the blame on the chief engineer, Thomas Bouch. He himself died a few months after the inquiry reported in June 1880. The reports were made in a remarkably short time considering the wealth of evidence they had to consider. The remains were demolished and a new bridge built alongside the old with a double line of tracks. Personal life He married Madelina, n√©e Garden, in 1851 but the couple had no children. He retired in the early summer of 1888 and died at Ribsden, Bagshot, Surrey.

From youth he was devoted to sport, and excelled as a boxer, runner, and sculler until he was twenty-three, when he was disabled by an accident to his left foot. In 1866 he was engaged by Samuel Beeton to contribute sporting leaders to the Glow-Worm and the Weekly Dispatch.

The Paleolithic extended from about 500,000 BCE to 8000 BCE. The Paleolithic is subdivided into periods, the Lower Paleolithic, 500,000 to 350,000 BCE, the Middle Paleolithic, 350,000 to 40,000 BCE, the Upper Paleolithic, 40,000 to 10,000 BCE, and the Final Paleolithic, 10,000 to 8000 BCE. The Mesolithic lasted from 8000 to 5500 BCE, and the Neolithic from 5500 to 2300 BCE. The Neolithic is subdivided into the Neolithic proper, 5500 to 2900 BCE, and the Copper Age, 2900 to 2300 BCE. The Stone Age era lasted 800,000 years, and involved three different human species: Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens. The Stone Age cultures ranged from early human groups with primitive tools to advanced agricultural societies, which used sophisticated stone tools, built fortified settlements and developed copper metallurgy. As elsewhere in eastern and central Europe, the Stone Age human cultures went through the stages known as the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic, each bringing new refinements of the stone tool making techniques. The Paleolithic period human activities (the earliest sites are about 500,000 years old) were intermittent because of the recurring periods of glaciation. With the recession of the last glaciation, a general climate warming and the resulting increase in ecologic environment diversity was characteristic of the Mesolithic (from 9000-8000 BCE). The Neolithic brought the first settled agricultural communities; their founders migrated from the Danube River area (from 5500 BCE). Later the native post- Mesolithic populations also adopted and further developed the agricultural way of life (from 4400 to about 2000 BCE).Various authors, ed.

Gatherer-hunter Homo erectus campsites, together with their inhabitants' primitive stone tools (choppers and microliths), bones of the large mammals they hunted and the fish they caught, were found below the San River glaciation period sediments in Trzebnica and are about 500,000 years old. Younger sites related to the same species were found at Rusko near Strzegom, located, like Trzebnica, in the Lower Silesia region. This represents the microlithic complexes of the Lower Paleolithic period. Homo erectus, earlier known as Pithecanthropus erectus, was a species of early humans.Piotr Kaczanowski, Janusz Krzysztof Koz≈Çowski - Najdawniejsze dzieje ziem polskich (do VII w.)

Various relics were found and different Neanderthal cultures are distinguished. Acheulean handaxes from Silesia dated 200,000-180,000 years ago are among the older tools. Gatherer-hunter sporadic groups of Neanderthals penetrated southern Poland also during the Eemian interglacial, 128,000-115,000 BCE. Examination of the Micoquien-PrƒÖdnik culture (East Micoquien complex) sites in the PrƒÖdnik River Valley north of Krak√≥w and in Zwole≈Ñ near Radom from about 85,000 to 70,000 BCE (early phase of the Vistula River glaciation period) shows that some Neanderthals were skilled collective hunters, able to kill numerous large mammals characteristic of the cold Pleistocene climate and process the meat, skin and bones using specialized tools.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski p. 43, 61, 381 = Homo sapiens = Homo sapiens proper (Homo sapiens sapiens, the Cro-Magnon type) appears in the Upper Paleolithic, which lasted from 40,000 to 9,000 BCE. During the coldest part of this Ice age period, 20,000 to 15,000 BCE, humans did not inhabit Poland. The latter, warmer part, after the climatic discontinuity and the reappearance of humans, is considered the Late Paleolithic.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p.18-19, Jan M. Burdukiewicz Upper Paleolithic people specialized in organized, group hunting of large mammals; they sometimes pursued and drove entire herds into traps. Their nutritional needs were met largely by meat consumption, as the vegetation was limited to tundra and steppe and the land was covered by ice and snow (Vistula final glaciation) for long periods. More sophisticated tool making methods resulted in the production of long (some over two feet), narrow and sharp flintstone splits. In a cave near Nowy Targ (East-Gravettian culture), a 30,000-year-old boomerang, the world's oldest, was found. It is a crescent-shaped 70 cm long object with a fine finish, made of mammoth tusk. Mammoths were hunted in the Krak√≥w area during 25,000-20,000 BCE.

Several hundred Paleolithic campsites have been located there, which makes it the world's largest accumulation of such finds. They extend over a number of periods, beginning with the Mousterian (Neanderthal) culture, followed by the Hamburg culture of reindeer hunters. The Final Paleolithic is represented there by the Komornica culture, named after a village in Legionowo County. The best known Late Paleolithic campsites in the area, which include some dugout huts, belonged to the people preoccupied with hematite ore mining, from which ochre pigment used for body painting was being made. The red dye was widely traded, which is why rocks and minerals originating from distant regions of today's Poland, Slovakia and Hungary are found at Rydno. Pieces of \\"chocolate\\" flint brought into this area for processing were stored in quantities that were always multiples of three. Because of this and other evidence, it is believed that the Paleolithic people developed a counting system based on this number. A 12,600 BCE Hamburg culture site with tents, camp-fire and stone meat baking devices was discovered in Olbrachcice, Wschowa County.Rydno, Polish WikipediaRydno by Katarzyna Gritzmann, Fundacja Kultury Wici web site A rich source of Late Paleolithic sites and artifacts (the Magdalenian culture of 14,500 BCE) is the PrƒÖdnik River Valley. The Maszycka Cave there contained the remains of a typical (at that time) social unit of several families, 20-30 people, as well as numerous tools and other artifacts of their culture, including ornamented bone utensils. Remnants of a 15,000 to 17,000 years old Magdalenian culture dwelling (a dugout cabin site with traces of supporting posts, a hearth and imported materials) were discovered recently in ƒÜmiel√≥w, Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski County.Nauka w Polsce web site April 11, 2008, Adam Lisiecki; also Archeowie≈õci web site, Wojciech Pastuszka Traces of younger (Final Paleolithic) campsites identified with the Swiderian, Federmesser and Ahrenburgian cultures were located at Stare Marzy near ≈öwiecie, among other places.  Mesolithic  The Mesolithic lasted from 9000 BCE (rapid climate warming) to 5500 BCE (arrival of first farmers from the Danube River area). It was the last period when the food production economy was entirely opportunistic, based on assimilation of plant and animal material found in nature, that is gathering and hunting. Because of warmer temperatures, complex forest ecosystems and wetlands developed and this natural diversity necessitated new hunting and fishing strategies. As new populations entered Poland from the west, hunters and fishermen working individually or in small groups had to pursue single large and small animals using traps, javelins, bows and arrows, boats and fishing equipment, and utilizing dogs. Women engaged in gathering of such products as roots, herbs, nuts, bird eggs, mollusks, fruit or honey, which possibly was even more important than hunting. Mesolithic human settlements became quite numerous and by the end of this period the economy of harvesting nature became very highly developed. Tools and devices were made of materials such as stone (flint strip mines have been found at the northern edge of ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains), bone, wood, horn, or plant material for rope and baskets, and included such fine utensils as fishing hooks and sewing needles. Animal figurines were made of amber. At least during the later Mesolithic, the dead were placed in graves and outfitted with familiar objects of their surroundings. One such well preserved grave of an apparent tool-maker, together with his tools and other items, was found in Janis≈Çawice near Skierniewice and dated 5500 BCE.  Neolithic  = Introduction of agriculture - Danubian cultures of farming communities = Early Neolithic era began around 5500 BCE with the arrival from the middle Danube area of people, who kept livestock, cultivated crops, made pottery and smooth-surface tools. Their land tilling predecessors had been coming into the Balkans and then the Danube region from Anatolia beginning a thousand years earlier. They formed the first settled rural communities, thus forging the most fundamental civilizational advance.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 32-33, Ryszard Grygiel The original newcomers represented the Linear Pottery culture. Their uniform culture survived in Poland in its original form until about 4600 BCE. Despite the big impact they made, the first waves came in small numbers - hundreds, or at most a few thousand people, judging by the sizes of the known settlements. They populated mainly fertile soils of southern highlands and river valleys further north, all the way to the Baltic Sea. They lived alongside the more numerous native people who were still pursuing the Mesolithic lifestyle, but during the Linear Pottery culture times there wasn't much interaction, as the two groups inhabited different environments.Europe's 1st Farmers Were Segregated, Expert Immigrants. National Geographic Sept. 2009 Their villages consisted of several, but sometimes up to a dozen or so rectangular communal long-houses,Europe: A History by Norman Davies, p. 74, 1998 New York, HarperPerennial, some over 30 meters long, supported by wooden posts, the oldest of which come from the Lower Silesia region. One such location from about 5000 BCE was also unearthed at Olszanica, which is now at the west end of Krak√≥w just within the city limits. Large Danubian complexes were in recent years excavated in the Targowisko and Szar√≥w (Wieliczka County) area of fertile loessial hills. The settlements, which included massive post construction houses even over 50 meters long as well as industrial facilities, extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of the identified structures functioned together, as was the case when the buildings were connected by a courtyard and protected by a common fence. Plants were cultivated mostly in small nearby gardens, but wheat and barley were also grown on small fields obtained by burning the forest. In the absence of animal-drawn plowing devices, soil was being hoed manually. The forest burning activity brought about significant ecological and environmental changes in Lesser Poland, Silesia and Kujawy. Further out were the pastures, the entire area utilized by a single settlement having a radius of about 5 km. Cattle, sheep and goats were even more numerous in the northern flatlands, where the land was less fertile. The Danubian people communities kept in touch and exchanged goods over large areas, all the way to their regions of origin beyond the Carpathian Mountains. After 5000 BCE new waves of immigrants arrived from the south again, which accelerated the process of differentiation of the agrarian society into several distinct cultures during the first half of 5th millennium BC and afterwards. In the Oder River basin mostly there was the culture named after the punctured variety of Linear Band pottery - Stroked Pottery culture, while in the Vistula River basin the Lengyel and Polg√°r cultures appeared. The two regions developed in some separation, but within them the different cultural traditions of the younger Danubian circle often overlapped. The houses were now of an elongated trapezoidal shape, up to 40 meters long, grouped in larger complexes, often protected by beam and earth walls, moats and other fortifications, as such defensive measures apparently became necessary against people from the still Mesolithic native population or other Danubian settlements. These defensive structures, built from the mid 5th millennium BCE on, were complicated and consumed significant time and resources. Their design followed that of the similar construction that was taking place in the Danube River areas, starting in the early part of this millennium. Large cemeteries and graves supplied with fancier objects such as jewelry, including the first so-called \\"princely\\" graves (the princesses had imported copper necklaces, earrings and diadems in addition to locally made decorations), testify to the emergence of a relatively more affluent society. Cattle raising and trading (large varieties resulted from cross-breeding with the aurochs) and land tillage provided basic sustenance. Salt was obtained and traded and became a much sought after commodity, at first probably to help preserve stored food. The salt springs around Wieliczka were utilized already by the Lengyel culture people, who left ceramic vessels used in salt production there. The Danubian people produced many richly decorated objects, including clay containers with animal head ornaments and figurines of women.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 34-39, Ryszard Grygiel A settlement and cemetery of the Lengyel-Polg√°r cultural zone, dated around or after 4600 BCE, was discovered in ≈ölƒôza, Wroc≈Çaw County. It consisted of a central long trapezoidal house accompanied by several post-built supporting structures.The Archaeology of the Route of A-4 Motorway in Silesia by Bogus≈Çaw Gediga, Archeologia ≈ªywa (Living Archeology), special English issue 2005 Among the large explored settlements of the Lengyel culture from the 4400-4000 BCE period, there is one in Brze≈õƒá Kujawski, and another one in Os≈Çonki, solidly fortified about 4200 BCE after an assault incident involving arson and murder, both located in the Kujawy region. At the Os≈Çonki settlement nearly 30 trapezoidal houses and over 80 graves were located, some of them with many copper ornaments. The agricultural and construction activities of the communities centered on the two large settlements (hunting and fishing were also practiced) caused very likely an accumulation of environmental damage, which eventually forced them to abandon the area.Archaeological Research at Oslonki, Poland by Peter Bogucki, Princeton University web site 4th millennium BC constructions reinforced with ditches and palisades and ceramics molded into figural representations of the Lengyel-Polg√°r culture were located in Pod≈Çƒô≈ºe, Wieliczka County. The Malice farming culture of southern Poland (all of 5th millennium and until 3800 BCE, named after a site in Malice near Sandomierz) was the first Neolithic culture to originate north of the Carpathian Mountains and spread south. A rare discovery of 5th millennium Malice culture buildings and decorated pottery was made in Targowisko, Wieliczka County. = Neolithic cultures developed by native populations = After 4500 BCE the Erteb√∏lle culture of northwestern origin entered a ceramic phase with its own forms of pottery (characteristic pointed bottoms). They lived by the Baltic Sea shores and were specialized in utilizing the resources of the sea, thus still representing the Mesolithic ways of life. At their settlement in DƒÖbki near Koszalin Stroke-ornamented pottery was found, obtained probably through trade with the Danubian people.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 40 and 44, Ryszard Grygiel The native Mesolithic populations were slow in gradually assimilating the agricultural way of life, beginning with just the use of ceramics. It took a thousand years into the Neolithic period before they adopted animal husbandry (which became especially important to them) and plant cultivation to any appreciable degree. When they eventually developed interest in the more fertile areas utilized by the late Danubian cultures, they became the threat that compelled the Danubian farmers to fortify their settlements. The native post-Mesolithic groups expanded beyond the traditional Danubian areas of agricultural development, moving also into ecologically less favorable environments, which included utilization of sandy soils.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 40-41, Ryszard Grygiel The first truly native Neolithic culture was the Funnelbeaker culture, named after the shape of their typical clay vessels. It developed starting around 4400 BCE and lasted some two thousand years. Like other post-Mesolithic cultures, the Funnelbeaker culture was Megalithic. They built tombs of large stones, some of them huge (for example trapezoidal structures up to 150 meters long) and resembling pyramids. Few survived until now because of the demand for stone as building material, but a well-preserved one from the first half of 4th millennium BC was found in Wietrzychowice near W≈Çoc≈Çawek. From this place and period came the skull, on which the trepanation procedure was performed for medical or magic reasons. Timewise the beginnings of the post-Mesolithic cultures in Poland coincide with the beginnings of the Eneolithic period in the Balkans. Copper objects, mostly ornamental or luxurious items, were traded and then developed locally, first by the Danubian and then by the indigenous people. Copper metallurgy facilities were identified in Z≈Çota near Sandomierz. Clay decorative objects include realistic representations of animals and containers with images engraved on them. A pot from Bronocice, Pi≈Ñcz√≥w County (3400 BCE) has a unique narrative scene and the world's oldest semblance of a four- wheeled cart drawn on its surface. Stone tools became most highly developed and acquired their then characteristic smooth surfaces. Well preserved settlements with rectangular buildings were unearthed in Gr√≥dek Nadbu≈ºny near Hrubiesz√≥w (where remnants of a vertical loom for weaving were found), in Nied≈∫wied≈∫ near Krak√≥w, and in northern Poland in Bar≈Ço≈ºno, Starogard Gda≈Ñski County, where the structures are similar to the ones in Nied≈∫wied≈∫. In Bar≈Ço≈ºno three post supported houses were discovered, the largest of which had the main part 16 meters long and 6.5 meters wide. As dated from the ceramics found, they represent the developed, \\"Wi√≥recka\\" phase of the Funnelbeaker culture.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 40-44 and 46-47, Ryszard GrygielArchaeological Rescue Excavations by Miros≈Çaw Fudzi≈Ñski and Henryk Paner, Archeologia ≈ªywa (Living Archeology), special English issue 2005 Originating from central European lowlands, the Funnelbeaker people were able to utilize large expanses of less fertile soils, obtained by extensive reduction of forested areas, with the increased role of livestock. They moved south into the regions previously developed by the Danubian cultures, all the way to Bohemia and Moravia. Being more numerous, better fit for the environment, organized and economically more productive, the Funnelbeaker culture people replaced the Danubian cultures in their late phase. The Globular Amphora culture was the next major Neolithic culture. It originated in the Polish lowlands during the first half of 4th millennium BC, lasted to about 2400 BCE in parallel with the Funnelbeaker culture, and is named after the bulging shape of its representative pottery. They specialized in breeding domestic animals and lived in a semi-settled state, seeking optimal pastures and moving as needed. This semi-nomadic lifestyle was probably necessitated by the poor condition of the soils, by that time depleted and rendered infertile because of the preceding centuries of forest burning and extensive exploitation. Globular Amphora were the first culture in Poland known for utilizing the domesticated horse, and swine became important as the source of food. Ritual animal, especially cattle burial sites, often with two or more individuals buried together and supplied with objects as strange as drums have been discovered, but their role is not well understood. Globular Amphora people were involved in the north-south amber trade. Their megalithic burials included ceramics, stone tools and ornamental gifts.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 42-44, Ryszard Grygiel The Baden culture in southern Poland was the latest of the Danubian ancestry cultures and continued between 3200 and 2600 BCE. They made vessels with characteristic protruding radial ornaments. A large fortified Baden culture settlement of around 3000 BCE was found in Bronocice near Pi≈Ñcz√≥w.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 44, Ryszard Grygiel Finally there were still in existence the forest zone cultures, representing the ceramic phase of hunting and gathering communities. Some of them lasted into the early Bronze Age.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 44-45, Ryszard Grygiel The major industry of this period was flintstone mining. One of the largest Neolithic (middle to late periods) flint mines in Europe with over 700 vertical shafts and preserved underground passages was located in Krzemionki Opatowskie near Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski. The axes produced from the material obtained there were exported to distant parts of the continent.Large Salvage Excavations in Poland by Jerzy GƒÖssowski, Archeologia ≈ªywa (Living Archeology), special English issue 2005U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 46-47, Ryszard Grygiel = Late Neolithic arrivals from eastern and western regions of Europe = The Corded Ware culture, in existence in central Europe between 3000 and 2000 BCE, originated most likely from Proto-Indo-European nomadic people of the Black Sea steppes. It was a pastoral culture at least in its early stages, for the most part lacking permanent settlements and known primarily from the burial grounds (a large one with many richly furnished graves was discovered in Z≈Çota near Sandomierz). They moved together with their herds of cattle, sheep, goats and horses along the river valleys of southern Poland, but also engaged in flint mining and manufacturing of tools and weapons for their own use and trade.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 48-50, Ryszard Grygiel A Corded Ware culture princely burial was found in Szczytna, Subcarpathian Voivodeship. The grave, well-secured three meters below the surface, contained a man's skeleton and a funerary gift collection of highly valuable copper decorations, containers, stone tools and arrowheads. The uniquely equipped burial of a warrior-chief has close analogies with finds from Transylvania, a testimony to geographically extensive contacts of Corded Ware culture nomadic people.Sensacja archeologiczna.

Their settlements consisting of characteristic sea erosion reinforced houses were located along the Bay of Gda≈Ñsk and east of there. They engaged in fishery and hunting, especially of seals, then numerous along the Baltic coast. The Rzucewo culture people produced in special shops the widely used and traded amber decorative items.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 50-51, Ryszard Grygiel From the opposite end of Europe (the Iberian Peninsula) came the few people who formed during the 2500-1900 BCE period the Bell-Beaker culture. It was named after the shape of their typical, carefully finished and precisely ornamented pottery. Southwestern Poland was at the eastern edge of their range.

Talia, originally from Kalgoorlie, relocated to Nashville in 1999 and has been based in Chicago where she lives with her husband and children.http://www.jennytalia.com  Biography  Jenny Talia was born as Tammy-Jo Bryant and grew up in Kalgoorlie. Her father is Kevin Bloody Wilson (born as Dennis Bryant in 1947), a comedian and entertainer, who also performed as Bryan Dennis; her mother is Betty. They married in 1970 and besides Talia, they have a son, Travis Bryant, who became a pilot. From 1996, Talia released three country music albums as T. J. Dennis. She toured Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom and occasionally performed shows in the United States. Her debut album, My Way ... or no Way at All (1996), was issued on the Both Barrels Music label based in Perth. For the recording sessions she used Martin Jenner, Lucky Oceans and Denise DeMarchi. In June 1999 she performed at Nashville's Fun Fair. Her third country music album, Tjdennis.com (2000), was recorded in that city. Talia described how she evolved from straight forward country music to bawdy comedy, when first living in Nashville, \\"I did gigs around town and I was always asked to play an Australian song. For me, the first 'Australian' song that popped into my head was always one of my Dad's... I would change the words around a bit and make it from a girl's point of view.

Named for the green algae that cover its walls, the structure of the cave is strikingly different from inland systems; the cave is a Flank Margin Cave (old mixing chambers at the edge of the fresh water lens with the sea water) with two well-defined levels apparently indicating two periods with differing sea-levels. The innermost cavern contains a crystal-clear underground lake. In addition to the publicly accessible sections of the cave there is also a section of \\"wild caves\\" with relatively undisturbed ecology. Hydrologically, the cave system is connected with the adjacent coastal waters.  History  At various times they have been known as the Runaway Bay Caves, Hopewell Caves, Cave Hall Caves, Discovery Bay Caves, Dry Harbour Caves, Rum Caves and Dairy Caves. The first known inhabitants of the caves were Arawak Indians who left pottery fragments and adzes. When Jamaica was a British Colony the caves were used as a hideaway by the Spanish who were being driven out by the British settlers. The caves were also known to have been used by escaped slaves, hence the name Runaway Caves. Between the two world wars they were used by smugglers running arms to Cuba, while in the later years of the Second World War the Government of Jamaica used the entrance of the cave as a storeroom for rum in barrels. Natural history The caves are home to nine of Jamaica's 21 species of bat including the Big-Eared Bat, the Mustache Bat, and the Jamaican Fruit-Eating Bat. Numbers are quite high with most of the available roosting space used. Guano is present in large amounts but few of the usual guano dwelling inverts have been recorded; the invasive American Roach is found. The brackish water in the lower levels is full of marine life including small barnacles and various unidentified small swimming creatures.  Cultural references  The filming of the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die, used the caves for villain Doctor Kananga's underground base beneath a cemetery on the fictional island of San Monique. It is most memorable for being the location where Bond (played for the first time by Roger Moore) kills Kananga (played by Yaphet Kotto) by forcing him to swallow a bullet of compressed air, causing him to float up to the ceiling like a balloon and explode. Ian Fleming's original novel had the villain using the real-life Jamaican caves as part of his SMERSH-funding smuggling operation.

The forest area is crossed by the rivers Uecker, Randow and Zarow. There are also numerous protected moors, especially in the border area with Poland. The swamps were also the reason why the heath was colonised relatively late. In the 17th century it was mainly colonists who set up charcoal burners and glassworks.

Under him, from 1391 to 1400, the Cathedral-Priory church's nave was rebuilt in the Perpendicular style of English Gothic architecture. Life =Early life= His family (and hence its surname) probably originated in the Kentish village of Chillenden, though his parents are unknown. After becoming a monk at Christ Church Priory, he studied for a bachelorship in canon law at Canterbury College, Oxford from 1365 to 1378, before going to Rome to study the same subject at the papal curia. There he became Doctor of Canon Law, in 1383 or earlier, put together an index to the fourth book of the Decretals of Gregory IX (Repertorium quarti libri decretalium), wrote a commentary to the Regulae juris (Longleat, MS 35, fols. 187‚Äì206), and lectured on the fourth book of the Clementines (‚ÄòReportata on the Clementines‚Äô).These lectures on the Clementines and his Repertorium were bound together into one book in the library of All Souls College, Oxford, as MS 53. It indicates English canonists' interest in marriage law. In 1383 the University of Oxford was involved in a dispute with St Frideswide's Priory, and Chillenden served as the former's proctor. =As prior= Chillenden's election as prior came after some time as one of the Priory's treasurers. As prior, Chillenden also tried to hold onto partial control of the monasteries's finances, subsuming his role of treasurer into his office of prior. All the monastery's income from, for example, its oblations and manors thus passed through his office, with him allocating a sufficient allowance to meet the expenditure of each obedientary (e.g. cellarer, sacrist). In addition, with the monastery - in the wake of the Black Death - veering between leasing out and directly managing its East Kent manors and leasing them out, he ceased direct management (then true of many, but not all, its manors) and reformed the leasing system, with rents being paid in fixed quantities of stock and grain rather than in money. However, he did not bring so sudden an end to the priory's estates being directly managed as RAL Smith maintains.R. A. L. Smith, Canterbury Cathedral priory: a study in monastic administration (1943) Whilst Chillenden was prior, twenty-four books on canon law and another eleven on civil law were added to the monastery library. One of these was probably the Repertorium sexti libri decretaliumBL, Royal MS 2 C. \\\\- it was previously attributed to Chillenden himself, but was actually written by a monk called John. With this financial control, within a year of election Chillenden had restarted the rebuilding of the nave (paused since Simon Sudbury's murder in 1381). Chillenden also initiated a policy of investment and new construction by the priory. This occurred both in urban areas like Southwark, London (where it bought houses and shops previously belonging to a Robert Little, and built new ones) and Canterbury (creating new buildings in Burgate and Stourstreet, along with a huge new inn called The Chequers, and purchasing a new inn called The Crown), in the priory's rural manors (with new granaries, stables, fulling mills, watermills and barns being built, often with roof tiles, rare at this period), and in the priory itself (with the chapter house restored, a new 903 lb silver-gilt table-altar purchased, and the prior's chapel and residence - among other buildings - extensively improved). A century after Chillenden's death, he was called by John Leland \\"the greatest builder‚Äô among the priors\\".John Leland's Itinerary, 248 As the last prior of Canterbury to attend parliament, Chillenden was summoned to Richard II's 1399 council at Oxford to advise the king on the papal schism, and at another time appointed by Richard as a commissioner in the inquiry on goods belonging to merchants from Gueldres then resident in England. He represented both Christ Church Priory and the English crown at the 1409 Council of Pisa, though five years earlier [1405] he had refused to accept the role of bishop of Rochester, to which he had been elected.

Biography Seymour, third son of Charles Seymour, vicar of Kilronan, County Roscommon, by Beata, daughter of Fergus Langley of Lich Finn, County Tipperary, was born in Ireland on 22 September 1822. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating B.A. in 1844 and LL.D. in 1872. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 12 June 1846, and practised on the northern circuit. By the influence of his father-in-law he was returned to parliament as one of the members for Sunderland in 1852, and his support of the liberal party was rewarded with the recordership of Newcastle in December 1854. On returning to his constituency for re-election he was defeated. In the meantime he had become connected with various commercial undertakings, notably with the Waller Gold-mining Company, of which he was chairman in 1852. His experiences were unfortunate, and in 1858 he had to make an arrangement with his creditors. In 1859 he was called before the benchers of the Middle Temple to answer charges affecting his character as a barrister in connection with some commercial transactions, and on 23 February was censured by the benchers. Seymour disputed the fairness of the decision, but he would not publish the evidence, and he was excluded from the bar mess of the Northern Circuit. He commenced legal proceedings against Mr. Butterworth, the publisher of the Law Magazine, for giving a statement of the case with comments. The trial was heard by Lord-chief-justice Cockburn on 2‚Äì3 December 1862, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff of 40s. In May 1859 Seymour was returned for Southampton, securing conservative support by a pledge not to vote against Derby's government. His failure to observe this promise was commented on by the Morning Herald, and Seymour sought to institute a criminal prosecution of that paper, which was refused by Lord Campbell. Seymour was named a queen's counsel in the county palatine of Lancaster in August 1860, and on 19 February 1861 a queen's counsel for England by Lord Campbell. In the same year he was employed by the government to draw up the Admiralty Reform Act. His views grew gradually more conservative; he contested unsuccessfully Hull in 1857, Southampton in 1865, Nottingham in 1869 and 1870, Stockton in 1880, and South Shields in 1885. By the influence of his political friends he became judge of the county-court circuit No. 1, with his chief court at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in August 1889, and held that appointment at his death, which took place at Tynemouth on 16 March 1895. In February 1894 he was presented with his portrait by C. K. Robinson. He married, on 1 September 1847, Emily, second daughter of Joseph John Wright, solicitor, Sunderland.

Early life Born on November 15, 1906 to farmers, Nikky≈ç had a humble life in a small town. Later in his youth he moved to Tokyo to work, where he began to study several different religions. During his studies he attended a sermon on the Lotus Sutra and became a Buddhist. Rissh≈ç K≈çsei Kai Mr. Niwano had been actively involved with the Buddhist group Reiy≈´kai, and it was then that he encountered Ms. Myoko Naganuma and led her to convert to Reiy≈´kai. In 1938 they both attended a leaders meeting where the leadership of Reiy≈´kai made several comments stating that the Lotus Sutra was outdated. After discussing this matter with each other, they decided that they could not belong to an organization which held this type of view. On March 5, 1938 they founded Rissh≈ç K≈çsei Kai, holding the first meeting in Mr. Niwano's house. Niwano was to be the President and Naganuma to be the vice-president. As the organization grew he gave up his job as a milk man and devoted himself full- time to the ministry. He became involved in interfaith activities and helped to found the World Conference of Religions for Peace in 1970. During this time he became involved in numerous religious and cultural conferences and gatherings, some of which include the Asian Conference on Religion and Peace and the 6th WCRP in Italy, where he presided over the WCRP alongside Pope John Paul II. He also spoke on several occasions as the United Nations calling for world peace and the abolition of nuclear arms. In 1991 he stepped down as president and was succeeded by his eldest son, Nichiko Niwano. Although retired, he continued to participate in interfaith and peace activities. Awards In 1979 he was awarded the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion. In 1992 he was made a Knight Commander with the Silver Star of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by the Vatican. In 1993 Mr. Niwano was awarded the Interfaith Medallion from the International Council of Christians and Jews. Daniel Montgomery quotes that \\"no Buddhist leader in the World has become more widely known or showered with honours than him.\\" Montgomery, Daniel (1991). Fire in the Lotus, The Dynamic Religion of Nichiren. London : Mandala, , page 232. Death and legacy Nikkyo Niwano died on October 4, 1999. He was cremated and some of his ashes were placed in the Precious Stupa of the One Vehicle, a small stupa located on the grounds of the groups headquarters. He is remembered for his interfaith work and his calls for global peace and disarmament. While many people around the world regard him with the highest respect, some criticism occurred shortly after his death regarding the large fortune that he left behind, many claiming that this was un-Buddhist.http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?nn20000907b8.htm Works * Nikky≈ç Niwano (1980).

Following officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he served as a subaltern with the Royal Garrison Artillery during the First World War. He later transferred to the Royal Corps of Signals. In 1926, Norman married Patricia Moyra, eldest daughter of the late Lieutenant Colonel J.H.A. Annesley. During that year, Norman volunteered for reserve service as a pilot with No. 601 (County of London) Squadron in the Auxiliary Air Force, and he later assumed duties as a flight commander. Professional life In 1928, Norman co-founded Airwork Services with Alan Muntz. In 1929, the company opened Heston Aerodrome that was active in private, commercial and military aviation until closure in 1947.Sherwood (1999) In 1931, he was appointed Officer Commanding of No. 601 Squadron. In 1934, he transferred to the Auxiliary Air Force Reserve of Officers in the rank of squadron leader. He later commanded No. 110 Army Co- operation Wing based at RAF Ringway. In 1935, in partnership with architect Graham Dawbarn, Norman founded the consultancy firm of Norman and Dawbarn, responsible for designs of buildings and lay-outs of many municipal airports in the UK and overseas, including those at Gatwick, Birmingham, Ringway, Jersey, and Guernsey. In 1939, Norman succeeded as 2nd Baronet. Second World War In 1940, Norman commanded the Central Landing Establishment based at RAF Ringway. From the early days of the Second World War, he worked in close collaboration with the British Army on developing airborne troops. Norman controlled the air side of the first British paratroop raid on Italy shortly after it entered the war. He not only arranged all the details, but took a personal interest in all the numerous training exercises before the raid, and accompanied the paratroops on the expedition, returning regretfully, he said, in an aircraft, as he was not at that time a proficient parachutist. When he got back, he went on a parachute course. He distinguished himself in Operation Biting, the raid by British parachute troops on the coast of northern France in March 1942, when the radio location post at Bruneval, 12 miles north of Le Havre, was destroyed. It was a combined operation, the carrying force of R.A.F. bombers under Norman's command and led by Wing Commander P. C. Pickard. Norman's final appointment came in 1942, when he was appointed Air Officer Commanding No. 38 Wing. On 19 May 1943, Norman died in the post-crash fire when Lockheed Hudson IIIA FH168 that was to carry him to North Africa force- landed after takeoff from RAF St Eval. Postscript Norman was a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, a member of the Aviation Committee of the London Chamber of Commerce, and a member of the Council of the Air Registration Board, of which body he was also chairman of the Design and Construction Panel. Norman's eldest of three sons was Mark Annesley, born on 8 February 1927, who succeeded him as third baronet. Mark Norman worked for Bristol Siddeley Engines as company secretary. Nigel Norman's second son was Desmond Norman, co-founder of the aircraft manufacturer Britten Norman. Torquil Norman, third of Sir Nigel's sons, founded Bluebird Toys and the Roundhouse Trust.

This is an abundant sponge of coastal areas of the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea ranging from the intertidal zone to a recorded depth of over 550 m. It is also found in the intertidal zone of the coast of the northern part of the North Island of New Zealand. It is very tolerant of a wide range of coastal habitats, including strong currents, high salinity and exposure to powerful wave action. Its only requirement is a rocky substrate which can include small cobbles. Morphology Close-up view. Halichondria panicea occurs in a very wide range of forms and can be difficult to identify. Some forms have a granular surface which gives rise to the common name but sometimes the surface is smooth, even glassy. The surface is often marked with pores (osculae) which can extend into tubular \\"chimneys\\" in wave-sheltered habitats. The overall form is determined largely by the habitat: wave-exposed forms usually form thin widespread sheets but wave-sheltered forms often form massive encrustations up to 20 cm thick. This diversity has led to its being described as a new species 56 times (see below). The colour is also variable. The \\"natural\\" colour is cream or grey: this is usually found in specimens from relatively deep water. However at shallower depths, the sponge is usually green due to symbiotic algae which live close to the surface of the sponge. At intermediate depths the sponge tends to be green in summer, cream or grey in winter. It smells like \\"exploded gunpowder\\". Biology Halichondria panicea is a suspension feeder feeding mainly on phytoplankton. For such a common species, relatively little is known about its reproduction: It appears to be a hermaphrodite and oogenesis has been reported as occurring in a very narrow timeband within a single population although exceptions have been observed. Other names When the World Register of Marine Species was created, it was discovered that no less than 56 Latin names had been assigned to this species over the years, because of confusion caused by the many different forms it might take.

In retirement, he became a research historian, studying the history of broadcasting. Early life Miall was born in London and educated at Bootham SchoolOxford Dictionary of National Biography in York. He learned German at Freiburg University, and read economics and law at St John's College, Cambridge. He was President of the Cambridge Union Society and Editor of the Cambridge Review. BBC career Miall joined the European Service of the BBC in early 1939. He took charge of broadcasts in German until 1942, when was seconded to the Political Warfare Executive and sent to work on psychological warfare in New York City and San Francisco. He returned to London in 1944, and then worked in the Psychological Warfare Division of SHAEF in Luxembourg. He returned to the BBC in 1945, and was briefly a special correspondent in Czechoslovakia. He became the BBC's American correspondent from 1945 to 1953, covering nearly all of the Harry Truman's presidency, and the first year of Dwight D. Eisenhower's. Although based in Washington, D.C., he visited all of the then 48 U.S. states. His radio broadcasts made his voice a familiar feature of BBC news coverage. In June 1947, he reported a speech at Harvard by George Marshall, on reconstruction in Europe. Ernest Bevin, then British Foreign Secretary, heard the broadcast, and was spurred to press ahead with what became the Marshall Plan for the nations of Europe to rebuild their economies after the war. When Miall returned to London, he served as head of \\"television talks\\" - documentaries and current affairs - at BBC television from 1954, assisted by Grace Wyndham Goldie and based at Lime Grove. During that period, programmes such as Monitor, Tonight and The Sky at Night were created; Panorama was relaunched; and David Attenborough began his wildlife broadcasting career. Miall was promoted to assistant controller at the BBC in 1961, in charge of the planning for the new BBC television channel, BBC2, which began broadcasting in 1964. He was appointed OBE in 1961. After a period as Assistant Controller for Programme Services, Television, Miall returned to America in 1966 to run the BBC's New York office, in charge of editing news coverage and also selling BBC costume dramas to American television channels.

He was a minor figure at the Grand Ducal Medici court. Early life Antonio with his mother Bianca, by Alessandro Allori. Antonio was born under obscure conditions during the lifetime of Francesco I de' Medici's legitimate consort, who died in childbirth in April 1578. The grand duke secretly married his mistress Bianca Cappello only two months later, before celebrating a public wedding in 1579, after the official mourning period. The very existence of the infant was not publicly acknowledged until he was almost three years old, but from the moment he was brought into the court, he was raised as the legitimate heir to Tuscany. During his father's lifetime no doubts were raised either of his paternity, or of Francesco's intention that he should succeed him. Francesco legitimated Antonio and in 1584 he obtained implicit approval from Philip II of Spain, who was the overlord of Siena, that the legitimated Antonio was to rule. Francesco's younger brother, had been designated for the Church, rising to the rank of Cardinal. Later life Within hours of Francesco's death on 18 October 1587, Bianca Cappello was dead, too, poisoned, it was thought, at the direction of the Cardinal, who now set aside his orders and took up rule as Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Bianca Cappello had recently undergone a false pregnancy, in 1586, which encouraged Cardinal Ferdinando to create a story that Bianca's pregnancy in 1576 had been a false one, too, and that Antonio was the son of a serving girl who had been smuggled into the bed. As a magnanimous gesture, the former cardinal conferred some substantial property on the youth and induced him to take the clerical habit of the Knights of Malta, which would preclude any further heirs with substantial claims to the Medici inheritance. Thus at eighteen, Antonio joined the Knights of Malta; he fought the Ottoman Turks in Hungary in 1594-95 and soon contracted syphilis; he served in various ambassadorial capacities, and satisfied his pleasure in the hunt, and in music and theater. His virtuoso interests in alchemy and other scientific concerns, pursued on his property at the Casino Mediceo di San Marco of Florence, brought him into contact with Galileo. His mistress from Lucca presented him with three sons, to the disapproval of the Medici court; but he managed to have them legitimated by Pope Paul V and recognized by Grand Duke Cosimo. Antonio died in modest retirement in 1621, having withdrawn from the court after 1614. Issue He had three sons by his wife, Artemisa Tozzi (born in Lucca), 1590-1643: * Paolo (1616 - 1656), a military. * Giulio (1617 - 1670), a priest. * Anton Francesco (1618 - 1659) Antonio also had two illegitimate daughters: * Maria (¬ø?), a nun at Santissima Annunziata. * Maddalena (1610-?), daughter of a Bolognese woman.

Early Bronze Age cultures in Poland began around 2300‚Äì2400 BCE,Various authors, ed. Marek Derwich and Adam ≈ªurek, U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski (do roku 1038) (Foundations of Poland (until year 1038)), Wydawnictwo Dolno≈õlƒÖskie, Wroc≈Çaw 2002, , p. 55, S≈Çawomir Kadrow while the Iron Age commenced in approximately 700‚Äì750 BCE.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 68, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga The Iron Age archeological cultures no longer existed by the start of the Common Era. The subject of the ethnicity and linguistic affiliation of the groups living in Central Europe at that time is, given the absence of written records, speculative, and accordingly there is considerable disagreement. In Poland the Lusatian culture, spanning both the Bronze and Iron Ages, became particularly prominent. The most famous archeological finding from that period is the Biskupin fortified settlement (gord) on the lake from which it takes its name, representing the Lusatian culture of the early Iron Age.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 54‚Äì85 The Bronze Age in Poland consisted of Period I (early), 2300 to 1600 BC; Period II (older), 1600 to 1350 BC; Period III (middle), 1350 to 1100 BC; Period IV (younger), 1100 to 900 BC; Period V (late), 900 to 700 BC. The Early Iron Age included Hallstatt Period C, 700 to 600 BC, and Hallstatt Period D, 600 to 450 BC. Bronze items present in Poland around 2300 BC were brought through the Carpathian Basin. The native Early Bronze Age that followed was dominated by the innovative Unetice culture in western Poland, and by the conservative Mierzanowice culture in the east. Those were replaced in their respective territories, for the duration of the second, the Older Bronze Period, by the (pre-Lusatian) Tumulus culture and the Trzciniec culture. Characteristic of the remaining bronze periods were the Urnfield cultures; within their range skeletal burials had been replaced by cremation of bodies throughout much of Europe. In Poland the Lusatian culture settlements dominated the landscape for nearly a thousand years, continuing into and including the Early Iron Age. A series of Scythian invasions, beginning in the 6th century BC, precipitated the demise of the Lusatian culture. The Hallstatt Period D was the time of expansion of the Pomeranian culture, while the Western Baltic Kurgans culture occupied the Masuria-Warmia region of contemporary Poland.Kalendarium dziej√≥w Polski (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, p. 10‚Äì11, Jacek PoleskiU ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 54‚Äì83, S≈Çawomir Kadrow, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga  Unetice and other Bronze Age cultures  = Unetice culture = The Bronze Age in Poland, as well as elsewhere in central Europe, begins with the innovative Unetice culture, in existence in Silesia and a part of Greater Poland during the first period of this era, that is from before 2200 to 1600 BC. This settled agricultural society's origins consisted of the conservative traditions inherited from the Corded Ware populations and dynamic elements of the Bell-Beaker people. Significantly, the Unetice people cultivated contacts with the highly developed cultures of the Carpathian Basin, through whom they had trade links with the cultures of early Greece. Their culture also echoed inspiring influence coming all the way from the most highly developed at that time civilizations of the Middle East. Characteristic of the Unetice societies was greater general affluence and developed social stratification, compared with Late Neolithic cultures. Objects made of bronze, often of luxurious or prestigious nature, were in high demand as symbols of power and importance and are typically found in the graves of \\"princes\\". Fourteen such burial sites, circular mounds of earth heaped up on top of wooden, clay and stone structures, some as large as 30 meters in diameter, were found in ≈Åƒôki Ma≈Çe near Grodzisk Wielkopolski, erected 2000‚Äì1800 BC, suggesting the existence of a local dynasty. Proliferation of locally-made bronze items (Uneticean daggers were in high demand all over Europe and in Anatolia) far from the centers of ore mining or bronze craftsmanship shows that the elites were able to control the trade routes, which also involved the transportation of amber from the Baltic Sea shores to Aegean Sea area artisans. Many concealed (for unknown reasons) bronze treasures have been found, including a fine one from Pilszcz near G≈Çubczyce.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 60‚Äì61, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga Stylistically refined Uneticean ceramics show inspiration from the Achaean vessels obtained through trade. Fortified settlements were built; one actively researched site, that was utilized and went through a number of phases during the 2000‚Äì1500 BC period, is in Bruszczewo in Ko≈õcian County.Archeologia ≈ªywa (Living Archeology) quarterly, Warsaw, issue 3-4(29-30)2004, Bruszczewo... by Janusz Czebreszuk, Johannes Muller Remains of settlements and cemeteries were discovered around Wroc≈Çaw and elsewhere in Lower Silesia, including an amber processing workshop in Nowa Wie≈õ, Boles≈Çawiec County.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 55‚Äì56, S≈Çawomir Kadrow The nature of the weapons and other items found at Unetice sites suggests a chronic state of warfare and the emergence of a warrior class. At the forefront of civilization in its time and place, the Unetice culture eventually succumbed to social and economic deterioration; its demise may have been hastened by destructive raids waged by the warriors of the belligerent Burial Mound culture, which in the end replaced it.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 56, S≈Çawomir Kadrow = Iwno culture = The Iwno culture, named after Iwno near Szubin, was a contemporary of the Unetice culture. Located in Kujawy, eastern (Gda≈Ñsk) Pomerania and northeastern Greater Poland, it was influenced by the Unetice culture, from where their bronze items were imported, and had many common traits with the Mierzanowice culture (see below). Iwno thin-walled clay vessels were carefully finished and domestic animal rising was important for the economy.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 55, 214‚Äì215; Piotr Kaczanowski, Janusz Krzysztof Koz≈Çowski - Najdawniejsze dzieje ziem polskich (do VII w.)

These people, culturally also descendants of the Corded Ware culture, at first lived as mobile cattle breeders, but around 2200 BC started building permanent settlements and engaged in agriculture as well. Mierzanowice culture was a conservative society, frequently still using stone tools and reserving copper for decorations. The Plesz√≥w group of the Mierzanowice culture originated the most significant of the Polish Bronze Age fortified settlements, located in Trzcinica near Jas≈Ço. It was constructed on a particularly suitable, elevated natural location, with the initial enclosed area of 0.6 hectares. It remained in continuous use from about 2100 to 1300 BC and is often dubbed the Carpathian Troy or the Troy of the North. The area has been a site of archeological explorations for the past hundred years, but only the more recent investigations uncovered its true significance in terms of the understanding of the early Bronze Age developments in central Europe. 30,000 Plesz√≥w group artifacts have been unearthed, including exceptionally well-made ornamented pottery and weaving equipment. Some of the objects recovered, as well as the nature of the defensive structures, reveal the Plesz√≥w group's contacts with the Carpathian Basin peoples and the resulting influence coming from their cultures. = Strzy≈º√≥w culture = Of the same cultural sphere as Mierzanowice, still further east was the Strzy≈º√≥w culture, named after the village near Hrubiesz√≥w. Ottom√°ny cottages c. 1650 BC, Trzcinica (2016) Stretch of the Otomani-Fuzesabony earthwork, road and gatehouse in Carpathian Troy Open-Air Archaeological Museum (2016) = Otomani-F√ºzesabony culture = Highly advanced Otomani-F√ºzesabony culture people arrived in Trzcinica area around 1650 BC, coming from the regions south of the Carpathian Mountains, and took over the settlement developed earlier by the Plesz√≥w group, as they were settling the Wis≈Çoka River drainage area. They assimilated the local population and created a more powerful stronghold by rebuilding and expanding with remarkable engineering ingenuity the existing structure. The Otomani people left over 60,000 identified relics (including, unlike those of the Mierzanowice people, numerous luxury bronze items), many of which are a manifestation of their close ties with the Mediterranean area cultures ‚Äì whence the \\"Troy connection\\". The Trzcinica fortress was burned, rebuilt and expanded again (to 2 hectares), and after 1350 BC abandoned for over two thousand years. The settlement was repopulated by the Slavs who around 770‚Äì780 CE built a massive gord here. The above cultures constitute the first (early) period of the Bronze Age in Poland, ca. 2300 to 1600 BC. = Trzciniec culture = Throughout their range and beyond, the Mierzanowice and Strzy≈º√≥w cultures (and the more southern part of the Iwno culture) were replaced by the Trzciniec culture. It was named after Trzciniec near Pu≈Çawy and lasted from 1700 to 1100 BC, that is throughout the second and third periods of the Bronze Age. It was probably made up of diverse post-Neolithic populations, whose common characteristic was the type of pottery ‚Äì large vessels with a thickened upper edge and a horizontal decorative protrusion around the neck, first found around northern Germany at the beginning of the millennium. Their own production of bronze objects came late and only in the western part of this culture's range.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 58, S≈Çawomir Kadrow A kurgan burial site of the Trzciniec culture, in use from the 15th to the early 12th century BC was preserved in Dacharz√≥w near Sandomierz. The central bottom part of the structure consists of two adjacent rectangular stone burial chambers with wooden floors. The larger one contains the bones of several women and children, the smaller one the cremated remains of one older man. Clay pots and copper decorations were also present. The chambers were covered by wooden construction supporting stone slanting walls/roofs, the whole structure being covered by a large (12‚Äì13 meters in diameter) earth mound. In addition to this oldest part ‚Äì the main burial of an apparent tribal chief and his family, there are newer peripheral graves at the edge of the kurgan and items indicating a prolonged cemetery and local cult use of this burial complex.Co kryjƒÖ kurhany by Marek Florek, Archeologia ≈ªywa 1(10)1999 issue Small scale and sparse settlement areas with more primitive crafts were thought to be characteristic of the Trzciniec culture period and distribution. However a comprehensive, long-functioning a well-developed complex has been found near Polesie, ≈Åowicz County, with objects carbon-dated from 1530 to 1210 BC. The utilized living space, a complete \\"microcosm\\", had the area of 17 hectares, bordered by two streams, with fields, animal quarters and workshops. Cattle and pigs were kept, while the farmers cultivated oats, wheat and barley and caused devastation of the natural environment surroundings. Skeletons examined indicate that many residents suffered from tooth decay. Among the many thousand stone remnants discovered there are ceremonial staffs (maces) with a wooden handle, indicating influence from the distant Mesopotamia and the East in general. Melting and processing of bronze took place and salt was imported from regions further south. The main identified burial site was actively and repeatedly utilized for generations, bodies rearranged, the grave dug in the ground being covered by a mound five meters in diameter.Epoka brƒÖzu pod autostradƒÖ (Bronze Era under a highway) by Krzysztof Kowalski, Rzeczpospolita internet edition, October 1, 2009 = Tumulus culture = Proto-Lusatian Tumulus or Burial Mound culture of Danubian origin thrived in western Polish lands during the 1700‚Äì1400 BC period, and contributed to the birth and rise of the Urnfield cultures.Jerzy Wyrozumski ‚Äì Historia Polski do roku 1505, p. 62 Around 1400 BC it was replaced by the most important of them ‚Äì the Lusatian culture. Burial Mound culture again was a complex of cultures, which replaced the Unetice culture and had an earth and stone mound grave as their common trait. The burials are skeletal, as opposed to the cremation practices of the later Urnfield cultures. There are no substantial settlements left by the Burial Mound people, whose agricultural practices were apparently limited mostly to animal husbandry. They developed bronze metallurgy to a large extent, satisfying their own needs for weapons and richly designed and executed decorations. Their dominant social class were the warriors, who were equal and were the only men entitled to a tumulus burial.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 58‚Äì59, S≈Çawomir Kadrow = Piliny culture = The Piliny culture (1500‚Äì1200 BC, roughly the third or middle period of the Bronze Age) of Hungary and Slovakia, and also southern Lesser Poland, where like others they left bronze treasures, is an early example of the Urnfield cultures. These cultures' burial customs involved cremation of bodies and placing the ashes in urns (often with small apertures, presumably for the soul to escape). The urns were buried without a mound, sometimes forming huge cemeteries with thousands of such graves.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 62‚Äì63, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga  Lusatian culture of the later Bronze Age  = General characteristics = Lusatian culture artifacts at the Bielsko-Bia≈Ça Museum in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça. Among the earthenware is the so-called \\"clay pancake\\". The Lusatian culture lasted on Polish lands from 1450 to 250 BC, through the remainder of the Bronze Age (middle and late periods) and then into the Iron Age, from 750 BC on. Although archeologically it presents itself in a fairly uniform way, it is believed to have been ethnically non-homogeneous, originating in the interplay between groups arriving from outside and populations in existence in Poland, in which new cultural patterns were adopted. The east-west cultural disparity continued: For example, the use of metal objects was less common in the eastern regions, while in the western zone besides the urns the burials contained often many other vessels. The western zone ceramics of the early Lusatian period had very prominent protuberances around the lower part of the container. These regional differences became even more pronounced with time. A number of smaller Lusatian subcultures are distinguished, such as the one in Upper Silesia, where after a 250-year hiatus, beginning at about 900 BC, atypically for the Urnfield cultural sphere, skeletal burials are found again. = Settlements, economic activities, crafts and social organization = Bronze Age Lusatian rural settlements were limited to low-lying areas and until late in this period lacked fortifications or other defensive measures; during these more peaceful times protection was not as essential as in the centuries to follow. The houses were made of beams insulated by clay or moss, supported by poles, with slanting roofs covered by straw or reed. Inside there were hearths, stools, beds, places for economic activity such as metallurgical production shops, vertical looms and hand-operated mills. Some livestock were also kept inside, and some were culled before winter because of insufficient ability to store feed. The materials used were still wood, horn and bone, and, especially in the eastern zone, stone. Women were commonly engaged in spinning and weaving, for clay weaving implements and workshops were found within the unearthed settlements.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 64‚Äì65, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga Pottery was still produced without the potter's wheel and kilns specialized for baking pots were just making their first appearance. During the late Bronze Age specialized centers manufactured beautifully painted ceramics, much of it for sale. Bronze metallurgy and craftsmanship became also highly developed and acquired locally different styles ‚Äì luxurious decorative items, tools and arms were made around Legnica and elsewhere in western and southern Poland. Lusatian social organization was based on the family and extended family, although early tribal communities may have also been developing. Social, professional and trade groups were gradually forming, including warriors, priests and metallurgists, but there is no evidence of a hereditary ruling class or other social elites. Lusatian settlements in central Poland (≈Å√≥d≈∫ area) were small (4‚Äì5 families) and short-lived, no more than half a century at the same location, probably because the soil was no longer usable after intensive exploitation through a couple of generations. The exception is a huge settlement in Kowalewice, Zgierz County, from the late Bronze Age, lasting into the Hallstatt period. A treasure of unique in Poland bronze and iron personal ornaments dated 8th century BC, stylistically related to finds from northern as well as southern Europe, was discovered on the edge of a settlement in Aleksandrowice, Krak√≥w County, an area of extensive Lusatian settlement activity. = Solar cult and cult related art = Many objects recovered by archeologists are believed to be related to a cult of the sun and the solar deity. Those include ceramics with painted solar images and molded into bird figures, bronze wheeled mini-carts with animal ornaments and bronze clasps with bird images, probably worn as parts of a ceremonial robe by priests-sorcerers. Anthropomorphic figurines and zoomorphic containers and plates related to solar or other forms of cult are found in the Lusatian western zone; they come from the last centuries of the Bronze Age and continue into the Iron Age. Engraved on a vase-urn found in ≈Åazy in Milicz County and dated 850‚Äì650 BC are representations of mythical deer-man figures. Some such vessels, jewelry and drawings have their contemporary counterparts in Assyria, ancient Israel, Archaic Greece and Etruria, which shows the breadth of Lusatian trade and other contacts. A panpipe (syrinx), a musical instrument of the type popular in northern Italy and eastern Hallstatt circles, was found in a grave in Przeczyce near Zawiercie from the late bronze or early iron periods.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 66‚Äì67, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga  Lusatian culture of the early Iron Age  = Changing conditions and regional relations = Several factors destabilized the situation at the outset of the Iron Age. Climate cooling caused a degradation of the Asian steppes which forced the nomadic people who lived there to move out and started a chain of consequences ‚Äì horsemen from the steppe armed with iron weapons were able to penetrate large areas of Europe. The Europeans responded by building large fortified settlements, adopting the warring methods of the Asian invaders, developing a specialized military caste and a strong power system based on a prince-ruler. The Hallstatt culture, which developed west and south of Poland, itself imitating the Mediterranean civilizations and cultivating close contacts with them, turned out to be a major influence on the Lusatian people on Polish lands, whose culture reached its peak during the 750‚Äì550 BC period. Baltic amber was traded in return for weapons and luxurious objects from southern Europe, including fancy personal grooming items such as nail clipping devices, and trade relations with the Nordic area peoples were similarly well developed, notably in western Pomerania, which had increasingly been falling under the Nordic cultural zone (southern Scandinavian Peninsula, Denmark and northern Germany) influence throughout the Later Bronze Age, when its artisans imitated the Nordic imports. = Lusatian culture of the Hallstatt periods = The Lusatian culture of the Hallstatt periods included most lands of present- day Poland, including the related Bia≈Çowice culture (Zielona G√≥ra County) in some of the westernmost parts, contemporaneous with Hallstatt C and D and later and credited with the passing of a \\"cist\\" (rock encasement) grave type to the Pomeranian culture. Western Poland was more highly developed, with local manufacturing; jewelry and other decorative products made of iron, bronze, glass, amber and other materials as well as luxurious painted ceramics were patterned after the Hallstatt craft. In many graveyards the dead were buried in wooden chambers. The burials found in Gorszewice (Szamotu≈Çy County) in Greater Poland (650‚Äì550 BC) are supplied with fancy equipment and resemble the graves of the Hallstatt tribal chiefs; similarly there are other treasures of luxurious and prestigious objects.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 68‚Äì73 and 81, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga Large scale excavation of Lusatian settlements influenced by the Alpine region of the Hallstatt culture took place in Wroc≈Çaw County. There at Stary ≈ölesz√≥w and Milejowice parts of the settlements are separated from the rest by a solid palisade fence, possibly enclosing the dwellings of the emerging local elite. At the Nowy ≈ölesz√≥w settlement a residential and industrial zones could be clearly distinguished, the latter one including kilns for pottery baking and smelting furnaces for ironworks. A necropolis in Domas≈Çaw functioned from 1300 to 400 BC and over 3000 graves have been discovered there. Over 80 Hallstatt type rich burials are among them. Objects recovered point to extensive trading contacts with the south of the Alps and Mediterranean regions. Because of the evidence acquired, some investigators now believe that the large center in Wroc≈Çaw County and other early Iron Age settlements in Lower Silesia represent the Hallstatt, rather than Lusatian culture.AutostradƒÖ do przesz≈Ço≈õci czyli tajemnice A4 by Beata Maciejewska, Gazeta Wyborcza, Wroc≈Çaw web site, Oct, 29, 2009 Despite this apparent fascination with the lifestyles of the western elites (and to some degree creation of their own), the Lusatian people never acquired a comparable level of social stratification and there were no hereditary \\"princes\\". = Economic activities = Agricultural activities remained the mainstay of the economy, supplemented as before by hunting and gathering. Simple wooden scratch-plows were already used, pulled by oxen. Millet, wheat, rye, oats and barley were grown in field systems, while in the gardens bean and lentil were cultivated, as well as oil-producing poppy, turnips and flax, whose fiber made linen thread. Animal husbandry methods improved when iron utensils became more common, that is beginning in the 6th century BC. Horses were bred and utilized more often, in addition to the traditionally kept cattle, swine, sheep and goats, and improved feed storage allowed keeping the herds throughout the winter season. Salt springs were used for salt production. In Wieliczka area in particular salt was being manufactured already during the Bronze Age, with large scale extraction taking place during the Hallstatt periods. In southern Poland the Lusatians tried to exploit the locally available metal ores. = Construction of fortified settlements and Scythian invasions = Beginning around 900 BC the Lusatian people gradually fortified their settlements, first in the Silesia region. By 650‚Äì600 BC there were quite a few of them there and all over the western zone. Often built in locations naturally easy to defend, they were surrounded by walls made of earth, stone and wood, and moats, and could cover anywhere from 0.5 to 20 hectares. Smaller strongholds were built at strategic locations such as mountain passes and trade routes, where the residents could control and police the area. The strongholds also functioned as industrial centers; a good example of a trade-manufacturing fortified settlement is the one in Komor√≥w, located near the Gorszewice cemetery. Some of the large fortified areas didn't have many structures inside and served probably as temporary sanctuaries for the local population at times of danger. Beginning in the 6th century several waves of Scythian invasions went through the Polish lands. The routes they traveled can be seen from the trail of the burnt-out Lusatian settlements they left. Dramatic material testimony of violent death and destruction was found among the ashes of a perished fortified settlement in Wicina near Nowogr√≥d Bobrza≈Ñski. On the other hand, a golden Scythian treasure was discovered near a Lusatian settlement in Witaszkowo near Gubin ‚Äì elements of arms and decorations patterned after zoomorphic Greek art motifs and dated 550 BC, probably booty seized from a fallen Scythian chief.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 74‚Äì75, 81‚Äì82, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga = Biskupin = The reconstructed Biskupin fortified settlement. As shown by dendrochronology research, the majority of trees used for the construction were cut in winter of 738/737 BC.PoczƒÖtki Polski w nowym ≈õwietle (The beginnings of Poland in new perspective) by Tomasz Jasi≈Ñski, p. 11. The Polish Academy of Sciences, Portal Wiedzy www.portalwiedzy.pan.pl \\"Nauka\\", April 2007 Of a different and far less common type is the famous, very well preserved Biskupin wooden stronghold on the lake, in use from about 750 to 500 BC, when rising water levels forced the inhabitants to abandon the settlement.Large Salvage Excavations in Poland by Jerzy GƒÖssowski, Archeologia ≈ªywa (Living Archeology), special English issue 2005 The houses (almost a hundred, enough to room about one thousand settlers) inside the walls were densely and regularly arranged in long rows.Jerzy Wyrozumski ‚Äì Historia Polski do roku 1505, p. 66 There were eleven parallel streets covered by wood ‚Äì the whole structure is seen by some as a proto-urban imitation of the Mediterranean cities. But the dwellings were all alike, indicating a lack of significant social distinction within the Lusatian community. This site, central to Polish archeology, has been under active and intense research since 1934. The descendants of the Biskupin residents, like of most Lusatian people, were very likely incorporated into the Pomeranian culture, and with it eventually into the Germanic mainstream.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 348 = Decline of the Lusatian culture = In the 5th century the Lusatians stopped building fortified settlements. The Scythian expansion severed their trade links with the Hallstatt societies, while climatic changes damaged their agriculture. All this forced them to disperse and caused disintegration of their social structures. Less developed population from the eastern zone migrated west, highly developed ceramic and metallurgic industries waned, the Pomeranian culture expanded into the previously Lusatian areas. By the 4th century BC the Lusatian culture was for the most part gone, with the last, small populations surviving in western and southern Poland.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 81‚Äì82, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga  Pomeranian culture, Western Baltic Kurgans culture  = Pomeranian culture = Pomeranian face urns This article's last major culture covering most Polish lands, the Pomeranian culture, developed in the 7th century BC in eastern Pomerania. This region had preserved a distinct cultural identity throughout the middle and late Bronze Age; unlike the rest of the Lusatian lands they kept the custom of raising burial mounds or barrows above the graves. Those were covered by a layer of stones and the urns were placed in a chest, or cist built of rock pieces. At the outset of the Iron Age the eastern Pomeranians became involved in long distance amber trade that ranged from the Sambian Peninsula, through Pomerania, the Lusatian and Hallstatt lands all the way to Italy. The amber trade gave them access to imported products. At roughly the same time climatic changes favored a rural economy different from that typical of the Lusatian societies. Animal husbandry and the less demanding cereals (rye and barley) became more important, as the villages had to be built at higher altitudes (because of climatically elevated water tables and environmental exploitation of the lowland settlement areas).U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 82, Bogus≈Çaw Gediga This in turn favored small communities based on the family and extended family, flexible and capable of greater mobility. All such factors gave the Pomeranian people a competitive advantage over the traditional Lusatian settlements. = Pomeranian burials and urns = Accordingly, the large Lusatian urn fields were replaced by small, family size burial sites with several or more urns. The cist graves were now mostly flat, without mounds, forming a rectangle with up to two meter-long sides built of vertical slabs, containing the urns (sometimes as many as thirty and in separate compartments) inside and covered with another slab. Further south and east, as the Pomeranian culture expanded into central and southeastern Poland, there were also burials where the urn was placed under a globe or cloche, that is inside a large, spherical ceramic container, itself sometimes placed in a cist; areas with this arrangement are sometimes recognized as a distinct subculture (Cloche Grave culture). Two types of funerary urns are peculiar to the Pomeranians, house-urns and face-urns. House-urns stand on several legs, have a large opening in front, come from an earlier period, the 7‚Äì6th century BC and mostly from the Lƒôbork region. Face-urns from the same period are round, bulging containers with a unique and often realistic image of a face around the neck area and a hat-like lid, while the later ones tend to be less elaborate. Sometimes on the outside they were variously decorated, with tools and toilet accessories placed inside. Face-urns from the 650‚Äì450 BC period unearthed in Borucino, Kartuzy County and elsewhere present a rich assortment of engraved narrative scenes. Those include horse-drawn chariots that apparently depict the nightly trips of the sun-god through the underworlds, which symbolically represents the cyclical renewal of life; carts pulled by oxen and representing lunar symbolism are also present. Solar images were placed on the lids. House- and face-urns are believed to represent Etruscan influence. = Pomeranian economy = thumb200pxEarly Iron Age: Nordic Bronze Age Jastorf culture Harpstedt-Nienburg group Celtic groups Pomeranian culture House urns culture East Baltic culture West Baltic cairns culture Milogrady culture estonic group Pomeranian rural economy was based on small, open settlements. Their livestock included horses and many dogs. Plowing was done with all wooden (bare) spatula-plows, which required multiple runs. The Pomeranians cultivated several different grains and practiced fishery. Bronze and iron processing became very highly developed. Of the weapons, tools, decorative items and jewelry manufactured, the large bronze necklaces made of many rings, running around the neck and upper chest area, connected by a latticed buckle in the back (600‚Äì450 BC) are especially impressive. Advanced bronze metallurgy facilities were found at Juszkowo near Pruszcz Gda≈Ñski. At Pruszcz itself an amber processing workshop was found ‚Äì the material used was imported from Sambia. At the iron works material obtained from the local ore deposits (G√≥ry ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie) was most likely used. Another highly developed craft was pottery, which found its highest expression in the above described face-urns. = Expansion and decline of the Pomeranian culture = The already existing Pomeranian culture expanded further when the Lusatian culture entered the crisis stage. In the 5th century BC major acquisitions took place in the western and southern directions, when northern Silesia and Lesser Poland were taken over. The older Lusatian populations were pushed out or assimilated. The Pomeranians themselves were changing in the process, either as a result of encountering new environmental conditions, or because of being influenced by the Lusatian people (face-urns for example disappeared here). In the 3rd century the Pomeranian culture in its original form mostly vanished, with regional enclaves only surviving till the middle of the 2nd century BC. = Western Baltic Kurgans culture = The Western Baltic Kurgans culture existed in Masuria, Warmia, Sambia and northern Masovia during the 650‚Äì50 BC period. It originated partially from the people who migrated there from the Dnieper River area and assimilated elements of the Warmian-Masurian Lusatian branches (themselves preceded by the middle Bronze Age Sambian Kurgans culture), as well as of the old forest zone cultures. They were related in a number of ways, including funeral vessels, to their contemporary, the Pomeranian culture. Upon radial stone structures they built burial mounds ‚Äì kurgans, or barrows, some of them quite large and containing a number of individual burials. A large kurgan site from the 3rd century BC was located and investigated in Pi√≥rkowo in Braniewo County. The dead were cremated and the ashes placed in urns. They built small fortified settlements at naturally suitable places, such as hilltops, and characteristically, within shallow bodies of water, which involved sinking logs and special pile construction. Underwater exploration allowed a conceptual reconstruction of such settlement (3rd‚Äì2nd century BC) on Orzysz Lake near Orzysz in Pisz County. The Western Baltic Kurgans economy was traditional, based on animal husbandry (herds kept in a semi-wild state). Land tilling was done to a lesser extent and only later in this culture's history. Hunting, fishing and gathering were also important. Tool manufacturing was old-fashioned, mostly non-metallic. Ceramic containers often had round (semi-spherical) bottoms and modest punctured or engraved ornamentation. The Western Baltic Kurgans culture is the predecessor culture of the Western Balt culture (cultural sphere of Western Baltic tribes), which developed during the first several centuries CE.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, Synchronization of archeological cultures, p. 214‚Äì217 by Adam ≈ªurek and chronology tables p. 222‚Äì225 by Wojciech Mrozowicz and Adam ≈ªurek used throughout the article  See also  * Prehistory of Poland (until 966) * Stone Age Poland * Poland in Antiquity * Poland in the Early Middle Ages * Nordic Bronze Age * Hallstatt culture * Pre-Roman Iron Age Notes a.The Trzcinica site is being restored and developed as The Carpathian Troy Open-Air Archaeological Museum References Further reading * Various authors, ed.

On the contrary to the beneficial roles that LIPG plays within the body, endothelial lipase is thought of to play a potential role in cancer and inflammation. Knowledge obtained in vitro and in vivo suggest the relations to these conditions, but human interaction knowledge lacks due to the recent discovery of endothelial lipase. Endothelial lipase was first characterized in 1999. The two independent research groups which are notable for this discovery cloned the endothelial lipase gene and identified the novel lipase secreted from endothelial cells. The anti-Atherosclerosis opportunity through alleviating plaque blockage and prospective ability to raise High-density lipoprotein (HDL) have gained endothelial lipase recognition.  Discovery  229x229px In 1999, the identification of endothelial lipase was independently discovered by two research groups. The first group at Rhone-Poulenc Rorer cloned and characterized a new member of the triacylglyerol (TG) family. When this novel endothelial lipase was over-expressed in mice, the concentrations of HDL Cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I in plasma decreased. A second group at Stanford University independently cloned this same endothelial lipase from human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human coronary artery endothelial cells and rodent endothelial-like yolk sacs. Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to isolate the genes. The genes were then compared and aligned. Two cDNA fragments expressed the lipase gene and endothelial properties. Northern blot analysis documented the samples. The suggested relation to metabolism and vascular disease was attributed to tissue selective expression in endothelial cells.  Structure  Endothelial lipase is a protein that belongs triglyceride lipase category. This protein is encoded by the LIPG gene. Endothelial lipase is secreted from vascular endothelial cells, being the only lipase to date. The primary secretion is that of a 55kDa protein which is secreted to a 68kDa protein after post-translational Glycosylation. LIPG functions as it binds to Proteoglycans. LIPG also has the potential for additional cleavage. The additional cleavage would result in inactivity of the 40 kDa protein N-terminal 40 kDa and 28 kDa C-terminal. LIPG has the capability to form a protein dimer prior to secretion which causes dimerization to appear. The addition reaction of the same compound and molecules enhances the resistance to cleavage and limited activity is sustained. Triglyceride Structure  Biological Function  Lipid Metabolism = Metabolism = The site of endothelial lipase enzymatic activity is the surface of endothelial cells. LIPG regulates lipoprotein metabolism through the hydrolysis of HDL phospholipds. This high-density lipoprotein is an amphipathic lipid, meaning the lipid is composed of both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic component. Cholesterol has a four-ring structure and is an isoprenoid-based hydrocarbon. Although cholesterol lacks the phosphate head group, cholesterol's hydroxyl component interacts with water, categorizing cholesterol as amphipathic. HDL cholesterol provides extreme benefits to the body and is vital in sustaining the fluidity of natural membranes. HDL cholesterol must be maintained at a certain level to ensure normal cell growth and reproduction. The HDL capability of absorption of cholesterol and transport to the liver, aids in the removal of cholesterol in the body. On the contrary, Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol works in opposition. LDL cholesterol does not transport cholesterol out of the body but rather serves as a foundation for cholesterol buildup. LDL should be kept low in the body to avoid cholesterol buildup in arteries. When HDL are hydrolyzed, the turnover rate of HDL increases and cholesterol levels in plasma decrease. This hydrolysis allows for the acceleration or continuation of cholesterol removal from the body to avoid a buildup. Following the hydrolysis of HDL, free fatty acid lipid precursors are taken up. These lipids are then utilized in other phospholipid catabolism. In summation, endothelial lipase is said to be a pivotal component in metabolism through high-density lipoprotein hydrolysis. d = Vascular Biology = Endothelial lipase is linked to potential treatment and improvement of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a vascular disease which is caused by arterial plaque buildup. Cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other components contribute to the formation of plaque in the blood. Plaque is detrimental to vascular heath because it narrows and stiffens the arteries, causing a lack of oxygen-rich blood flow. HDL increase serves as a treatment for atherosclerosis. The hydrolysis of HDL leads to the transportation of cholesterol to the liver. The filtration system of the liver aids in the removal of cholesterol from the body. Therefore, the cholesterol level in the plasma will decrease. Thus, endothelial lipase synthesis of HDL could provide an adequate opportunity to increase HDL levels. Data suggests that endothelial lipase inhibition should increase the plasma HDL, primarily in patients with low HDL-C levels. An increased risk of atherosclerosis is associated with low levels of HDL. Although a functional correlation can be drawn, there is little clinical evidence to provide support to the suggested potential benefits in vascular pathophysiology.

These people are identified as Slavic, Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, Thracian, Avar, and Scythian tribes. Other groups, which are difficult to identify, were most likely also present, as the ethnic compositions of archeological cultures are often poorly recognized. While lacking use of a written language to any appreciable degree, many of them developed relatively advanced material culture and social organization, as evidenced by the archeological record; for example, richly furnished, \\"princely\\" dynastic graves. Characteristic of the period was a high rate of geographical migration of large groups of people, even the equivalents of modern nations.Various authors, ed. Marek Derwich and Adam ≈ªurek, U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski (do roku 1038) (Foundations of Poland (until year 1038)), Wydawnictwo Dolno≈õlƒÖskie, Wroc≈Çaw 2002, , p. 86‚Äì121 This article covers the continuation of the Iron Age (see Bronze and Iron Age Poland), the La T√®ne and Roman influence, and Migration periods. The La T√®ne period is subdivided into: * La T√®ne A, 450‚Äì400 BCE * La T√®ne B, 400‚Äì250 BCE * La T√®ne C, 250‚Äì150 BCE * La T√®ne D, 150‚Äì0 BCE The centuries 400‚Äì200 BCE are also considered the early pre- Roman period, and the centuries 200‚Äì0 BCE the younger pre-Roman period (A). These eras were followed by the period of Roman influence: * Early stage: 0‚Äì150 CE ** 0‚Äì80 B1 ** 80‚Äì150 B2 * Late stage: 150‚Äì375 CE ** 150‚Äì250 C1 ** 250‚Äì300 C2 ** 300‚Äì375 C3 The years 375‚Äì500 CE constituted the (pre-Slavic) Migration Period (D and E). Beginning in the early 4th century BCE, the Celtic peoples established a number of settlement centers. Most of these were in what is now southern Poland, which was at the outer edge of their expansion. Through their highly developed economy and crafts, they exerted lasting cultural influence disproportional to their small numbers in the region.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 86‚Äì93 Expanding and moving out of their homeland in Scandinavia and Northern Germany, the Germanic peoples lived in what is now Poland for several centuries, during which period many of their tribes also migrated outward to the south and east (see Wielbark culture). With the expansion of the Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes came under Roman cultural influence. Some written remarks by Roman authors that are relevant to the developments on Polish lands have been preserved; they provide additional insight when compared with the archeological record. In the end, as the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed, damaged, or destabilized the various extant Germanic cultures and societies, the Germanic peoples left Central and Eastern Europe for the safer and wealthier western and southern parts of the European continent.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 94‚Äì115 The northeast corner of contemporary Poland's territory was and remained populated by Baltic tribes. They were at the outer limits of the significant cultural influence of the Roman Empire.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 116‚Äì119  Celtic peoples  Celtic peoples beginning with the core La T√®ne culture area (from 450 BCE; orange), developing over the older Hallstatt culture area (green); maximum distribution c. 300 BCE (brown) = Archeological cultures and groups = The first Celtic people arrived in Poland from Bohemia and Moravia around or after 400 BCE, just a few decades after their La T√®ne culture emerged. They formed several enclaves mostly in the southern part of the country, within the Pomeranian or Lusatian populations or in areas abandoned by those peoples. The cultures or groups that were Celtic or had a Celtic element in them (mixed Celtic and autochthonous) lasted at their furthest extent to 170 CE (P√∫chov culture). After the Celts appeared and during their tenure (they always remained a small minority only), the bulk of the population had begun acquiring the traits of archaeological cultures with a dominant Proto-Germanic or Germanic component. In Europe, the expansion of Rome and the pressures exerted by Germanic peoples checked and reversed the Celtic expansion. Initially, two groups established themselves on fertile grounds in Silesia: one on the left bank of the Oder River south of Wroc≈Çaw, in the area that included Mount ≈ölƒô≈ºa; the other around the G≈Çubczyce highlands. Both these groups stayed in their respective regions during the period 400‚Äì120 BCE. Burials and other significant Celtic sites in G≈Çubczyce County have been investigated in Kietrz and nearby Nowa Cerekwia. The ≈ölƒô≈ºa group eventually assimilated into the local population, while the one in the G≈Çubczyce highlands apparently migrated south. More-recent discoveries include Celtic settlements in Wroc≈Çaw County, such as, in Wojkowice, the well- preserved 3rd-century-BCE grave of a woman with bronze and iron bracelets, brooches, rings, and chains. A century or more later, two more groups arrived and settled the upper San River basin (270‚Äì170 BC) and the Krak√≥w area. The latter group, together with the local population that was at about that time developing the characteristics of the Przeworsk culture (see the next section), formed the mixed Tyniec group, which existed 270‚Äì30 BCE. The Tyniec group's era of dominance was c. 80‚Äì70 BCE, when the existing settlements received Celtic reinforcements from the more southerly populations that were being displaced from Slovakia by the Dacians. In the 1st century BCE, another small group settled in future Poland, probably much further north, in Kujawy. Finally, there was the long-lasting (270 BCE‚Äì170 CE) mixed P√∫chov culture, whom Roman sources associated with the Celtic Cotini, whose northern reaches included parts of the Beskids mountain range and even the Krak√≥w area.Piotr Kaczanowski, Janusz Krzysztof Koz≈Çowski - Najdawniejsze dzieje ziem polskich (do VII w.) (Oldest history of Polish lands (until the 7th century)), Fogra, Krak√≥w 1998, , p. 280, 282‚Äì283 = Agriculture, technology, art, and trade = Ancient Celtic agriculture was advanced. Celtic farmers used plows with iron shares and fertilized fields with animal manure. Their livestock consisted of selected breeds, especially sheep and large cattle. The Celts who settled in future Poland brought with them and disseminated various achievements of La T√®ne culture, including a variety of tools and other inventions. One of them was the rotational quern, which had a stationary lower stone and an upper one rotated by a lever. They also introduced iron furnaces to Poland. Iron was obtained in greater quantities from locally available turf ores; its metallurgy and processing were improved, resulting in the manufacture of stronger and more-resistant tools and weapons. Makers of ceramics used the potter's wheel and (especially the Tyniec group) produced with great precision thin-walled painted vessels, among the best in Europe. Domed bilevel furnaces were used; pots were placed on a perforated clay shelf, with the hearth beneath. The Celts also produced glass and enamel, and they processed gold and semi-precious stones for jewelry. The Celtic communities maintained extensive trade contacts with the Greek cities, Etruria, and then Rome. They were involved in the amber trade between the Baltic and Adriatic seas, but amber was also worked in local shops. In the 1st century BCE, coins of gold and silver, in addition to the more common metals, were used and minted around Krak√≥w and elsewhere. In Gorz√≥w near O≈õwiƒôcim, a treasure of Celtic coins was discovered. Original Celtic art found its expression in numerous designs that incorporated plant, animal, and anthropomorphic motifs. These various Celtic achievements were adopted by the native populations, but usually with considerable delay. = Prominent settlements and burial sites = The settlement in Nowa Cerekwia was active from the beginning of 4th to the end of the 2nd century BCE. One hundred people lived in over 20 houses supported by pillars, with walls made of beams, finished with clay and painted. Although Celtic settlements in Poland were established at various elevations, they had no defensive reinforcements. After the Celts abandoned the area, the Nowa Cerekiew settlement remained uninhabited for 150 years before being reoccupied by the Przeworsk culture people and later the Slavs. Objects recently found at Nowa Cerekiew include a collection of gold and silver coins minted by the Boii tribe (3rd‚Äì2nd century BCE), Greek coins from Sicily and other colonies, and various metal decorative items. Clay containers, jewelry, and tools have been recovered in the past. Nowa Cerekiew was a major Celtic trade and political center, one of the very few in central Europe, a source of great profits and the northernmost of their Amber Road stations.Celtowie spod Opola, Gazeta Wyborcza Nov. 16, 2007, Izabela ≈ªbikowskaSkarb Celt√≥w pod Kietrzem!, Nowa Trybuna Opolska Nov. 16, 2007, S≈Çawomir Dragu≈Ça Among the most significant Celtic finds in Lesser Poland are the extensive and wealthy settlement in Pod≈Çƒô≈ºe and its associated cemetery in Zakrzowiec, both in Wieliczka County; and a multi-period settlement complex in Aleksandrowice, Krak√≥w County. The Pod≈Çƒô≈ºe site was occupied from the mid-3rd century BCE onward and yielded many metal objects, coins and blank coin molds, and a large collection of glass bracelets. The Celtic graves at Zakrzowiec are dugout rectangular enclosures several meters long that contain ashes and grave offerings such as pottery and personal ornaments. Graves of the same type but of a later period, 1st‚Äì2nd century CE, are also found around Krak√≥w, demonstrating the continuation of Celtic traditions even after the arrival of Germanic tribes in the area. The Celtic burial site investigated in Aleksandrowice contains a rich 2nd-century- BCE assemblage of funerary gifts, including iron weapons. The unique elaborate designs of these items, including a scabbard with a recurring dragon motif, have been found only in the areas of Celtic settlement in Slovenia and western Croatia. = Spiritual life and cult sites = Within the realm of Celtic spiritual life, there was considerable variation. Fourth- and early-third- century BCE burials in Wroc≈Çaw and ≈ölƒô≈ºa region are skeletal. Sometimes a man and a woman were buried together, suggesting the known Celtic practice of sacrificing a wife during her husband's funeral, but women were usually buried separately, with their jewelry. Some of the dead were given meat and a knife for cutting it. From the 3rd century BCE onward, bodies were cremated, which was also the case in all of the Lesser Poland burials. The graves of Celtic warriors (3rd century BCE) in Iwanowice,_Krak√≥w_County contain a very rich assortment of weapons and ornaments. The Mount ≈ölƒô≈ºa formation is believed by many to have been a place of exceptional cult significance, over many centuries, possibly going back all the way to the Lusatian times, but especially for the Celts. In the early 11th century, the chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg describes the mountain as a place of adoration because of its size and the \\"cursed\\" pagan ceremonies carried out there. The summits of this and of neighboring mountains are circled by standing stones and monumental sculptures. Diagonal cross signs found on many of the stone objects may have had their origin in the Hallstatt‚ÄìLusatian solar cult. Such signs can also be seen on the massive \\"monk\\" sculpture (which actually is more like a simple chess figure or skittles pin), which was located inside the largest stone ring on Mount ≈ölƒô≈ºa itself and is therefore believed to originate from Hallstatt cultural circles. The stone rings also contain fragments of Lusatian ceramics. The younger sculptures (\\"Maiden with a fish\\", \\"Mushroom,\\" and bear figures) have their distant counterparts in the Celtic art of the Iberian Peninsula and are thought to be the work of the Celts, who further developed ≈ölƒô≈ºa as a cultic center. The Mount ≈ölƒô≈ºa cult was probably revived by the Slavs, who arrived in the early Middle Ages.  Early Germanic peoples  Archeological cultures of Central Europe in the Late Pre-Roman Iron Age: Nordic group House Urns culture Oksywie culture late phase Jastorf culture Gubin group of Jastorf Przeworsk culture Western Balt culture Eastern Balt forest zone cultures Zarubintsy culture Celtic The expansion of the Germanic tribes 750 BCE ‚Äì 1 CE (after the Penguin Atlas of World History 1988): = La T√®ne and Jastorf cultures and their roles = The Proto-Germanic or Germanic cultures on Polish lands developed gradually and diversely, beginning with the extant Lusatian and Pomeranian peoples, influenced and augmented first by La T√®ne culture Celts, and then by Jastorf culture and its tribes, who settled northwestern Poland beginning in the 4th century BCE and later migrated southeast through and past the main stretch of Polish lands (mid-3rd century BCE and after). The now-disappearing Celtic people had greatly reshaped central Europe and left a lasting legacy. Their advanced culture catalyzed economic and other progress within the contemporary as well as future populations, which had often had little or no ethnic Celtic component. The \\"La T√®ne\\" archeological period ended as the Common Era began. The origins of the Germanic people's powerful ascent, leading them to displace the Celts, are not easy to discern. For example, we do not know to what degree Pomeranian culture gave way to Przeworsk culture by internal evolution, external population influx, or just permeation by the new regional cultural trends. The early Germanic Jastorf cultural sphere was in the beginning an impoverished continuation of the North German Urnfield culture and the Nordic circle cultures. It formed around 700‚Äì550 BCE in Northern Germany and Jutland under Hallstatt influence; in its early stages, its funeral customs strongly resembled those of the contemporary Pomeranian culture. From the Jastorf culture, which rapidly expanded from c. 500 BCE onward, two groups arose and settled the western borderlands of Poland during 300‚Äì100 BCE: The Oder group in western Pomerania and the Gubin group further south. These groups, which were peripheral to Jastorf culture, very likely originated as Pomeranian culture populations influenced by the Jastorf cultural model.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 224 Jastorf communities established large burial grounds, separate for men and women. The dead were cremated and the ashes placed in urns, which were covered by bowls turned upside down. Funeral gifts were modest and rather uniform, indicating a society that was neither affluent nor socially diversified. The Oder and Gubin groups probably included the tribes later called Bastarnae and Scirii in Greek written sources, noted because of their military exploits around Greece and its colonies in the later part of the 3rd century BCE. Their route followed the Warta and Noteƒá rivers, crossed Kujawy and Masovia, turned south along the Bug River, and continued on to what today is Moldavia, where they settled and developed the Poienesti-Lukasevka culture. This route is marked by archeological findings, especially the characteristic bronze crown-shaped necklaces. = Oksywie culture and Przeworsk culture = It is not clear whether, to what degree, or for what duration some of these traveling Jastorf people settled on Polish lands. However, their migration, together with the accelerated La T√®ne culture influence, catalyzed the emergence of the Oksywie and Przeworsk cultures. Both new cultures were under strong Jastorf influence. The increasingly common presence within the Przeworsk culture area of objects made by Jastorf people reflects the penetration of Jastorf culture into their population. Both the Oksywie and Przeworsk cultures fully utilized iron processing technologies; unlike their predecessor cultures, they show no regional differentiation. Oksywie culture (250 BCE‚Äì30 CE) was named after a village (now within the city of Gdynia) where a burial site was found. It originally occupied the Vistula delta region and then the rest of eastern Pomerania, expanded west up to the Jastorf Oder group area, and in the 1st century BCE also included part of what had been that group's territory. Like other cultures of this period, it had basic La T√®ne cultural characteristics, plus those typical of the Baltic cultures. Oksywie culture ceramics and burial customs indicate strong ties with Przeworsk culture. Men's ashes were placed in well-made black urns with a fine finish and a decorative band. Unlike men's graves in Jastorf culture, theirs were furnished with utensilsand weapons, including the typical one- edged sword, and were often covered with or marked by stones. Women's ashes were buried in hollows with feminine personal items. A clay vessel with relief animal images found in Go≈Çƒôbiowo Wielkie in Gda≈Ñsk County (2nd half of the 1st century BCE) is among the finest in all of the Germanic cultural zone. Przeworsk culture was named after a town in Lesser Poland, near which another burial ground was found. Like Oksywie culture, it originated c. 250 BCE, but it lasted much longer. In its course it went through many changes, formed tribal and political structures, fought wars (including with the Romans), until in the 5th century CE its highly developed society of farmers, artisans, warriors, and chiefs succumbed to the temptations of the lands of the now- fallen empire. (For many of them it happened possibly rather quickly, during the first half of that century.). Przeworsk culture initially became established in Lower Silesia, Greater Poland, central Poland, and western Masovia and Lesser Poland, gradually replacing (from west to east) Pomeranian culture and Cloche Grave culture. It coexisted with these older cultures for a while (in some cases well into the younger pre-Roman period, 200‚Äì0 BCE) and assimilated some of their characteristics, such as Cloche Grave funerary practice and ceramics. The Przeworsk people must have originated from the above two local cultures, because of the lack of any other archeologically viable possibility, but their different cremation rite and pottery style represent a striking cultural discontinuity from their predecessors. In the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE (late La T√®ne period), the Przeworsk people followed the lead of the more advanced Celts, who had established population enclaves in southern and middle Poland. Przeworsk culture developed as a result of the local populations' adoption of La T√®ne culture models. The passage of the Bastarnae and Scirii and the associated unrest likely functioned as the outside catalyzing agent; Jastorf culture archeological material has been found in pre-Przeworsk artifact assemblages and in some of the early Przeworsk range. The Przeworsk people mastered and implemented the various achievements of the Celts, most importantly developing large-scale production of iron, for which they used local bog ores. They sometimes formed mixed groups and cooperated within common settlements with the Celts, of which the Tyniec group in the Krak√≥w region and another group in Kujawy are the best-known examples. Arms, clothes, and ornaments were patterned after Celtic products. In the early stages of their culture, the Przeworsk people displayed no social distinctions; their graves were alike and flat, and ashes were usually buried together with funeral gifts and without urns. Religious practices of pagan Germanic peoples included offering ceremonies performed in swamps, involving manmade objects, produce, farm animals, or even human sacrifices, as was the case at one site near S≈Çowikowo in S≈Çupca County and another in OtalƒÖ≈ºka, Gr√≥jec County. Dog burials within or around a homestead were another form of protective offering. As the Celtic domination in this part of Europe was coming to an end and the borders of the Roman Empire had gotten much closer, the Przeworsk culture people were being subjected to the Greco-Roman world's influence with a rapidly growing intensity.  Cultures and tribes in Roman times  = Early Roman wars and movement of tribes = Much circumstantial evidence points to the participation of Germanic people from Polish lands in the events of the first half of the 1st century BCE, which culminated in Gaul in 58 BCE, as related in Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico. At the time the Suebi tribal confederation led by Ariovistus arrived in Gaul, a rapid decrease of settlement density can be observed in the areas of the upper and middle Oder River basin. In fact, the Gubin group of Jastorf culture then disappeared entirely, which may indicate that the group identified with one of the Suebi tribes. Also vacated were the western areas of Przeworsk culture (Lower Silesia, Lubusz Land and western Greater Poland), the probable original territory of the tribes accompanying the Suebi. Burial sites and artifacts characteristic of Przeworsk culture have been found in Saxony, Thuringia, and Hesse, along the route of the Suebi offensive. The abovementioned regions of western Poland were not repopulated and economically redeveloped until the 2nd century CE. As a result of the Roman efforts to subjugate all of Germania, the member tribes of the Suebi alliance were displaced, moved east, conquered the Celtic tribes who stood in their way, and settled: the Quadi in Moravia, the Marcomanni in Bohemia. The latter tribe, under Marbod, formed a quasi-state with a huge army and was able to conquer, among others, the Lugii tribal association. What archeologists see as the Przeworsk culture by this period (early 1st century CE) is believed to consist primarily of the Lugii, described by Tacitus as a very large union of tribes. The Roman defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (9 CE) stabilized the situation at the periphery of the Empire to some degree. Through Marcomanni and Quadi intermediaries, the Lugii and other tribes on Polish lands increasingly became involved in trade and other contacts with the Danubian provinces of Rome. In 50 CE they invaded and pillaged the Quadi state created by Vannius, contributing to its fall. The catalyst for the expedition was rumors of the enormous riches that Vannius had accumulated by plunder and by charging duties. In 93 CE the Lugii, asked Emperor Domitian for help in their war against the Suebi and received 100 mounted soldiers. = Amber Road = Operations of the ancient Amber Road, a trans-European, north‚Äìsouth amber trade route, continued and intensified during the Roman Empire. From the 1st century BCE the Amber Road connected the Baltic Sea shores and Aquileia, an important amber processing center. This route was controlled first by the Celts, later by the Romans south of the Danube, and then by Germanic tribes north of that river. It was used for transporting a variety of traded merchandise (and slaves) besides amber. As told in Naturalis Historia by Pliny the Elder, during the reign of Nero an equestrian of unknown name led an expedition to the Baltic shorelines and returned to Rome with huge quantity of amber, which was subsequently used for propagandist purposes during gladiator matches and other public games. The infrastructure of the Amber Road was destroyed by Germanic and Sarmatian attacks in the second half of the 3rd century CE, although it was still intermittently used until the mid-6th century. The Przeworsk culture sites provide a rich assortment of objects traded along the Amber Road.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 98‚Äì99 and 101, Tadeusz Makiewicz = Gustow and Lubusz groups = From the beginning of the Common Era until 140 CE, two local groups existed in northwest Poland. The Gustow group (named after Gustow on R√ºgen) lived in the area settled in the past by the Oder group. To the south, by the middle section of the Oder River (the area previously inhabited by the Gubin group), lived the Lubusz group. These two groups were intermediary between the Elbe cultural circle to the west and the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures to the east (Wielbark replaced Oksywie culture after 30 CE). = Przeworsk culture settlements and burial sites = The Przeworsk people of the earlier Roman period lived in small, unprotected villages. Each village was home to a few dozen residents at most, living in several houses, each of which covered an area of 8‚Äì22 square meters and was usually set partially below ground level (semi-sunken). Because Przeworsk technology included wells, the settlements did not need to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd-century-CE wells of various construction with timber-lined walls have been found at a settlement in Stanis≈Çawice, Bochnia County. Fields were used for crop cultivation for a while and then as pastures, as animal manure helped refertilize the depleted soil. Once iron plowshares were introduced, Przeworsk fields alternated between tillage and grazing. Several or more settlements made up a micro-region within which the residents cooperated economically and buried their dead in a common cemetery. Each micro-region was separated from other micro-regions by forests and barren land. A number of such micro-regions possibly made up a tribe, with tribes separated by empty space, which Tacitus called zones \\"of mutual fear.\\" However, tribes would at times form larger confederations, such as temporary alliances for waging wars or even early forms of states, especially if they were culturally closely related. A Przeworsk culture turn-of-the-millennium industrial complex for the extraction of salt from salt springs was discovered in Chabsko near Mogilno.The Archaeology of the Transit Gas Pipeline by Kazimierz Adamczyk and Marek Gierlach, Archeologia ≈ªywa (Living Archeology) special English issue 2005 Examinations of Przeworsk burial grounds, of which even the largest was used continuously over periods of up to several centuries, have turned up no more than several hundred graves, showing that overall population density was low. The dead were cremated and the ashes sometimes placed into urns with central engraved bulges. In the 1st century CE, this design was replaced with a horizontal ridge around the circumference of the urn, which produced a sharp profile. In Siemiech√≥w, a grave of a warrior who must have taken part in the Ariovistus expedition (70‚Äì50 BCE) was found; it contains Celtic weapons, a helmet manufactured in the Alpine region that was used as the warrior's burial urn, and local ceramics. Burial gifts were often, for unknown reasons, bent or broken and then burned with the body. The burials range from \\"poor\\" to \\"rich,\\" the latter supplied with costly Celtic and then Roman imports, reflecting the considerable social stratification that had developed by this time. = Wielbark culture and burials = Central and East European cultures ca. 100 CE Wielbark culture, named after Wielbark in Malbork County where a large cemetery was found, replaced Oksywie culture in Pomerania rather suddenly across its entire territory. While Oksywie culture was closely related to Przeworsk culture, its successor Wielbark culture shows only minimal contacts with the Przeworsk areas, indicating clear tribal and geographical separation. Wielbark culture lasted on Polish lands from 30‚Äì400 CE, although most of its people left Poland long before the latter date. Some of this culture's burials are skeletal; the dead were inhumed in solid log coffins, while others were cremated; both such graves were identically equipped. Cremated remains were either placed in urns or simply buried in hollows. Burial gifts did not include weapons or tools. They did include clay vessels, decorations, personal ornaments, and ‚Äî if the deceased had been wealthy enough to own a horse ‚Äî spurs. These various items, and especially the 1st and 2nd century CE jewelry made of bronze, silver, and gold, are works of the highest quality, surpassing the comparable products of the Przeworsk culture. This craftsmanship reached its apex with 2nd-century \\"Baroque\\" jewelry, beautiful by any standard, that was placed in the graves of women in (as the Wielbark culture expanded south) Pozna≈Ñ SzelƒÖg and Kowalewko, Oborniki County, among other places. The Kowalewko cemetery in Greater Poland is one of the largest Wielbark burial sites in Poland and is distinguished by a great number of beautiful relics, made locally or imported from the Empire. The total number of burials is estimated to exceed 500, most of which have been excavated. Sixty percent of bodies were not cremated but were typically placed in wooden coffins made of boards or planks. The burial ground was in use from the mid-1st century CE to about 220, meaning that approximately 80 local residents of each generation were inhumed there. Remnants of settlements in the region have also been investigated. At Rogowo near Che≈Çmno, a Wielbark settlement, an industrial production site and a 2nd-to-3rd-century bi-ritual cemetery with very richly furnished graves have been discovered. In the area of Ulkowy, Gda≈Ñsk County, a settlement consisting of sunken floors and post- construction dwellings has been found, as well as a burial ground in use from the mid-1st century to the second half of the 3rd century. Only part of the cemetery was excavated on the occasion of a motorway construction, but it yielded 110 inhumations (11 in hollowed-out log coffins) and 15 cremations (eight of them in urns) with a rich collection of decorative objects, mostly from the graves of women. Those include fancy jewelry and accessories made of gold, silver, bronze, amber, glass, and enamel. Ceramics, utility items, and tools, including weaving equipment, were recovered from the settlement site. Other significant Wielbark settlements in the area were encountered in Swaro≈ºyn and Stanis≈Çawie, both in Tczew County.Archaeological Rescue Excavations by Miros≈Çaw Fudzi≈Ñski and Henryk Paner, Archeologia ≈ªywa (Living Archeology), special English issue 2005Museum of Archeology in Gda≈Ñsk web site Stone circle in Odry Many Wielbark graves were flat, but kurgans are also characteristic and common. In the case of kurgans, the grave was covered with stones, which were surrounded by a circle of larger stones. These were covered with earth and a solitary stone or stela often put on top. Such a kurgan could include one or several individual burials, have a diameter of up to a dozen or so meters, and be up to 1 meter high. Some burial grounds feature large stone circles of massive boulders up to 1.7 meters high, separated by several meters of spaces, sometimes connected by smaller stones; the whole structure is 10‚Äì40 meters in diameter. In the middle of the circles, one to four stelae were placed, and sometimes a single grave. The stone circles are believed to be the locations of meetings of Scandinavian (see below) tings (assemblies or courts). The single graves inside the circles are probably those of human sacrifices meant to propitiate the gods and assure their support for the deliberations. A stone kurgan cemetery was found in Wƒôsiory, Kartuzy County; another burial site with 10 large stone circles was discovered in Odry, Chojnice County, both dated 2nd century CE. = Origins and expansion of the Wielbark culture = How did Wielbark culture arise, and why did it so immediately replace Oksywie culture? According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th-century Gothic historian Jordanes, the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boats and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region, and then, some years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, which was dismissed by past historians, is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events, and the Wielbark culture is indeed partly identified with the Germanic ancestors of the Goths. The idea that a culturally different (although related) people arrived in the mouth of the Vistula, mixed with the Oksywie population, and came to dominate it due to their (cultural, at least) advancement is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and could explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 CE. Archeology nevertheless shows the evolution of Oksywie culture to be the fundamental source of Wielbark culture, as the two cultures extended over exactly the same territory and continuously used the same cemeteries. The locally present Veneti and Rugians became influenced by the Goths or their Scandinavian predecessors. It is presently believed that the Scandinavian arrivals directly settled the areas where the great cult kurgan and stone burial grounds are found. They are referred to as the Odry-Wƒôsiory- Grzybnica type, were established in the second half of the 1st century CE and occur in parts of Pomerania west of the Vistula, up to the Koszalin area. The contemporary and rather closely related Wielbark culture in (previously settled by the Przeworsk culture) Greater Poland, represented by the Kowalewko cemetery, lacks however for the most part the kurgans and the stone structures. The Wielbark people came here from Pomerania. In the course of the 1st and 2nd century CE the Wielbark culture expanded south, towards Greater Poland and Masovia, partially at the expense of the Przeworsk culture. Around the mid-1st century the Wielbark culture people forced out the Przeworsk population from northern Greater Poland and settled the area for about 150 years. The Przeworsk culture itself also expanded in the southern, eastern and south-western directions.  \\"Barbarians\\", Late Roman Empire and the Great Migration of Peoples  = Marcomannic Wars and movement of tribes = The Marcomannic Wars fought during 166‚Äì180 CE were caused by the pressure exerted by the northern Germanic peoples (settled around the area of today's Poland) on the tribes located in the vicinity of Roman limes, the Empire's defended border. Expansion of the Proto-Gothic Wielbark culture displaced from northern Greater Poland and Masovia the Przeworsk culture people; they in turn, moving south and east, crossed during the third quarter of the 2nd century the Carpathian Mountains. The ethnic composition of the Przeworsk population at this stage is not known, as the Lugii tribes no longer seem to be mentioned. Related to the Przeworsk culture was the Wietrzno-Solina type, a cultural unit with Celtic and then Dacian elements, situated within the more eastern part of the Beskids range (San River basin) during the 100‚Äì250 AD period.Polish Wikipedia article on this culture The Kotins tribe Celtic survivors with their P√∫chov culture disappeared now for good, as a result of their migration and involvement in the Marcomannic Wars. There were also changes in northwest Poland, on the border of the Elbe cultural sphere region. The Lubusz group there was absorbed by the new Luboszyce culture (Luboszyce, Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie County), that occupied the middle Oder basin during the 140‚Äì430 CE period. Its birth was related to the arrival from the east of population groups strongly influenced by the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures. Gradually a new branch of Germanic people, the Burgundians, whose origins are traced back to Scandinavia and the Bornholm island in particular and whose ancestors then migrated to the northwest Przework culture area, developed and evolved under new favorable conditions here. On the other hand, the Gustow group left western Pomerania, to be replaced after 70 years by the Dƒôbczyn group (Dƒôbczyn, Wschowa County), established by the arrivals from the Elbe cultures and lasting between 210 and 450 AD. = Economic development and currency = The economic development of what to the Romans were barbarian lands (also called \\"Barbaricum\\", regions populated mostly by Germanic peoples, north and northeast of the Empire) benefited greatly from the skills of the prisoners taken during the protracted Marcomannic Wars, Roman legionaries and craftsmen, some of whom undoubtedly stayed beyond the limes and made their contribution there. Contacts with the wealthy Danubian Roman provinces during the wars were also quite active and intensive. Because of all that, from the end of the 2nd century CE on, the Roman-originated and based technical expertise and inventions were becoming increasingly widespread within the Germanic societies. For example, besides traditional houses supported by pillars, framework houses were being built, lathe machines were used for amber and other jewelry work. The barbarian societies were getting more wealthy and, especially during the last centuries of imperial Rome, more socially polarized. An estimated 70,000 Roman coins from all periods were found in Poland, starting with the 2nd century BCE silver denarii. A treasure of these and other coins, some as early as the 1st century CE, was found in Po≈Çaniec, Stasz√≥w County, probably a booty captured c. 19 CE from King Marbod of the Marcomanni. Greater waves of Roman money found their way to Poland throughout the 1st and 2nd centuries and then again during the 4th and 5th centuries, this time as bronze and golden solidi. The barbarians did not use them for commerce; they were being accumulated in dynastic treasuries of rulers and occasionally used for ceremonial gift exchange. The chiefs also kept large golden Roman medallions or their local imitations. The largest barbarian medallion, an equivalent of 48 solidii, is a part of the gold and silver treasure found in Zag√≥rzyn near Kalisz. = Princely burials = The evolution of the power structure within the Germanic societies in Poland and elsewhere can be traced to some degree by examining the \\"princely\\" graves - burials of chiefs, and even hereditary princes, as the consolidation of power progressed. Those appear from the beginning of the Common Era and are located away from ordinary cemeteries, singly or in small groups. The bodies were inhumed in wooden coffins and covered with kurgans, or interred in wooden or stone chambers. Luxurious Roman-made gifts and fancy barbarian emulations (such as silver and gold clasps with springs, created with an unsurpassed attention to detail, dated 3rd century CE from Wroc≈Çaw Zakrz√≥w), but not weapons, were placed in the graves. The 1st and 2nd century burials of this type, occurring all the way from Jutland to Lesser Poland, are referred to as princely graves Lubieszewo type, after Lubieszewo, Gryfice County in western Pomerania, where six such burials were found. Two types of 3rd- and 4th-century princely graves are distinguished: The Zakrz√≥w type, named after the location of three very rich stone chamber burials found in Wroc≈Çaw Zakrz√≥w occur in southern Poland, while in the northern and central parts of the country the Rosto≈Çty (Bia≈Çystok County) type kurgans are rather common. At some sites, believed to be dynastic necropolises, the princes were buried in generation long time increments. During the late Roman period the princely burials are fewer in number, but they get increasingly more elaborate. = Ceramics and metallurgy = The pottery as well as iron mining and processing industries kept developing in Poland throughout the Roman periods, until terminated in the 5th century or so by the Great Migration. Clay pots were still often formed manually and these were more crude, while the better ones were made with the potter's wheel, used beginning in the early 3rd century. Some had inscriptions engraved, but their meaning, if any, is not known (Germanic people had occasionally used the runic alphabets). Wide-open, vase type Przeworsk culture urn from the 2nd century CE found in Bia≈Ça, Zgierz County is covered with representations from Celtic and Germanic mythology, such as deer, horse riders, crosses and swastikas. The 3rd and 4th century buckets were made of wood and reinforced with bronze braces and sheets. Przeworsk culture's large globular clay storage containers from the 3rd and 4th century were 60 cm to over one meter tall. The 4th and 5th century ceramic specimens from the late phase of this culture include pitchers, clay pails, beakers and bowls. Characteristic of the Roman times iron industry were huge centers of metallurgy. One such concentration of ironworks, in ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains, which already produced iron on an industrial scale in the 1st century CE, in the 2nd and 3rd centuries became Barbaricum's largest. It may have been responsible for the majority of the iron supplied for barbarian weapon production during the Marcomannic Wars. The iron product was obtained in rather small, single-use smelting furnaces. One furnace's iron output was from a few to 20 kg, which required 10 to 200 kg of ore and the same amount of charcoal. The satisfaction of so much need for charcoal caused significant deforestation of the areas surrounding the iron centers. Not only turf, but also hematite ores were utilized, which involved building mines and shafts to provide access. The furnaces in ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains were grouped into large complexes, located in forested areas, away from human settlements. There could have had been as many as 700,000 smelting furnaces built in that area; one big concentration of the Przeworsk culture's spent furnaces (2nd‚Äì3rd centuries) was located in Nowa S≈Çupia, Kielce County. The second largest iron production center functioned at that time in Masovia, west of Warsaw, with the total number of furnaces there, in which only turf ores were used, estimated at up to 200,000. They were operated as very large complexes, with several thousand furnaces at a time located near populated areas, where intermediate products were processed further. Those two great concentrations of metallurgical industry produced iron largely for long distance trade; to fulfill local requirements and on smaller scale iron was obtained at a number of other locations. Graves of warrior-smiths buried with weapons and sets of tools were found, which suggests that they belonged to the societal upper ranks and were held in high esteem. = Weapons and tools = A set of iron carpenter's tools from the 3rd-4th century, including a compass for marking circles, was found in Przyw√≥z, Wielu≈Ñ County, where there was a Przeworsk culture settlement and a 2nd/3rd century dynastic burial complex.Polish Wikipedia article on Przyw√≥z The graves of Przeworsk men typically include substantial collections of arms, so that their warrior's battle equipment and its evolution are well known. Less wealthy warriors fought typically on foot, with spears (for close range combat) and javelins (for throwing), both with iron heads. The better off fighters used swords, first of the long Celtic kind, and then in the 1st and 2nd century CE of the short and broad, gladius Roman infantry type. Swords were kept in scabbards, some of which, depending on status, were very ornate. The long and narrow swords, better suited for horseback combat, became popular again in the 3rd century, but only the more wealthy warriors had horses, not to mention iron helmets or ring armor. Round wooden shields had iron umbos in the middle, usually with a thorn for piercing the enemy. There were no saddles, but the richest of horsemen used silver spurs and bronze bridles with chain reins. Numerous Przeworsk culture objects including spurs and a unique silver belt buckle were recovered at the Aleksandrowice, Krak√≥w County settlement area; some relics there are dated possibly as late as the first half of the 6th century. = Migrations of Wielbark and Przeworsk cultures people = Expansion of the Germanic peoples In the 2nd century CE the Proto-Gothic people of the Wielbark culture began their own great migration, moving east, south, and southeast. In the first half of the 3rd century they left most of Pomerania except for the lower Vistula region, where a small Wielbark population remained; Pomerania west of there became mostly settled by the Dƒôbczyn group. Also evacuated at that time northern Greater Poland was retaken by the Przeworsk culture people. The Wielbark people successively took over eastern Masovia, Lesser Poland, Podlasie, Polesie and Volhynia. They settled in Ukraine, where they encountered other peoples, which resulted in the early 3rd century CE in the rise of the Chernyakhov culture. This last culture, which in the 4th century encompassed large areas of southeastern Europe, was of a mixed ethnic composition; in the more western part it was made-up of the Wielbark culture people, as well as other Germanic people and the Dacians. It was within the Chernyakhov culture that the Gothic tribes assumed their mature form. Vandalic burial cemetery in Prusiek, Poland The Przeworsk culture populations were for the most part also moving (to a lesser extent) south and east, which by the 4th century caused a lessening of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia. The Przeworsk people there at this point in time are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich, the warriors, the tribal elders and rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed contributions and plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were getting more poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form,Problem kontynuacji kulturowej ... by Tadeusz Makiewicz, from Praojczyzna S≈Çowian, Institute of Anthropology in Pozna≈Ñ but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps, found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship. = Hun advance, barbarian migrations in Europe = On top of the Przeworsk culture's internal crisis situation came external pressures, namely the massive migration of peoples. Around 370 CE, the Huns crossed the Volga River, defeating the Alans and then the Ostrogoths, causing in 375 the fall of their state located in the Black Sea shores region. This unleashed a domino effect, as various Germanic peoples moved west and south to avoid the danger. The Visigoths and others retreated, forcing further migrations, while the weakness of the Roman Empire encouraged encroachments of its territory, the whole scenario resulting in the fall of its western part. The paths of this Great Migration of Peoples led in part through the Polish lands, and the Germanic tribes living here joined the movement themselves, with the result of an almost complete, in the course of the 5th century, depopulation of Poland. In the upper Vistula basin, where the Przeworsk culture settlements were still relatively dense in the first half of the 5th century, they are markedly absent during the second half of it. This is also the case in Silesia; the depopulation pattern began there earlier and the latest finds are dated around 400 CE. All of it agrees well with the information given by Procopius of Caesarea, according to whom the Heruli returning to Scandinavia from the Carpathian Basin in 512, heading towards the Varni tribe area in Germany, crossed a large region devoid of human settlements - presumably Silesia and Lusatia. Likewise there are no settlements found in Masovia and Podlasie beyond the early part of the 5th century. On the other hand, in central Poland and Greater Poland isolated remnants from the Roman era cultures continue to be located through the end of 5th and even into the earlier parts of the 6th century. Still further north, in Pomerania, such findings are actually quite numerous, including many cult coin deposit sites (Roman and then Byzantine golden solidi). There, the Germanic groups lasted the longest (and kept up trade and other contacts with their brethren elsewhere). The territory of the powerful confederation of the Hun tribes included about 400 CE the lands of southern Poland, where burial and treasure sites have been investigated. A woman's grave in Jƒôdrzychowice, Strzelin County contained fancy feminine ornaments and a nicely preserved bronze kettle, which gave a name (\\"Jƒôdrzychowice\\") to one of the two basic Hun kettle types, while a burial of a young warrior-aristocrat including his horse and precious harness, attire and weaponry elements (gold sheet covered ritual bow and sword sheath) was found in Jakuszowice, Kazimierza Wielka County. Still further east, in ≈öwilcza near Rzesz√≥w a hidden Hun treasure was located; this last find dates from the mid-5th century, when the Hun empire was about to crumble.  Baltic peoples  = Early Balts in light of ancient sources and linguistic research = The Balts or Baltic peoples, or their Indo- European predecessors, have settled (at different times different parts of) the territory of today's northeast Poland as well as the lands located further north and east, generally east of the lower Vistula River, the Baltic seashore north of there including and past the Sambian peninsula, and the inland area east of the above regions (some of their ancestors came from as far east as the upper Oka River), from the early Iron Age. The analysis of the Baltic historic range has been aided by the studies of their characteristic toponyms and hydronyms, in addition to the examination of the archeological record and the few ancient written sources. Herodotus wrote of the Neuri tribe, who lived beyond the Scythians and to the north of whom the land was uninhabited as far as he knew. Of the Baltic tribes may have written Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy when they spoke of the Veneti, Venedi or Venedai people. Pliny in Natural History locates them in the mouth of the Vistula region, while Ptolemy in Geographia just east of the lower Vistula along the Bay of Gda≈Ñsk. The Western Baltic Veneti's territory may have reached east all the way to Sambia.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 259, 350 Tacitus in Germania, describing (possibly the same) inhabitants of the south-eastern Baltic shores, mentioned the Aesti people, involved in collecting amber not for their own use but for long distance trade in a raw state. Jordanes in Getica speaks of the \\"Aesti, who dwell on the farthest shore of the German Ocean\\" (beyond the Germanic- named Vidivarii people, who occupied the mouth of the Vistula area). This \\"Ocean\\" he defines as where the floods of the Vistula empty, the Baltic Sea.Transl. by Charles Christopher Mierow, Princeton University Press 1908, from the University of Calgary web site Various versions of the Aesti name were used later for various purposes; in particular that's what in the 9th century the Baltic Old Prussian people were called and their country was then referred to as Aestland. Ptolemy in Geographia gives the names of two Baltic tribes: \\"Galindai\\" and \\"Soudinoi\\", which he localized east of the lower Vistula, some distance from the sea, just about where the Baltic Galindians (in Masuria), and the Sudovians or Yotvingians east of the Galindians lived a thousand years later. According to linguistic sources, the Baltic tribes precursors appeared first inland, in the forest zone regions far from the sea, and only later settled the near Baltic Sea areas, extending from the northeastern part of the Vistula basin to the Daugava River basin. This westbound expansion resulted in the establishment of the two main Baltic branches: The Western Balts, represented by the extinct Old Prussians and Yotvingians, and the Eastern Balts including the modern nations of Lithuanians and Latvians. = Western Balt culture = The Western Baltic Kurgans culture, which resulted from the interaction between groups arriving from the east and the people living in the Masuria-Sambia region (mid-1st millennium BCE) is discussed in the Bronze and Iron Age Poland article, within its time frame. The process of separation and differentiation of the eastern and western Baltic tribes deepened during the period of Roman influence, when the economy, culture, and customs of the Western Balts became increasingly influenced by the more highly developed Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures. From the beginning of the Common Era we can speak of the Western Balt culture, which included several distinct groups of the Western Baltic cultural circle and can definitely be connected with the Baltic peoples. Beginning in the 1st century CE, the Western Balts experienced their \\"golden\\" period ‚Äî times of economic expansion and increased affluence of their societies, all of which was based on the amber trade, resulting in active and long-term contacts with the lands of the Roman Empire. As late as the early 6th century CE, an Aesti mission arrived in Italy at the court of King Theodoric the Great of the Ostrogoths with gifts of amber. As elsewhere, with wealth came imported and locally manufactured luxury items, social stratification, and an emergence of the \\"princely\\" class, whose status was reflected in their burials. = Baltic settlements, economy, crafts, and burials = The Balts grew various grains, beans, and peas, but despite the advent of iron-reinforced plows and other new agricultural technologies, the regional environmental conditions set limits on the practicality and extent of land tillage. By contrast, the dense forest coverage facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of livestock. The latter included all of the major species of farm animals, including in particular the small forest horse ('Equus caballus germanicus'). The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture: men of high socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses, and even with costly equestrian gear. Baltic settlements were mainly small, family- based communities, often forming small clusters separated by uninhabited areas. However, some settlements were larger and remained in use over many generations. While they lacked artificial fortifications, they were often raised in natural settings that were easily defended. One rather large dwelling place, which was in use from the 2nd to the 4th century, was discovered and investigated in Osowo, Go≈Çdap County (near Suwa≈Çki). The living quarters were pillar-supported houses, while the farming infrastructure included 80 grain storage caves. Small fortified refuges were built to a limited extent beginning at the end of the 4th century, but Western Balts did not build larger-scale fortified settlements until the Middle Ages. The dominant funereal custom was cremation, with ashes placed in urns that were either ceramic or made from organic materials such as textiles or leather. In the large cemeteries built along the seashore and covered by stone pavement, graves were flat. However, there were also single graves accompanied by stone structures/kurgans, as in the skeletal burials from the 1st and 2nd centuries CE that have been found in Sambia and the later ones (3rd‚Äì4th centuries) in Sudovia. From about 400 CE onward, cremation became the only means of corpse disposition, and the more familiar type of kurgan emerged, with each grave holding the remains of several persons. Samples of mature ancient-Baltic craftsmanship (2nd‚Äì4th century) have been found in places such as ≈ªywa Woda and Szwajcaria, both in Suwa≈Çki County; and in August√≥w County. The princely graves, as is typical, also contain many imports from southern and western Europe. Baltic fine bronze ornamental items, such as thin, open-worked plates for necklace clasps, were typically coated with colored, often red enamel. Foreign influence can also be seen in the designs of clay urns, such as the 3rd- or 4th-century Greek kernos-type vessel with additional miniature urns attached, or the 5th-century \\"window\\" container with a square opening from Olsztyn County, similar to the urns found in Denmark and northwestern Germany. = Olsztyn group = The last-mentioned specimen comes from the Olsztyn group burial ground in Tumiany. The Olsztyn group represents the late phase of the Western Baltic cultural circle, originating in the second half of the 5th century and reaching its height in the 6th and 7th centuries. It was located in Masuria, partially in areas vacated by the Wielbark culture people. This group is believed to have been established by branches of the Galindian tribe, including a part that migrated to southern Europe and then returned to the Baltic area. Its cemeteries contain horse burials and many plate clasps, buckles, connectors, and other objects made of bronze, silver, and gold, studded with semi-precious stones and decorated with engravings. These sophisticated artifacts demonstrate the Olsztyn group people's extensive interregional and far-reaching trade and other relationships and contacts with the peoples of Scandinavia and western, southern, and southeastern Europe. = Migrations and their effects on Baltic people = In the 5th century, due to Migration Period population shifts and the pressure from the westbound movement of the Slavic peoples, patterns of Baltic settlement began to change. The Western Balts took over the lands left by the Wielbark culture people and reached the eastern part of the mouth of the Vistula. A major trade route connecting the southeastern Baltic areas with the Black Sea shores went now through the regions controlled by the Balts. Expansion of the Old Prussian tribes, such as the previously mentioned Galindians and Yotvingians, encompassed today's northeast Poland and the adjacent territories further north. Galindia (today's western Masuria), whose new inhabitants included the Olsztyn group, became in the 6th and 7th centuries the most affluent of the lands settled by Balts, with highly developed local craftsmanship supplementing the wealth of items brought from distant countries. This westbound expansion was accompanied by retreat at the southeastern bounds of the Baltic range caused by the advance of the Slavs,U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 119, Danuta Jaskanis the Balts' closest ethnolinguistic relatives.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 116, Danuta Jaskanis A majority of the Baltic peoples, whose population at the end of the first millennium CE is estimated at about 480,000, became extinct during the later Middle Ages due to attempts at forced Christianization, conquest and extermination, or assimilation (Slavicisation), the Old Prussians being the primary example. Lithuanians and Latvians are the sole surviving Baltic peoples.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, Synchronization of archeological cultures, p. 216‚Äì217 by Adam ≈ªurek and chronology tables p. 222‚Äì225 by Wojciech Mrozowicz and Adam ≈ªurek used throughout the article  See also  * Prehistory of Poland (until 966) * Stone Age Poland * Bronze and Iron Age Poland * Poland in the Early Middle Ages  Notes  a.The Lusatian and Pomeranian people, or their linguistic predecessors, may have belonged to the hypothetical Old European languages group (pre-Indo-European), the probable source of the names of many European rivers.

Function  Gastric lipase is an acidic lipase secreted by the gastric chief cells in the fundic mucosa in the stomach. It has a pH optimum of 3‚Äì6. Gastric lipase, together with lingual lipase, comprise the two acidic lipases. These lipases, unlike alkaline lipases (such as pancreatic lipase), do not require bile acid or colipase of optimal enzymatic activity. Acidic lipases make up 30% of lipid hydrolysis occurring during digestion in the human adult, with gastric lipase contributing the most of the two acidic lipases. In neonates, acidic lipases are much more important, providing up to 50% of total lipolytic activity. Gastric lipase hydrolyzes the ester bonds of triglycerides in the stomach. Fatty acids and diacylglycerols are produced from this reaction. The long chain free fatty acids have the ability to prevent gastric lipase from hydrolyzing more triglycerides. In this case, gastric acid will be responsible for less than 30% of lipid hydrolysis. These enzymes are found in the cytoplasm and cell membranes of gastric cells. Gastric lipase is not the primary lipase needed for the majority of triglyceride hydrolysis. Outside of the stomach, gastric lipase can hydrolyze triacylglycerol in the duodenum with the help of other lipases and bile secretion. It is an essential enzyme for hydrolyzing milk fat globule membranes. For a newborn with an underdeveloped pancreas, LIPF plays a more important role in lipid digestion compared to an adult with a fully functioning pancreas. There is typically an increase in production of LIPF when the pancreas is unable to operate at its optimal potential. Low levels of LIPF are typically seen in the tumors of gastric cancer patients. Clinical significance Gastric lipase can partially compensate for the decrease in production of pancreatic lipase associated with pancreatic dysfunction, giving some means for the body to digest lipids. A limitation of acidic lipases is that they remove only one fatty acid from each triacylglycerol. The free fatty acid can readily cross the epithelial membrane lining the gastrointestinal tract, but the diacylglycerol cannot be transported across. This leaves the acidic lipases less efficient than alkaline lipases.  Structure  Gastric lipase is a polypeptide of 371 residues in length. The structure of gastric lipase was determined using X-ray diffraction with a resolution of 3.00 √Ö, and is composed of 41% helices and 14% beta sheets. Gastric lipase belongs to the Œ±/Œ≤-hydrolase-fold family. It possesses a classical catalytic triad (Ser-153, His-353, Asp-324) and an oxyanion hole (backbone NH groups of Gln-154 and Leu-67) analogous to serine proteases.

The flowers are 8 mm diameter, with five yellowish-white petals and 20 yellowish-white stamens; they are produced in corymbs 6‚Äì12 cm diameter in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a pome 7‚Äì8 mm diameter, pale to deep pink with a persistent dark carpel, maturing in late autumn; the fruit stalks are distinctively red. The fruit commonly persist long into the winter after leaf fall; after being softened by frost they are readily eaten by thrushes and waxwings, which disperse the seeds. It is closely related to Sorbus glabrescens, which differs in having more strongly glaucous blue-green leaves with the leaflets broadest near the middle and all about the same size, and white fruit. The two are sometimes treated as conspecific. Both are tetraploid species which breed true without pollination by apomixis. Cultivation and uses Outside of its native range, it is grown as an ornamental tree for its decorative pale pink fruit in western Europe. Selected cultivars include 'Pink Pagoda' and 'November Pink'. In the past, plants in cultivation were commonly misidentified as, or treated as synonyms of, Sorbus hupehensis, a species from further north in China (Hubei) that may be distinguished by its slender shoots and white fruit; it is much less common in cultivation.

She has specialized in dramatic soprano roles and also sings mezzo-soprano roles occasionally. Biography After being educated in the USA, Polaski moved to Europe. Her debut was in 1976 as Senta in Richard Wagner's The Flying Dutchman at the Musiktheater im Revier in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. She subsequently sang on a number of opera stages in Germany (for example, Mannheim, Ulm, Karlsruhe, Darmstadt, Hannover and Freiburg). Her repertoire comprises primarily dramatic soprano roles, such as the Wagnerian roles of Isolde in Tristan und Isolde, Br√ºnnhilde (Der Ring des Nibelungen), Kundry (Parsifal) and Ortrud (Lohengrin), and Richard Strauss' Ariadne auf Naxos and Elektra, Berlioz' Didon and Cassandre (Les Troyens), Berg's Marie (Wozzeck) and Jan√°ƒçek's Kostelniƒçka (Jen≈Øfa). Polaski achieved recognition in 1988 at the Bayreuth Festival in the role of Br√ºnnhilde, conducted by Daniel Barenboim. In November 1988, after a single performance of The Flying Dutchman with the San Francisco Opera, Polaski, a born-again Christian, canceled all her future engagements and announced she would sing only spiritual music. In 1991 she reprised her performance, and under James Levine she sang the role for five consecutive years from 1994. She has appeared as a guest in Amsterdam, at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Berlin State Opera and the Berlin Philharmonic, in Bonn, Chicago, Duisburg, Dresden, Florence, Frankfurt, Geneva, Genoa, Hamburg, Copenhagen and Cologne, at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in London, in Lucerne, Mailand, Mannheim, Montreux and Munich, at the New York Metropolitan Opera and the Carnegie Hall, in Oslo, Paris, Rome, Salzburg, Stuttgart, at the Sydney Festival, in Tokyo, Vienna, Yokohama and Z√ºrich. She made her debut at the Vienna State Opera in 1996 as Br√ºnnhilde; she has also sung Ariadne, Elektra, Marie, Ortrud and Kundry there. She was named an Austrian Kammers√§nger (a title of honor for singers) in 2003. Polaski has also made a name for herself as a Lied and concert singer. The title role of Elektra has been a feature of Polaski's repertoire for years, and she has performed it with major orchestras, directors and conductors (for example, Simone Young, Daniel Barenboim, Lorin Maazel, and Semyon Bychkov).

The Slavic migrations to the area of contemporary Poland started in the second half of the 5th century AD, about a half century after these territories were vacated by Germanic tribes fleeing from the Huns. The first waves of the incoming Slavs settled the vicinity of the upper Vistula River and elsewhere in the lands of present southeastern Poland and southern Masovia. Coming from the east, from the upper and middle regions of the Dnieper River,For genetic evidence see Krzysztof Rƒôba≈Ça et al. Y-STR variation among Slavs: evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin, in Journal of Human Genetics (Springer Japan), May 2007 the immigrants would have had come primarily from the western branch of the early Slavs known as Sclaveni,Byzantine historian Jordanes, Getica and since their arrival are classified as West Slavs and Lechites, who are the closest ancestors of Poles. From there the new population dispersed north and west over the course of the 6th century. The Slavs lived from cultivation of crops and were generally farmers, but also engaged in hunting and gathering. The migrations took place when the destabilizing invasions of Eastern and Central Europe by waves of people and armies from the east, such as the Huns, Avars and Magyars, were occurring. This westward movement of Slavic people was facilitated in part by the previous emigration of Germanic peoples toward the safer areas of Western and Southern Europe. The immigrating Slavs formed various small tribal organizations beginning in the 8th century, some of which coalesced later into larger, state-like ones. Beginning in the 7th century, these tribal units built many fortified structures with earth and wood walls and embankments, called gords. Some of them were developed and inhabited, others had a very large empty area inside the walls. By the 9th century, the West Slavs had settled the Baltic coast in Pomerania, which subsequently developed into a commercial and military power. Along the coastline, remnants of Scandinavian settlements and emporia were to be found. The most important of them was probably the trade settlement and seaport of Truso, located in Prussia. Prussia itself was relatively unaffected by Slavic migration and remained inhabited by Baltic Old Prussians. During the same time, the tribe of the Vistulans (Wi≈õlanie), based in Krak√≥w and the surrounding region, controlled a large area in the south, which they developed and fortified with many strongholds. During the 10th century, the Lechitic Western Polans (Polanie, lit. \\"people of the open fields\\") turned out to be of decisive historic importance. Initially based in the central Polish lowlands around Giecz, Pozna≈Ñ and Gniezno, the Polans went through a period of accelerated building of fortified settlements and territorial expansion beginning in the first half of the 10th century. Under duke Mieszko I of the Piast dynasty, the expanded Polan territory was converted to Christianity in 966, which is generally regarded the birth of the Polish state. The contemporary names of the realm, \\"Mieszko's state\\" or \\"Gniezno state\\", were dropped soon afterwards in favour of \\"Poland\\", a rendering of the Polans' tribal name. The Piast dynasty would continue to rule Poland until the late 14th century.  Origin of the Slavic peoples  = Slavic beginnings of Poland = The origins of the Slavic peoples, who arrived on Polish lands at the outset of the Middle Ages as representatives of the Prague culture, go back to the Kiev culture, which formed beginning early in the 3rd century AD and is genetically derived from the Post-Zarubintsy cultural horizon (Rakhny‚ÄìLjutez‚ÄìPochep material culture sphere) and itself was one of the later post-Zarubintsy culture groups. Such an ethnogenetic relationship is apparent between the large Kiev culture population and the early (6th‚Äì7th centuries) Slavic settlements in the Oder and Vistula basins, but lacking between these Slavic settlements and the older local cultures within the same region, that ceased to exist beginning in the 400‚Äì450 AD period. = Zarubintsy culture = Central and East European cultures ca. 100 AD. The Zarubintsy culture is shown expanding into the Post- Zarubintsy horizon (red), the area where the Proto-Slavic people are thought to have formed. The Zarubintsy culture circle, in existence roughly from 200 BC to 150 AD, extended along the middle and upper Dnieper and its tributary the Pripyat River, but also left traces of settlements in parts of Polesie and the upper Bug River basin. The main distinguished local groups were the Polesie group, the Middle Dnieper group and the Upper Dnieper group. The Zarubintsy culture developed from the Milograd culture in the northern part of its range and from the local Scythian populations in the more southern part. The Polesie group's origin was also influenced by the Pomeranian and Jastorf cultures. The Zarubintsy culture and its beginnings were moderately affected by La T√®ne culture and the Black Sea area (trade with the Greek cities provided imported items) centers of civilization in the earlier stages, but not much by Roman influence later on, and accordingly its economic development was lagging behind that of other early Roman period cultures. Cremation of bodies was practiced, with the human remains and burial gifts including metal decorations, small in number and limited in variety, placed in pits. = Kiev culture = Originating from the Post-Zarubintsy cultures and often considered the oldest Slavic culture, the Kiev culture functioned during the later Roman periods (end of 2nd through mid-5th century) north of the vast Chernyakhov culture territories, within the basins of the upper and middle Dnieper, Desna and Seym rivers. The archeological cultural features of the Kiev sites show this culture to be identical or highly compatible (representing the same cultural model) with that of the 6th-century Slavic societies, including the settlements on the lands of today's Poland. The Kiev culture is known mostly from settlement sites; the burial sites, involving pit graves, are few and poorly equipped. Not many metal objects have been found, despite the known native production of iron and processing of other metals, including enamel coating technology. Clay vessels were made without the potter's wheel. The Kiev culture represented an intermediate level of development, between that of the cultures of the Central European Barbaricum, and the forest zone societies of the eastern part of the continent. The Kiev culture consisted of four local formations: The Middle Dnieper group, the Desna group, the Upper Dnieper group and the Dnieper-Don group. The general model of the Kiev culture is like that of the early Slavic cultures that were to follow and must have originated mainly from the Kiev groups, but evolved probably over a larger territory, stretching west to the base of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains, and from a broader Post-Zarubintsy foundation. The Kiev culture and related groups expanded considerably after 375 AD, when the Ostrogothic state,Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 243 and more broadly speaking the Chernyakhov culture, were destroyed by the Huns.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 277, 303Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski p. 334 This process was facilitated further and gained pace, involving at that time the Kiev's descendant cultures, when the Hun confederation itself broke down in the mid-5th century.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 281, 302, 303, 334, 351 = Written sources = The eastern cradle of the Slavs is also directly confirmed by a written source. The anonymous author known as the Cosmographer of Ravenna (c. 700) names Scythia, a geographic region encompassing vast areas of eastern Europe, as the place \\"where the generations of the Sclaveni had their beginnings\\". Scythia, \\"stretching far and spreading wide\\" in the eastern and southern directions, had at the west end, as seen at the time of Jordanes' writing (first half to mid-6th century) or earlier, \\"the Germans and the river Vistula\\". Jordanes places the Slavs in Scythia as well. = Alternative point of view = According to an alternative theory, popular in the earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures in the area of modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites. A 2011 article on the early Western Slavs states that the transitional period (of relative depopulation) is difficult to evaluate archeologically. Some believe that the Late Antique \\"Germanic\\" populations (in Poland late Przeworsk culture and others) abandoned East Central Europe and were replaced by the Slavs coming from the east, others see the \\"Germanic\\" groups as staying and becoming, or already being, Slavs. Current archeology, says the author, \\"is unable to give a satisfying answer and probably both aspects played a role\\". In terms of their origin, territorial and linguistic, \\"Germanic\\" groups should not be played off against \\"Slavs\\", as our current understanding of the terms may have limited relevance to the complex realities of the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages. Local languages in the region cannot be identified by archeological studies, and genetic evaluation of cremation burial remains has not been possible.  Slavic differentiation and expansion; Prague culture  = Kolochin culture, Penkovka culture and Prague‚ÄìKorchak culture = The final process of the differentiation of the cultures recognized as early Slavic, the Kolochin culture] (over the territory of the Kiev culture), the Penkovka culture and the Prague-Korchak culture, took place during the end of the 4th and in the 5th century CE. Beyond the Post-Zarubintsy horizon, the expanding early Slavs took over much of the territories of the Chernyakhov culture and the Dacian Carpathian Tumuli culture. As not all of the previous inhabitants from those cultures had left the area, they probably contributed some elements to the Slavic cultures. The Prague culture developed over the western part of the Slavic expansion within the basins of the middle Dnieper River, Pripyat River and upper Dniester up to the Carpathian Mountains and in southeastern Poland, i.e., the upper and middle Vistula basin. This culture was responsible for most of the growth in 6th and 7th centuries, by which time it also encompassed the middle Danube and middle Elbe basins. The Prague culture very likely corresponds to the Sclaveni referred to by Jordanes, whose area he described as extending west to the Vistula sources. The Penkovka culture people inhabited the southeastern part, from Seversky Donets to the lower Danube (including the region where the Antes would be), and the Kolochin culture was located north of the more eastern area of the Penkovka culture (the upper Dnieper and Desna basins). The Korchak type designates the eastern part of the Prague-Korchak culture, which was somewhat less directly dependent on the mother Kiev culture than its two sister cultures because of its western expansion. The early 6th-century Slavic settlements covered an area three times the size of the Kiev culture region some hundred years earlier.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 327, 334, 351 = Early settlements, economy and burials in Poland = Slavic archaeological cultures c. 700 AD In Poland, the earliest archeological sites considered Slavic include a limited number of 6th-century settlements and a few isolated burial sites. The material obtained there consists mostly of simple, manually formed ceramics, typical of the entire early Slavic area. It is on the basis of the different varieties of these basic clay pots and infrequent decorations that the three cultures are distinguished.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 333, 334 The largest of the earliest Slavic (Prague culture) settlement sites in Poland that have been subjected to systematic research is located in Bach√≥rz, Rzesz√≥w County, and dates to the second half of 5th through 7th centuries. It consisted of 12 nearly square, partially dug-out houses, each covering the area of 6.2 to 19.8 (14.0 on the average) square meters. A stone furnace was usually placed in a corner, which is typical for Slavic homesteads of that period, but clay ovens and centrally located hearths are also found. 45 newer dwellings of a different type from the 7th/8th to 9th/10th centuries have also been discovered in the vicinity.The web site of the Institute of Archeology, Jagiellonian University ‚Äì Bach√≥rzU ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 124, Micha≈Ç Parczewski Poorly developed handicraft and limited resources for metal working are characteristic of the communities of all early Slavic cultures. There were no major iron production centers, but metal founding techniques were known; among the metal objects occasionally found are iron knives and hooks, as well as bronze decorative items (as can be found in 7th-century finds in Haƒáki, Bielsk Podlaski County, a site of one of the earliest fortified settlements). The inventories of the typical small open settlements also normally include various utensils made of stone, horn and clay (including weights used for weaving). The settlements were arranged as clusters of cabins along river or stream valleys, but above their flood levels, they were usually irregular and typically faced south. The wooden frame or pillar-supported square houses covered with a straw roof had each sides of 2.5 to 4.5 meters in length. Fertile lowlands were sought, but also forested areas with diversified plant and animal environment to provide additional sustenance. The settlements were self-sufficient; the early Slavs functioned without significant long-distance trade. Potter's wheels were used from the turn of the 7th century on. Some villages larger than a few homes have been discovered in the Krak√≥w-Nowa Huta region from the 6th to 9th century, for example a complex of 11 settlements on the left bank of the Vistula in the direction of Igo≈Çomia. The original furnishings of Slavic huts are difficult to determine, because equipment was often made of perishable materials such as wood, leather or fabrics. Free- standing clay dome stoves for bread baking have been found on some locations. Another large 6th‚Äì to 9th-century settlement complex existed in the vicinity of G≈Çog√≥w in Silesia.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 334‚Äì337U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 123‚Äì126, Micha≈Ç ParczewskiS≈Çowianie nad BzurƒÖ by Marek Dulinicz and Felix Biermann, Archeologia ≈ªywa, issue 1 (16) 2001 The Slavic people cremated their dead, typical for the inhabitants of their region for centuries. The burials were usually single, the graves grouped in small cemeteries, with the ashes placed in simple urns more often than in ground indentations. The number of burial sites found is small in relation to the known settlement density. The food production economy was based on millet and wheat cultivation, hunting, fishing, gathering and cattle breeding (swine, sheep and goats bred to a lesser extent). = Geographic expansion in Poland and Central Europe = The earliest Slavic settlers from the east reached southeastern Poland in the second half of the 5th century, specifically the San River basin, then the upper Vistula regions, including the Krak√≥w area and Nowy SƒÖcz Valley. Single early sites are also known around Sandomierz and Lublin in Masovia and Upper Silesia. Somewhat younger settlement concentrations were discovered in Lower Silesia. In the 6th century, the above areas were settled. At the end of this century, or in the early 7th century, the Slavic newcomers reached Western Pomerania. According to the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, the Slavs captured in Constantinople in 592 named the Baltic Sea coastal area as the place from which they originated.Michael and Mary Whitby (trans.), The History of Theophylact Simocatta: An English Translation with Introduction, Oxford University Press, 1986, As of that time and in the following decades, Western Pomerania, plus some of Greater Poland, Lower Silesia and some areas west of the middle and lower Oder River made up the Sukow-Dziedzice culture group. Its origin is the subject of debate among archeologists. First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived from any other Slavic archeological culture. They reveal certain similarities to the artifacts of the Dobrodzie≈Ñ group of the Przeworsk culture. According to scholars such as Siedow, Kurnatowska and Brzostowicz, it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition. According to allochthonists, it represents a variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage. The Sukow-Dziedzice group shows significant idiosyncrasies, such as no graves and (typical for the rest of the Slavic world) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span. This particular pattern of expansion into the lands of Poland and then Germany Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 327, 337‚Äì338 was a part of the great Slavic migration during the 5th-7th centuries from originating lands in the east to various countries of Central and Southeastern Europe.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, pp. 337‚Äì338U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 126‚Äì127, Micha≈Ç Parczewski Another 6th-century route, more southern, took the Prague culture of the Slavs through Slovakia, Moravia and Bohemia. The Slavs also reached the eastern Alps and populated the Elbe and the Danube basins, from where they moved south to occupy the Balkans as far as Peloponnese. = Ancient and early Medieval written accounts of the Slavs = Besides the Baltic Veneti (see Poland in Antiquity article), ancient and medieval authors speak of the East European, or Slavic Venethi. It can be inferred from Tacitus' description in Germania that his \\"Venethi\\" possibly lived around the middle Dnieper basin,Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 259, 350 which in his times would correspond to the Proto-Slavic Zarubintsy cultural sphere. Jordanes, to whom the Venethi meant Slavs, wrote of past fighting between the Ostrogoths and the Venethi that took place during the third quarter of the 4th century in today's Ukraine.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 102, Tadeusz Makiewicz At that time, the Venethi therefore would have been people of the Kiev culture. The Venethi, Jordanes reported, \\"now rage in war far and wide, in punishment for our sins\\", and were at that time made obedient to the Gothic king Hermanaric. Jordanes' 6th-century description of the \\"populous race of the Venethi\\" includes indications of their dwelling places in the regions near the northern ridge of the Carpathian Mountains and stretching from there \\"almost endlessly\\" east, while in the western direction reaching the sources of the Vistula. More specifically, he designates the area between the Vistula and the lower Danube as the country of the Sclaveni. \\"They have swamps and forests for their cities\\" (hi paludes silvasque pro civitatibus habent),De origine actibusque Getarum, the Latin Library at Ad Fontes Academy web page he added sarcastically. The \\"bravest of these peoples\\", the Antes, settled the lands between the Dniester and the Dnieper rivers. The Venethi were the third Slavic branch of an unspecified location (most likely of the Kolochin culture), as well as the overall designation for the totality of the Slavic peoples, who \\"though off-shoots from one stock, have now three names\\". Procopius in De Bello Gothico located the \\"countless Antes tribes\\" even further east, beyond the Dnieper. Together with the Sclaveni, they spoke the same language, of an \\"unheard of barbarity\\". According to Jordanes, the Heruli nation traveled in 512 across all of the Sclaveni peoples territories, and then west of there through a large expanse of unpopulated lands, as the Slavs were about to settle the western and northern parts of Poland in the decades to follow. All of the above is in good accordance with the findings of today's archeology.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 250, 329, 330, 333, 350, 352U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 122, 123, 126, Micha≈Ç Parczewski Byzantine writers held the Slavs in low regard for the simple life they led and also for their supposedly limited combat abilities, but in fact they were already a threat to the Danubian boundaries of the Empire in the early 6th century, where they waged plundering expeditions. Procopius, the anonymous author of Strategicon, and Theophylact Simocatta wrote at some length on how to deal with the Slavs militarily, which suggests that they had become a formidable adversary. John of Ephesus actually goes as far as saying in the last quarter of the 6th century that the Slavs had learned to conduct war better than the Byzantine army. The Balkan Peninsula was indeed soon overrun by the Slavic invaders during the first half of the 7th century under Emperor Heraclius. The above- mentioned authors provide various details on the character, living conditions, social structure and economic activities of the early Slavic people, some of which are confirmed by the archeological discoveries in Poland, since the Slavic communities were quite similar all over their range. Their uniform Old Slavic language remained in use until the 9th to 12th centuries, depending on the region. The Greek missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius from Thessaloniki, where \\"everybody fluently spoke Slavic\\", were expected to be able to communicate in distant Moravia without any difficulty when sent there in 863 by the Byzantine ruler.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 124, 126, Micha≈Ç Parczewski =Invasions of the Avars in Europe and their presence in Poland= In the 6th century, the Turkic-speaking nomadic Avars moved into the middle Danube area. Twice (in 562 and 566‚Äì567), the Avars undertook military expeditions against the Franks, and their routes went through the Polish lands. The Avar envoys bribed Slavic chiefs from the lands they did not control, including Pomerania, to secure their participation in Avar raids, but other than that, the exact nature of their relations with the Slavs in Poland is not known. The Avars had some presence or contacts in Poland also in the 7th and 8th centuries, when they left artifacts in the Krak√≥w-Nowa Huta region and elsewhere, including a bronze belt decoration found in the Krakus Mound. This last item, from the turn of the 8th century, is used to date the mound itself.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 141, Zofia KurnatowskaKaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, pp. 338‚Äì339  Tribal differentiation  Pagan cult wall (8-9th century BC) in ≈Åysa G√≥ra = 8th- century settlements = With the major population shifts of the Slavic migrations completed, the 8th century brought a measure of stability to the Slavic people settled in Poland. About one million people actively utilized no more than 20‚Äì25% of the land; the rest was mainly forest. Normal settlements, with the exception of a few fortifications and cult venues, were limited to lowland areas below 350 meters above the sea level. Most villages built without artificial defensive structures were located within valley areas of natural bodies of water. The Slavs were very familiar with the water environment and used it as natural defense. The living and economic activity structures were either distributed randomly or arranged in rows or around a central empty lot. The larger settlements could have had over a dozen homesteads and be occupied by 50 to 80 residents, but more typically there were just several homes with no more than 30 inhabitants. From the 7th century on, the previously common semi-subterranean dwellings were being replaced by buildings wholly above the surface, but still consisted of just one room. Pits were dug for storage and other uses. As the Germanic people before them, the Slavs left vacant regions between developed areas for separation from strangers and to avoid conflicts, especially along the limits of their tribal territories. = Gord construction = Slavic peoples around the 8th and 9th centuries The Polish tribes did build more imposing structures than the simple dwellings in their small communities: fortified settlements and other reinforced enclosures of the gord (Polish \\"gr√≥d\\") type. These were established on naturally suitable, defense-enhancing sites beginning in the late 6th or 7th century. Szeligi near P≈Çock and Haƒáki are the early examples.Kaczanowski, Koz≈Çowski, p. 339 A large-scale building effort took place in the 8th century. The gords were differently designed and of various sizes, from small to impressively massive. Ditches, walls, palisades and embankments were used to strengthen the perimeter, which often involved a complicated earthwork besides wood and stone construction. Gords of the tribal period were irregularly distributed across the country (there were fewer larger ones in Lesser Poland, but more smaller ones in central and northern Poland), and could cover an area from 0.1 to 25 hectares. They could have a simple or multi-segment architecture and be protected by fortifications of different types. Some were permanently occupied by a substantial number of people or by a chief and his cohort of armed men, while others were utilized as refuges to protect the local population in case of external danger. Beginning in the 9th century, the gords became the nuclei of future urban developments, attracting tradesmen of all kinds, especially in strategic locations. Gords erected in the 8th century have been researched extensively, for example the ones in Miƒôdzy≈õwieƒá (Cieszyn County, Go≈Çƒôszyce tribe) and Naszacowice (Nowy SƒÖcz County). The last one was destroyed and rebuilt four times, with the final reconstruction completed after 989. A monumental and technically complex border protection area gord of over 3 hectares in size was built around 770‚Äì780 in Trzcinica near Jas≈Ço on the site of an old Bronze Age era stronghold, probably the seat of a local ruler and his garrison. Thousands of relics were found there, including a silver treasure of 600 pieces. The gord was set afire several times and ultimately destroyed during the first half of the 11th century.Muzeum Podkarpackie (Sub-Carpathian Museum) in Krosno web site, Jan Gancarski This larger scale building activity, from the mid-8th century on, was a manifestation of the emergence of tribal organisms, a new civilizational quality that represented rather efficient proto-political organizations and social structures on a new level. They were based on these fortifications, defensive objects, of which the mid-8th century and later Vistulan gords in Lesser Poland are a good example. The threat coming from the Avar state in Pannonia could have had provided the original motivation for the construction projects.Jerzy Wyrozumski ‚Äì Dzieje Polski piastowskiej (VIII w. ‚Äì 1370) (History of Piast Poland (8th century ‚Äì 1370)), Fogra, Krak√≥w 1999, , p. 47 = Society organized into larger tribal units = From the 8th century on, the Slavs in Poland increasingly organized themselves in larger structures known as \\"great tribes,\\" either through voluntary or forced association. The population was primarily involved in agricultural pursuits. Fields were cultivated as well as gardens within settlements. Plowing was done using oxen and wooden plows reinforced with iron. Forest burning was used to increase the arable area, but also to provide fertilizer, as the ashes lasted in that capacity for several seasons. Rotation of crops was practiced as well as the winter/spring crop system. After several seasons of exploitation, the land was being left idle to regain fertility. Wheat, millet and rye were most important crops; other cultivated plant species included oat, barley, pea, broad bean, lentil, flax and hemp, as well as apple, pear, plum, peach and cherry trees in fruit orchards. Beginning in the 8th century, swine gradually became economically more important than cattle; sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, chickens, geese and ducks were also kept. The agricultural practices of the Slavs are known from archeological research, which documents progressive increases over time in arable area and resulting deforestation,U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 148, Zofia Kurnatowska and from written reports provided by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, a 10th-century Jewish traveler. Ibrahim described also other features of Slavic life, for example the use of steam baths. The existence of bath structures has been confirmed by archeology.Nauka w Polsce (Science in Poland), internet service of the Polish Press Agency, Sept. 6, 2010 article by Szymon Zdzieb≈Çowski An anonymous Arab writer from the turn of the 10th century mentions that the Slavic people made an alcoholic beverage out of honey and their celebrations were accompanied by music played on the lute, tambourines and wind instruments. Gathering, hunting and fishing were still essential as sources of food and materials such as hide or fur. The forest was also exploited as a source of building materials such as wood. In addition, wild forest bees were kept there, and the forest could be used as a place of refuge.Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, p. 49 Until the 9th century, the population was separated from the main centers of civilization and self- sufficient with primitive, local community and household-based manufacturing. Specialized craftsmen existed only in the fields of iron extraction from ore and processing, and pottery; the few luxury items used were imports. From the 7th century on, modestly decorated ceramics were made with the potter's wheel. 7th‚Äì to 9th-century collections of objects have been found in Bonikowo and Bruszczewo, Ko≈õcian County (iron spurs, knives, clay containers with some ornamentation) and in the Krak√≥w-Nowa Huta region (weapons and utensils in Plesz√≥w and Mogi≈Ça), among other places. Slavic warriors were traditionally armed with spears, bows and wooden shields. Axes were used later, and still swords of the types popular throughout 7th‚Äì to 9th-century Europe were also used. Independent of distant powers, the Slavic tribes in Poland lived a relatively undisturbed life, but at the cost of some backwardness in civilization. A qualitative change took place in the 9th century, when the Polish lands were crossed again by long-distance trade routes. Pomerania become a part of the Baltic trade zone, while Lesser Poland participated in trade centered in the Danubian countries. In the Upper Vistula basin, Oriental silver jewelry and Arab coins, often cut into pieces, \\"grzywna\\" iron coin equivalents (of the type used in Great Moravia) and even linen cloths served as currency. The basic social unit was the nuclear family, consisting of parents and their children, which had to fit in a dwelling area of several to 25 square meters. The \\"big family,\\" a patriarchal, multi-generational group of related families with the meaning of a kin or clan, was of declining importance during this period. A larger group was needed in the past (5th‚Äì7th centuries) for forest clearing and burning undertakings, when farming communities had to shift from location to location; in the 8th-century phase of agriculture, a family was sufficient to take care of their arable land.Jerzy Wyrozumski ‚Äì Historia Polski do roku 1505 (History of Poland until 1505), Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe (Polish Scientific Publishers PWN), Warszawa 1986, , p. 73 A concept of agricultural land ownership was gradually developing, at this point a family, not individual prerogative. Several or more clan territories were grouped into a neighborhood association, or \\"opole\\", which established a rudimentary self-government. Such a community was the owner of forested land, pastures, bodies of water and within it took place the first organization around common projects and the related development of political power. A big and resourceful opole could become, by extending its possessions, a proto-state entity vaguely referred to as a tribe.Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, p. 50, concerning land ownership and evolution of \\"opole\\" The tribe was the top level of this structure. It would contain several opoles and control a region of up to about 1500 square kilometers, where internal relationships were arbitrated and external defense organized. A general assembly of all tribesmen took care of the most pressing of issues. Thietmar of Merseburg wrote in the early 11th century of the Veleti, a tribe of Polabian Slavs, with a report that their assembly kept deliberating till everybody agreed, but this \\"war democracy\\" was gradually being replaced by a government system in which the tribal elders and rulers had the upper hand. This development facilitated the coalescing of tribes into \\"great tribes,\\" some of which under favorable conditions would later become tribal states. The communal and tribal democracy, with self-imposed contributions by the community members, survived in small entities and local territorial subunits the longest. On a larger scale, it was being replaced by the rule of able leaders and then dominant families, ultimately leading inevitably to hereditary transition of supreme power, mandatory taxation, service etc.Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, pp. 50‚Äì52 When social and economic evolution reached this level, the concentration of power was facilitated and made possible to sustain by parallel development of a professional military force (called at this stage \\"dru≈ºyna\\") at the ruler's or chief's disposal.Jerzy Wyrozumski ‚Äì Historia Polski do roku 1505, p. 66 = Burials and religion = Burial customs, at least in southern Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes was placed on the mound or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one from the end of the 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 125, 133, Micha≈Ç Parczewski According to Procopius, the Slavs believed in one god, the creator of lightning and master of the entire universe, to whom all sacrificial animals (and sometimes people) were offered. The highest god was called Svarog throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names.Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, p. 56 Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, who were all venerated and appeased by offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such beliefs and practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 125, Micha≈Ç ParczewskiU ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 134, Stanis≈Çaw Rosik The Slavs erected sanctuaries, created statues and other sculptures, including the four-faced Svetovid, whose carvings symbolize various aspects of the Slavic cosmology model. One 9th-century specimen from the Zbruch River in modern Ukraine, found in 1848, is on display at the Archeological Museum in Krak√≥w. Many of the sacred locations and objects were identified outside Poland, for example in northeastern Germany or Ukraine. In Poland, religious activity sites have been investigated in northwestern Pomerania, including Szczecin, where a three-headed deity once stood, and the Wolin island, where 9th‚Äì to 11th-century cult figurines were found.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 134‚Äì135, Stanis≈Çaw Rosik Archeologically confirmed cult places and figures have also been researched at several other locations.Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, pp. 54‚Äì59  Early Slavic states and other 9th-century developments  = Samo's realm = The first Slavic state-like entity, the realm of King Samo, originally a Frankish trader, flourished close to Poland in Bohemia and Moravia, parts of Pannonia and more southern regions between the Oder and Elbe rivers. It during the period 623‚Äì658.Kalendarium dziej√≥w Polski (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, p. 21, Jacek Poleski Samo became a Slavic leader by helping the Slavs defend themselves successfully against Avar assailants. What Samo led was probably a loose alliance of tribes, and it fell apart after his death. Slavic Carantania, centered on Krnski Grad (now Karnburg in Austria), was more of a real state, developed possibly from one part of the disintegrating Samo's kingdom, but lasted under a native dynasty throughout the 8th century and became Christianized. = Great Moravia and the establishment of a written Slavic language = The lands of the West Slavs as specified in a historical map often reproduced in the 20th century Larger scale state-generating processes developed in Slavic areas in the 9th century. Great Moravia, the most prominent Slavic state of the era, became established in the early 9th century south of modern Poland. The original lands of Great Moravia included what is now Moravia and western Slovakia, plus parts of Bohemia, Pannonia and southern regions of Lesser Poland. The glory of the Great Moravian empire became fully apparent in light of archeological discoveries; lavishly equipped burials are especially spectacular. Such finds do not extend to the lands that now constitute southern Poland, however. The great territorial expansion of Great Moravia took place during the reign of Svatopluk I at the end of the 9th century. The Moravian state collapsed quite suddenly; in 906, weakened by an internal crisis and Magyar invasions, it ceased to exist entirely. In 831, Mojmir I was baptized, and his Moravian state became a part of the Bavarian Passau diocese. Aiming to achieve ecclesiastical as well as political independence from East Frankish influence, his successor Rastislav asked the Byzantine emperor Michael III for missionaries. As a result, Cyril and Methodius arrived in Moravia in 863 and commenced missionary activities among the Slavic people there. To further their goals, the brothers developed a written Slavic liturgical language: Old Church Slavonic, which employed the Glagolitic alphabet created by them. They translated the Bible and other church texts into this language, thus establishing a foundation for the later Slavic Eastern Orthodox churches. = The Czech state = The fall of Great Moravia made room for the expansion of the Czech or Bohemian state, which likewise incorporated some of the Polish lands. The founder of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty, Prince Bo≈ôivoj, was baptized by Methodius in the Slavic rite during the later part of the 9th century and settled in Prague. His son and successor Spytihnƒõv was baptized in Regensburg in the Latin rite, which marks the early stage of East Frankish/German influence in Bohemian affairs, which was destined to be decisive.Europe: A History by Norman Davies, p. 324, 1998 New York, HarperPerennial, Borivoj's grandson Prince Wenceslaus, the future Czech martyr and patron saint, was killed, probably in 935, by his brother Boleslaus. Boleslaus I solidified the power of the Prague princes and most likely dominated the Vistulan and Lendian tribes of Lesser Poland and at least parts of Silesia. = 9th-century Polish lands = In the 9th century the Polish lands were still on the peripheries of medieval Europe as regards its major powers and events, but a measure of progress did take place in levels of civilization, as evidenced by the number of gords built, kurgans raised and movable equipment used. The tribal elites must have been influenced by the relative closeness of the Carolingian Empire; objects crafted there have occasionally been found.Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, pp. 52‚Äì54 Poland was populated by many tribes of various sizes. The names of some of them, mostly from the western part of the country, are known from written sources, especially a Latin document written in the mid-9th century by the anonymous Bavarian Geographer. During this period, smaller tribal structures were disintegrating while larger ones were being established in their place. Characteristic of the turn of the 10th century in most Polish tribal settlement areas was a particular intensification of gord building activity. The gords were the centers of social and political life. Tribal leaders and elders had their headquarters in their protected environment and some of the tribal general assemblies took place inside them. Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity, while the gords themselves were frequently visited by traders and artisans. = The Vistulan state = Krakus Mound A major development of the 9th century period concerns the somewhat enigmatic Wi≈õlanie, or Vistulans (Bavarian Geographer's Vuislane) tribe. The Vistulans of western Lesser Poland, mentioned in several contemporary written sources, were already a large tribal union in the first half of the 9th century. In the second half of the century, they were evolving into a super-tribal state until their efforts were terminated by more powerful neighbors from the south. Krak√≥w, the main town of the Vistulans, with its Wawel gord, was located along a major \\"international\\" trade route. The main Vistulan-related archeological find is a late 9th-century treasure of iron-ax shaped grzywnas, well known as currency units in Great Moravia. They were discovered in 1979 in a wooden chest below the basement of a medieval house on Kanonicza Street in Krak√≥w near the Vistula River and Wawel Hill. The total weight of the iron material is 3630 kilograms and the individual bars of various sizes (4212 of them) were bound in bundles, which suggests that the package was being readied for transportation.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 140‚Äì141, Zofia Kurnatowska Other finds include the 8th-century Krakus, Wanda and other large burial mounds, and the remnants of several gords)Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, p. 52 Vistulan gords, built from the mid-8th century on, were typically very large, often over 10 hectares in size. About 30 big ones are known. The 9th-century gords in Lesser Poland and in Silesia were likely built as a defense against Great Moravian military expansion.Kalendarium dziej√≥w Polski (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, p. 24, Jacek Poleski The largest one, in Strad√≥w, Kazimierza Wielka County, had an area of 25 hectares and walls or embankments 18 meters high, but parts of this giant structure were probably built later. The gords were often located along the northern slope of the western Carpathian Mountains, on hills or hillsides. The buildings inside the walls were sparsely located or altogether absent, so for the most part, the role of the gords seems to have been something other than that of settlements or administrative centers. Large mounds up to 50 meters in diameter are found not only in Krak√≥w, but also in Przemy≈õl and Sandomierz. among other places (about 20 total). They were probably funeral locations of rulers or chiefs, with the actual burial site, on the top of the mound, long lost.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 133, Micha≈Ç Parczewski Besides the mounds, the degree of gord development and the grzywna treasure point to Krak√≥w as the main center of Vistulan power (instead of Wi≈õlica, as also suspected in the past). The most important written references to Vistulans come from The Life of Saint Methodius, also known as \\"The Pannonian Legend\\", most likely written by disciples of Methodius right after his death in 885.Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, p. 66 The fragment speaks of a very powerful pagan prince who resided in the Vistulan country, reviled the Christians and caused them great harm. He was warned by emissaries speaking on behalf of the missionary and advised to reform and voluntarily accept baptism in his own homeland. Otherwise, it was predicted, he would be forced to do so in a foreign land. According to the Pannonian Legend, that is exactly what eventually did happen. This passage is widely interpreted as an indication that the Vistulans were invaded and overrun by the army of Great Moravia and their pagan prince captured. This would have had to have happened during Methodius' second stay in Moravia, between 873 and 885, during the reign of Svatopluk I. A Vistulan stronghold in Wi≈õlica once stood here A further elaboration on this story is possibly found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kad≈Çubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, entered through Moravia as if it were a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Krak√≥w area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Krak√≥w's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events. East of the Vistulans, eastern Lesser Poland was the territory of the Lendian tribe (Lƒôdzianie, the Bavarian Geographer's \\"Lendizi\\"). In the mid-10th century Constantine VII wrote their name as Lendzaneoi. The Lendians had to be a very substantial tribe, since the names for Poland in the Lithuanian and Hungarian languages and for the Poles in medieval Ruthenian all begin with the letter \\"L\\" and are derived from the name of this tribe. The Poles historically have also referred to themselves as \\"Lechici\\". After the fall of Great Moravia, the Magyars controlled at least part of the territory of the Lendians. They were conquered by Kievan Rus' during 930‚Äì940. At the end of the 10th century, the Lendian lands became divided; the western part was taken by Poland, the eastern portion retained by Kievan Rus'.Kalendarium dziej√≥w Polski (Chronology of Polish History), ed. Andrzej Chwalba, pp. 25‚Äì26, Jacek Poleski The Vistulans were probably also subjected to Magyar raids as an additional layer of embankments was often added to the gord fortifications in the early part of the 10th century. In the early or mid-10th century, the Vistulan entity, like Silesia, was incorporated by Boleslaus I of Bohemia into the Czech state. This association turned out to be beneficial in terms of economic development, because Krak√≥w was an important station on the Prague‚ÄîKiev trade route. The first known Christian church structures were erected on Wawel Hill. Later in the 10th century, under uncertain circumstances, but in a peaceful way (the gord network suffered no damage on this occasion), the Vistulans became a part of the Piast Polish state. = The Baltic coast = In terms of economic and general civilizational achievement, the most advanced region that corresponds to the modern boundaries of Poland in the 9th century was Pomerania. It was also characterized by the most extensive contacts with the external world, and accordingly, the greatest cultural richness and diversity. Pomerania was a favorite destination for traders and other entrepreneurs from distant lands, some of whom established local manufacturing and trade centers; those were usually accompanied by nearby gords inhabited by the local elite. Some of these complexes gave rise to early towns or urban centers such as Wolin, Pyrzyce or Szczecin. The Bavarian Geographer mentioned two tribes, the Velunzani (\\"Uelunzani\\") and Pyritzans (\\"Prissani\\") in the area, each with 70 towns. Despite the high level of economic advancement, no social structures indicative of statehood developed in Farther Pomeranian societies, except for the Wolin city-state.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 136‚Äì140, Zofia Kurnatowska The Wolin settlement was established on the island of the same name in the late 8th century. Located at the mouth of the Oder River, Wolin from the beginning was involved with long distance Baltic Sea trade. The settlement, thought to be identical with both Vineta and Jomsborg, was pagan, multiethnic, and readily kept accepting newcomers, especially craftsmen and other professionals, from all over the world. Being located on a major intercontinental sea route, it soon became a major European industrial and trade power. Writing in the 11th century, Adam of Bremen recognized Wolin as one of the largest European cities, inhabited by honest, good-natured and hospitable Slavic people, together with other nationalities, from Greeks to barbarians, including the Saxons, as long as they did not demonstrate their Christianity too openly. Wolin was the major stronghold of the Volinian tribal territory, comprising the island and a broad stretch of the adjacent mainland, with its frontier guarded by a string of gords. The city's peak of prosperity occurred around and after year 900, when a new seaport was built (the municipal complex had now four of them) and the metropolitan area was secured by walls and embankments. The archeological findings there include a great variety of imported goods (even from the Far East) and locally manufactured products and raw materials; amber and precious metals figure prominently, as jewelry was one of the mainstay economic activities of the Wolinian elite. Truso in Prussia was another Baltic seaport and trade emporium known from the reworking of Orosius' universal history by Alfred the Great. King Alfred included a description of a voyage undertaken around 890 by Wulfstan from the Danish port of Hedeby to Truso, which is located near the mouth of the Vistula. Wulfstan gave a rather detailed description of the location of Truso, within the land of the Aesti, yet close to the Slavic areas west of the Vistula. Truso's actual site was discovered in 1982 at Jan√≥w Pomorski, near ElblƒÖg.Truso by Marek Jagodzi≈Ñski of the Archeological-Historical Museum in ElblƒÖg, from Pradzieje.pl web site Established as a seaport by the Vikings and Danish traders at the end of the 8th century in the Prussian border area previously already explored by the Scandinavians, Truso lasted as a major city and commercial center until the early 11th century, when it was destroyed and replaced in that capacity by Gda≈Ñsk. The settlement covered an area of 20 hectares and consisted of a two- dock seaport, the craft-trade portion, and the peripheral residential development, all protected by a wood and earth bulwark separating it from the mainland. The port-trade and craftsmen zones were themselves separated by a fire control ditch with water flowing through it. There were several rows of houses, including long Viking hall structures, waterside warehouses, market areas and wooden beam covered streets. Numerous relics were found there, including weights used also as currency units, coins (from English to Arab) and workshops processing metal, jewelry or large quantities of amber. Remnants of long Viking boats were also found, the whole complex being a testimony to Viking preoccupation with commerce, the mainstay of their activities around the Baltic Sea region. The multi-ethnic Truso had extensive trade contacts not only with distant lands and Scandinavia, but also the Slavic areas located to the south and west of it, from where ceramics and other products were transported along the Vistula in river crafts. Ironically, Truso's sudden destruction by fire and subsequent disappearance was apparently a result of a Viking raid.Truso ‚Äì zaginiony port by Andrzej Markert from \\"Sprawy nauki\\" web siteTruso ‚Äì emporium Wiking√≥w an interview with Marek Jagodzi≈Ñski by Arkadiusz Szaraniec from \\"Travel Polska\\" web site This connection to the Baltic trade zone led to an establishment of inner-Slavic long-distance trade routes. Lesser Poland participated in exchange centered in the Danubian countries. Oriental silver jewelry and Arab coins, often cut into pieces, \\"grzywna\\" iron coin equivalents (of the type used in Great Moravia) in the Upper Vistula basin and even linen cloths served as currency. = Magyar intrusion = The Magyars were at first yet another wave of nomadic invaders. Of the Uralic languages family, coming from northwestern Siberia, they migrated south and west, occupying the Pannonian Basin from the end of the 9th century. From there, until the second half of the 10th century, when they were forced to settle, they raided and pillaged vast areas of Europe, including Poland. A saber and ornamental elements were found in a Hungarian warrior's grave from the first half of the 10th century in the Przemy≈õl area. Geographically, the Magyar invasions interfered with the previously highly influential contacts between Central Europe and centers of Byzantine Christianity. It may have been the decisive factor that steered Poland toward the Western (Latin) branch of Christianity by the time of its adoption in 966.A Traveller's History of Poland, by John Radzilowski, p. 16; Northampton, Mass.: Interlink Books, 2007,  10th-century developments in Greater Poland; Mieszko's state  = Tribal Greater Poland = The 10th century brought a notable development in the form of settlement stability on Polish lands. Short-lived prehistoric settlements gradually gave way to villages on fixed sites. The number of villages grew with time, but their sites rarely shifted. The population distribution patterns established from that century on are evident on today's landscape. Sources from the 9th and 10th centuries make no mention of the Polan (Polanie) tribe. The closest thing would be the huge (400 gords) Glopeani tribe of the Bavarian Geographer, whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake Gop≈Ço, but archeological investigations cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gop≈Ço area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle Obra River basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the Warta River. There was the Gniezno area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the Lech Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole in the cultural, or settlement pattern sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the Piast House, which resulted in the early part of the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 141, Zofia Kurnatowska = Mieszko's state and its origins = What was later to be called the Gniezno state, also known as Mieszko's state, was first expanded at the expense of the subdued tribes in the era of Mieszko's father and grandfather. Writing around 965 or 966 Ibrahim ibn Yaqub described the country of Mieszko, \\"the king of the North\\", as the most wide-ranging of the Slavic lands. Mieszko, the ruler of the Slavs, was also mentioned as such at that time by Widukind of Corvey in his Res gestae saxonicae. In its mature form, this state included the West Slavic lands between the Oder and Bug rivers and between the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian Mountains, including the economically crucial mouth areas of the Vistula and Oder rivers, as well as Lesser Poland and Silesia. The name of Poles (Polanians, Polyans, Polans) appears in writing for the first time around year 1000, just like the country's name Poland (Latinized as Polonia). \\"Polanie\\" was possibly the name given by later historians to the inhabitants of Greater Poland (a presumed tribe not mentioned in earlier sources). 10th-century inhabitants of Greater Poland would originate from tribes not known by name that were instrumental in bringing about the establishment of the Polish state; one such tribe had to constitute the immediate power base of Mieszko's predecessors, if not Mieszko himself. = The account of Gallus Anonymus vs. archeology = In the early 12th century, the chronicler Gallus Anonymus wrote down or invented a legend about the Piast dynasty. Amid miraculous details, the story offers the names of the supposed ancestors of the royal family, beginning with a man named Cho≈õcisko, the father of the central figure Piast the Wheelwright, who was a humble farmer living in Gniezno and married to Rzepka. According to Gallus, the male heads of the Piast clan following after him were Siemowit, Lestek, Siemomys≈Ç and Mieszko I, the first \\"Piast\\" known with historic certainty. Gallus expressed his own misgivings concerning the trustworthiness of the royal story he passed on, but he did consider the sequence of the last three names of Mieszko's predecessors to be reliable.Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, pp. 69‚Äì70 The results of archeological studies of 9th- and 10th- century gords in Greater Poland are at odds with the timing of this story. There was no Gniezno settlement in the 9th century; there was a pagan cult site there beginning only at the turn of the 10th century. The Gniezno gord was built around year 940, possibly because the location, of great spiritual importance to the tribal community, would rally the local population around its building and defense.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 146‚Äì147, Zofia Kurnatowska = The early Piast state and its expansion = Remnants of the Piast gord in Giecz Under the old tribal system, the tribal assembly elected a chief in case of an external threat to lead the defense effort, and it was a temporarily granted authority. The Piast clan was able to replace this practice in the Gniezno area with a hereditary ruler, in line with trends in other locations at the time. This allowed the Piast clan to create a state that they could over generations.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 147‚Äì148, Zofia Kurnatowska The development of the Piast state can be traced to some degree by following the disappearance of the old tribal gords, many of them built in Greater Poland during the later part of the 9th century and soon thereafter, which were destroyed by the advancing Gniezno tribal population. The gords in Sp≈Çawie, Wrze≈õnia County and in Daleszyn, Gosty≈Ñ County, for example, both built soon after 899, were attacked and taken over by the Piast state forces, the first one burned during the initial period of the armed expansion. The old gords were often rebuilt or replaced beginning in the first decades of the 10th century by new, large and massively reinforced Piast gords. Connected by water communication lines, the powerful gords of the mid-10th century served as the main concentrations of forces of the emerging state.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 147‚Äì149, Zofia Kurnatowska Parallel with the gord building activity of ca. 920-50, the Piasts undertook military expansion by crossing the Warta River and moving south and west within the Oder River basin. The entire network of tribal gords between the Obra and Barycz rivers, among other places, was eliminated.My nie z Gniezna, ale z Giecza by Piotr Bojarski, Gazeta Wyborcza July 2, 2007 The conquered population was often resettled to central Greater Poland, which resulted in partial depopulation of previously well-developed regions. At the end of this stage of the Piast state formation new Piast gords were built in the (north) Noteƒá River area and other outlying areas of the annexed lands, for example in Santok and ≈örem around 970. During the following decade the job of unifying the core of the early Piast state was finished‚Äîbesides Greater Poland with Kujawy it included also much of central Poland. Masovia and parts of Pomerania found themselves increasingly under the Piast influence, while the southbound expansion was for the time being stalled, because large portions of Lesser Poland and Silesia were controlled by the Czech state.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 148‚Äì149, Zofia Kurnatowska The expanding Piast state developed a professional military force. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Mieszko collected taxes in the form of weights used for trading and spent those taxes as monthly pay for his warriors. He had three thousand heavily armored mounted soldiers alone, whose quality according to Ibrahim was very impressive. Mieszko provided for all their equipment and needs, even military pay for their children regardless of their gender, from the moment they were born. This force was supported by a much greater number of foot fighters.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 193‚Äì194, Zofia Kurnatowska, Marek Derwich Numerous armaments were found in the Piast gords, many of them of foreign, e.g. Frankish or Scandinavian origin. Mercenaries from these regions, as well as German and Norman knights, constituted a significant element of Mieszko's elite fighting guard.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 149‚Äì150, Zofia Kurnatowska = Revenue generating measures and conquests = To sustain this military machine and meet other state expenses, large amounts of revenue were necessary. Greater Poland had some natural resources used for trade, such as fur, hide, honey and wax, but those surely did not provide enough income. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Prague in Bohemia, a city built of stone, was the main center for the exchange of trading commodities in this part of Europe. From Krak√≥w, the Slavic traders brought tin, salt, amber and whatever other products they had, most importantly slaves; Muslim, Jewish, Hungarian and other traders were the buyers. The Life of St. Adalbert, written at the end of the 10th century by John Canaparius, records the fate of many Christian slaves sold in Prague as the main curse of the time. Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th-century Gniezno Doors. It may well be that the territorial expansion financed itself by being the source of loot, of which the captured local people were the most valuable part. The scale of the human trade practice is arguable, however, because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near-gord settlements, where they could serve the victors in various capacities and thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state. Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and Central Europe. The slave trade not insufficient to meet all revenue needs, the Piast state had to look for other options. Mieszko thus strove to subdue Pomerania at the Baltic coast. The area was the site of wealthy trade emporia, frequently visited by traders, especially from the east, west and north. Mieszko had every reason to believe that great profits would have resulted from his ability to control the rich seaports situated on long distance trade routes such as Wolin, Szczecin and Ko≈Çobrzeg.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 150‚Äì151, Zofia Kurnatowska The Piast state reached the mouth of the Vistula first. Based on the investigations of the gords erected along the middle and lower Vistula, it appears that the lower Vistula waterway was under Piast control from about the mid-10th century. A powerful gord built in Gda≈Ñsk, under Mieszko at the latest, solidified Piast rule over Pomerelia. However, the mouth of the Oder River was firmly controlled by the Jomsvikings and the Volinians, who were allied with the Veleti. \\"The Veleti are fighting Mieszko\\", reported Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, \\"and their military might is great\\". Widukind wrote about events of 963 that involved the person of the Saxon count Wichmann the Younger, an adventurer exiled from his country. According to Widukind, \\"Wichmann went to the barbarians (probably the Veleti or the Wolinians) and leading them (...) defeated Mieszko twice, killed his brother, and acquired a great deal of spoils\\". Thietmar of Merseburg also reports that Mieszko with his people became subjects of the Holy Roman Emperor in 963, together with other Slavic entities such as the Lusatians who were forced into subjection by the powerful Margrave Gero of the Saxon Eastern March. = Mieszko's relationship with Emperor Otto I = Series of military reverses and detrimental relationships, which involved the Czech P≈ôemyslids allied with the Veleti besides rivals, compelled Mieszko to seek the support of the German Emperor Otto I. After the contacts were made, Widukind described Mieszko as \\"a friend of the emperor\\". A pact was negotiated and finalized no later than 965. The price Mieszko had to pay for the imperial protection was acceptance of the status of the emperor's vassal. He paid him tribute from the lands up to the Warta River and very likely also made a promise to accept Christianity. = Mieszko's acceptance of Christianity = In response to immediate practical concerns, the Christian Church was installed in Poland in its Western Latin Rite, an act that brought Mieszko's country into sphere of ancient Mediterranean culture. Of the issues requiring urgent attention, the preeminent one was the increasing pressure of the eastbound expansion of the German state (between the Elbe and the Oder rivers) and its plans to control the parallel expansion of the Church through the archdiocese in Magdeburg, the establishment of which was finalized in 968.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 154, Zofia Kurnatowska The so-called Baptism of Poland and the attendant processes did not take place through Mieszko's German connections. At that time, Mieszko was in the process of fixing an uneasy relationship with the Bohemian state of Boleslaus I. The difficulties were caused mainly by Czech cooperation with the Veleti. Already in 964, the two parties arrived at an agreement on that and other issues.J.A. Sobiesiak ‚Äì Boles≈Çaw II Przemy≈õlida (Boleslaus II the Pious), p. 89, Avalon 2006 In 965, Mieszko married Boleslaus' daughter Doubravka. Mieszko's chosen Christian princess, a woman possibly in her twenties,Jerzy Strzelczyk ‚Äì Boles≈Çaw Chrobry (Boles≈Çaw I the Brave), p. 15, Pozna≈Ñ 2003 was a devout Christian and Mieszko's own conversion had to be a part of the deal. This act in fact followed in 966 and initiated the Christianization of Greater Poland, a region that up to that point had not been exposed to Christian influence, unlike Lesser Poland and Silesia. In 968, an independent missionary bishopric, reporting directly to the pope, was established, with Jordan installed as the first bishop.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, pp. 154‚Äì155, Zofia Kurnatowska The scope of the Christianization mission in its early phase was quite limited geographically, and the few relics that have survived come from Gniezno Land. Stone churches and baptisteries were discovered within the Ostr√≥w Lednicki and Pozna≈Ñ gords, and a chapel in Gniezno. Pozna≈Ñ was also the site of the first cathedral, the bishopric seat of Jordan and Bishop Unger, who followed him.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, p. 156, Zofia Kurnatowska = The early expansion of the Piasts, Great Moravian and Norman contributions = Newer research points out some other intriguing possibilities regarding the early origins of the Polish state in Greater Poland. There are indications that the processes that led to the establishment of the Piast state began during the period ca. 890-910. During these years, a tremendous civilizational advancement took place in central Greater Poland, as the unearthed products of all kinds that have been discovered are better made and more elaborate. The timing coincides with the breakdown of the Great Moravian state caused by the Magyar invasions. Before and after its fall in 905-07, many Great Moravian people, fearing for their lives, had to escape. According to the notes made by Constantine VII, they found refuge in neighboring countries. Decorations found in So≈Çacz graves in Pozna≈Ñ have their counterparts in burial sites around Nitra in Slovakia. In the Nitra area, there was also in medieval times a well-known clan named Poznan. The above indicates that the Pozna≈Ñ town was established by Nitran refugees, and more generally, the immigrants from Great Moravia contributed to the sudden awakening of the otherwise remote and isolated Piast lands. The early expansion of the Gniezno Land tribe very likely began under Mieszko's grandfather Lestek, the probable real founder of the Piast state. Widukind's chronicle speaks of Mieszko ruling a Slavic nation called \\"Licicaviki\\", which was what Widukind made out of \\"Lestkowicy\\": the people of Lestko, or Lestek. Lestek was also reflected in the sagas of the Normans, who may have played a role in Poland's origins (an accumulation of treasures from the period 930-1000 is attributed to them). Siemomys≈Ç and then Mieszko continued after Lestek, whose tradition was alive within the Piast court when Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth named one of his sons after him and Gallus Anonymous wrote his chronicle. The term \\"Lechici\\", popular later as a synonym for \\"Poles\\", may also have been inspired by Mieszko's grandfather.Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej, p. 75 = Early capitals, large scale gord construction = There is some disagreement as to the early seat of the ruling clan. Modern archeology has shown that the gord in Gniezno did not even exist before about 940. This fact eliminates the possibility of Gniezno's early central role, which is what had long been believed, based on the account given by Gallus Anonymus. The relics found in Giecz (including a great concentration of silver treasures), where the original gord was built some 80 years earlier, point to that location. Other likely early capitals include the old gords of Grzybowo, Kalisz or Pozna≈Ñ. Pozna≈Ñ, which is older than Gniezno, was probably the original site of Mieszko's court in the earlier years of his reign. The first cathedral church, a monumental structure, was erected there. The events of 974‚Äì78, when Mieszko, like his brother-in-law Boleslaus II of Bohemia, supported Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, in his rebellion against Otto II, created a threat of the emperor's retribution. The situation probably motivated Mieszko to move the government to Gniezno, which was safer due to its more eastern location. The emperor's response turned out to be ineffective, but this geographical advantage continued in the years to come. The growing importance of Gniezno was reflected in the addition around 980 of a new southern part to the original two segments of the gord. In the existing summary of the Dagome iudex document written in 991-92 before Mieszko's death, Mieszko's state is referred to as Civitas Gnesnensis, or the Gniezno State. The enormous effort of the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousand residents of the Gniezno region who were involved in building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords was made in response to a perceived deadly threat, not just to help them pursue regional conquests. After 935, when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko's father Siemomys≈Ç, the Czechs conquered Silesia and soon moved also against Germany. The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community. A Polabian Slav uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under Otto I, and the eastbound moving Saxons must have added to the sense of danger at that time (unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto, helping restrain the Polabians). When the situation stabilized, the Piast state consolidated and the huge gords turned out to be handy for facilitating the Piast's own expansion, led at this stage by Siemomys≈Ç. = Alliance with Germany and conquest of Pomerania = Fighting the Veleti from the beginning of Mieszko's rule led to an alliance of his state with Germany. The alliance was natural at this point, because the German state was expanding eastbound as the Polish state was expanding westbound, with the Veleti common target in between. A victory was achieved in September of 967, when Wichmann, this time leading forces of the Volinians, was killed, and Mieszko, helped by additional mounted units provided by his father-in-law Boleslaus, had his revenge. Mieszko's victory was recognized by the Emperor Otto I as the turning point in the struggle to contain the Polabian Slavs, which had distracted him from pursuing his Italian policies. This new status allowed Mieszko to pursue his efforts to obtain for his country an independent bishopric. The Poles thus had their own bishopric before the Czechs, whose tradition of Christianity was much older. The victory of 967, as well as the successful fighting with Margrave Hodo that followed in the Battle of Cedynia of 972, allowed Mieszko to conquer further parts of Pomerania. Wolin however remained autonomous and pagan. Ko≈Çobrzeg, where a strong gord was built around 985, was probably the actual center of Piast power in Pomerania. Before, a Scandinavian colony in Bardy-≈öwielubie near Ko≈Çobrzeg functioned as the center of this area. The western part of Mieszko controlled Pomerania (the region referred to by Polish historians as Western Pomerania, roughly within the current Polish borders, as opposed to Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania or Pomerelia), which became independent of Poland during the Pomeranian uprising of 1005, when Poland was ruled by Mieszko's son Boles≈Çaw.Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, 1999, p.32, :pagan reaction of 1005Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.25, : pagan uprising that also ended the Polish suzerainty in 1005J√ºrgen Petersohn, Der s√ºdliche Ostseeraum im kirchlich-politischen Kr√§ftespiel des Reichs, Polens und D√§nemarks vom 10. bis 13.

Masovia was still more loosely associated with the Piast state, while the Sandomierz region was for a while their southern outpost. The construction of powerful Piast gords in western Silesia region along the Oder River (G≈Çog√≥w, Wroc≈Çaw and Opole) took place by 985 at the latest. The alliance with the Czechs was by that time over; Queen Doubravka, a member of the Czech royal family, died in 977. Mieszko, allied with Germany, then fought the P≈ôemyslids and took over part of Silesia and then also eastern Lesser Poland (the Lendian lands). In 989, Krak√≥w with the rest of Lesser Poland was taken over. That region, autonomous under the Czech rule, also enjoyed a special status within the Piast state. In 990, eastern Silesia was added, which completed the Piast takeover of southern Poland. By the end of Mieszko's life, his state included the West Slavic lands in geographic proximity and connected by natural features to the Piast territorial nucleus of Greater Poland. Those lands have sometimes been regarded by historians as \\"Lechitic\\", or ethnically Polish, even though in the 10th century, all the western Slavic tribes, including the Czechs, were quite similar linguistically. Silver treasures, common in the Scandinavian countries, are found also in Slavic areas including Poland, especially northern Poland. Silver objects, coins and decorations, often cut into pieces, are believed to have served as currency units, brought in by Jewish and Arab traders, but locally more as accumulations of wealth and symbols of prestige. The process of hiding or depositing them, besides protecting them from danger, is believed by the researchers to represent a cult ritual. A treasure located in G√≥ra Strƒôkowa, Bia≈Çystok County, hidden after 901, includes dirhem coins minted between 764 and 901 and Slavic decorations made in southern Ruthenia that show Byzantine influence. This find is a manifestation of a 10th-century trade route running all the way from Central Asia through Byzantium, Kiev, the Dnieper and Pripyat rivers basins and Masovia to the Baltic Sea shores. Such treasures most likely belonged to members of the emerging elites.U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski, Synchronization of archeological cultures, p. 212‚Äì215 by Adam ≈ªurek and chronology tables pp. 218‚Äì221 by Wojciech Mrozowicz and Adam ≈ªurek used throughout the article  See also  * Prehistory and protohistory of Poland * Stone-Age Poland * Bronze- and Iron-Age Poland * Poland in Antiquity * History of Poland during the Piast dynasty  Notes  a.\\"Though their names are now dispersed amid various clans and places, yet they are chiefly called Sclaveni and Antes\\" (Antes denoting the eastern early Slavic branch).

Japanese cell phone novels were also downloaded in short installments and run on handsets as Java-based mobile applications in three different formats: WMLD, JAVA and TXT. Maho i-Land is the largest Japanese cell phone novel site that carries more than a million titles, mainly novice writers, all which are available for free. Maho iLand provides templates for blogs and homepages. It is visited 3.5 billion times each month. In 2007, 98 cell phone novels were published into books. \\"Koizora\\" is a popular phone novel with approximately 12 million views on-line, written by \\"Mika\\", that was not only published but turned into a movie.newyorker.com Five out of the ten best selling novels in Japan in 2007 were originally cell phone novels.New York Times  History  Messaging with pagers became popular with teenage girls in Japan in the 1990s, and the popularity of mobile communication devices eventually gave way to the development of literary genres based on these new media forms. The use of compact and highly contextual writing is a well-established part of Japanese literary tradition, and cell phone novels have been compared to classic Japanese literature such as the 11th Century Tale of Genji. The first cell phone novel was \\"published\\" in Japan in 2003 by a Tokyo man in his mid-thirties who calls himself Yoshi. His first cell phone novel was called Deep Love, the story of a teenager engaged in \\"subsidized dating\\" (enj≈ç kosai) in Tokyo and contracting AIDS. It became so popular that it was published as an actual book, with 2.6 million copies sold in Japan, then spun off into a television series, a manga, and a movie. The cell phone novel became a hit mainly through word of mouth and gradually started to gain traction in Taiwan, China, and South Korea among young adults. In Japan, several sites offer large prizes to authors (up to $100,000 US) and purchase the publishing rights to the novels. Kiki, the pseudonymous author of I, Girlfriend won the Japan Keitai Novel Award in 2008. The movement also became popular in Europe, Africa and North America. In 2005, Random House purchased a share in Vocel, a San Diego-based company which mobile studyguides. In Europe it started in about 2007, promoted by people like Oliver Bendel and Wolfgang Hohlbein, and publishers such as Cosmoblonde or Blackbetty Mobilmedia. Teenagers in South Africa have been downloading an m-novel called Kontax ‚Äì a novel specifically written for mobile phones. The pioneer cell phone novel in North America, a novel called Secondhand Memories by Takatsu ‚Äì that can be viewed on Textnovel, the first English language cell phone novel site founded in the United States ‚Äì has been viewed more than 60,000 times and published in print in 2015 as a paperback.  Reason for popularity  Although Japan was the original birthplace of the cell phone novel, the phenomenon soon moved to other parts of East Asia, and many of the online writers are university students. These writers understand what narratives will attract young readers, incorporating emergent events or trendy elements from teen culture into their stories. Cell phone novels create a virtual world for teenagers via the mobile phone, or, more precisely, via text messages. As in virtual online video games, readers can put themselves into first person in the story. Cell phone novels create a personal space for each individual reader. As Paul Levinson wrote in Cellphone, \\"nowadays, a writer can write just about as easily, anywhere, as a reader can read\\" (p 20). The cell phone novel is changing reading habits; readers no longer need to physically go to a bookshop and purchase a book. They can go online using their cell phone, download a novel, and read it on their personal mobile phone anywhere, any time they wish. Similar to the e-book, its mobility and convenience saves time.  Characteristics and literary style  Because of the short chapter format consisting of around 70‚Äì100 words (usually fewer than 200), the phenomenon has brought a new approach to literature, allowing a new vision to potentially redefine traditional writing and the publishing world. Despite the use of cell phones, most of these novels are not written with SMS slang and language. Instead, it has brought out a new era of minimalism and art. In each chapter, readers will be able to experience narration, poetry and even visual arts in the use of carefully chosen line breaks, punctuation, rhythm and white space. Often, cell phone novels features the use of fragments, conversational, simple and delicate language; cliffhangers and dramatic dialogue emphasized by the unseen or omitted becomes a vital part of the reading experience, allowing deeper meanings and interpretations to unfold. Because of the use of poetic language, mood, emotions and internal thoughts are stimulated in the reader easily. Dramatic and drastic plots takes readers through twists and turns, cliffhanger after cliffhanger, always keeping the reader waiting for the next chapter installment. The nature of writing and reading on the go, creates a unique experience, allowing the writer and reader to approach literature in a different way, opening interactivity between the readers and the writer as the story develops in \\"real time\\".

Club career The trained teacher began his career as player with SC Zug, FC Baar, FC Emmenbr√ºcke, and FC Wettingen. After this followed assignments as professional with Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich and FC Basel. In his time with Grasshoppers he won the Swiss Championship and Cup. International career He made regular appearances in the Swiss national football team. Coaching career His managerial career began with FC Emmenbr√ºcke where he was player manager from 1995 to 1997. After this he spent a season with each, FC Winterthur and FC Baden. In March 1999 he took on German second division side SSV Ulm 1846, then on 5th place and in the course of the season's last 11 matchdays led them to the third place, and thus the first ever promotion to the Bundesliga. After 24 matches there the club was closer to an UEFA Cup rank then to the relegation zone, but a crisis thereafter saw the SSV 1846 passed down again after just a single season. After bad results at the beginning of the new year in the second division Andermatt was let go already in September. This maneuver did not help the club at all and by the end of that season Ulm had gone all the way to the third division. From June 2001 until his premature exit in March 2002 he was hired by German side Eintracht Frankfurt which was just relegated to the second division in the hope that he might lead the team to an immediate return to the Bundesliga. After the fulfillment of this aspiration became more and more unrealistic he was replaced halfway through the second half of the season. After this he returned to Switzerland and took over the reins at first division side FC Wil where he was fired in 2003 after the brief and turbulent take-over by former European footballer of the year Igor Belanov. The Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz, Liechtenstein (capacity of 6 127) From 2003 to 2005 he coached FC Vaduz in Liechtenstein and alongside this the national side of the principality, where he could achieve some surprising results when drawing. 2-2 against Portugal, the losing finalists of the Euro 2004. Before this result, Liechtenstein had lost all of its previous 20 World Cup qualifiers. The team also caused a shock in the return match at the end of the group phase when Benjamin Fischer scored and Liechtenstein led at half time before eventually losing 2-1. Liechtenstein under andermatt also won 4-0 at Luxembourg. On the other hand, Liechtenstein are the only country ever to lose to San Marino with a 0-1 loss in a friendly match on 28 April 2004. The club side led in the Swiss second division for a long stretch of the 2004/05 season. At the end of the season FC Vaduz had a minor crisis which saw the slipping and Andermatt was fired four rounds before the end of the season. Vaduz missed out on promotion in the play-off matches versus Neuch√¢tel Xamax. Andermatt however retained his position with the national team until October 2006 when he took the manager job with BSC Young Boys in Berne. There he finished his first season 4th.

The project's aims are in line with the International Maritime Organization's recommendations to reduce sulphur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from ships in the Baltic Sea progressively by 2015. These two oxides are the main cause of eutrophication, which is an environmental effect that limits water nutrients and endangers sea life. The new Tier III for NOx emission standard's goal is 80% lower in comparison with Tier I, whereas marine fuel cannot exceed SOx level of 0.1% which should be enough to revert the current situation of the Baltic Sea Region by 2040.

The local politics of Valledupar take places within the framework of the Politics of Colombia which are based on a presidential system and representative democratic republic. History The Politics of Valledupar has struggled along the political situations of Colombia throughout the years since its creation by Spanish colonizers and its Independence from them. Relatively prompt to political violence the politics of Valledupar have been divided between periods of political instability and periods of relatively political stability along a hegemony between the Colombian Liberal Party and the Colombian Liberal Party following ideals of Colombian Liberalism and Conservatism respectively. In the early 20th century and with the influence of new political ideals from Europe, Communism spread through Latin America, Colombia and the region of Valledupar. After the end of the Thousand Days War radical liberals in the region started to adopt versions of Colombian communism but have always represented a minority in comparison to the population. The political trend was the caudillismo (strong men) in support of the two main political parties, the conservative and liberal supported by other powerful landowners and selected families. Elections were held only for president and legislature. Within the powers of the President of Colombia (before the constitution of 1991) was the ability to appoint department governors, mayors of municipalities and police inspectors for corregimientos and settlements. In the region of Valledupar the main traditional, political, landowner families were the Castros and the Araujos, whose political hegemony dates back to colonial times of their Spanish ancestors. The post of Mayor of Valledupar was created in 1915 along with the Municipal Council of Valledupar. The municipal council had very little importance, since the appointed mayor had control over much of the budget and was usually a military man. Councilmen were elected in a single election along with the president and the rest of the legislative branch of government. The region was also greatly influenced by Liberal President Alfonso L√≥pez Pumarejo whose mother was from Valledupar. =During La Violencia= During the period of La Violencia very few incidents of political violence occurred in Valledupar, however the repression incidents provoked by the chulavitas (the Conservative government police) were described in vallenato songs.Concejo de Valledupar Politics in Valledupar have been plagued by political scandals and corruption to maintain power. The politics of Economics have also been centered towards an agro-export economy and concerning social changes, the indigenous peoples have also conflicted with these politics since the time of the Colony situation that escalated because of the Catholic Church involvement in their culture and the expropriation of land. There hasn't been any significant agrarian reforms but an improvement in social protection and benefits that began with the election of President Lopez Pumarejo and his \\"Revolucion en Marcha\\" (Marching Revolution) program. During the years of the National Front, communist guerrillas developed during the period of La Violencia under communist ideals started to appear in the region of Valledupar. Political parties also associated with these ideals like the Colombian Communist Party (PCC), the Revolutionary Independent Labour Movement (MOIR) and the Colombian Liberal Party faction Liberal Revolutionary Movement (MRL) developed with a strong militancy of young students to protest the nature of the National Front and the repression of the conservatives governments, among these is former President Lopez-Pumarejo's son Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen who pushed for the creation of the Cesar Department and setting Valledupar as its capital along with the aristocrat political leadership of Valledupar. During this time the communist guerrillas began armed incursions against the Colombian army in Valledupar and landowners, with kidnappings for ransom, cattle or agricultural equipment robbing, extorting, but sporadically. Meanwhile, land owners experimented a boom in cotton production that further enriched them throughout the 1970s. Valledupar enjoyed a process of urban development and growth, while the majority maintained a relatively comfortable life. The cotton bonanza ended with an agricultural crisis and most of the landowners in debt with banks because of loans. This adding to an economic recession that hit Latin America as a whole during the years following the bonanza. This created not only an economic crisis but also a political and social crisis in Valledupar. Peasants began to strike demanding action by the governments of Colombia, Cesar and Valledupar. It was during the 1980s, when the leftist coalition party the Patriotic Union (UP) surged as an alternative to the peasants supports, adding to the Patriotic Union was considered the political wing of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) that had kidnapped and extorted by then hundreds of landowners. To the surprise of the landowners Ricardo Palmera, members of the traditional families of landowners joined the Patriotic Union and later when this party began to be persecuted by paramilitary groups and law enforcement he joined the FARC. Requisites The population of Valledupar apt to vote must be Colombian, over the age allowed to vote which is over 18 year of age and a valid ID. The ID number must be registered for vote in the National Registry of the Civil State, the entity in Colombia that within its functions is to control the registry of voters and vote count during an election and also register their IDs in the municipality in which they live. The voter also must be capable of exercise freely its civil and political rights. Candidates also must comply with the rules established in the Constitution of Colombia and the regulations established by the National Electoral Council of Colombia. Since July 25, 2005 LEY 974 DE 2005 (julio 22) Diario Official No. 45.980 de 25 de julio de 2005  Political parties, movements and groups  Valledupar has numerous political movements and groups associated with to the larger political parties of Colombia. Some of these local movements group ideas related to the major political parties and may adhere during an election, but most of the time these movements or group try not to be part of the officialism of a party. There have been two local groups based in Valledupar that have gained important regional or national political support, the now disbanded GOLPE Movement led by the Gneccos and Alterativa Liberal de Avanzada Social (ALAS) which joined forces with Team Colombia to create ALAS Equipo Colombia a major player in the national elections which is led by the Ara√∫jo family, mainly √Ålvaro Ara√∫jo Castro. = GOLPE Movement = GOLPE disbanded after its main leaders were either charged with crimes, threatened by violent groups or assassinated. Lucas Gnecco the head of the clan, was jailed after being accused by the Attorney General of Colombia of committing fraud in 1989 while serving as Governor of Cesar Department along with 47 other members of his administration.Noticias - Caracol Radio Lucas Gnecco was banned from running for office ever again. His two brothers Jorge and Jose Eduardo \\"Pepe\\" Gnecco were subject to persecution by paramilitary leader Rodrigo Tovar Pupo (aka Jorge 40) who assassinated Jorge and kidnapped Jose Eduardo. This kidnapping led to President √Ålvaro Uribe to threaten Jorge 40 with being extradited and loss of his benefits as part of the agreement with the government during the 2006 demobilization process of the paramilitary groups. =ALAS= After the weakening of the GOLPE Movement, ALAS led by the Ara√∫jo family primarily, gained political power, amid accusations of being benefited by the violent actions of the paramilitary leader \\"Jorge 40\\". Four of the most prominent members of the Ara√∫jo clan were formerly investigated for their participation in the Colombian parapolitics scandal in which politicians made agreements and pacts with the paramililtary groups to maintain political power. Members of the family with legal problems include former Senator √Ålvaro Ara√∫jo Castro, his father √Ålvaro Ara√∫jo Noguera, his brother Sergio Ara√∫jo Casatro and cousin former Governor of Cesar Department Hernando Molina Ara√∫jo. Due to this legal problems, then minister of Foreign Affairs Maria Consuelo Ara√∫jo Castro, the Ara√∫jo Castros' sister resigned despite not being involved in the scandal. Father and uncle in law of the clan is current Inspector General of Colombia Edgardo Maya Villaz√≥n who was married to former minister of Culture Consuelo Ara√∫jonoguera (Assassinated by the FARC guerrilla in 2002) and faced a lot of criticism due to the problems of his family and has been asked to resign due to conflicts of interests and ethics. Another important politician associated to the Araujos was Mauricio Pimiento which was initially supported by them but later joined the lines of a different political movement. Senator Pimiento was also involved in the Parapolitics scandal and was jailed along with √Ålvaro Ara√∫jo Castro. = Forward Valledupar = After these scandals Valledupar and the Cesar Department were left without strong political leaders and a coalition of politicians formed from different political parties to recover the political leadership gap left. The coalition was dubbed Adelante Valledupar (Forward Valledupar) and during the October 28, 2007 Colombian regional elections helped to elect as mayor Ruben Carvajal.

He was a close political associate of Joseph Chamberlain. Origins and working life Powell Williams was born in Worcester, the son of another Joseph Powell Williams. He attended Hazlewood School, Birmingham, which was founded by his father's cousin Thomas Wright Hill. On leaving school he worked for Graham & James, solicitors of Ludgate Hill, Birmingham. Business with this firm led him to travel to the United States where he was to represent this and other Birmingham interests. He considered staying, but the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 led him to return to Britain. He was also a partner in the firm of Hill, Evans & Co, vinegar manufacturers, which (along with Lea & Perrins and Royal Worcester) was one of the industrial mainstays of the city of Worcester. Joseph's father had been one of the founders of the company (originally called Hill, Evans & Williams): it made not only vinegar, but what were then termed \\"British wines\\". On his return from the United States he accepted an appointment to the Post Office which, under the guidance of Rowland Hill (Joseph's second cousin), was undergoing a substantial revolution in the way it worked. While in the Post Office he had a share in setting up the Post Office Savings Bank. He also worked in the postal district to which Anthony Trollope was surveyor and struck up a friendship with Trollope - it is said that he read many of the proofs of the author's novels. Political career Powell Williams' religious background was in dissent: the Williams family had played an active role in the Swan Hill Congregational Chapel in Shrewsbury. They had also had long associations with the craft based industries of the West Midlands conurbation where master often worked on the shop floor alongside their workers. Joseph's interests soon turned to joining the ranks of \\"Radical\\" Liberal politicians who sought to reshape the late nineteenth century political map of Britain. On the death of his father in 1873 he returned from London to Birmingham. He had long associated himself with the Liberal Party in Birmingham and in 1877 he was elected as Councillor of St. Thomas's Ward. He joined Birmingham Council during the Mayoralty of Joseph Chamberlain and he was to shape his political career within the group that surrounded Chamberlain. During this time he was Honorary Secretary to the Birmingham Liberal Association and, later, and Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Birmingham City Council. In 1885 Powell Williams entered Parliament for Birmingham South as a Liberal. He joined a group of mainly Birmingham based MPs, led by Joseph Chamberlain. This group disagreed with William Ewart Gladstone on a number of issues, their central platform being opposition to Gladstone's Irish policies. To this end they created the Liberal Unionists in 1886 which were to split from the Liberal Party and side with the Conservatives. Powell Williams went on to serve in the Unionist administration of Lord Salisbury as Financial Secretary to the War Office from 1895 to 1901, and on leaving that post was sworn into the Privy Council in November 1901. He is said to have played a key role in Chamberlain's success in Birmingham, and one source states that he and Jesse Collings acted as Chamberlain's \\"political bodyguards\\". He is stated to have acted as a \\"ghost\\" for Chamberlain's proposals on the Irish question and his article on the \\"Radical Programme\\". He was liked for his humour on the floor of the Commons, and reported by The Times to be \\"greatly esteemed by lobby journalists and officials\\", but he was probably more at home in the committee room and the back lobbies. His time as Financial Secretary to the War Office was not always a success and the Daily Chronicle stated that he was a \\"square peg in a round hole\\", his office full of \\"blunders and bulls\\", but \\"good humoured about them\\". Despite his early uneasiness about the alliance between the Liberal Unionists and the Conservatives, the Birmingham Post said that \\"He kept the Liberal Unionist seats going and the alliance with the Conservatives alive.\\" Later life and death In his later life, alongside his political career in Birmingham and Westminster, Powell Williams held a number of positions including the chairmanship of the Midland Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. In February 1904 he suffered a stroke in the lobby of the House of Commons from which he later died, aged 63. He was buried in Key Hill Cemetery, Hockley, Birmingham. Personal life In 1870 Powell Williams married Anne Elizabeth Bindley. They had two sons, Francis, who became an Electrical Engineer and was Secretary to the Institute of Engineers (India) from 1921 to 1931, and Rowland, who became a barrister and played first-class cricket; and two daughters, Mary Dorothy and Winifred Ethel.

Dispute with the Raja of Kapurthala His father Raja Nihal Singh wanted him to succeed to the throne but this was opposed by the British. His father's will, which entitled him to inherit large estates, was challenged by his brother, Raja Randhir Singh. After long litigation, a settlement was arrived at by which Bikrama Singh was given a pension by the state; under the terms of this settlement, Bikrama Singh left Kapurthala to settle in Jullunder.Chief and Families of Note in The Punjab, Volume-II, Lahore-1910, Page-421Raja of The Punjab by Sir, Lepel Henry Griffin, Lahore-1870, Pages: 552-575 Settlement of estates through the Bikrama Singh Estates Act He was the joint owner of the Kapurthala Estate in Awadh, Uttar Pradesh.

Retrieved 29 June 2018 It is originally derived from the Old English word \\"denu\\" (Middle English, \\"dene\\") meaning \\"valley.\\" Another common variant of this surname is Deane. The view north towards Ross-on-Wye from Symonds Yat Rock, in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire  Origin and variants  Dean is thought to be a habitational name from any of several places in various parts of England that are known by a variation of the name. The first bearers of the name lived in Anglo-Saxon England in mountainous or hilly areas where they would have adopted the name as a habitational marker. The surname is historically concentrated in the West Country in South West England, particularly in and around the county of Gloucestershire, Retrieved 29 June 2018 and there are several places called Dean in the area (including other areas of Southern England), suggesting that this region may be the surname‚Äôs likely area of origin. Dean and Deane are also historically found as surnames in Scotland and Ireland. Perhaps less likely, it may also be a descriptive name for someone thought to resemble an ecclesiastical Dean, or an occupational name associated with the servant of a Dean, derived from the Middle English word \\"deen,\\" which is itself ultimately derived from the Latin word \\"decanus\\" (modern English, Deacon), meaning \\"a leader of ten men\\". Recorded usage of the name dates back to the late 11th century when it was recorded as the surname of several individuals. The first known person on record to use the Dean surname appears to have been an individual named Robert de Dene, who was a \\"Pincema\\", or, an official in charge of wine and beverage for King Edward the Confessor (1042‚Äì1066). His descendants, known as Denn or Denne, were landowners in Kent and Sussex, but apparently died out by the 1600s. Another known early Dean was an individual named Ralph De Dene, who was recorded in the Domesday Book for Sussex during the reign of William the Conqueror (1066‚Äì1087) in 1086. The official use of surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. Until the gradual standardization of English spelling in the last few centuries however, English lacked any comprehensive system of spelling. Consequently, spelling variations in names are frequently found in early Anglo-Saxon and later Anglo-Norman documents, meaning that a person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime.

Career =Playing career= Lochhead joined St Johnstone in summer 1925, just after the club had been promoted to the old First Division for the first time. Playing as a left-half, he made 18 appearances for The Saints over three seasons, before moving to Walsall in June 1928. He spent just one year in the Midlands, playing 42 games for The Saddlers without scoring, and then joined Norwich City in June 1929. He has the distinction of scoring the first-ever League goal at Carrow Road in a 4-3 victory over West Ham United on 31 August 1935 - one of just five in 223 competitive matches for Norwich before his retirement the following month. =Coaching career= After retiring as a player, Lochhead became an assistant manager and scout at Norwich City. He remained at the club during the Second World War, making three wartime appearances due to player shortages. He managed Norwich during the transitional post-war season of 1945-1946, but the board decided to replace him with the more experienced Cyril Spiers, who left after just one season in which the Canaries finished second from bottom of the Third Division (South), ahead of Mansfield Town on goal average despite conceding 100 times in 42 matches. Spiers returned to his former club, Cardiff City, in December 1947 and Lochhead was re-appointed with City bottom of the League. He improved the performances but could not better Spiers' position, as City again avoided last place on goal average, this time ahead of Brighton & Hove Albion, and again had to apply for re-election. Lochhead then managed two mid-table finishes, winning 57, drawing 40 and losing 74 and drawing of his 171 matches, but his health was shattered after an accident in August 1949 and he was replaced by Norman Low in March 1950. Lochhead also signed Johnny Gavin from Limerick in 1948, who remains Norwich's all-time top goalscorer, and brought two of the club's highest appearance-makers, Ron Ashman and Ken Nethercott, into the side. He also coached in Europe, including Galatasaray (Turkey) and Heracles Almelo of the Netherlands, before returning to the United Kingdom to spend two years as manager of non-League Merthyr Tydfil.

Its abilities to splice, crossfade, trim, and loop sound in 16-bit CD quality made it popular among producers in the late 80s through to the mid 90s. The S1000 used 24-bit internal processing, had digital filters and an effects send and return, and came with 2MB of RAM (expandable to 8MB). Version 2.0 of the S1000's operating system introduced primitive timestretching, allowing a sound's pitch and length to be altered independently of one another. Far from seamless, this distinctive sound became popular in its own right, featured on songs such as \\"Higher State of Consciousness\\" and \\"RipGroove\\". Variants Several variations of the S1000 were produced: * The S1000HD included an internal 40MB hard disk * The S1000KB was built into a keyboard, and included room for an internal 80MB hard disk * The S1000PB was a playback-only version that couldn't create new samples * The S1100, released in 1990, was an expanded and enhanced version of the S1000 * The S1100EX was an expansion for the S1100, including everything except the front panel, to increase its polyphony and timbrality Expansion cards The following expansion cards are available to upgrade the abilities of any S1000 series sampler: * EXM005 2MB RAM (up to three can be fitted, for 8MB RAM in total) * IB 102 Atari / Supra hard disk interface * IB 103 SCSI interface * IB 104 AES/EBU digital interface Legacy The S1000 quickly displaced the S900 as the studio standard sampler. Many bedroom producers could make music using little more than an S1000 and an Atari ST to sequence it, and in the UK this combination was a popular way of producing music in genres from jungle to speed garage. In an interview taken over ten years after the S1000's release, Boards of Canada's Michael Sandison said \\"We have five or six samplers, but my favorite by far is still the Akai S1000.

Biography Skinner, second son of John Skinner (1744‚Äì1816), bishop of St. Andrews, was born at Aberdeen on 24 October 1778, and educated at Marischal College, University of Aberdeen and at Oxford, where he matriculated from Wadham College on 3 March 1798, graduating B.A. in 1801, and M.A., B.D., and D.D. in 1819. William Stevens, the friend of Bishop Horne, and Jones of Nayland defrayed part of his university expenses. If Stevens had not done this, John Skinner would not have been financially able to send his son William to Oxford. Having William attend Oxford was important to him as a way of showing \\"his own personal conviction of the full communion which existed between the English and Scottish Churches.\\". =Ordination & consecration= Skinner was ordained by Bishop Samuel Horsley of St. Asaph's in March 1802. Returning to Scotland, he officiated as assistant, and afterwards as colleague, to his father in the incumbency of St. Andrew's Church, Aberdeen. On 11 September 1816 he was elected by the clergy of the diocese as successor to his father in the see of Aberdeen, and was consecrated at Stirling on 27 October 1816. The consecraters were the Primus and the Bishops of Edinburgh, Dunkeld, and Murray.\\". George Gleig, primus of the church, sent a severe but fruitless reproof to the dean and clergy of Aberdeen for electing the son of their late bishop. =Elected primus= Skinner was one of the bishops who attended the synod held at Laurencekirk on 18 June 1828 to revise the canons of 1811; thirty canons were adopted and duly signed on 20 June. In 1832 he confirmed as many as four hundred and sixty-two persons, and a first effort was made in the same year to circulate religious works in the Gaelic language. On 29 August 1838 he attended another synod held in St. Paul's Church, Edinburgh, when the canons were again revised. Upon the death of Bishop James Walker, Skinner was unanimously elected primus by an episcopal synod held in St. Andrew's Church, Aberdeen, on 2 June 1841. Both as bishop and \\"as senior Episcopalian bishop in Scotland,\\" Skinner worked to consolidate the \\"Scottish Episcopal Church as a serious religious presence\\" in Scotland. This effort included having \\"the church's documents translated into Scottish Gaelic.\\" He also \\"oversaw the establishment of Glenalmond College, near Perth\\" in 1844. He saw the school being used for educating potential clergy.\\"BISHOP WILLIAM SKINNER.\\" In the previous year a serious controversy had sprung out of the refusal of Sir William Dunbar, priest of St. Paul's Chapel, Aberdeen, to receive or to administer the sacrament in accordance with the Scottish ritual. Acting with the concurrence of his synod, Skinner excommunicated Dunbar on 13 August 1843. The bishop was ‚Äì according to the Dictionary of National Biography ‚Äì assiduous and exemplary in the discharge of his duties, and did much during his primacy to consolidate the episcopal party in Scotland. Marriage and death Skinner was married in 1804 to the youngest daughter of James Brand, cashier of the Aberdeen Banking Company. They had a daughter, Mary Garioch (1806 - 1864).\\"Rev William Skinner.\\" He died at 1 Golden Square, Aberdeen, on 15 April 1857, and was buried in the Spital cemetery on 22 April.

He was involved in the trials of Sir Thomas More, John Fisher and Anne Boleyn. Family John Port was born about 1472 at Chester, where his ancestors had been merchants for some generations. His father, Henry Port, was a sheriff of Chester in 1471-2 then mayor of Chester in 1486-7,British History Online: Mayors and Sheriffs of Chester, accessed May 2018. and his mother, Anne Barrow, was the daughter of Robert Barrow, also a sheriff of Chester in 1488-9 and 1506-7 then mayor of Chester in 1526-7. Career By 1495 Port had settled at Etwall in Derbyshire as a result of his marriage to the daughter of John Fitzherbert (d.1502).. Port studied law at the Middle Temple, where he was Reader in 1509, Lent Reader and treasurer in 1515, and governor in 1520. In 1504 he was one of the commissioners appointed to raise a subsidy in Derbyshire. On 2 June 1509 he was made King's solicitor, and on 26 November signed a proclamation as member of the Privy Council.Letters and Papers of Henry VIII, 1509‚Äì1514, No. 702 (cited in DNB) In the same year he was \\"keeper of the King's books\\", and in 1511 clerk of the wardrobe. Before 1512 he was appointed attorney to the earldom of Chester, and in that year he appeared as one of the commissioners selected to inquire into the extortions of the masters of the mint. In 1515 and most succeeding years he served on the commission for the peace in Derbyshire. In 1517 he was clerk of exchange in the Tower, and in 1522 was made serjeant-at-law. He acquired an extensive practice as an advocate, and in 1525 he was made a Justice of the King's Bench and knighted. He was on the commission for gaol delivery at York, and in June went on the northern circuit as justice of assize. He was also a member of Princess Mary's council. In 1535 he was placed on the commission of oyer and terminer for Middlesex to try John Fisher and Thomas More, and in the following year was similarly employed with regard to Anne Boleyn. Port died on or about 14 March 1540. Port's son, John Port the Younger, took a prominent part in the transactions relating to the foundation of Brasenose College, Oxford. He gave to it a garden lying on the south side of the college, and completed John Williamson's bequest of ¬£200 to provide stipends for two sufficient and able persons to read and teach openly in the hall, the one philosophy, the other 'humanity. The stipend was (then) 4 shillings a year, but the limitation to the descendants of Williamson and Port was abolished by Oxford University in 1854. John the Younger was also the founder of Repton School, and the land on which the family Manor House once stood in Etwall is now the grounds of a Secondary School which still holds the Port family crest of three birds within its own school crest.:File:John Port School Logo.jpg Marriages and issue Port married firstly Joan FitzHerbert, widow of John Pole of Radbourne, Derbyshire, and the daughter and coheir of John FitzHerbert (d.1502), King's Remembrancer of the Exchequer, by whom he had a son, Sir John Port, and three daughters:. *Ellen Port, who married firstly Sir Edmund Pierrepont of Holme, Nottinghamshire and secondly Sir John Babington. *Barbara Port, who married Sir John Francys of Foremark. *Maria Port, who married Sir George Finderne of Findern.

He had three sisters and was the youngest of the four children. Within a few years the family relocated to South Portland, where his father continued jobs as a carpenter, stableman, blacksmith and farmer. He graduated from South Portland High School in 1949, being active on the school paper, varsity track, and serving as representative to the Maine Student Legislature. He was awarded a State of Maine Competitive Scholarship.  Education  William Coperthwaite attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where he majored in art history. His extra-curricular activities included track and pole vaulting, and he served as vice-president of the Outing Club. He later enrolled in the innovative Putney Graduate School of Teacher Education (Antioch University New England) Master's degree program and in 1972 was awarded a Ph.D in education from Harvard University.

He became a serjeant-at-law in 1868, the last person received into Serjeants' Inn who was not a judge. Early life Sleigh was born in Dublin, the eldest son of William Willcocks Sleigh, M.D., of Bull House, Buckinghamshire, and subsequently of Dublin. After a private education, he matriculated from St. Mary Hall, Oxford on 9 February 1843, but did not graduate with a degree. He married Amelia Warner at Waterperry in Oxfordshire on 25 January 1843. They had one child, William Warner Sleigh, who also became a barrister. Legal career Sleigh became a student of the Middle Temple on 18 January 1843, and was called to the bar on 30 January 1846. He practised on the home circuit, attending the Central Criminal Court, and the London, Middlesex, and Kent quarter sessions. He was created a serjeant-at-law on 2 November 1868: he was the last person received into Serjeants' Inn who was not a judge. Like his fellow serjeants-at-law, John Humffreys Parry, William Ballantine, and John Walter Huddleston (afterwards Baron Huddleston), he enjoyed a lucrative practice at the Old Bailey, and took part in many leading criminal trials, being a most effective cross-examiner In 1871 he accepted the first brief for the claimant Arthur Orton, alias Roger Tichborne, in his civil action. He was long retained as leading counsel to the Bank of England, with Hardinge Giffard (afterwards Lord Halsbury) as his junior. He was a Conservative, and stood for Parliament four times without being elected: in Lambeth on 5 May 1862, Huddersfield on 20 March 1868, Frome in the 1868 general election on 17 November 1868, and Newark on 1 April 1870. After visiting Australia in 1871, convalescing from sciatica, he decided to emigrate in 1877. He was called to the bar in New South Wales on 8 March 1877 and in Victoria on 21 March 1877. Although a claim to precedence as a serjeant-at-law was not allowed, he was given the courtesy title of serjeant. He was the only serjeant-at-law to practise in Australia. He moved to Launceston and was admitted to the bar in Tasmania on 11 March 1880. He was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in April 1880, as an independent candidate for the Deloraine seat. He spent more time in Melbourne after visiting England in 1881. Later life His son died in 1882, and he returned to England permanently in 1886. He died at Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, survived by his wife.

In addition to manufacturing, the company is also active in the import and wholesale distribution of musical instruments, amplifiers and accessories through its division High Tech Distribution. The company manufactures electric guitars, basses, and strings. History Patrice Vigier, a self-taught luthier from les Ulis, began modifying guitars and building finished necks at the end of the 1970s. He later built his first fretless guitar with a glass fingerboard. Through a friend, Philippe Lacour of Distribution Music, Vigier met his first customers in Montparnasse. In 1980, he founded the company, Vigier, and introduced his first model, the Arpege, at a music fair. That guitar featured: * Neck-through construction with a trapezoidal extension * Metal reinforcement board underneath the fingerboard * Metal fretboard on the fretless version * Active electronics * A fixed bridge * Benedetti custom humbuckers The Nautilus System (1982) In 1981, instead of using standard batteries, Vigier powered its electronics with a rechargeable power supply. In 1983, another model came equipped with a built-in equalizer and sound memory system called Nautilus. Vigier launched two other models: the Passion in 1983 and the Marilyn in 1985. In 1986, Vigier diversified by creating a wholesale division to import and distribute instruments, amplifiers, and accessories. Distributed brands included Ampeg, DiMarzio, Ernie Ball, Music Man, Orange, Premier, and Trace Elliot. Two years later, Vigier renamed the division High Tech Distribution to separate the manufacturing and distribution operations. In the 1990s, Vigier introduced new models. The Excalibur came in 1991, its fretless variant, the Surfreter in 1998, and the Excess bass in 1996. In 2000, Vigier celebrated its 20th anniversary with an Excalibur Surfreter adorned with gold, diamonds, sapphires, and emeralds. The instrument was valued at EUR 30,000. In the same year, the company launched the Expert, a model inspired by the classic Fender Stratocaster. Vigier also developed a guitar with a MIDI-controlled selector, volume, and tone knob. The company presented a prototype at the 2003 Frankfurt music fair, but never finalized the project as Patrice Vigier never approved the final version. In the second half of the 2000s, Vigier began introducing signature models‚Äîincluding the Excalibur Shawn Lane in 2005, and the Excalibur Bumblefoot Ron Thal and Excess Roger Glover in 2006. In 2009 Vigier introduced its model singlecut, G.V., in reference to Georges Vigier, Patrice's late father.  Models  = Electric guitars = * Arpege * Passion * Excalibur * G.V. * Expert * Marilyn * Bfoot * DoubleBfoot = Basses = * Arpege * Excess * Passion  Manufacturing  Vigier produces all their instruments in France. Vigier makes each guitar or bass in three to five months‚Äîpartly by hand and partly with machines. Woods‚Äîsuch as alder, maple, and ash‚Äîcome from French forests. Rosewood and mahogany are imported from India and Honduras respectively. Pre-cut raw wood logs are sorted and dried naturally for three to seven years to achieve the desired moisture content. Bodies and necks are drawn on the blanks using templates‚Äîthen cut, dried, and stored in a controlled environment. In addition to wood, Vigier uses other materials such as copper and steel alloys (Delta metal and iMetal) and Phenowood, a resin- based composite material. Vigier builds bodies from two pieces. They machine cuts and bevels with CNC tools, and make fingerboards corrected to within 1/100 of a millimeter. The necks are fitted with the 90/10 design (90% wood, 10% carbon) whereby a carbon reinforcement bar replaces an adjustable truss rod. They do the rest of the operations by hand. Instrument weight is maintained between 3 and 3.7 kg. Instruments are hand finished with about ten layers of stain and clear coat to a thickness of approximately 0.7 mm. Glue and finish are dried for five weeks. Guitars and basses have stainless steel frets, a zero fret, a teflon nut, oversized locking tuners, DiMarzio potentiometers, and Neutrik locking jacks. Cavities are shielded. Straps pegs are secured with deepm inserts. For its floating bridge models, Vigier uses a system that rests on needle bearings. The company produces an average of 500 instruments a year.  Awards  In 1992, Patrice Vigier was awarded \\"Luthier of the Year\\" in the electric guitar category. In 1993, the Excalibur was awarded the title of \\"Most Innovative Guitar of the Year\\" by the American magazine The Music And Sound Retailer. The American magazine Premier Guitar also has nominated Vigier's guitars, twice for the Premier Gear Awards: the G.V. Wood in 2011 and the Excalibur Special 7 in 2013.

Biography Kenny was born in Dublin, the only son of Edward Kenny, solicitor, of Kilrush, County Clare, and his wife, Catherine (n√©e Murphy). Before he was called to the bar in 1868, he had graduated with a B.A. from Trinity College, Dublin and worked as a clerk in the Census Office. He practiced on the Munster Circuit and became a Q.C. in 1885 and a Bencher of the King's Inns in 1890. He was mainly instrumental in establishing the Liberal Union of Ireland after the defeat of the Home Rule Bill of 1886, and in organising the visit of Lord Hartington and George Goschen to Dublin in 1887. In 1891 Kenny was adopted as unionist candidate in the upcoming General Election. Kenny was returned to Parliament for Dublin St Stephen's Green in the 1892 general election as a unionist over the nationalist candidate, George Noble Plunkett, aka Count Plunkett, whose son, Joseph Mary Plunkett, was a leader in the 1916 Easter Rising. Count Plunkett would later be elected to office as a Sinn F√©in member, after the Rising. The Liberal Unionists promoted land reform and peasant land ownership as a means of positively preserving the Union but were opposed strongly to local government. William Kenny corresponded with Lord Hartington to that effect calling Chamberlain's proposed county councils an \\"awful scheme of provincial councils\\" and demanding a centralised local government as an alternative. Kenny served as Solicitor-General for Ireland from 1895 to 1898 in the Unionist administration of Lord Salisbury. In the House of Commons, he joined his cousin Matthew Joseph Kenny, who had been elected as a Parnellite in 1882. In 1895 he sat on the Tourist Committee for Ireland. In 1898 Kenny was appointed a Judge of the High Court and resigned as Solicitor-General and from his seat in the House of Commons. He was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and was sworn in by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Earl Cadogan, at Dublin Castle on 11 August 1902. Kenny remained on the bench until his death at his Dublin residence, Marlfield, Cabinteely, on 4 February 1921, aged 75. His portrait by Sarah Purser hangs in the King's Inns. Maurice Healy in his memoir The Old Munster Circuit described Kenny as stern and inflexible, somewhat lacking in empathy for those poorer than himself, but also a sound and learned lawyer with a strong sense of justice. He suggests that Kenny's political views made him a somewhat isolated figure, since in the atmosphere of the 1890s and 1900s, Catholic Unionists were regarded by their opponents with particular suspicion. Family Kenny married Mary Coffey on 13 August 1873, and they had a family of eight children.

The meaning of its name in Chinese is ‚ÄúUniversity Road‚Äù, as it was first a road near West China Union University (; now the Huaxi District of Sichuan University; ) in 1910. Orientation Daxue Road is located in the south of Chengdu, running a west‚Äìeast direction. It begins from South Renmin Road (‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂçóË∑Ø) and continues eastward towards Hongxing Road (Á∫¢ÊòüË∑Ø). The road is about long and wide. 116 phoenix trees (Stercuiia platanitolia) lining the street and divided it into 3 parts, 2 for pedestrian, 1 for cars. History In the beginning of 20th Century In 1905, West China Union Middle School was established as a union intervention of the American Mutual Foreign Mission Society, the Friends' Foreign Mission Association of Great Britain and Ireland, the General Board of Missions of theMethodist Church of Canada, (later the United Church of Canada) and the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church USA. Then West China Union University opened in 1910 under the same supervision and built according to the plans set out mainly by Fred Rowntree. The Daxue Road was one of the interior roads of the university at that time. Moreover, it was called \\"Main road to city south gate\\" and \\"road to city east gate\\" as the gateway road of the university to the city. On the north side of the street there were mainly dormitories of university students and staff accommodations of West China Union Middle School and on the south side were the teaching area of university. Along the street there are the Whiting Memorial Administration Building (), The Lamont Library and Harvard-Yenching Museum (), education offices(not existed today), Religious Room (not existed today) etc. After the foundation of the P.R. China to the 21st Century As the mushrooming of urban construction in Chengdu, in 1960, the newly planned South Renmin Road separated the university into two parts. And as the increasing of residence housings built in and around this district, Daxue Road, from an interior university road, gradually became a city street serving for all the citizens. In the 1990s, it was one of the major markets in Chengdu, named as \\"Daxue Road Market ()\\". Between every phoenix tree there was one or two stalls, strengthened to the pedestrian area. The total area of the market reached about 8,000 m2. During the night, there was night market, mobile stalls selling cheap food and small commodities everywhere. Pedestrians, bicycles and cars all went through in the center of the road. From 2006 to present Current Streetscape of Daxue Road, Chengdu (ÊàêÈÉΩÂ§ßÂ≠¶Ë∑ØË°óÈÅìÂç≥ÊôØ) In 2006, Chengdu government listed Daxue Road as one of the important reforming Culture Blocks. A new Market building was built and all the former venders had been asked to move in. Buildings along the street had been repainted. Brick walls enclosing the campus had been replaced by iron railings or hedges in order that people walking on the street could see the campus buildings. After this renewal, although on the ground floor of the buildings along this street are mostly small restaurants and groceries, Daxue Road became one of the main transportation roads west‚Äìeast orientation of Chengdu. Sightseeing Along the street there are two buildings listed in the Heritage buildings in Chengdu in 2001. ; The Whiting Memorial Administration Building The Whiting Memorial Administration Building () was originally the studio of West China Union University (). It was built from 1915 to 1919, designed by British Architect Fred Rowntree, who was also the main designer of the whole campus. It used the inverted arched technology at that time, which was the advanced during that time. Now this building is used as the office building of Huaxi District of Sichuan University. ; The Lamont Library and Harvard-Yenching Museum The Lamont Library and Harvard-Yenching Museum () finished construction in 1926 and now is used as Campus History Museum of Sichuan University.

Yellow Pages Endeavour has been succeeded in record attempts by the similarly designed Extreme 50, renamed Macquarie Innovation, built and operated by the same team. Design and construction Designed by Lindsay Cunningham, both boats are triscaph proa- like designs (though often referred to as a trimaran) intended for sailing in one direction. They have three hulls attached to a Y-shaped aka. The ama, or windward hull, contains the cockpit and controls for the two crew members. The remaining two hulls travel in line, forming a vaka, or leeward hull. The rigid wingsail is attached to the center of the Y. Yellow Pages Endeavour used a high aspect sail, while the Macquarie Innovation uses a larger, lower aspect sail on a wider platform in an attempt to generate more power with less heeling force. Though the designs are often referred to as foil born, the hulls are designed to plane, and both versions have been photographed with the ama lifted clear of the water. A series of cavitation resistant asymmetric foils, with fences to prevent ventilation at high speeds, are situated in the vaka hulls serve to provide lateral resistance. The construction of the load- bearing portions of the vaka hulls and aka are primarily of unidirectional carbon fiber composite over a nomex core. These are then faired using heat shrink membrane over foam cores. The ama is constructed of lightweight marine grade plywood, and is designed to shatter and throw the crew clear of the cockpit in the event of a crash. The wingsail is made of a heat shrink membrane over a lightweight foam core. Record attempts In October 1993 skipper Simon McKeon and crew member Tim Daddo took the world record in the Yellow Pages Endeavour with an official speed of 46.52 knots (53.5 mph or 86.2 km/h) off the coast of Sandy Point, Victoria, Australia. The record was set in winds of 19 to , for a top speed of 2.3 times the windspeed. In early testing, the Macquarie Innovation demonstrated speeds of in 15-- of wind, 2.5 times windspeed, and the team hopes that a good sailing day in of wind will break the barrier. In 2008, the World Speed Sailing Record Council certified a C class 500 meter record of for the Macquarie Innovation, skippered by Simon McKeon at Sandy Point. In 2009, McKeon and the Innovation broke the 50 knot barrier, with a certified speed of . The team contested the speed as certified, due to a adjustment to the recorded speed to compensate for an ebbing tide during the record run. The Macquarie Team position is that most, if not all, of the 0.35 knot correction was due to wind blown drift, not the ebb tide, and was therefore applied in error. Difficulties The Yellow Pages Endeavour and Macquarie Innovation designs are highly specialized craft, designed to operate only under ideal conditions for record attempts. The location, Sandy Point, provides the unusual combination of very smooth water and high winds needed for record attempts. Even so, times when ideal conditions are available are scarce; in the 2007 season, one 28-day period yielded only 1.5 hours of good sailing time, in a wind, not enough for a record-setting performance Every run also risks a crash, which, due to the lightweight nature of the craft, can result in disaster, such as in 2004 when a capsize destroyed the Macquarie Innovation. When this happens, the vessel must be rebuilt, costing time, money, and possible good sailing days. On the other hand,Yellow Pages Endeavour set the world record only eight months after a crash that wrecked the vessel.

English-French dictionary For fourteen years he devoted himself largely to compiling a new English-French and French-English dictionary. It appeared in 1846 as General English and French Dictionary, newly composed from the English dictionaries of Johnson, Webster, Richardson, &c.;, and from the French dictionaries of the French Academy, of Laveaux, Boiste, (London, 1846). It proved superior to anything which had preceded it, and was at once ‚Äòautoris√© par le conseil de l'instruction publique‚Äô, 3 July 1846. The twenty-ninth edition, in two volumes, appeared in 1884 (remodelled by H. Witcomb, Spiers's successor at the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es), and it remained for a long time a standard dictionary. Both Ralph Waldo Emerson and John Muir owned copies. An abridgment, under the title of Dictionnaire abr√©g√© Anglais-Fran√ßais et Fran√ßais-Anglais, abr√©g√© du Dictionnaire G√©n√©ral de M. Spiers, was brought out in 1851 and supplied to almost every school and lyc√©e in France. In November 1857 he brought an action against L√©on Contanseau and his publishers, Longmans & Co., for violating the copyright of his dictionaries in a work entitled A Practical Dictionary of the French and English Languages‚Äô but Vice-chancellor Sir William Page Wood (afterwards Lord Hatherley), in his decision on 25 February 1858, said that, although great use of Spiers's books had been made without due acknowledgement, yet in regard to such publications, which were not entirely original, a charge of piracy could not be sustained. Major General Sir Edward Louis Spears, 1st Baronet (1886‚Äì1974) was his grandson, who had changed his name from Spiers to Spears. Works Besides his Dictionary, Spiers's chief publications were: :1. Manual of Commercial Terms in English and French, 1846. :2. Study of the English Prose Writers, Sacred and Profane, 1852. :3. Treatise on English Versification, 1852. :4. The English Letter- Writer, 1853. :5. Study of English Poetry, a choice collection of the finest pieces of the poets of Great Britain, 1855. All these works were issued in both English and French editions in London, Paris, and America (New York or Philadelphia). Spiers also printed and edited for French students Sheridan's The School for Scandal and The Essays of F. Bacon, Viscount St. Albans (1851).

Life Sterling, eldest son of Captain Edward Sterling, by Hester, daughter of John Coningham of Derry, was born at Dundalk in 1805. John Sterling, the man of letters, was a younger brother. After keeping some terms at Trinity College, Cambridge, he was on 18 February 1826 gazetted ensign in the 24th Foot. From 21 March 1834 to 5 December 1843 he was a captain in the 73rd Foot, and was then placed on half-pay. He was on active service during the Crimean campaign of 1854‚Äì5, first as Brigade Major of the Highland brigade and afterwards as assistant adjutant-general to the Highland division, including the battles of the Alma, Balaklava, and Inkerman, and the siege of Sebastopol. He received the medal with four clasps, the order of the Legion of Honour, the Turkish medal, and the fourth class of the Medjidie. On 17 October 1857 he sold his commission, retiring with the rank of colonel; but during 1858‚Äì1859 he was again employed as military secretary to Sir Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde, in the suppression of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, and received a medal with clasp. In 1861 Lord Clyde accused Sterling of wilfully neglecting to insert the name of Colonel Pakenham in a list of persons recommended for reward by the bestowal of the KCB at the close of the mutiny. This led to many letters, which are given in Correspondence concerning Charges made by Lord Clyde against Sir Anthony Sterling, March 1861 (privately printed 1863).

A devout Seventh- day Adventist artist, he is best known for Christian-themed illustrations he painted for the Adventist church and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was also a popular illustrator of short stories in American weekly magazines during the 1930s and early 1940s.  Biography  Harry's father Joseph named all his male children \\"Joseph\\" so each son went by their middle names, thus Harry Anderson is the name he went by. Originally intending to be a mathematician, in 1925 while attending the University of Illinois, Joseph Harry Anderson discovered a talent and love for drawing and painting. In 1927, he moved to Syracuse, New York and attended the Syracuse School of Art with friend and fellow artist Tom Lovell for classical art education. He graduated in 1931 during the Great Depression and had difficulty making a living. Within a year he earned enough by doing art for magazines to return home to Chicago. By 1937 he was working on national advertising campaigns and doing work for several major magazines, the names of his clients were American Airlines, American Magazine, Buster Brown Shoes, Coca-Cola, Collier's, Cosmopolitan, Cream of Wheat, Esso, Ford, Good Housekeeping, Humble Oil, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, Ladies' Home Journal, Massachusetts Mutual, Ovaltine, Redbook, The Saturday Evening Post, Woman's Home Companion, Wyeth and others. The painting \\"What Happened to Your Hand\\" became a ubiquitous print in Sunday schools and churches during the 1950s and 1960s. About 1940, Anderson married Ruth Huebel, a girl who worked in his building and posed for him on one occasion. The following year he went to work for Haddon Sundblom's studio. In 1944, Anderson and his wife joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church and, by request, in 1945 he did his first painting of Jesus. Anderson's painting, \\"What Happened to Your Hand?\\", depicting Jesus with modern-day children was decried as blasphemous by some adults, but was eventually printed in the publishing program after the editor's daughter longingly wished that she too could sit on Jesus' lap like the girl in the painting. This was the very first painting of Jesus done showing Him in a modern-day setting. From that time on, he split his time between commercial illustrations and religious ones. He painted approximately 300 religious-themed illustrations for Review and Herald Publishing Association at near minimum wage. Anderson was featured in a 1956 issue of American Artist and received awards from several associations throughout his career. He was awarded the New York Art Directors Club. In 1994, he was inducted into the Society of Illustrators' Hall of Fame. In the mid-1960s, he was commissioned to create a number of paintings for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He painted a large oil mural of Jesus ordaining his apostles for the church's pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair. Following this, he did nearly two dozen more paintings for the LDS Church; enlarged re-paintings of many of these are displayed in the Temple Square Visitors Center and the lobby of the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and at other prominent church locations. Re-prints of some of Anderson's paintings can be found hanging in nearly every LDS Church meetinghouse and temple in the world. The paintings are also still widely used by the church for many of its printed and online materials. In his 70s and 80s, Anderson made western-themed paintings for several fine art galleries.

The story concerns four children and a dog whose journey in a magical rainbow results in an adventure that finds them on a race against time to save the world. Rainbow was the world's first all digital film and was shot in high-definition video. Shot entirely with Sony's first Solid State Electronic Cinematography cameras and featuring over 35 minutes of digital image processing and visual effects, all post production, sound effects, editing and scoring were completed digitally. The Digital High Definition image was transferred to 35mm negative using Sony's Electron Beam Recorder for theatrical release.  Synopsis  Mike \\"Mikey\\" Bailey is a rambunctious 10-year-old living in Hudson Harbour, New Jersey. His notable family members include his grandfather Frank, a magician; mother Jackie; and older brother Steve who is a loner and wishes to join a local street gang. Mike encounters a stray dog who he names Mutt, who leads him to a spot where he seemingly witnesses a rainbow actually land. He tells his friends Pete and Tessy of his encounter and takes them to the landing site, but they do not believe his claims. At the site they find a triangular crater, Tessy taking a soil sample and testing it, the soil illuminating in colour and vanishing in her hand. Mike, Pete and Tessy prepare a scientific project to track down the next rainbow and examine it. Eventually, a rainbow appears and the three, along with Steve and Mutt, race across town on their bicycles to get to the rainbow. Upon arrival, they witness the rainbow land and are sucked into a colourful pathway, taking photographs as they go. They then enter a dark area of the rainbow filled with gold, Steve taking three pieces which causes the rainbow to vanish and drop the group in a cornfield. They are revealed to be in Kansas, and are taken to the local sheriff's office at an airport. Sheriff Wyatt Hampton contacts Jackie to pick them up, but the group flee into the airport to print their photos of the rainbow's interior. Jackie and Frank come to the children's aid when they arrive back in Hudson Harbour, but no one believes their story except Frank. Steve sells one of the pieces of gold to a pawnbroker's, and another to the street gang, and attempts to join, only to be humiliated and rejected. The children's school science teacher, Sam Cohen, obtains the photos and discovers the children's project. Eventually, colour begins to drain from the world and people either act aggressively towards each other or fall unconscious. The children, Frank, Jackie and Sam all deduce that due to Steve's removal of the gold pieces, the rainbow has been damaged and caused colour, oxygen and photosynthesis to be drained, and all life could be threatened. The group split up to retrieve the gold pieces. Mike and Frank break into the pawnbroker's and retrieve a piece of the gold, Tessy and Jackie gain results on where the next rainbow will appear, and Steve, Pete and Sam gain the other gold piece from the street gang. With time almost up, Mike, Steve and Mutt race out to the new rainbow's landing site. Mike and Mutt are absorbed by a faulty rainbow, but Mike tosses the gold pieces back into it, restoring the rainbow and the world to normality. Mike and Mutt then end up in a tropical rainforest, as the film ends.

Production  Principal photography began in Montreal on 21 September 1994, the start of a nine-week shoot that would take the cast and crew through to the end of November. This included two weeks of green screen studio filming. Clarenceville, a 30-minute drive from Montreal, was the site of the important cornfield scenes (doubling for Kansas), and the opening and closing of the film features aerial footage in New York City and Hawaii. The remainder was shot in Montreal. Montreal was chosen for the production site due its ideal mix of architecture and weather conditions. \\"When the script was originally written, the locale was set in Washington D.C.\\" Visual Consultant, 2nd Unit Director and Executive Producer David L. Snyder stated. \\"When we arrived in Montreal Bob and I made the decision to change the locale to New Jersey and not move the production around, as we had found everything we needed in Quebec. A fictional city located in New Jersey can be fairly nondescript and much less identifiable than Boston, New York City, or Washington for that matter.\\" Hoskins chose Snyder to establish the appropriate look after their experience working together on Super Mario Bros. Pre-production commenced at Ealing Studios, London prior to the move to Montreal. The Ealing conferences dealt with script readings and visual concepts, including some preliminary filming of various 'practical' man-made rainbows. Bob Hoskins, Freddie Francis Once in Canada, Snyder met with Production Designer Claude Pare and asked him to turn his concepts into reality, which included design ideas for the Hudson Harbor settings. A primary task involved taking a French-Canadian city and replacing all the French language signage with English language graphics and signage. For a film that's featured set-piece is a ride through the Rainbow and whose story features the loss of colour to the world, costume designer Janet Campbell's role was especially important. Each character's look was also designed to reflect his or her individuality. \\"Steve is one good example,\\" says Campbell. \\"He's older than the other kids and is a rebel, so the colors I've chosen for him are darker. But toward the end, when his true nature begins to shine through, the colors of his clothing become brighter.\\" The best example of Campbell's attempts to showcase colour came in the guise of Jack The Prophet, the character which warns about the impending advent of doomsday. In early October, in the area of Montreal known as the Plateau Mont Royal, the cast and crew spent several days filming both the inside and outside of an authentic American diner. The Galaxie Diner, transformed for the film into Ynez and Charlie's Galaxie Diner, serving Spanish-Chinese food, plays an important part of the film. About seventy-five extras were needed to portray a mob brandishing baseball bats, overturning cars and generally causing havoc, as the world turns headlong into disaster. Opposing them are 15 members of Montreal's actual SWAT team (many of whom had prior experience working on films) and several mounted policemen. The eight-strong stunt crew included veteran, five-time world karate champion, Jean Frenette. He performed the motorcycle jump over a car and through the deadly 'Wall of Fire', with a pillion rider seated behind him. To achieve the floating quality for the interior of the Rainbow, originally the traditional special effects concept of harnesses and wire rigs hanging the actors from the rafters was suggested. However, the film's Visual Effects Supervisor, Steven Robiner, brought in from Sony Pictures in Los Angeles, had a different idea. Robiner said \\"Aesthetics was my main concern; we wanted to show the kids really floating through the rainbow, and none of these actors were gymnasts so I felt strongly that it would be much easier for them to express this feeling of floating and weightlessness being underwater. It was also going to be much easier in the post production process to composite the children within the rainbow, and not have to worry about hand-painted wire-removal\\" Robiner's plan was to submerge a green screen inside a diving training pool that had an instructors window, under the water, at the side. Fortunately, a nearby Montreal university, located in Montreal's east end, had exactly the type of pool he was looking for. At first this underwater concept was questioned as being too radically different and untried, however after Robiner pointed out that this would also save the production about 3 days of shooting because more than 70% of the rainbow interior scenes could be all shot at this one single pool location with a locked off camera and lights, the producers agreed. To help the children adjust to this potentially hostile environment, the producers engaged the services of aquatic consultant Daniel Berthiaume. Shooting under water lasted for two full days and Berthiaume was in the water for periods of three to five hours at a time. The last portion of the shoot continued on a large sound stage in Montreal, where the Visual Effects segments involving the kids travelling through the rainbow was to be filmed. The stage's 3-story high walls and floor were all painted with the special green coloured paint necessary for the compositing process. Special mechanical seats, platforms and camera rigs concept designs were made by Steven Robiner and John Galt and then engineered and built by Special Effects Supervisor Antonio Vidosa and his crew. For a shot in which the four kids are to float, spinning in the form a circle with each child holding the hand of the kid on each side of them, with their heads together and feet at the outer edge, then they let go their hands and each spin off and away from the others. Originally it was suggested to do this with the four actors hanging on wires, but Robiner rejected that idea because \\"hanging four kids on wires just seemed to be a dangerous and time- consuming idea, on top of being difficult for them to perform in...\\" To produce a shot in which the kids are supposed to be spinning head over heals while floating in the rainbow, another rig was used that let the actor remain motionless while the camera rotated 720 degrees over his head, behind his back, and then under his feet and up again. The old style HD cameras had umbilical cables for power and signal transmission which needed to be carefully wound around a large spool as the camera rotated. Royal connection Autumn Kelly (age 17), later a member of the British royal family by marriage, has a small part as one of the Tigerette gang. Reception Philip Kemp's review in Sight & Sound, August 1996, commented that \\"the story is put across with energy and imagination\\" and pointed out that the scenes where \\"colour drains away and society starts tearing itself apart‚Ä¶ are genuinely disturbing [with] effective use of transitions between colour and monochrome.\\" Kemp further reflected that the \\"chief credit for the clarity and richness of the images should go to veteran cinematographer Freddie Francis, whose experience of colour/monochrome effects goes back 40 years to his work with Oswald Morris on John Huston's Moby Dick.‚Äù According to Halliwell's Film Guide, Rainbow was a \\"Heavy-handed, didactic children's film that strives for a fairy-tale quality, but too frequently falls flat.\\" References External links  Category:1996 films Category:British films Category:British fantasy films Category:1990s children's fantasy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Bob Hoskins Category:Films shot in Montreal ","title":"Rainbow (1996 film)"},{"id":"13987309","text":"Grandia may refer to: *Grandia (series), video game franchise *Grandia (video game), first game *Grandia II, second game *Grandia III, third game *Grandia Xtreme, PS2 game *Grandia Online, online game *Grandia: Parallel Trippers, GBC game *Grandia: Digital Museum, other game ","title":"Grandia (disambiguation)"},{"id":"13987326","text":"Kirtland's snake (Clonophis kirtlandii) is a threatened or endangered (depending on location) North American species of nonvenomous snake of the subfamily Natricinae, of the family Colubridae. www.reptile-database.org.

Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. . (Clonophis kirtlandi, pp. 156-157). Geographic range Kirtland's snake is found in Illinois, Indiana, northern Kentucky, southern Michigan, Ohio, and western Pennsylvania. Habitat The preferred natural habitats of C. kirtlandii are forest, grassland, and wetlands such as swamps and marshes. It is almost always found very close to a water source, even though it is less aquatic than water snakes of the genus Nerodia which share its geographic range. Conservation status The species Clonophis kirtlandii is listed as endangered in Indiana,. Michigan, and Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Fish & Boat Commission. It is listed as threatened in Illinois and Ohio, though current research in Ohio is leaning towards the snake being listed as vulnerable. Diet Kirtland's snake feeds on primarily crayfish, along with the occasional earthworm, slug, minnow, salamander, frog and toad. Kirtland's snake may have a venom adapted towards killing crayfish. Defensive behavior When alarmed C. kirtlandii flattens its entire body to a remarkable thinness, and becomes rigid.Schmidt, K.P., and D.D. Davis (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (Natrix kirtlandii, pp. 209-210 + Plate 22, Center, on p. 342). Kirtland's snake will also coil up into a disc the size of about a quarter in an attempt to hide from potential threats. If this does not succeed, it will then flee instead of fight. No person on record has ever been bitten by a Kirtland's snake. This species prefers intimidation, hiding, and fleeing rather than any form of fighting. Reproduction Kirtland's snake is ovoviviparous. Females give birth in August and September. Brood size varies from 4 to 22. Each newborn is 13‚Äì17 cm (5-6¬æ in.) in total length and averages 1.4 gm in weight. References Further reading *Behler, J.L., and F.W. King (1979).

Besides mentions in the Historia Augusta, Geta is known from several inscriptions, two of which were found in Leptis Magna, Africa (East of Tripoli in modern Libya).Historia Augusta, \\"Severus\\", 1.2; 2.3. A.R. Birley, Septimius Severus: The African Emperor, revised edition (New Haven: Yale University, 1988), pp. 215, 218  Early life  Geta was of Punic origin. His family were local, wealthy and distinguished in Leptis Magna, a prominent city of the Carthaginian Empire, founded by Phoenicians. His father, Lucius Septimius Severus (c. 70 ‚Äì aft. 110) was sufes and prefectus when Lepcis was made a colonia and its inhabitants were granted citizenship under Trajan; Lucius was the first duumvir of the new colonia (IRT 412). He is likely the wealthy equestrian that is highly commemorated by the Flavian dynasty poet Statius (Silvae 4.5, 4.praef.). Geta's paternal grandparents were Marcus Septimius Aper (born c. 35), and Octavia.Birley, Septimius Severus, pp. 218f Geta also had a sister named Septimia Polla, who apparently never married; Geta honored her memory with a silver statue.Birley, Septimius Severus, p. 214 While Geta seems to have held no political offices, either local or imperial, other members of his family were distinguished. He had two cousins, who served as Consuls under Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius: Gaius Septimius Severus, suffect consul in 160; and Publius Septimius Aper, suffect consul in July 153.Birley, Septimius Severus, pp. 214, 219 Another relative of his was Lucius Septimius Severus Aper, ordinary consul in 207.

She was also greatly known as a social educator and curriculum development scholar. Life and career Miel was born in Six Lakes, Michigan, where she grew up. In 1928, she graduated from the University of Michigan. Three years following her graduation she received her master's. From that point in her life, she went on the get her doctorate in education at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1944. Miel focused on the democratic social learning environment of children in schools. She supported democratic ideals and the development of democratic behavior as the ultimate goal of schooling. She was one of the first to apply social learning theories, democratic principles, and processes to various areas of curriculum development and school administration. Miel believed social learning should be taught throughout the day not just one subject area. She also believed the teacher was the most important factor in curriculum change and reform would fail if all the people carrying them out were not included. Miel believed it was important to include social issues in the curriculum and was interested in issues of equity and diversity. Although her ideas were well thought through, they were not received very well at the time for many reasons. They include: 1\\\\. People thought in terms of discrete subject areas. 2\\\\. She published \\"More Than Social Studies\\" in a time where American education was considered soft and in dire need of more math and science. The focus on math and science was increased even more by The National Defense Act which linked federal support to a national policy objective. 3\\\\. Finally, 3. Alice Miel lacked affiliation with social studies traditionalists and was not considered an expert or specialist in any of the social sciences. She had become a teacher at the height of the Progressive Movement in education and it became a strong undercurrent in her life. Miel's career started at Tappan Junior High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan where she began teaching Social Studies and Latin in elementary and secondary schools. While teaching at Ann Arbor she benefited from an educational environment in which local school faculty and students could practice the democratic skills of deliberation and decision-making. She later became the principal. An early landmark in Alice's life was in 1936 when she had a study session at Ohio State University with Laura Zirbes, a prominent figure in the field of elementary education. Miel left this meeting with an obligation to understanding children, not just content, and to providing for their individual differences. In 1945, Miel was appointed a professor at Teachers College and staff researcher at the Horace Mann-Lincoln Institute of school experimentation. Miel was an early president of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development from 1953-1954. In 1960, she took charge of the college's department of curriculum and teaching. While in the department, Miel encouraged the development of a curriculum that allows teachers to apply concepts from organized knowledge to the solution of social problems. She remained at Teachers College for three decades. In 1967, Dr. Miel wrote the book, The Shortchanged Children of Suburbia. The book focused on how the public schools were preparing children for a world filled with men and women of different races, religions, and economic backgrounds. She surveyed children and their attitudes toward themselves, their families, and their neighborhoods in rural, urban, and suburban areas. She found suburban children to be limited and isolated from people whom where different from themselves. She also found prejudices toward people of different races and religions deeply ingrained in the children. Lastly, she found parents and teachers were more likely to ignore or avoid racial differences. She struggled to teach people to \\"Take a walk around yourself\\", meaning that people should reflect inwardly before superficially judging human differences. Also, she thought educators should branch out and teach children about other people and various social problems. Miel received the National Education Association's Human Rights Award in 1968 for the publication of her book. In 1970 Miel helped found the World Council on Curriculum and Instruction. Dr. Miel retired from the Teacher College in 1971. Miel made many efforts to promote democratic leadership and decision-making among educators and to enhance the capacity of schools for change and self-renewal. She developed a knowledge base of factors that affect schools' capacity for change, used cooperative action research to help school systems plan research-based instructional innovations, worked to influence and involve a variety of members in the community to make decisions affecting their schools, and developed models of school change in her curriculum development research. Death After many achievements, on January 31, 1998 Dr. Miel died at the age of 91. As a professor of education and an author who focused on curriculum development, Dr. Miel taught and left her impression on the subject matter throughout the country and around the world.

His only sister, Sarah, married, on 1 May 1808, William Hazlitt. Stoddart was educated at Salisbury Grammar School, and, subsequently, at Christ Church, Oxford, at which he matriculated on 25 October 1790, and graduated B.A. in 1794, B.C.L. in 1798, and D.C.L. in 1801. He was admitted as a member of the College of Advocates in 1801, and from 1803 to 1807 he was the Advocate of the Crown and of the Admiralty at Malta. During his time in Malta Stoddart was visited by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. =Journalism= Stoddart subsequently returned to England to practice in the Doctors' Commons. In 1810, he started an association with The Times, for which he served as a leader-writer from 1812. In April 1814, Stoddart entered into an agreement with John Walter, the owner of The Times, to become the editor of the newspaper. The staunch Tory sympathy of Stoddart's articles provoked censure, but Stoddart refused Walter's requests that he moderate his tone, and, consequently, Walter authorised Thomas Barnes, then a reporter, to edit Stoddart's leading articles. However, Stoddart's political intemperacy increased until he was dismissed by Walter in winter 1816. Barnes became his successor.The History of The Times, vol. 1: The Thunderer in the Making, 1785-1841 (London: Printing House Square, 1935), p. 157-161 Two months later, Stoddart started a rival daily to The Times, entitled The New Times, which was shortly amalgamated with the Day. For a short time it appeared as the Day and New Times, but the first half of the title was removed in 1818, and survived as the New Times until about 1828. During the period of his editorship, Stoddart was scurrilously known as \\"Dr. Slop\\", and was the subject of several satires, of which A Slap at Slop (1820) had four editions. =Judicial career= His connection with the New Times probably ceased in 1826, when he was appointed chief justice and justice of the Vice-Admiralty Court in Malta. On 27 July he was knighted by George IV at St. James's Palace. Stoddart learned Italian because the Maltese complained that former judges had been imperfectly acquainted with the languages spoken on the island. He published in three parts, between 1830 and 1832, Trial by Jury: a Speech on the Opening of a Commission in Malta for establishing a modified Trial by Jury, translated from the Italian. During an outbreak of cholera on the island, he contributed to its successful suppression. =Later years in England= Stoddart returned to England in 1840. He studied etymological theory, which he believed would supplant that of Horne Tooke, and published the first part of the same, in a work named Glossology, or the Historical Relations of Languages, in 1858 in the Encyclop√¶dia Metropolitana. He died at 13 Brompton Square, London. Personal life On 1 August 1803, John Stoddart married Isabella Moncrieff, who was the eldest daughter of the Reverend Sir Henry Wellwood-Moncreiff, 8th Baronet (1750 - 1828) and by Susan Robertson Barclay. Lady Isabella Moncrieff was born on 31 March 1774, and died on 2 February 1846. She wrote several novels under the pseudonym \\"Mrs. Martha Blackford\\". At his death in 1856, the Annual Register reported that John Stoddart left \\"a very numerous family\\". A Register of the Scholars Admitted Into Merchant Taylors' School (1883) includes four Stoddarts as pupils. Henry Moncrieff Stoddart, born 23 July 1808, is identified as the eldest son of Sir John Stoddart. The register notes that he entered Charterhouse School in 1817 and \\"died while a monitor at school\\". William Wellwood Stoddart (b. 9 November 1809), also entered Charterhouse in 1817. He became vicar of Charlbury, Oxfordshire, and died at Genoa on 21 Nov. 1856. Thomas Robertson Stoddart, who is identified as the third son of Sir John Stoddart, \\"died young.\\" There was another son, Charles Benson Earle Stoddart (b. 8 May 1816). Another son, John Frederick, became a member of the Scottish bar in 1827, a judge in Ceylon in 1836, and died of a jungle fever while on circuit on 29 Aug. 1839 (Gent. Mag. 1840, i. 110). One daughter, Isabella Maxwell Stoddart, married Captain George Whitmore at Malta, on 22 February 1827. Another, Mary Anne Stoddart, married Francis Baring Atkinson at Malta on 24 December 1831, and died bearing a child at Marseilles, 29 November 1832. Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage (1865) mentions only one daughter, (Isabella) Whitmore, and three sons, John-Frederick, William, Thomas. Publications Stoddart published in 1801 Remarks on the Local Scenery and Manners of Scotland, London, 2 vols. 8vo. Of his writings on legal subjects, the most important was A Letter to Lord Brougham, one in the minority of the law lords by whom the great Irish marriage case, Queen v. Millis, was decided in 1844, and, as Stoddart endeavored to show, erroneously decided. On this case he also published in 1844 a pamphlet entitled Irish Marriage Question: Observations on the Opinions delivered by Lord Cottenham in the Irish Marriage Case, 1844. His legal acumen was also shown in his article \\"The Head of the Church\\" in the Law Review, February 1851, pp. 418‚Äì36. He translated from the French of Joseph Despaze The Five Men, or a review of the Proceedings and Principles of the Executive Directory of France, with the lives of the present Members, (1797); and, with Georg Heinrich Noehden, Schiller's Fiesco, (1796), and Don Carlos, (1798). To the quarto edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Metropolitana he contributed \\"Grammar\\" (i. 1‚Äì193), and the introductory chapter on \\"The Uses of History as a Study\\" (ix. 1‚Äì80); and to the octavo edition, 1850, an introduction to the Study of Universal History, besides \\"Glossology\\" in 1858.

Life Taylor, third son of Samuel Taylor, farmer, was born at Hinton, Suffolk, on 18 January 1789. He was educated at Halesworth, and articled to Mr. Webb, land surveyor at Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, in July 1805. He received further instruction from William Smith (1769‚Äì1839), the \\"Father of British geology\\", and finally became a land surveyor at Norwich in 1813, moving to London in October 1826. In the early part of his career he was engaged on the Ordnance Survey of England. Subsequently he was occupied in reporting on mining properties, including that of the British Iron Company in South Wales, his plaster model of which received the Isis medal of the Society of Arts. In July 1830 he went to the United States of America, and, after surveying the Blossburg coal region in Pennsylvania, spent three years in the exploration of the coal and iron veins of the Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company in Dauphin County in the same state. He published an elaborate report with maps. He also made surveys of mining lands in Cuba and the British provinces. His knowledge of theoretical geology led him to refer the old red sandstone that underlies the Pennsylvania coalfields to its true place, corresponding with its location in the series of European rocks. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society of London. He died at Philadelphia on 26 October 1851, having married in 1820 Emily, daughter of George Errington of Great Yarmouth, by whom he had four daughters. Works He devoted much time to arch√¶ology, and published ‚ÄòIndex Monasticus, or the Abbeys and other Monasteries ‚Ä¶ formerly established in the Diocese of Norwich and the Ancient Kingdom of East Anglia,‚Äô 1821. His other principal works were: * ‚ÄòOn the Geology of East Norfolk,‚Äô 1827. * ‚ÄòStatistics, History, and Description of Fossil Fuel,‚Äô 2nd edit. 1841. * ‚ÄòStatistics of Coal,‚Äô Philadelphia, 1848; 2nd edit. revised, 1854. * ‚ÄòThe Coalfields of Great Britain, with Notices of Coalfields in other parts of the World,‚Äô 1861. He compiled the index to the new edition of William Dugdale's Monasticon (1860), which took him two years.

It is an IL-4 and IL-13 antagonist that has been studied in a phase IIb clinical trial for the treatment of asthma. Two point mutations on pitrakinra (position 121 mutated from arginine to aspartic acid and position 124 mutated from tyrosine to aspartic acid) confer its ability to block signaling of IL-4 and interleukin-13 (IL-13) by preventing assembly of IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4RŒ±) with either IL-2RŒ≥ or IL-13RŒ±. Upregulation of Th2 cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13, is thought to be critical for the allergic inflammation associated with atopic diseases such as asthma and eczema. The targets of pitrakinra action are inflammatory cells (dendritic cells, Th2 cells, B cells) and structural cells (smooth muscle, endothelium, epithelium) that express IL-4RŒ±. The drug has been applied both as a subcutaneous injection and as an inhalation, but the latter formulation proved to be more effective. Mechanism of action Asthma results from a dysregulated, hyperresponsive immune response in the airways. Some immune cells in allergic asthmatics respond aggressively to foreign allergens with the release of IL-4 and 13, two key mediators that initiate a cycle of inflammation in the lung. Pitrakinra is an antagonist of the interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain, a protein that is also part of IL-13. It thereby blocks the inflammatory effects of IL-4 and IL-13, interrupting the Th2 lymphocyte immune response. Pitrakinra protects allergic cynomolgus monkeys from allergen-induced airways hyper-responsiveness and lung eosinophilia in both prophylactic and therapeutic model settings. Subcutaneous injection of pitrakinra in human patients with severe atopic eczema for 4 weeks or more decreases the eczema clinical score and circulating IgE concentrations, and normalized T-cell subsets. Decreases in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s (FEV1) after allergen challenge after 4 weeks of inhalation of pitrakinra supports the hypothesis that dual inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13 can affect the course of the late asthmatic response after experimental allergen challenge. The reduced frequency of spontaneous asthma attacks requiring rescue medication use suggests that the use of pitrakinra improves the control over asthma symptoms. In addition to improvements in the late asthmatic response, measurement of Fractional Expiratory Nitric Oxide (FENO) indicates that the resting inflammatory status of the lungs is significantly attenuated after inhalation of pitrakinra for 4 weeks. This result supports observations that IL-4 and other pro-inflammatory mediators induce nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) through STAT1 and STAT6 in epithelial cells. Basal FENO could be more dependent on up-regulation of iNOS by IL-4 and IL-13, whereas the increase in FENO after allergen challenge could involve additional pathways in epithelial cells and perhaps macrophages that are not affected by the inhibition of IL-4RŒ±. Pitrakinra may down-regulate baseline Th2 inflammation in the asthmatic lung while not interfering with the lung‚Äôs natural defenses in contact with large amounts of foreign allergen. Adverse events Pitrakinra is associated with few adverse effect, whether administered by subcutaneous injection or by inhalation in participants with atopic asthma or atopic eczema. The most common adverse event after subcutaneous administration is injection site-related discomfort, a common event with most injectable drugs. However, these events are neither associated with the development of antibodies nor with any discernible pattern (i.e., they were not more common at the end of the 4 weeks of exposure). There are also fewer spontaneous asthma attacks and respiratory-related adverse events that require rescue medication in participants who received pitrakinra subcutaneously than in those in the placebo group.

It is a horizontally scrolling shooter which takes inspiration from the Thunder Force series. The game has the player take control of a ship that can transform between a humanoid mecha and a space ship. The game was released in arcades in 1993, running on the TEC442-A hardware, then was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1996. It has never been released outside of Japan.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. The Buster Gears are fighter spaceships with various upgradeable weapons systems in the \\"Fighter\\" mode, but they can transform into an \\"Armor\\" mode, a humanoid warrior robot with several heavy fire arms. The Fighter mode is easily maneuverable, small, and fast; it also shoots straight in front of it. The Armor mode, on the other hand, is slower, bigger, and less responsive; it is capable of shooting up and down at a 45 degree angle, as well as straight. The firepower of the Armor mode is also superior. The weaponry of both modes can be upgraded by collecting P items which appear from defeating enemies. The ships can also acquire helper units by collecting either the T or G items. The Tracer unit is similar to the Fighter mode and it shoots forward when closing in on an enemy, while the Gunner unit is similar to the Armor mode and it homes on enemies. Both units also act as destructible shields. Buster Gears change mode by pressing the alternate button. There are two buttons, one for the Fighter mode and one for the Armor mode. Pressing both buttons results in the activation of a special attack, involving two units that appear above and below the Buster Gear. In Fighter mode, they are stationary and shoot in a circular manner. In Armor mode, the units rotate around the ship and provide forward cover fire. This special attack depletes the special attack meter and when it runs out, the units stop firing. The meter is filled up by unit inactivity and by collecting B items. Gameplay is similar to other Technosoft scrolling shooters, particularly the Thunder Force series. There are 8 stages in total. Stages consist of traveling through a scenario infested with enemies, which drop the various items aforementioned. Sometimes, there are minibosses, but there is always a rather large boss at the end of the stage. Defeating these bosses requires quick reactions and exploiting an inherent weakness. Enemies that are defeated yield points and upon completing a stage, several point bonuses are awarded. Extra lives are gained by acquiring a certain number of points. Unique to Hyper Duel is a ranking system, based upon how many P items have been acquired. The higher the number of upgrades the Buster Gear collects, the higher the number of bullets and shots on the screen. The Saturn version contains an original \\"Arcade Mode,\\" a practically arcade-perfect conversion of the original, as well as an updated \\"Saturn Mode.\\" In addition to including a new 3D opening cinematic, Saturn Mode also has cleaner, brighter, and more detailed sprites and backgrounds, even redrawn in some cases. The character select screen features 3D models of the Buster Gears. Certain animations are also smoother and redone to seem more 3D, particularly for the first boss. There are also some enhancements on the gameplay. For example, the Armor mode can lock its aim with the addition of a new button, allowing for independent aiming, a feature that was not present in the arcade version. Certain aspects of the game were also made harder. Overall, the Saturn version has more features. While the original arcade soundtrack used the native sound equipment of the arcade machine, the Saturn version boasts an arranged soundtrack that is CD quality. = Plot = A militant/alien group is threatening Earth and in response, Earth sends a unit of elite machines dubbed \\"Buster Gears‚Äù in order to defend itself. Thus, you assume the position of one of three pilots: Keith Spader, Lisa Rowling, or Dr. B. Lloyd. You then embark to defend the Earth through a series of several battlefields.  Development and release  The music of Hyper Duel was composed by Hyakutaro Tsukumo of Thunder Force V fame. It was originally released in 1993 for the arcade in Japan; it was later released for the Sega Saturn console on November 22, 1996 in Japan only. On May 1, 1997, the Saturn soundtrack was released by Technosoft in the album ‚ÄúTechnosoft Game Music Collection Vol. 6: Sanctuary.‚Äù Included were also four Thunder Force III arranges. On March 28, 2006, the soundtrack saw another release in the Factory Noise & AG album \\"Absolute Area -project Thunder Force VI-.\\" The Saturn tracks were remastered and packaged with several new arranges, as well a Thunder Force III arrange. The Saturn version has become a rare game for collectors. Eurogamer in 2014 listed the game as costing ¬£150 - ¬£220 in the United Kingdom.

Halloween, Present Day: Seven teenage friends; Seth, his girlfriend Tiffany, Lizzie, her boyfriend Doc, Nash, Ava, and Liam are driving through eastern Kansas Approx. 12m56s to a party when they stop for gas and directions. Seth finds a ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù through some backroads, but drives over an open bear trap, which destroys the car‚Äôs wheel. A young tow truck driver named Candy ‚Äúhappens upon‚Äù them and takes them to Wormwood Ridge, a town so small it does not appear on the map. Candy drops their van off at her father, ‚ÄúPa‚Äù Rusk‚Äôs garage/junkyard to be repaired and gives the others a tour of the town, which is preparing for the Headless Horseman Celebration, an annual event held every Halloween in Wormwood Ridge since 1806, the year the Horseman began stalking the area for heads according to legend. Seth and Ava go check on the van and discover it missing. Seth searches the junkyard for Pa Rusk when a headless figure emerges, decapitates him, and leaves with his severed head. When Seth does not return, Ava searches the junkyard and finds his body, then alerts the others. Candy reveals the history of ‚ÄúHeadless‚Äù, or Calvin Montgomery, a 19th-century serial killer who preyed on the children of Wormwood until the residents finally caught and hanged him in the town square, leaving him to rot until his body tore away from his head. Since then, Montgomery‚Äôs spirit rises every 7 years on Halloween to collect 7 youths‚Äô heads. Candy warns them that they must leave before Headless returns to claim his next head. The group attempts an escape into the forest on foot but a supernatural mist envelops them and Headless appears on horseback, scattering the group. In the confusion, Tiffany is decapitated and Headless collects her head, then disappears. The others hear church bells nearby and realize they are walking in circles, now back at Wormwood. The group splits up: Liam and Lizzie search for a working vehicle and Nash, Doc, and Ava search the town for weapons. The trio steals several guns from Kolchak Stillwall‚Äôs general store, but Headless appears and decapitates Doc, stealing his head. As Lizzie and Liam are searching the garage, they are attacked by Pa Rusk but Liam overpowers him. The four reunite at Kolchak‚Äôs but soon split again, with Lizzie and Nash work to get a car working while Ava and Liam search the town‚Äôs library for clues as to how to defeat Headless. Nash fixes a car and the four escape the town and are about to cross the bridge over the river when Headless appears and decapitates Nash, causing the car to crash. Pa Rusk shows up and forces Liam, Ava, and Lizzie back into town at gunpoint, where he ties them up for Headless. When Pa Rusk leaves, Candy unties the remaining three, revealing she is not originally from the town and wishes to escape with the others. She tells them that if Headless does not get his 7 heads, he and all of Wormwood will cease to exist entirely. Liam is able to call 911 and a patrol car is sent out to search the area but the inhabitants of Wormwood kill the officer as Headless appears and decapitates Lizzie. Candy steals Pa Rusk‚Äôs tow truck, running him down with it in the process. Liam and Ava lure Headless to the bridge out of town in an effort to destroy him because he cannot cross running water. Candy drives up in the tow truck and using the tow‚Äôs cable, Ava and Liam hook Headless then pull him onto the bridge where he simultaneously bursts into flames and melts, causing the bridge to catch fire. Wormwood, the buildings and all the people turn to dust and blow away leaving only Candy, Liam, and Ava alive as the bridge to Wormwood burns.

Education Jonathan Holt Titcomb was born in London on 29 July 1819, and educated at Brompton in 1826, and at Clapham from 1827 to 1830. In 1831, he moved to King's College School, from where he went in 1834 to Thomas Jarrett to be prepared for university. He entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1837, read for mathematical honours, and at the end of his first year gained a college scholarship. He graduated BA (junior optime) in 1841, and MA in 1845, and was created D.D. honoris causa in 1877. Career =Curate and vicar= In 1842 he took up residence in the house of Lady Harriet Forde of Hollymount, near Downpatrick, Ireland, as tutor to her nephew, Pierce Butler. He was ordained on 25 September 1842, and acted as curate at Downpatrick. In February 1844, he became curate of St. Mark's church, Kennington, London, and in April 1845 perpetual curate of St. Andrew- the-Less, a large parish in Cambridge where a portion of the population were of the most disreputable and degraded character. He married, in May 1845, Sarah Holt, eldest daughter of John Wood of Southport. They would have two sons, and eight daughters, four of whom died in the bishop's lifetime. Titcomb very soon made himself popular, and had large congregations attending his church; he instituted Sunday schools and district visitors, and became a very successful open-air preacher. He resigned his living in June 1859, and moved to South Kensington, London. For nearly three years he acted as secretary to the Christian Vernacular Education Society for India. In April 1861, Titcomb was presented to the vicarage of St. Stephen's, South Lambeth, where a new district church had been erected. From 1870 to 1876 he acted as rural dean of Clapham, Surrey, and in 1874 was made an honorary canon of Winchester Cathedral. His London engagements were also numerous: he was a member of the Eclectic Society and of the Prophetical Society, where he read papers; he lectured at the Christian Evidence Society, and argued with atheists at Bradlaugh's Hall of Science. His wife died on 25 January 1876, aged 52. The Earl of Onslow, who had witnessed the success of his ministry in South Lambeth, gave him the living of Woking, Surrey, in March 1876. In the following year he was appointed the first bishop of the newly formed diocese of Rangoon (now Yangon) in British Burma, and consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 21 December 1877. =Bishop of Rangoon= He landed in Rangoon on 21 February 1878, and during his short career in the country led an active life. He held a confirmation in the Andaman Islands, consecrated a missionary church at Toungoo, ordained to the diaconate Tamil and Karen converts, paid seven visits to Moulmein resulting in the appointment of a chaplain there, and baptised and confirmed numerous Tamils, Karens, Burmese, Chinese, Eurasians and Telugus. On 17 February 1881 he fell over a cliff in the Karen hills, and was so injured that he was ultimately obliged to return to England, where on 3 March 1882 he resigned his bishopric. An account of some portion of his career as a bishop is given in his autobiography Personal Recollections of British Burma, and its Church Mission Work in 1878‚Äì9 (London, 1880). His son, William Holt Yates Titcomb, was a figurative oil painter, particularly known for his depictions of Cornish fisherfolk. =Later life= After a period of rest, Titcomb was appointed by the bishop of London his coadjutor for the supervision of the English chaplains in Northern and Central Europe, extending over ten nations (i.e. a predecessor of the European Bishops of Fulham). After eight long continental journeys (1884‚Äì1886) his strength failed, and he accepted the vicarage of St. Peter's, Brockley, Kent. He formally resigned his post as coadjutor in or before March 1886. He died at St. Leonard's-on-Sea on 2 April 1887, aged 67, and was interred at Brompton Cemetery.

One writer has presented what he called \\"a simplistic view\\" of distinction bias: When asked if someone would like an apple, they may say \\"Yes\\". So, an apple is placed before them and they begin to eat it and are happy. But what if two apples were placed on the table - one was the one they would have happily eaten and the other which is slightly fresher looking. The individual will choose the fresher apple and eat it and be happy but if asked, \\"would you have enjoyed eating that other apple\\", they would likely say \\"No\\". Even though in the alternate, no-choice reality they were perfectly happy with the apple. Moreover, if presented with five apples on a table, they might examine each apple so that they would be sure they had the best one, even though the time spent making that decision would be wasted. The reason for this is that distinction bias causes individuals to \\"over- examine and over-value the differences between things as we scrutinize them.\\"  Hsee and Zhang  The concept of the distinction bias was advanced by Christopher K. Hsee and Jiao Zhang of the University of Chicago as an explanation for differences in evaluations of options between joint evaluation mode and separate evaluation mode (2004). Evaluation mode is a contextual feature in decision making. Joint evaluation mode is when options are evaluated simultaneously, and separate evaluation mode is when each option is evaluated in isolation (e.g., Hsee, 1998; Hsee & Leclerc, 1998). Research shows that evaluation mode affects the evaluation of options, such that options presented simultaneously are evaluated differently from the same options presented separately. Hsee and Zhang (2004) offered a number of potential explanations for this change in preferences from joint evaluation to separate evaluation, including the distinction bias. The distinction bias suggests that comparing two options, as done in joint evaluation, makes even small differences between options salient. In other words, viewing options simultaneously makes them seem more dissimilar than when viewing and evaluating each in isolation. When predictions or choices are made, explained Hsee and Zhang in their 2004 paper, people are often in the joint evaluation (JE) mode but when people experience an event, they are often in the single evaluation (SE) mode. The 'utility function' of an attribute can vary between single evaluation and joint evaluation. When people in joint evaluation make predictions or decisions for events to be experienced in single evaluation, they often resort to their joint evaluation preferences rather than single evaluation preferences and over-predict the difference that different values of an attribute will lead their happiness in single evaluation. This over- prediction is referred to as the distinction bias. Examples and applications For example, when televisions are displayed next to each other on the sales floor, the difference in quality between two very similar, high- quality televisions may appear great. A consumer may pay a much higher price for the higher-quality television, even though the difference in quality is imperceptible when the televisions are viewed in isolation. Because the consumer will likely be watching only one television at a time, the lower-cost television would have provided a similar experience at a lower cost. The same calculus can apply when one is choosing between a cheaper store-brand food product and a more expensive brand-name product. In many cases, the difference in taste between the two products would not be worth the difference in price. If the products were sampled in isolation, the difference in taste would be unnoticeable or negligible; consequently, the difference in price, not the difference in taste, ought to determine which choice the consumer makes. In 2010, a magazine asked consumers to try 12 brands of baked beans. Branston won the taste test, followed by Asda, Morrisons, and Heinz. The Morrisons beans, in other words, were preferred over the Heinz beans, even though, as it happened, they were half the price. One writer has discussed the distinction bias in connection with such matters as choosing a job or a house. When making a choice between an interesting job that pays $60,000 a year and a boring job that pays $70,000 a year or a choice between two equally priced houses, one of them larger but farther from work, the average individual is likely to make false assumptions ‚Äì for example, that $70,000 will make them feel exactly one- sixth better than $60,000, or that 4,000 square-foot house is one-third better than a 3,000 square-foot house. In reality, on average, we don't actually feel one-sixth better having the extra money or one-third better having the extra space. The more sensible approach, the writer advises in accordance with the research of Hsee and Zhang, is to avoid comparing two jobs, or houses, directly. Instead, consider each job, or house, individually and make an overall assessment of each one on its own, and then compare assessments, which allows them to make a choice that accurately predicts future experience. Further studies In 2009, Margaret E. Brooks, Ashley M. Guidroz, and Madhura Chakrabarti reported on two studies in which they had examined the reactions of job applicants to alternative approaches to diversity in employment decisions. The applicants preferred the so-called holistic approaches, and the magnitude of their preference was considerably greater when both approaches were evaluated simultaneously. The researchers found that the results, which they viewed as important for \\"applicant reactions research, human resource decision making, and policy formation\\", were consistent with distinction bias.

He also became commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines), Bureau of Customs Commissioner and subsequently secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment. Early life and education Jose Bulaon Lingad was born in Lubao, Pampanga on November 24, 1914. He took up law at the University of the Philippines and the Philippine Law School and passed the bar exam in 1938. At age 24, he was elected Councilor of Lubao, making him one of the youngest elected officials in the country. By the time he was elected Governor of Pampanga, he was still at a young age of 33 years old. Career during World War II After the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in 1941, Lingad joined the armed resistance against the Japanese in Bataan. He survived the Bataan Death March and later joined the guerrilla movement. Political career In the 1947 general elections, Lingad was elected governor of Pampanga as a member of the Liberal Party at the age of 33. He also became vice-president of the League of Governors of the Philippines. Seated as governor in 1948, Lingad served a single term, being defeated for re-election in 1951 due to the fall-out from the Maliwalu massacre. Had Lingad stayed on as governor though, he would have been appointed by President Elpidio Quirino to lead the Department of National Defense due to his stellar accomplishments at the time. After his term as governor, Lingad was still recognized as the political kingpin of Pampanga. And during the elections of 1949, Lingad nominated Diosdado Macapagal, who was then serving as second secretary of the Philippine embassy in Washington, D.C. to run for the 1st Congressional District of Pampanga. With the help and guidance of governor Lingad, Diosdado Macapagal would start his political career that would make him president of the Philippines one day. As they were childhood friends in the town of Lubao, Pampanga. In 1969, Lingad was elected as Congressman of the 1st district of Pampanga. =Cabinet Official= When his Protege Diosdado Macapagal was elected president in 1961, Lingad joined the Macapagal administration, first as Commissioner of Internal Revenue, then Commissioner of Customs and, ultimately Secretary of Labor. =Congressional career= In 1969, Lingad was elected to the House of Representatives under the Liberal Party banner representing the 1st District of Pampanga, the same seat Macapagal had won 20 years earlier. Lingad served in the 7th Congress from 1969 to 1972. Previously perceived as holding right-wing political views, Lingad shifted to the left while in Congress, supporting farmers' rights and dialogue with the leftist insurgency. Lingad's congressional career was abbreviated with the abolition of Congress following the declaration of martial law by Marcos in 1972. Lingad, a member of the political opposition against Marcos, was among the first political figures to be arrested and imprisoned on the day martial law was declared. Lingad was released from prison after three months and he retired to his Pampanga farm. He was called out of retirement by the opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., who urged him to run for Pampanga governor in the January 1980 local elections as a candidate of the anti-Marcos opposition. Lingad was defeated by Estelito Mendoza, but he raised charges of fraud which led to the staging of a new election for governor. Assassination and Legacy On December 16, 1980, Lingad was shot His assassin, who died in a vehicular accident before being prosecuted, was identified as a member of the Philippine Constabulary. National leaders from all sides of the political spectrum attended his wake. \\\\ On November 25, 1989, RA No. 6780 entitled \\"An Act of Changing the Name of the Central Luzon General Hospital located in the municipality of San Fernando, province of Pampanga, to Jose B.

Collins .Den Virtuella Floran: Sorbus intermedia (in Swedish; with maps) Description Inflorescence with honeybee It is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 10‚Äì20 m tall with a stout trunk usually up to 60 cm, but sometimes as much as 2‚Äì3 m diameter, and grey bark; the crown is dome-shaped, with stout horizontal branches. The leaves are green above, and densely hairy with pale grey-white hairs beneath, 7‚Äì12 cm long and 5‚Äì7 cm broad, with four to seven oval lobes on each side of the leaf, broadest near the middle, rounded at the apex, and finely serrated margins. The autumn colour is dull yellowish to grey-brown. The flowers are 15‚Äì20 mm diameter, with five white petals and 20 yellowish-white stamens; they are produced in corymbs 8‚Äì12 cm diameter in late spring. The fruit is an oval pome 15 mm long and 10 mm diameter, orange-red to red, maturing in mid autumn. The fruit is dryish, and eaten by thrushes and waxwings, which disperse the seeds.Mitchell, A. F.

It is closely related to Sorbus hybrida (Finnish whitebeam), another species of hybrid origin, which differs in having the leaves more deeply lobed, with the basal two pairs cut right to the midrib as separate leaflets. Both are tetraploid apomictic species which breed true without pollination. Habitat, cultivation and uses In the Nordic countries, the tree typically grows in forests, pastures or forest edges. It is widely grown as an ornamental tree in northern Europe, valued for its tolerance of urban street conditions; it is very commonly used in avenues and urban parks. It is frequently naturalised in the British Isles.Flora of NW Europe: Sorbus intermedia In recent years, much new planting of \\"Swedish whitebeam\\" has actually been of the related Sorbus mougeotii (Vosges whitebeam), another apomictic species from further south in Europe that has more erect branching, less deeply lobed leaves with whiter undersides to the leaves, and darker red fruit.Hansen, K.

He was a child prodigy skilled with many musical instruments. Bourdon worked much of his life for the Victor Talking Machine Company where he exerted considerable influence.  Childhood  Bourdon was born in Longueuil, Quebec into a family with musical talents. His father was an amateur singer. Louis-Honor√© Bourdon, his half-brother was a renowned impresario. Caroline Derome, his mother, began Bourdon's musical instruction with the cello when he was seven. She would later marry Jean-Baptiste Dubois, a professional cellist who would further instruct Bourdon in the instrument. Around this same time Bourdon learned to play the piano. In 1897, Bourdan was invited to attend the Ghent Conservatory in Belgium. There he continued his training on the cello under Joseph Jacob. He did well, winning a \\"first prize with great distinction\\" in a school competition after spending only eight months there. He was touring Europe shortly thereafter. In 1899 he returned to Canada to tour, and was received well in Montreal and Quebec City.  Career  Bourdon moved to the United States seeking better career opportunities than he could find in Canada. From 1902 until 1904 he played with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. He travelled back to Quebec during the summer of 1903 to perform Le D√©sir with the Quebec Symphony Orchestra on the opening of the Auditorium de Qu√©bec on August 31, 1903. In 1904 he moved to Philadelphia where he played with the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 1905 he made his first recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company. In 1908 he moved, this time to Saint Paul, Minnesota. In 1909, the Victor Company hired Bourdon as the \\"in-house\\" cellist, and he performed number of different tasks during his career with the company. He performed on piano and cello as an accompanist for Victor artists. He served as a conductor for the Victor Concert Orchestra, the Victor Symphony Orchestra, and occasionally the Victor Salon Orchestra and Sousa's Band. Thousands of Victor recordings for which Bourdon was the conductor or an instrumentalist are documented on the EDVR (Encyclopedic Discography of Victor Recordings).Encyclopedic Discography of Victor Recordings In 1920, he was promoted to musical co-director at Victor, a position he shared with Josef Pasternack. In 1922, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Bourdon left RCA Victor in 1931. He worked in a number of jobs in the music industry during his post-Victor career. He directed musical scores for films by Laurel and Hardy and Mickey Mouse cartoons by Walt Disney. From 1927 until 1938 he directed Cities Service Concerts on NBC radio. The program had been on the air for only half a year before Bourdon took over directing; it went on another 11 seasons and was very successful. He worked as a musical director at Muzak, Brunswick Records, and the Thesaurus radio transcription service. Bourdon was hired to conduct the newly formed Orchestre Symphonique de Montr√©al, which gave their first concert on January 14, 1935 at Plateau Hall. He retained that position for many years. In 1944, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in music by the Universit√© de Montr√©al. Bourdon died in New York City on April 24, 1961.

Sutherland was born in Edinburgh, where he completed his high school studies. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1827, and graduated M.D. at the university in 1831. He was married to Sarah Elizabeth Cowie (1808‚Äì95), daughter of a Lancashire merchant. There were no children. Mrs Sutherland became a friend of Florence Nightingale, and assisted her with practical matters,Lynn McDonald, \\"Sarah Elizabeth Sutherland,\\" Women 8:1037‚Äì38; correspondence with her is in 8:601-08 when he became Nightingale's closest collaborator. Mrs Sutherland shared their concerns about public health; she was an active member of the Ladies' Sanitary Association. After spending much time on the continent he practised for a short period in Liverpool, where he edited 'The Liverpool Health of Towns' Advocate' in 1846. In 1848, at the request of the Earl of Carlisle, he entered the public service as an inspector under the first board of health. He conducted several special inquiries, notably one into the cholera epidemic of 1848‚Äì9 (Parl. Papers, 1850 No. 1273, 1852 No. 1523). He was the head of a commission sent to foreign countries to inquire into the law and practice of burial. In 1851, Sutherland was appointed as the British medical delegate to the first International Sanitary Conference (aka Cholera Conference or Quarantine Conference). Louis Napoleon conferred him the Order of the Legion of Honour for services in producing a new International Sanitary Regulation. In 1855 he was engaged at the Home Office in bringing into operation the act for abolishing intramural interments (ib. 1856, No. 146). He was also doing duty in the reorganised general board of health when, at the request of Lord Palmerston and Lord Panmure, he became the head of the Sanitary Commission sent to the Crimean War to deal with the massive sanitary defects of the war hospitals. This commission's mandate was not only to investigate but to implement changes. It started work in March 1855 on the worst Scutari hospitals and succeeded in bringing down the death rates. With Sutherland was a leading civil engineer, Robert Rawlinson, and members of the pioneering Sanitary Department at Liverpool, who did the cleaning out of the sewers and drains. On 25 August 1855 he came to England for consultation, and was summoned to Balmoral to inform the Queen of the steps that had been taken for the benefit of the troops. After the war he and Nightingale, with many others, tried to get the planned Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley cancelled (it was drastically redesigned). He and Nightingale jointly produced a confidential report on it for the war secretary.John Sutherland and Florence Nightingale, Confidential Report on the Plans of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Southampton (Hospital Reform 12:) He took an active part in the preparation of the report of the royal commission on the health of the army dated 1858 (ib. 1857‚Äì58, No. 2318), and also of the report on the state of the army in India, dated 19 May 1863 (ib. 1863, No. 3184). Both reports were of vast importance to the welfare of the soldiers, and most of Sutherland's recommendations were carried out. One of these was the appointment of the barrack and hospital improvement commission, with Sidney Herbert as president and Captain (afterwards Sir) Douglas Galton, Dr. Burrell of the army medical department, and Sutherland as members. This committee visited every barrack and hospital in the United Kingdom, and the sanitary arrangements of each were reported on. Defects were brought to light and remedied, and the health of the troops consequently improved (ib. 1861, No. 2839). Subsequently, Dr. Sutherland and Captain Galton visited and made reports on the Mediterranean stations, including the Ionian Islands (ib. 1863, No. 3207). As a member of the Royal Commission on the Crimean War, Sutherland worked up the considerable amount of evidence for it. He also gave his own evidence to it. He then became the \\"active member\\" of the four sub-commissions set up within the War Office, after the Crimean War, to ensure that the recommendations of the Royal Commission were implemented. Further, again according to Nightingale, not only was he a member of the Royal Commission on India, he \\"wrote nearly the whole\\" of the report on it. That work benefited as well as the British Army, \\"the whole native population‚Äîall that has been done for them sprang from this commission\\". In 1862 the barrack and hospital improvement commission was reconstituted with the quartermaster- general as president and Sutherland as a prominent member. The title was altered to the army sanitary committee in 1865 (ib. 1865, No. 424). Two Indian officers were added, and all sanitary reports were submitted to the committee and suggestions for improving Indian stations prepared. This arrangement remained in force until Sutherland's retirement on 30 June 1888, when he was appointed a medical superintending inspector-general of the board of health and home office. Nightingale considered that Dr Sutherland received so little recognition for his work: no honours from the UK, although the French gave him the Legion of Honour. Nightingale and Sutherland formed an effective public health reform team. They shared a common philosophy, of the application of the best available science, to be applied to the problem at hand, then ongoing monitoring to ensure that the results were beneficial. Sutherland acted sometimes as Nightingale‚Äôs research assistant, finding crucial material for her‚Äîhe was a doctor and well connected internationally with public health and military experts. Sometimes he was her secretary, reading correspondence and drafting replies for her. They shared a Christian faith and ambitious, faith- based, goals for reform. Sutherland drafted some of Nightingale‚Äôs boldest statements about quality hospital care being available to the poorest‚Äîas good as that received by private patients. Sutherland continued his beneficent work to within a few years of his death, which took place at Oakleigh, Alleyne Park, Norwood, Surrey, on 14 July 1891. Sutherland‚Äôs last words to his wife were for Nightingale: ‚ÄúGive her my love and my blessing‚Äù. Nightingale insisted that a full obituary to her friend and collaborator appeared in The Times. Sutherland was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

Fascism From a privileged background, Haighton was born in Rotterdam and was well educated, studying in Los Angeles and producing a thesis on Arthur Schopenhauer, although he was also physically disabled for his entire life.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1990, p. 170 Haighton's father had been a highly successful businessman, making a fortune in particular from his lottery insurance business LOTISICO. He died early and as such Alfred Haighton inherited the highly profitable business, allowing him to devote much of his time to politics. He soon became close to H.A. Sinclair de Rochemont and in 1924 the two set up the Verbond van Actualisten, a group which looked for inspiration to Italian fascism. The group broke down in 1927 and Haighton then put his money into a journal, De Bezem and eventually his own movement, the Fascistische Jongeren Bond. This movement was depleted in 1932 when his close ally Jan Baars broke from him to set up the General Dutch Fascist League (ANFB). Nazism Haighton had become a strong anti-Semite and as such led the followers he had left into the National Socialist Dutch Workers Party (NSNAP), although once again his abrasive personality meant that the relationship was not to last.Rees, p. 171 He dropped out of politics for a spell before joining Arnold Meijer's Zwart Front, although he declined to join the National Front when this group absorbed the Zwart Front in 1940. Officially a member of the NSNAP again he took little role in active politics and instead concentrated on his anti-Semitic writing and literary pursuits. Literature In 1938 Haighton purchased the literary journal De Nieuwe Gids, a work that held a high reputation amongst the Dutch artistic set. Under Haighton however the once respected journal became intensely partisan, presenting a highly pro-Nazi Germany line. Writers such as Jan Eekhout, a staunchly pro-Nazi novelist noted for his use of archaic and dialect Dutch words as part of an attempt to construct rustic literature, were featured and widely praised under Haighton.Egil T√∂rnqvist, Europe, The Nordic Countries, Rodopi, 1998, pp. 193-194 The Dutch literary establishment reacted negatively to Haighton's stewardship of the magazine, to the point that by 1943 De Nieuwe Gids had only 98 registered subscribers.Jeroen Dewulf, Spirit of Resistance: Dutch Clandestine Literature During the Nazi Occupation, Camden House, 2010, p. 50 Haighton died suddenly in Beekbergen that same year.

Life and work He has contributed to virtually all Austrian newspapers and magazines, as well as international papers, such as Die Zeit or The New York Times. Beck was born in 1967, and educated at the University of Vienna, where he read ethnology. His pictures, in a style all of their own, show a keen eye for detail, colour and light. His work has been shown in Vienna's Leopold Museum, the Westlicht Gallery and the Palais Coburg. Beck has published photo books on various subjects, and has created CD covers and posters. His work has had a deep impact on Austrian photography. Beck's main focus is man and human nature. His often stunning colour portraits reveal a deep compassion and fondness for his subjects. He has portrayed, among others, the musicians Willi Resetarits and Hans S√∂llner, actors Dennis Hopper and Christopher Lee, singers Elina Garanca and Edita Gruberova, crime novelist Wolf Haas and a number of Austrian and international high-profile politicians, such as Mohamed ElBaradei.

William Sandys Wright Vaux FRS (28 February 1818 ‚Äì 21 June 1885), was a celebrated English antiquary and numismatist of the 19th century. Biography Vaux was born in 1818 in Oxford. He was the only son of William Vaux (d. 1844), prebendary of Winchester Cathedral and vicar of Wanborough, Wiltshire. He was educated at Westminster School from 1831 to 1836, and matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 18 March 1836, graduating BA 1840 and M.A. 1842. In 1841 he entered the department of antiquities of the British Museum, and in January 1861 became the keeper of the department of coins and medals, a post which, owing to ill-health, he resigned in October 1870. He was connected with the early development of the Oxford Movement in London, and his rooms were a frequent place of meeting for the sub-committees connected with the London Church Union and the foreign chaplaincies. From 1871 to 1876 he was engaged in cataloguing the coins in the Bodleian Library. From 1846 he was a member of the Numismatic Society, and ‚Äî according to the Dictionary of National Biography ‚Äî to his friendly care much of the success of that body is due. In 1852 he became one of the secretaries, and for some time assisted John Yonge Akerman in editing the first series of the Numismatic Chronicle, in which he himself wrote twenty-five papers. In 1855 he was elected president, and remained in office until 1874. For many years the society met in his rooms in Gate Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. On 4 June 1868 he became a fellow of the Royal Society. From November 1875 to his death he was the secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society, and for many years secretary to the Royal Society of Literature. Vaux became a member of the Canterbury Association on 5 April 1850. He died at 102 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London, on 21 June 1885, having married on 11 July 1861 Louisa, eldest daughter of Francis Rivington of Harley Street, London. Works Vaux's knowledge was large and varied, more especially in all that related to oriental antiquities. His Nineveh and Persepolis: an Historical Sketch of Ancient Assyria and Persia, with an Account of the recent Researches in those Countries (1850; 4th ed. 1855), did much to popularise the discoveries of Layard and other travellers. He also wrote: # Handbook to the Antiquities in the British Museum: a Description of the Remains of Greek, Assyrian, Egyptian, and Etruscan Art, 1851. # Ancient History from the Monuments; Persia from the earliest Period to the Arab Conquest, 1875: new edition by Prof. A. H. Sayce, 1893. # Ancient History from the Monuments: Greek Cities and Islands of Asia Minor, 1877. In 1854 he edited The World Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake for the Hakluyt Society.

Early life Nicolaos Matussis was born in the village of Samarina in 1899, into an Aromanian (Vlach) family. After graduating from the Gymnasium in Trikala, he studied law at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He then went on to work as a lawyer in Larissa. He was a devoted Aromanian nationalist and became an early member of the Communist Party of Greece, even becoming a member of its central committee before being expelled from it in 1926. He then returned to Larissa where he was active in Ioannis Sofianopoulos's Agrarian Party. World War II With the beginning of the Axis occupation of Greece, Matussis reestablished his links with Alcibiades Diamandi whom he had first met in 1920. Together they founded the Aromanian separatist state of the Principality of the Pindus, spanning from Thessaly to Epirus and Macedonia, and encompassing all Vlach populated areas within Greece. Matussis, Demosthenes Tsoutras and Konstantinos Tahas confounded the Italian-sponsored Vlach \\"Roman Legion\\" which became the state's official military force. In 1942, after Diamandi suddenly left Greece to go to Romania, Matussi became leader of the so-called Roman Legion.Œ§Œ± œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒπŒ¨ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒªœçŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒΩŒ±œÇ.

Having abandoned his ambitions of a Vlach state, he founded a pro-German collaborationist organization Organization of Pioneers of New Europe (OPNE). In late 1943 or early 1944, he followed Diamandi's footsteps, fleeing to Romania. Following King Michael's Coup, the Romanian Communist Party seized power in the country, sentencing Matussis to 20 years in prison on a Danube island. In 1964, following his requests and also the request of the Greek government, he was released to the hands of Greek authorities, who put him to prison and took him to court, accused of treason (like several members of the \\"Roman Legion\\" in the courts just after the war in 1945‚Äì1947). In this court (which took place in Athens, far from Larissa where he was active) and with the support of defense witnesses he was declared innocent of war crimes.

Bile salt-stimulated lipase (or BSSL) is an equivalent enzyme found within breast milk. BSDL has been found in the pancreatic secretions of all species in which it has been looked for. BSSL, originally discovered in the milk of humans and various other primates, has since been found in the milk of many animals including dogs, cats, rats, and rabbits. Enzymatic activity More than 95% of the fat present in human milk and in infant formulas is in the form of triacylglycerols (TG). In adults, TGs are thought to be broken down or hydrolyzed mainly by the colipase-dependent lipase enzyme. In the newborn, CDL activity in the duodenum is lower than in adults. Both BSDL and BSSL have a broad substrate specificity and, like CDL, are capable of hydrolyzing triacylglycerides (in addition to phospholipids, esters of cholesterol, and lipid-soluble vitamins). In particular, they can hydrolyze esters of the essential fatty acids (n-3 and n-6 PUFAs) and DHA.* BSDL production in the newborn pancreas is quite low when compared with production in the mammary gland or adult pancreas. However, newborn infants absorb lipids relatively well, considering the low level of CDL and BSDL they produce. This observation has led to the suggestion that BSDL produced by lactating mammary gland and present within milk, may compensate for the low levels of other TG- digesting enzymes and aid newborns in lipid absorption. The importance of BSSL in breast milk for the preterm infant nutrition was suggested at 2007. It was also directly shown recently.Maggio L, Bellagamba M. et al.

Vicars was born in Mauritius on 7 December 1826, where his father, Captain Richard John Vicars, (d 1839), a captain in the Royal Engineers, was then stationed. His mother Marianne Williams was a native of Newfoundland. He was the eldest of several siblings. After passing his examinations at Woolwich on 22 December 1843 he received a commission in the 97th Foot, and in the following year proceeded to Corfu. On 6 November 1846 he obtained his lieutenancy. In 1848 his regiment was removed to Jamaica, and in 1851 to Canada. In November of that year his mind took a serious turn, and henceforward his character was changed. He associated with Dr. Twining, the garrison chaplain at Halifax, became a Sunday-school teacher, visited the sick, and took every opportunity of reading the scriptures and praying with the men of his company. In 1852 he became adjutant of his regiment. In May 1853 the regiment returned to England, and in August he resigned the adjutancy. He also became a frequent attendant of meetings held at Exeter Hall and an active member of the Soldiers' Friendly Society, besides holding meetings with railway navvies on many occasions. Before his regiment left England for the Crimea, early in 1854, it was reported that \\"since Mr. Vicars became so good, he has steadied about four hundred men in the regiment.\\" At the Piraeus many men of the 97th died of cholera, and Vicars while conducting the burial parties took every opportunity of addressing the spectators at the graves. On 3 November 1854 he was promoted to the rank of captain. On 20 November 1854 he landed in the Crimea, and, with his regiment, took part in the Siege of Sebastopol. Here he continued his religious work, holding prayer meetings in his tent, visiting the sick in the hospitals, and carefully looking after his men. On the night of 22 March 1855, while he was in the trenches, the Russians made a sortie in force from Sebastopol, and, taking the English by surprise, drove them out of their trenches. Vicars, keeping his men in hand, fired a volley into the enemy at twenty paces, and then ‚Äòcharging‚Äô with the 97th he drove the Russians back and regained possession of the trenches. He was killed in a sortie by the Russians from Sebastopol, 22 March 1855. He cut down two men with his own hand before he fell, bayoneted and shot through the right shoulder. He was buried on the following day on the Woronzoff road, close to the milestone. In his despatch on 6 April, Lord Raglan made special mention of Vicars' gallantry. The Memorials of Captain Hedley Vicars (with a portrait and a view of his grave), by the author of ‚ÄòThe Victory Won,‚Äô i.e. Catherine M. Marsh, was published soon after his death. The memorials are dedicated \\"to her whom God graciously chose to sow in his young heart its first imperishable seed.\\" It had a large circulation, and was translated into French, German, Swedish and Italian.

Rucamanque is located in south-central Chile (38 degrees 39 S, 72 degrees 35 W), at 376 m of altitude, County of Temuco, Cautƒ±n, IX Region, Chile. Rucamanque is a mapuche word that means Casa del Condor [Condor's house]. Rucamanque was long protected by the Chilean government because it has forests that cover a small watershed with water source for Temuco city. Later, Rucamanuqe was bought by the Universidad de La Frontera. Further details on the history of Rucamanque were reported by Salas (2001).  Rucamanque forests  Rucamanque has two main type of forests (according to its structure): old-growth and second-growth stands. The old- growth stands at Rucamanque are late successional stage forests, dominated by shade-tolerant tree species, with scattered 260- to 460-year-old Nothofagus obliqua (Roble) trees (Salas and Garcia, 2006). The old-growth stands at Rucamanque averages 590 trees/ha, 93.7 m2/ha of basal area, and 1096.7 m3/ha total volume, with the most abundant tree species being Aextoxicon punctatum. N. obliqua constitutes about 20% of the volume and basal area, with approximately 30 trees/ha and diameter at breast height (dbh) values over 70 cm. Stands of this type are remnants of the original sub-type of the N. obliqua‚ÄìN.alpina‚ÄìN. dombeyi forest type according to Donoso (1995). Botanically, this type of forest is classified as the Lapagerio‚ÄìAextoxiconetum punctatii association according to Oberdorfer (1960). Further details about ecology of these species can be found in Veblen et al. (1979, 1996), Veblen and Schlegel (1982), and Donoso (1994, 1995). The old-growth forest has had practically no human intervention. It is located at an altitude of between 350 and 450 m, on deep rich soils derived from volcanic ash (trumaos), where productivity is above average (Frank, 1998; Salas, 2001). Further details are given by Salas (2001, 2002). The second-growth forests, are even-aged fire- origin second-growth (renoval) dominated by Roble (67% in number of trees, and 75% in basal area), with averages of 1006 stems/ha and 55 m2/ha of basal area. They belong to the second-growth forests sub-type of the Roble-Rauli-Coigue forest type according to Donoso (1995). Tree ages range from 63 to 109 years (Salas and Garcia 2006).

Early years Born at 26 Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row, in the City of London, EC, J. S. Virtue was the second son of George Virtue, the founder in London of a publishing business, the main feature of which was producing illustrated works. At the age of fourteen, J.S. was apprenticed to his father, and in 1848, when he was 19, he was sent to work in the firm‚Äôs New York publishing branch, to expand the United States and Canadian market for its books and journals. He travelled widely through the United States and Canada on business, returnee to England in 1850, when he was admitted as a liveryman of the Stationers' Company, then went back to the New York City branch and became its head. By 1852, Virtue had expanded the firm‚Äôs North American business to fifteen local branches in the major cities of the eastern United States and Canada. J.S. returned to England in 1855, when his father retired from active business, and succeeded him as head of the Virtue company. Mid career As proprietor of The Art Journal, J.S. embarked upon the illustrations of the great galleries: the Royal, the Sheepshanks, the Vernon, and the Turner, making it famous. Among other works published by the firm were illustrated editions of the Holy Bible, 1861‚Äì5, three volumes, and Tomlinson's Cyclopaedia of Useful Arts, 1854. In 1862, in conjunction with his older brother, George Henry Virtue he organised another business at 1 Amen Corner, under the name of Virtue Brothers & Company. In 1865, his younger brother, William Alexander Virtue, became a partner in the family's City Road and Ivy Lane businesses. The brothers were also proprietors of Arthur Hall, Virtue & Co. which published all four of William H. Bartlett's Guelph collection books. J.S. sold some of the business after George Henry's death on July 21, 1866. William went to the United States and took over leadership of the family's American branch, until his death in 1875. His sister, Frances, was married to the British essayist and historian James Augustus Cotter Morison. J.S. married Miss J. E. Shirreff in 1867. About this time, he began publishing St Paul's Magazine, but sold it around 1869. By 1879 J.S. was living in Oatlands Park and sent for sale the many artworks, mostly paintings, that had been acquired for reproduction in The Art Journal.Christie's, London, 1 March 1879. In 1871, Samuel Spalding was admitted a partner in the business at 26 Ivy Lane, 294 City Road, and 31 Farringdon Street, and in 1874 Frederic Richard Daldy, of the firm of Bell & Daldy, was also taken into the house. The business was conducted much upon the old lines, new and improved editions of illustrated works being issued, including Charles Knight's Shakespeare (1871), and Picturesque Palestine (1880).

Perak at that time was part of the British-administered Federated Malay States. The Sultan's rule was marked by Perak joining the Federated Malay States, a Federation of four protected states in the Malay Peninsula, including Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang, established by the British government in 1895, which lasted until 1946. Early life Raja Idris Shah was born on 19 June 1849 at Kuala Keboi, Kampar, Perak. He was the son of Raja Bendahara Alang Iskandar ibni al-Marhum Raja Kecil Tengah Ahmad. Sultan of Perak Sultan Idris Shah I (right), accompanied by Raja Chulan (left) at the Houses of Parliament, London, 1906. He was the 27th Sultan of Perak. He succeeded his father-in-law, Sultan Yusuf Sharifuddin Muzaffar Shah, who died on 26 July 1887, and ruled until his death on 14 January 1916. In March 1900, he opened the Victoria Bridge, a single track railway bridge located in Karai, Perak. It is one of the oldest railway bridges in Malaysia, having been constructed between December 1897 and March 1900 by the Perak State Railway as a crossing over the Perak River to serve the local tin mining industry. He was appointed an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1892, and received the Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on 27 April 1901, in preparation of the forthcoming royal visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary). In 1902 he visited the United Kingdom to attend the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, arriving at London in early June, and prolonging his stay until the autumn to be present for the re-scheduled ceremony following the illness of the King. Death Upon returning to Perak in 1911, Sultan Idris health was under par and he rested at Port Dickson. Whilst recovering, he made a nazar, should he be restored a good health, he would build a mosque in Bukit Chandan. His vow later materialised with the erection of Ubudiah Mosque but he did not live to see it completed. Sultan Idris death on 14 January 1916 at the age of 66.

Life Waring was born at Lyme Regis, Dorset, on 29 June 1823, and owed his early love for literature to the perusal of the ‚ÄòPenny Magazine.‚Äô From 1836 he was educated at a branch of University College, London, then existing at Bristol, where he was also taught watercolour-drawing by Samuel Jackson. In 1840 he was apprenticed to Henry E. Kendall, architect, London. In 1842, he became a student in the Royal Academy, and in 1843 was awarded a medal at the Society of Arts for designs in architectural adornments. His health being delicate and his income ample, he spent the winter of 1843‚Äì4 in Italy ‚Äòto improve himself in art and to become a painter.‚Äô On returning to England he was a draughtsman successively in the offices of Ambrose Poynter, Laing of Birkenhead, Sir Robert Smirke (1846), and David Alfred Mocatta (1847). With Thomas R. Macquoid he went to Italy and Spain in 1847 and studied architecture, measuring and drawing the public buildings. The result was a work entitled ‚ÄòArchitectural Art in Italy and Spain,‚Äô published in 1850. For this the only remuneration received by the authors was a moderate payment for lithographing the sixty fine folio plates. Singly he produced ‚ÄòDesigns for Civic Architecture,‚Äô formed on a style of his own, possessing merit and a considerable share of beauty. In 1850‚Äì1 and 1851‚Äì2 he studied in the atelier of Thomas Couture in Paris, and drew assiduously from the life. He afterwards resided at Burgos, and studied the Miraflores monuments. In conjunction with Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, he in 1854 wrote four architectural guide-books to the courts of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham. While again in Italy in 1855 he made a further series of drawings, which were purchased for the South Kensington Museum, and published in 1858 as ‚ÄòThe Arts connected with Architecture in Central Italy.‚Äô He was appointed superintendent of the works of ornamental art and sculpture in the Manchester Exhibition in 1857, and edited the ‚ÄòArt Treasures of the United Kingdom,‚Äô 1858. In the International Exhibition at Kensington in 1862 he was the superintendent of the architectural gallery and of the classes for furniture, earthenware, and glass, goldsmiths' work and jewellery, and objects used in architecture. In connection with this exhibition he published in three volumes ‚ÄòMasterpieces of Industrial Art and Sculpture,‚Äô 1862, consisting of three hundred coloured plates, the description of which in English and French he himself wrote. He was chief commissioner of the exhibition of works of art held at Leeds in 1868. During a succeeding tour in Italy he sent a series of notes to the ‚ÄòArchitect.‚Äô In February 1871 the American Institute of Architects elected him an honorary member, but he obtained little practice. At the age of twenty Waring was an enthusiastic admirer of Swedenborg's doctrines; later he somewhat changed his opinions, and in his ‚ÄòRecord of Thoughts on Religious, Political, Social, and Personal Subjects‚Äô (2 vols. 1873), he advanced an eccentric claim to write under ‚Äòspecial divine inspiration‚Äô and the power of making prophecies concerning political events. He died at Hastings on 23 March 1875. Works In addition to the works already mentioned he published: 1. ‚ÄòPoems. By an Architect,‚Äô 1858. 2. ‚ÄòArchitectural, Sculptural, and Picturesque Studies in Burgos,‚Äô 1852. 3. ‚ÄòMasterpieces of Industrial Art and Sculpture at the International Exhibition,‚Äô 1863. 4. ‚ÄòIllustrations of Architecture and Ornament,‚Äô 1865. 5. ‚ÄòThe Universal Church,‚Äô 1866. 6. ‚ÄòBroadcast,‚Äô short essays, 1870. 7. ‚ÄòThe English Alphabet considered Philosophically,‚Äô 1870. 8. ‚ÄòStone Monuments, Tumuli, and Ornaments of Remote Ages, with Remarks on the Early Architecture of Ireland and Scotland,‚Äô 1870. 9. ‚ÄòA Record of my Artistic Life,‚Äô 1873. 10. ‚ÄòThe State,‚Äô a sequel to ‚ÄòThe Universal Church,‚Äô 1874. 11. ‚ÄòCeramic Art in Remote Ages, with Essays on the Symbols of the Circle, the Cross and Circle, showing their Relation to the Primitive Forms of Solar and Nature Worship,‚Äô 1874. 12. ‚ÄòThoughts and Notes for 1874 and 1874‚Äì5,‚Äô two series, 1874‚Äì5.

Ltd., London. Description Leaf; under side (left) and upper side (right) It is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 10‚Äì15 m tall with a stout trunk up to 60 cm in diameter, and grey bark. The crown is columnar or conic in young trees, becoming rounded with age, with branches angled upwards. The leaves are green above, and densely hairy with white hairs beneath. 7‚Äì12 cm long and 5‚Äì8 cm broad, the leaves are lobed, with six to nine oval lobes on each side of the leaf. These lobes are broadest near the base with the two basal pairs of lobes cut right to the midrib as separate leaflets, rounded at the apex, with finely serrated margins. The autumn colour is dull rusty brown. The flowers are 20 mm in diameter, with five white petals and 20 yellowish-white stamens; they are produced in corymbs 6‚Äì11 cm in diameter in late spring. The fruit is a globose pome 12‚Äì15 mm in diameter, bright red, maturing in mid-autumn. The fruit is succulent, and eaten by thrushes and waxwings, which disperse the seeds. Taxonomy It is a tetraploid species of hybrid origin between S. aucuparia (European rowan) and S. intermedia (Swedish whitebeam), the latter being a tetraploid triple hybrid between S. aucuparia, S. torminalis, and either S. aria or one of its close relatives. S. intermedia differs from S. hybrida in having the leaves less deeply lobed with no separate leaflets. Closely related Sorbus meinichii is a triploid or tetraploid species of hybrid origin between S. hybrida and S. aucuparia and differs in having the basal four to six pairs of lobes cut right to the midrib as separate leaflets. All three polyploid species are apomictic species which breed true without pollination. Cultivation Sorbus √ó hybrida is grown as an ornamental tree in northern Europe, and is locally naturalised in the British Isles.

The route runs from Route 20A in Springfield through mill towns, college towns and rural towns, crossing the Connecticut River three times before finally ending at Route 8 in Adams. Route description Route 141 and Route 116 through Chicopee Route 116 begins at Route 20A in Springfield, just before that route ends at its parent route and I-91. The route junctions with the interstate officially at Exit 11, before entering the city of Chicopee. The route crosses I-91 without junction before meeting I-391 twice, on either side of the Chicopee River. It then crosses under the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90) before curling through Chicomansett Village. In the northwest corner of Chicopee Route 141 becomes concurrent with the route, just east of I-391, which it crosses without junction. It then crosses the Willimansett Bridge into Holyoke, passing through the downtown area on two one-way streets, with Route 141 leaving the route during that time. It then becomes one route again, crossing a canal before crossing the Vietnam Memorial Bridge into South Hadley and Hampshire County. In South Hadley, Route 116 meets U.S. Route 202 with a cloverleaf interchange. After meeting the northern end of Route 33 it continues northward, passing Mount Holyoke College, where Route 47 begins. It then turns northeastward, passing through the northwest corner of Granby before clipping South Hadley again on the way into Amherst. The route passes Hampshire College and Amherst College before meeting Route 9 at the center of town. Route 116 then becomes concurrent with Route 9, heading southwestward before entering Hadley. Route 116 leaves the route 9 concurrency and turns northward as a four lane divided freeway. It passes the western edge of UMass Amherst, passing behind Warren McGuirk Alumni Stadium and having an interchange with North Hadley Road, which connects the route directly to the university. The route narrows to a two lane undivided road and meets the southern end of Route 63 before meeting Sunderland Road before passing into Franklin County and the town of Sunderland. Entering Deerfield crossing the Sunderland Bridge westbound with Sugarloaf Mountain in the background Eastbound in Savoy In Sunderland, Route 116 passes west of the Great Swamp and Bull Hill before crossing Route 47 again in the town center before crossing the Connecticut River a third time, over the Sunderland Bridge into Deerfield. The route then meets U.S. Route 5 and Route 10 just over the Whately town line, and just north of I-91 Exit 24. It then follows Routes 5 & 10 for about a mile before leaving the route, heading westward and crossing I-91 at Exit 25. The route heads northwestward, passing through the Mill River area of town and passing into Conway. Once the route enters Conway, it becomes a winding route, passing through that town center before continuing into Ashfield. In Ashfield, the route becomes Main Street, before it has a wrong-way concurrency with Route 112 for nearly a mile and a half. the route then turns westward, passing Spruce Corner on its way back into Hampshire County and the town of Plainfield. The route acts as the main road through the town before meeting Route 8A near the Dubuque Memorial State Forest. The two routes head westward into Berkshire County and the town of Savoy. In Savoy, Route 8A heads south while Route 116 heads westward into the town of Cheshire. Route 116 passes through the northeast corner of town before entering Adams and finally terminating at Route 8 in the southern end of downtown Adams. History Prior to 1955, Route 116 did not have a concurrency with Route 9 or enter Hadley. Rather, it continued along Pleasant Street and North Pleasant Street, passing along the eastern side of UMass before meeting Sunderland Road, where it rejoins the current route. This was done to lessen traffic along the edge of the campus. When the route was moved, Route 63's southern terminus was also moved along Meadow Street to connect it back to Route 116. Before the introduction of Interstate 91, Route 116 extended down to the Memorial Bridge in Springfield where U.S. Route 5 and U.S. Route 20 crossed the river at the time. In 2012, part of the road near Atkins Farm in Amherst was relocated to the east to remove a sharp curve in the road. This was done via the construction of two neighboring roundabouts.https://www.amherstma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/18768/AtkinsCornerDetourNotice?bidId=https://www.amherstma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5256/Atkins- Corner---Actual- presentation-7-26https://www.amherstma.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/4539 Major intersections References External links * Route 116‚ÄîWestern Massachusetts Scenic Byways * Route 116 Scenic Byway Corridor Management Plan, July 2013‚Äîincludes a history of the road and other information (PDF files) 116 ","title":"Massachusetts Route 116"},{"id":"13988099","text":"Greek Argentines (; ) are Argentine citizens of Greek descent or Greek-born people who reside in Argentina. Despite not being as large as other European communities, the Greeks have contributed a lot to their new country. The first immigrants arrived at the end of the 18th century, while the bulk of immigration occurred during the first half of the 20th century. Included are Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, who became adjusted to Argentine society because of the linguistic similarities between Eastern Romance and Spanish, as well as Latin identity of Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians. History Rear Admiral Giorgos \\"Jorge\\" Kolmaniatis, a native from Hydra who arrived in the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata in 1811, strongly contributed in the Argentine War of Independence by leading and training the newly formed fleet. Samuel Spiro, a fellow naval officer, either from Spetses or Mytilene, scuttled his ship in the Uruguay River rather than surrender it to the Spanish Armada. Both men's names were honored with Argentine Navy ships christened after them in 1937.Historical Dictionary of Argentina. Scarecrow Press, 1937. The second wave of Greeks arriving in Argentina came in the 20th century, mainly after the Asia Minor Campaign and the disaster in 1922, with the end of the Megali Idea. Again huge masses of refugees who were sent to Greece by the population exchange agreement between Kemal Atat√ºrk and Eleftherios Venizelos, came towards these latitudes seeking a chance to restart their lives from zero. Most of them were from Smyrna, Ayvalik and other Ionian cities.http://www.calir.org.ar They settled in what is today known as the capital of foreign immigration in Argentina, the city of Berisso, near La Plata.

Etymology The kibbutz is named after the nearby biblical spring of Ein Harod, known in English as the Well of Harod. The kibbutz is close to the site of the crucial battle of Ain Jalut from the year 1260, the first major Mongol defeat in the Middle Ages (Ein Jalut being the Arabic name of the spring). History It was formed in 1952 as a result of an ideological split in kibbutz Ein Harod (founded 1921), with Mapam-supporting members forming Ein Harod (Meuhad) and Mapai-supporting members breaking away to create Ein Harod (Ihud), which joined the Mapai- affiliated Ihud HaKvutzot veHaKibbutzim. Today both kibbutzim belong to the same movement, the United Kibbutz Movement.Ein Harod Meuchad Gems in Israel, February 2004 It is located on the land of the depopulated Palestinian village of Qumya. Environmentalism Ein Harod Ihud was Israel's first \\"green\\" kibbutz. The kibbutz has introduced a whole series of environmental projects. Recycling bins have been installed for sorting waste and an ecological garden is being planted based on a model developed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Technion. The kibbutz is switching to environmentally friendly detergents and has distributed a list of products not tested on animals. An energy survey has been conducted to identify alternative energy sources in the kitchen, laundry and ironing room. Energy consumption is being cut by using energy-saving bulbs and air conditioners, and installing electricity meters in homes and public buildings. The Ministry of Agriculture has approved funding for research on energy efficiency in milk cooling.

He was for some time a shoemaker, then a lawyer's clerk, and afterwards a bookseller's assistant. In 1839, at the age of sixteen, he commenced preaching, and in October 1841 entered the Bristol Baptist College. His first pastorate was at Sparrow Hill, Loughborough, where he stayed from 1845 to Christmas 1846. On 7 March 1847 he became minister of the United Presbyterian and Baptist Church at Devizes, Wiltshire, where his congregation gradually increased, and where he on 9 April 1852 opened a new chapel. In May 1858 he was elected co-pastor with Dr Edward Steane of Denmark Place Chapel, Camberwell, Surrey; and in May 1861, on the retirement of Steane, received the full charge. He remained at Camberwell till his death. In 1860 he visited Taunton, where, and in the neighbourhood, he collected information for his work J. Alleine, his Companions and his Times, published in 1861. In 1878 Stanford received the degree of D.D. from Brown University, Rhode Island, US. He was the president of the London Baptist Association in 1882. From November 1881 he became almost blind from glaucoma, but prepared his work for the press with a typewriter.

The environment present in the human mouth is suited to the growth of characteristic microorganisms found there. It provides a source of water and nutrients, as well as a moderate temperature. Resident microbes of the mouth adhere to the teeth and gums to resist mechanical flushing from the mouth to stomach where acid-sensitive microbes are destroyed by hydrochloric acid. Anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity include: Actinomyces, Arachnia (Propionibacterium propionicus), Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, Leptotrichia, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium, Selenomonas, Treponema, and Veillonella. Genera of fungi that are frequently found in the mouth include Candida, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Glomus, Alternaria, Penicillium, and Cryptococcus, among others. Bacteria accumulate on both the hard and soft oral tissues in biofilms. Bacterial adhesion is particularly important for oral bacteria. Oral bacteria have evolved mechanisms to sense their environment and evade or modify the host. Bacteria occupy the ecological niche provided by both the tooth surface and gingival epithelium. However, a highly efficient innate host defense system constantly monitors the bacterial colonization and prevents bacterial invasion of local tissues. A dynamic equilibrium exists between dental plaque bacteria and the innate host defense system. Of particular interest is the role of oral microorganisms in the two major dental diseases: dental caries and periodontal disease. Additionally, research has correlated poor oral heath and the resulting ability of the oral microbiota to invade the body to affect cardiac health as well as cognitive function. Oral Microflora Oral Microbiology Lab Analysis Report.Dorfman J, The Center for Special Dentistry. The oral microbiome, mainly comprising bacteria which have developed resistance to the human immune system, has been known to impact the host for its own benefit, as seen with dental cavities. The environment present in the human mouth allows the growth of characteristic microorganisms found there. It provides a source of water and nutrients, as well as a moderate temperature. Resident microbes of the mouth adhere to the teeth and gums to resist mechanical flushing from the mouth to stomach where acid-sensitive microbes are destroyed by hydrochloric acid. Anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity include: Actinomyces, Arachnia, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, Leptotrichia, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium, Selenomonas, Treponema, and Veillonella. In addition, there are also a number of fungi found in the oral cavity, including: Candida, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Glomus, Alternaria, Penicillium, and Cryptococcus. The oral cavity of a new-born baby does not contain bacteria but rapidly becomes colonized with bacteria such as Streptococcus salivarius. With the appearance of the teeth during the first year colonization by Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis occurs as these organisms colonise the dental surface and gingiva. Other strains of streptococci adhere strongly to the gums and cheeks but not to the teeth. The gingival crevice area (supporting structures of the teeth) provides a habitat for a variety of anaerobic species. Bacteroides and spirochetes colonize the mouth around puberty. Of particular interest is the role of oral microorganisms in the two major dental diseases: dental caries and periodontal disease.  Niche  The habitat of the oral microbiome is essentially the surfaces of the inside of the mouth. Saliva plays a considerable role in influencing the oral microbiome. More than 800 species of bacteria colonize oral mucous, 1,300 species are found in the gingival crevice, and nearly 1,000 species comprise dental plaque. The mouth is a rich environment for hundreds of species of bacteria since saliva is mostly water and plenty of nutrients pass through the mouth each day. When kissing, it takes only 10 seconds for no less than 80 million bacteria to be exchanged by the passing of saliva. However, the effect is transitory, as each individual quickly returns to their own equilibrium. Thanks to progress in molecular biology techniques, scientific understanding of oral ecology is improving. Oral ecology is being more comprehensively mapped, including the tongue, the teeth, the gums, salivary glands, etc. which are home to these communities of different microorganisms. The host‚Äôs immune system controls the bacterial colonization of the mouth and prevents local infection of tissues. A dynamic equilibrium exists notably between the bacteria of dental plaque and the host‚Äôs immune system, enabling the plaque to stay behind in the mouth when other biofilms are washed away. In equilibrium, the bacterial biofilm produced by the fermentation of sugar in the mouth is quickly swept away by the saliva, except for dental plaque. In cases of imbalance in the equilibrium, oral microorganisms grow out of control and cause oral diseases such as tooth decay and periodontal disease. Several studies have also linked poor oral hygiene to infection by pathogenic bacteria.  Role in Health  There are many factors of oral health which need to be preserved in order to prevent pathogenesis of the oral microbiome or diseases of the mouth. Dental plaque is the material that adheres to the teeth and consists of bacterial cells (mainly S. mutans and S. sanguis), salivary polymers and bacterial extracellular products. Plaque is a biofilm on the surfaces of the teeth. This accumulation of microorganisms subject the teeth and gingival tissues to high concentrations of bacterial metabolites which results in dental disease. If not taken care of, via brushing or flossing, the plaque can turn into tartar (its hardened form) and lead to gingivitis or periodontal disease. In the case of dental cavities, proteins involved in colonization of teeth by Streptococcus mutans can produce antibodies that inhibit the cariogenic process which can be used to create vaccines. Bacteria species typically associated with the oral microbiota have been found to be present in women with bacterial vaginosis. Genera of fungi that are frequently found in the mouth include Candida, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Glomus, Alternaria, Penicillium, and Cryptococcus, among others. Additionally, research has correlated poor oral heath and the resulting ability of the oral microbiota to invade the body to affect cardiac health as well as cognitive function. High levels of circulating antibodies to oral pathogens Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica are associated with hypertension in human. = Importance of Dental Hygiene = Maintaining a balanced oral microflora is important for total wellness. The best way to maintain this environment is with proper oral hygiene. Insufficient brushing and flossing can lead to gum and tooth disease, and eventually tooth loss. In addition, poor dental hygiene has been linked to conditions such as osteoporosis, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Some diseases and medications are known to limit salivary flow, making it easier for bacteria to overgrow in the mouth without being washed away. To prevent any possible side effects from poor oral hygiene, it is important to brush and floss every day, schedule regular cleanings, eat a healthy diet and use a recently-replaced toothbrush.  Issues and Areas of Research  The oral environment (temperature, humidity, pH, nutrients, etc.) impacts the selection of adapted (and sometimes pathogenic) populations of microorganisms.Linda Sherwood, Joanne Willey and Christopher Woolverton, , New York, McGraw Hill, 2013, 9th ed., p. 713‚Äì721 For a young person or an adult in good health and with a healthy diet, the microbes living in the mouth adhere to mucous, teeth and gums to resist removal by saliva. Eventually, they are mostly washed away and destroyed during their trip through the stomach. Salivary flow and oral conditions vary person-to-person, and also relative to the time of day and whether or not an individual sleeps with their mouth open. From youth to old age, the entire mouth interacts with and affects the oral microbiome.Kerr WJ, Kelly J & Geddes DA (1991) The areas of various surfaces in the human mouth from nine years to adulthood. J Dent Res. 1991 Dec; 70(12):1528-30 Via the larynx, numerous bacteria can travel through the respiratory tract to the lungs. There, mucous is charged with their removal. Pathogenic oral microflora have been linked to the production of factors which favor autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and arthritis, as well as cancers of the colon, lungs and breasts.‚Üë Fleming, C. J. (2016). Microbiota activated CD103+ DCS stemming from oral microbiota adaptation specifically drive Œ≥Œ¥T17 proliferation and activation.  Intercellular communication  Most of the bacterial species found in the mouth belong to microbial communities, called biofilms, a feature of which is inter-bacterial communication. Cell‚Äìcell contact is mediated by specific protein adhesins and often, as in the case of inter-species aggregation, by complementary polysaccharide receptors. Another method of communication involves cell‚Äìcell signalling molecules, which are of two classes: those used for intra-species and those used for inter-species signalling. An example of intra-species communication is quorum sensing. Oral bacteria have been shown to produce small peptides, such as competence stimulating peptides, which can help promote single-species biofilm formation. A common form of inter-species signalling is mediated by 4, 5-dihydroxy-2, 3-pentanedione (DPD), also known as autoinducer-2 (Al-2).

Its western terminus is at Route 10 in Easthampton. Its eastern terminus is at US 20 (US 20) in Springfield, a terminus it shares with Route 21\\\\. Route 141 gained notoriety in the local media in July 2005 when signage posted by contractors at the junction with Route 10 in Easthampton was posted incorrectly in the form of signage seen in Alabama.  Route description  Route 141 begins at an intersection with Route 10 (Main Street) just north of Park Street in Eashampton. Route 141 proceeds south along Union Street through downtown Easthampton, passing multiple blocks of buildings and crossing a rail trail near Railroad Street. The route passes a strip mall at the southern end of Easthampton's downtown, reaching a junction with Payson Avenue. At this junction, Route 141 takes over Payson's right-of-way as Cottage Street, passing an old factory in Easthampton along with nearby Nashawannuck Pond. Route 141 continues east along Cottage Street, passing local businesses. At Chapel Street, the route turns south along the right-of-way and becomes Holyoke Street, running southeast past residences in Easthampton, keeping a long distance parallel with Nashawannuck Pond. Route 141 continues southeast along Holyoke, with the residences becoming less dense as it approaches East Street. At the junction with Hendrick Street, Route 141 turns south and becomes Mountain Road as it runs along the side of Mount Tom. Making a bend to the southeast, the highway crosses the Hampshire County line and crosses into Hampden County. Now in Holyoke, Route 141 continues southeast as Easthampton Road, crossing roads south of Mount Tom. Crossing through the Rock Valley section of Holyoke, the highway passes south of the Whiting Reservoir and Wyckoff Country Club, entering the Smiths Valley section. Through Smiths Valley, Route 141 runs southeast through a residential neighborhood, reaching a ramp to Interstate 91 southbound (I-91 exit 17). After another turn, the route crosses into a trumpet interchange with I-91 northbound, becoming a one- way couplet through downtown Holyoke. Route 141 eastbound runs along Dwight Street while Route 141 westbound runs along Hampden Street after the junctions both directions have with US 5 and US 202 (Northampton Street). Route 141 eastbound is a main commercial street while the westbound one is a residential and commercial mix. Crossing through the Oakdale neighborhood in Holyoke, Route 141 eastbound and westbound merged at the junction with Pleasant Street. The route runs southeast along Appleton Street, crossing Beech Street, also a section of US 202. A main street through southeastern Holyoke, Route 141 is a two-lane road through the center of Oakdale. Passing a large factory, the route crosses over the First Level Canal, passes another factory and over the Second Level Canal. After crossing the canal, Route 141 immediately turns southwest off Appleton Street and turns onto Race Street. Two blocks south of Appleton, Route 141 reaches Cabot Street, where it turns east, meeting with Route 116 at Main Street. Route 141 and Route 116 become concurrent through Holyoke along Cabot Street. The routes cross the Third Level Canal and cross some railroad tracks. An unusually large Route 141 west shield in Chicopee Falls Route 141 and Route 116 cross an extra pair of railroad tracks before crossing the Connecticut River on what becomes Chicopee Street as it enters Chicopee. After the routes turn south off the bridge, they junction with Prospect Street before turning southwest along Chicopee. After crossing under I-391, the routes continue southwest for a while, until Grattan Street where Route 141 turns east. Running along Grattan Street, crossing over railroad tracks into an interchange with I-391's exit 4. Route 141 continues southeast along Grattan Street into the Aldenville neighborhood of Chicopee as a residential and commercial street. After McKinstry Avenue, the route becomes commercial, bending further southeast while passing Aldenville Public Library and crossing under the Mass Pike (I-90). Now in the Sandy Hill neighborhood, Route 141 along Grattan Street as a commercial street, turning east along the Chicopee River. The route reached a junction with Route 33 (Memorial Drive). Route 141 through Indian Orchard The route turns south along Bridge Street, crossing over the river, and turning east along East Main Street. Route 141 parallels the southern shore of the river, passing numerous residences in the Chicopee Falls neighborhood. After an intersection with Carew Street, the highway comes in striking distance of the river, entering an interchange with I-291's exit 6 via a ramp from Fuller Road. After I-291, Route 141 turns southeast along the river and changes names to Worcester Street as it crosses into Springfield. Entering the Indian Orchard neighborhood, the route stays straight as the Chicopee River turns north. Now paralleling US 20, passing a large industrial plant near some railroad tracks. Route 141 then bends northeast and begins paralleling the railroad tracks along with the Chicopee River. A short distance after, Route 141 turns along Front Street before turning off onto Main Street, two blocks south of the Chicopee River. Route 141, paralleling the river and reaching Route 21 (Parker Street). Route 141 and Route 21 become concurrent, running southeast along Parker Street, running west along Hubbard Park. Route 21 and Route 141 run south as a four-lane road, reaching a junction with US 20 (Boston Road). This junction marks the eastern terminus of Route 141.  History  Erroneous signage in July 2005 denoting Route 141 and Route 10 in Easthampton as Alabama routes. Route 141, along with Route 10 gained notoriety in July 2005 when it was discovered that signs had been put up at their junction in Easthampton. The road signs placed on Route 10 southbound were not done as a normal Massachusetts-style sign, but in the form of the Alabama-style sign. Unusually, these Alabama style shields were also squeezed to fit a normal Massachusetts shield design by a contractor. The signs had been posted about a week before the error had been forwarded to the Easthampton Department of Public Works by someone from the Massachusetts State Highway Department. They believed the contractor had taken out the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and chosen the Alabama shield. The signs would soon be replaced with correct Massachusetts shield.

History The first units of Italian parachutists were trained and formed shortly before the Second World War in Castel Benito, near Tripoli, where the first Military Parachute School was located. The first troops trained were two Libyan battalions, the Libyan Parachute Battalion and the 1st National Libyan Parachute Battalion, of the Royal Corps of Colonial Troops. To these were added the first battalions of Italian army troops and the 1st Carabinieri Parachute Battalion (there were three Carabinieri Parachute Battalions). 1 Battalion Royal Carabinieri paratroopers, formed on July 1, 1940, used in Second World War on the North African front (1941). The Italian Air Force also had parachute units. Later in Italy, the staff at Castel Benito was expanded into the School at Tarquinia and became the first elements of the future Divisione Folgore. The divisions Original military uniform of a paratrooper of the division Folgore in 1942 A second School was established in Viterbo and a new division, the Nembo (Nimbus or Rain Cloud) was being organized. A third division, the 183 Parachute Division Ciclone (Cyclone), was planned but the 1943 Armistice of Cassibile interrupted its organization. = Division Folgore= In 1941 a 5,000-man Parachute division was raised and was designated the 185th Parachute Division Folgore, it was trained for the assault on Malta in the planned Operation Hercules. When the Malta invasion never took place, the parachutists were deployed instead as infantry in the North African theater, despite being poorly equipped for this role. It was engaged in ground combat operations in North Africa from July 1942 until its destruction at El Alamein. Following this, a 185th Parachute battalion was raised from survivors. At El Alamein, as part of the German-Italian Panzer Army the Folgore was to the south. It was attacked by the British 44th and 50th Infantry, 7th Armoured, and Greek and Free French brigades making a feint to draw attention from the objective of operation Lightfoot and to pin down the 21st Panzer and Ariete armoured divisions. The heroic behavior of the Folgore Division during the Second battle of El Alamein in resisting the attacks of six British divisions (two armored and four infantry) inspired the respect and admiration of its enemy. Lacking effective anti-tank weapons, the Italian paratroopers managed to stop British tanks only with a few obsolete 47/32 guns and petrol bombs. On 11 November 1942, when the battle was over, the BBC transmitted the famous official bulletin: ‚ÄúThe remnants of the Folgore division put up resistance beyond every limit of human possibility.‚Äù¬´ I resti della divisione Folgore hanno resistito oltre ogni limite delle possibilit√† umane. ¬ª (Radio Londra) The Folgore, having run out of water, withdrew from the El Alamein front at 2:00 a.m. on 3 November 1942, carrying their anti-tank weapons. At 2:35 p.m. on 6 November what was left of the division was captured by the British. They had exhausted their ammunition and destroyed their weapons, but refused to raise their hands in surrender or show the white flag. =Nembo= 183¬∞ Parachute Regiment parading 2 June 2006 in Rome 184th Division Parachutists Nembo was constituted in 1943 as a second division of parachutists, based on entirely new units as well as the 185¬∞ Regiment of the Folgore Division. Nembo was sent shortly before the armistice between Italy and the Allies of 8 September 1943 to Sardinia where it was decimated by malaria. A unit of the same name was raised by the Co-Belligerent Army now fighting against the Germans, alongside the allies, as 12/183rd in the War of Italian liberation it fought in the battles of Filottrano, Grizzano Houses and in Operation Herring (the latter two as part of the Folgore Combat Group that was raised from surviving elements of original Division). After the end of the Second World War the Nembo unit title was given to a mechanized infantry units that was stationed, in turn, at Belluno, Villa Vicentina, Cervignano del Friuli and Gradisca d' Isonzo. The latter was its base of operations until 1991, at which time it was reconstituted as the 183rd Parachutist Battalion Nembo , within the Folgore Parachute Brigade. The Folgore (Parachute) brigade had been reconstituted in 1960. The Nembo battalion in 1993 was expanded to a Regiment, and from 1991 it has participated in many international missions that Italy has joined. =Ciclone= The 183rd Ciclone Parachute Division was planned and the training center was established in early 1943 with four battalions forming, however, it was overcome by events and was disbanded in accordance with the 1943 Armistice. =La Spezia= 1944 paracadutisti motorcycle 80 Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding) - trained and equipped similarly to the German Airlanding divisions, again for the Malta Invasion. RSI Paracadutisti A number of parachute units were raised by the RSI and were considered to be elite troops and fought well. The RSI Army (ENR), RSI Air Force, GNR, X Mas. * RSI Army - raised the 350 man 'Nembo' Autonomous Parachute battalion which suffered 70 percent casualties at the Battle of Anzio. * RSI Air Force - raised a three battalion 'Folgore' Parachute Regiment which became part of the 'Arditi' Group. * GNR - 'Mazzarini' GNR Parachute battalion of 300 men. It mainly operated against partisans in the Padovana Plains from August 1944 until 1945. * RSI Navy - Xa MAS - 'Nuotatori Paracadutisti' Parachute Battalion (Parachute Swimmers), which was formed by volunteers of the former Italian Navy's San Marco Regiment's Parachute battalion.

Common heraldic elements to both units: the gladio winged of mostrine/fregi (integrated from a parachute for the Brigade Parachutists) and the yellow lightning bolt in the symbol of the unit (in red field for the Division of Infantry, in blue field for the Brigade Parachutists). The military school of parachuting (CAPAR) is located at Pisa. Currently the Italian Army fields the Paratroopers Brigade Folgore with eight battalions, based in Livorno and stationed mostly in Tuscany. The Brigade is constituted around three paratrooper regiments (183¬∞, 186¬∞ and 187¬∞). There is also a training establishment known as CAPAR in Pisa (Parachuting Training Center, former SMIPAR - Military school of Parachuting, in its turn former CAP). Missions In 1982 the Italian Brigade Folgore landed in Beirut with the Multinational Force in Lebanon. In 1991, a Parachutist Tactical group was deployed to Kurdistan. Its mission was to provide humanitarian aid. From July 1992, the Brigade supplied personnel to Operation Vespri Siciliani i.e. Operation Sicilian Vespers. The Folgore participated in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia from 3 December 1992 to September 1993. Parts of the Brigade have been employed many times in the Balkans (IFOR/SFOR in Bosnia and KFOR in Kosovo), with MNF in Albania and INTERFET in East Timor. The Folgore participated from August 2005 to September 2005 in Operation Babylon in Iraq and to December 2014 in Afghanistan. In August 2007, the Folgore took part in United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, under aegis of the United Nations (Resolution 1701), as a result of the war between Israel and Hezbollah of summer 2006. =Other parachute units= * The 4th Alpini Parachutist Regiment is a light Infantry regiment of the Italian Army, specializing in mountain combat (Ranger). The Alpini are the mountain infantry corps of the Italian Army, that distinguished itself in combat during World War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII). Today the 4th Alpini Parachutist Regiment is a Special Forces unit of elite mountain infantry specialized in the airborne assault role. * Carabinieri - 1st Carabinieri Regiment \\"Tuscania\\"( Livorno) (or more properly the 1st Regiment Carabinieri \\"Tuscania\\") is a Special operation forces unit of the Italian Carabinieri. It is formed from paratroopers and is part of the 2nd Carabinieri Mobile Brigade along with the 7th Carabinieri Regiment based on Laives ( BZ), the 13th Carabinieri Regiment based in Gorizia, and the Special Intervention Group, which is also a parachute trained unit. The Tuscania is currently based in Livorno, and has approximately 550 personnel. =Italian Air Force Paratroopers= The Paratroopers of the 17¬∫ Stormo Incursori of the Italian Air Force are italian special forces.

Retrieved on 2008-05-05. =Hello: 2006‚Äì2008= In November 2006, the band signed onto Slanted Records and began recording for their first main studio album until February 2007. It was originally prepared for release in mid-2007, but the date was pushed forward to February of the following year. The album is reportedly the same version as the original demo releases in 2007, but instead \\"gave Slanted Records more time to market After Edmund just right.\\" The album was finally released under the title Hello on February 26, 2008, nearly a year after the band finished recording it. The album was produced by Scotty Wilbanks. In July 2008 they even did a string of concerts throughout Sweden in support of the album. Following the international dates the After Edmund fans cast enough votes to garner the attention of Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution Tour. On the Atlanta date of that tour After Edmund had the privilege of opening for such acts as Linkin Park, Chris Cornell and The Bravery. The performance earned them exposure on the nationally syndicated network MTV2. In the fall of that year the band opened for their friends in Building 429 on their US tour. According to the winter 2008 edition of the LaGrange College Columns, drummer Adam Stanley recently left the group. Matt McFadden took over at drums, and Mitch Parks switched to bass. After Edmund was nominated for Best New Artist in CCM Magazine's Readers Choice Awards. As a result of their positive reception they were asked back for another stint throughout February and March on Building 429's Truth, Hope & Love Tour, this time playing alongside Above the Golden State, among others. February saw the band being nominated for a Grammy Award at its 51st ceremony. =Spaceships & Submarines: The Lively Sessions: 2009‚Äì2010= For the Dove Awards of 2009, After Edmund's debut release Hello was nominated in the Best Rock/Contemporary Album category. At the award ceremony in April 2009, the band presented 3 awards, including two awards to The Blind Boys of Alabama, and Reuben Morgan's award for his song \\"Mighty to Save\\". The band performed at multiple music festivals during the summer of 2009. On October 6, After Edmund released a combination live DVD and EP entitled Spaceships and Submarines: The Lively Sessions. The video portion features a live, in-studio performance of four previously unreleased songs, three from their first record Hello, and two instrumental tracks. The audio of the songs was made available through a downloadable version that comes with the DVD. In addition to these two, a limited edition sticker and mini-poster was made available. During the rest of October, the band joined Lecrae, Mikeschair, Sho Baraka and Tedashii on the Altered Minds Tour. Together they played concerts throughout the east coast, mid-west and southern United States. After Edmund member, Matt Yates (keyboard, vocals), decided to leave the band, as of May 1, 2010, to spend more time with his family. =Times Have Changed EP: 2010‚Äì2015= On July 1, 2010, After Edmund released the new single \\"Dance Like You're From the Future\\" on their website for a free download. It was the first released track from their forthcoming, unannounced release. On August 1 they released to YouTube a viral video for the single. The single garnered favorable reviews from fans and critics alike. Quickly following the release of the single the band went on a short mini-tour through Texas and the south-east. Immediately proceeding this they went back into the studio to dive head first into their next release. They spent numerous months writing and recording at their studio in LaGrange, GA. They release a series of video blogs on the band's YouTube channel entitled \\"After Edmund: In The Studio.\\" On Dec. 1 the official announcement was made that their latest creation would be a double EP set entitled \\"Times Have Changed.\\" The EPs would be released separately, the first of which (Times Have Changed EP No. 1) becoming available on Feb.1 through digital distribution as well as at the band's concerts. It had been written, recorded and produced by the band entirely independent and for free. Combined with the announcement, the band also started their annual Christmas card giveaway in which any fan who wants one may receive in the mail an After Edmund/Christmas themed postcard signed by the band. The second song released from \\"Times Have Changed EP No. 1,\\" Monster, was made available for streaming on January 1 via the band's Myspace and Facebook Fanpage. This was the first of a 30-day series of planned content releases to give back to their fans. Over the next month the band would go on to give away numerous different things ranging from After Edmund desktops wallpapers to video blogs and guitar tabs. Throughout January several other announcements had been made regarding unanswered questions about the future. One was a confirm of mounting suspicions that newly found touring keyboardist, Austin Abbott, had been made an official member of the band. The band released an album titled \\"Art and Commerce\\" in April 2013. After Edmund also announced their upcoming plans to tour throughout March and April with Fireflight, on their Overcome Tour.

His brother was Samuel Seaward, FRS (see below). Early life Seaward was born the son of a builder in Lambeth, London, in January 1786, and initially worked with his father as a surveyor and architect. Career He was later employed by Grillier & Company, the contractors for the erection of Regent's Bridge across the River Thames, to supervise the work. During this period he became acquainted with Jeremy Bentham and James Walker and his uncle, Ralph Walker. Following this he managed some lead mines in Wales, acquired a knowledge of chemistry, and became friendly with Arthur Woolf, Richard Trevithick, and other mechanical engineers of the period. Upon his return to London he oversaw the construction of Gordon's, Dowson's, and other docks on the River Thames, and became an agent for the Gospel Oak Ironworks in Staffordshire. Seaward was at the same time connected with the Imperial Continental Gas Association and introduced gas lighting to several towns in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In 1823 Seaward drew plans for a new London Bridge of three arches, each of span. In 1824 he established the Canal Ironworks at Millwall, London, for the construction of machinery, especially marine engines; in 1825 they constructed the engine for the vessel the Royal George, which was intended for the Dover - Calais service. He joined the Institution of Civil Engineers as a member in 1826, and was a frequent attendant at the meetings. His younger brother, Samuel Seaward (1800‚Äì1842), joined him in about 1826; the brothers produced machinery for every part of the world, and made the name of Seaward widely known. In 1829 they assisted in the formation of the Diamond Steam Packet Company, and built the engines for the boats which ran between Gravesend and London. Of these, the Ruby and the Sapphire were types for speed and for accommodation. In 1836 the brothers brought out the direct-acting steam engines for HMS Gorgon and HMS Cyclops, which were known as Seaward's engines. They superseded the heavy side-beam engines of the period which had been in general use. The saving obtained in the consumption of fuel by the double-slide valve, both for the steam and exhaust, plus other improvements, caused the government to entrust the Seawards with the building of twenty-four steamboats and some smaller vessels. At the same time they adapted their engines to the vessels of the East India Company, the Steam Navigation Companies, and the ships of foreign governments. They were also early advocates of the use of auxiliary steam power for the voyage to India, and experimented with it on the East Indiaman Vernon in 1839 and 1840 with great successTransactions of the Institute of Civil Engineers, 1842, iii. 385‚Äì401 They also designed large swing bridges, dredging machines, cranes, and other dock apparatus, plus machinery for lead, saw, and sugar mills. Among the improvements and inventions for which John Seaward was personally responsible were tubular boilers, which were used by the Royal Navy, disconnecting cranks for paddle-wheel engines, the telescopic funnel, self-acting nozzles for feed and for regulating the saturation of the water in marine boilers, double passages in cylinders both for steam and education, cheese-couplings used to connect and disconnect screw propellerss to and from engines, and other minor improvements. The death of Samuel Seaward, on 11 May 1842 threw upon John Seaward the entire management of the Canal Ironworks. In the construction of the engines of the RMS Amazon, he is considered to have produced one of his most perfect works. The vessel unfortunately was destroyed by fire on her first passage to the West Indies on 4 January 1852. John Seaward died at 20 Brecknock Crescent, London, on 26 March 1858.

Biography Sedding, son of Richard and Peninnah Sedding of Summerstown, near Okehampton, Devon, was born on 20 June 1836: John Dando Sedding was his younger brother. He early displayed antiquarian tastes, which led to his visiting cathedrals, abbeys, and churches in England and France. In 1853 he entered the office of George Edmund Street, where he devoted himself to the study of Gothic architecture. For some time he resided as an architect in Bristol, and, after again spending a period in London, removed about 1862 to Penzance, where he obtained a large practice. In Cornwall he built or restored the churches of Gwithian, Wendron, Altarnun, North Hill, Ruan Major (modified during restoration), St. Peter's, Newlyn, and St Stephens by Launceston, while he had in progress at the time of his death a new church, St Martin's at Marple in Cheshire, together with its rectory History of St Martin's Church - Anthony Burton and two churches in Wales, the restoration of Bigbury church, and a mansion at Hayle for Mr. W. J. Rawlings. Sedding was a performer on the harmonium and organ, and an admirer of ancient church music. He was for a time precentor of the church of St. Raphael the Archangel, Bristol, and organist of St. Mary the Virgin, Soho. He greatly exerted himself in the revival of carol singing, and his books of Christmas carols were very popular. In 1865 his health failed, and he died at Penzance on 11 June 1868, being buried at Madron on 16 June. He married, on 18 August 1862, Jessie, daughter of John Proctor, chemist of Penzance, by whom he left four children, including the architect E. H. Sedding.

The face of the medal displayed the profile of the king, and on its reverse was a flag decoration and the words \\"for valour\\" On 14 August 1815, Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia replaced it with the Military Order of Savoy, now known as the Military Order of Italy. Charles Albert of Sardinia revived it on 26 March 1833, and added to it the Silver and Bronze medals. These had, on their faces, the coat of arms of Savoy with laurel branches, the royal crown, and the words \\"for military valor\\". On the reverse were two laurel branches enclosing the name of the decorated soldier, and the place and date of the action. With the proclamation of the Republic on 2 June 1946, the coat of arms of the House of Savoy was replaced with the emblem of the Italian Republic.Preceding paragraphs translated and adapted from which describes the book \\"Le medaglie d'oro al valor militare: volume primo, Roma, [Gruppo Medaglie d'Oro al Valor Militare d'Italia], 1965, 804 p.; 22 cm\\" For actions performed by individuals during World War I, the Gold Medal was awarded some 368 times, as well as 37 times to military units, and once to the Unknown Soldier. Only four of the individual awards went to foreigners, one of these being Czar Nicholas II of Russia. The other three were for acts of gallantry in which the recipient was killed in action or died from his injuries (the Frenchmen John O'Byrne and Roland Morillot, and the American Coleman deWitt).The website of the Italian Presidency: List of all recipients can be obtained by going to http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/onorificenze.aspx, going to \\"onorificenza\\" (under \\"Maschera di recerca\\"), selecting \\"Medaglia d'oro al valor militare\\" and pressing \\"avvia\\".

During World War II the medal was awarded to soldiers of the Royal Italian Army; after these forces were reorganized following the Armistice with Italy in 1943, it was awarded to members of the Allies-supporting Italian Co-Belligerent forces. The Axis-affiliated Italian Social Republic created another design of the medal, with a Gladius replacing the arms of Savoy, for members of the Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano from 1943 to 1945. This version of the award was not given recognition by the postwar Italian government. The Gold Medal for Military Valor is still awarded by the Italian state, and it, along with Silver and Bronze medals for Military Valor as well as the War Cross of Military Valour( which can only be awarded in time of war) was established by the Royal Decree of 4 November 1932, in which the purpose of these medals is defined as, \\"to distinguish and publicly honor the authors of heroic military acts, even ones performed in time of peace, provided that the exploit is closely connected with the purposes for which the Armed Forces are constituted, whatever may be the condition or quality of the author.\\" Notable recipients The first recipient was Domenico Millelire of the Royal Sardinian Navy on 6 April 1793 and the latest recipient was in 2014 Chief Corporal-Major Andrea Adorno of the 4th Alpini Paratroopers Regiment for combat operations in Bala Murghab, Afghanistan in 2010. = Individuals = * Abele Ambrosini * Amedeo Guillet * Annibale Bergonzoli * Antonio Locatelli (thrice awarded) * Carla Capponi * Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia * Carlo Fecia di Cossato * Carmelo Borg Pisani * Cesare Battisti * Charles Yorke, 4th Earl of Hardwicke * Domenico Millelire * Emanuele Beraudo di Pralormo * Emilio Fa√† di Bruno * Enrico Toti * Filippo Illuminato * Francesco Baracca * Fulco Ruffo di Calabria * Furio Niclot Doglio * Giovanni Fornasini * Giuliano Gozi * Giulio Martinat * Giuseppe Caimi * Giuseppe Galliano (twice awarded) * Hans-Joachim Marseille * Inigo Campioni * Irma Bandiera * Joachim M√ºncheberg * Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a Morato * Junio Valerio Borghese * Luigi Arbib Pascucci * Luigi Giorgi (twice awarded) * Luigi Gorrini * Luigi Reverberi * Luigi Rizzo (twice awarded) * Maurizio Giglio * Nicola Calipari * Orlando Lorenzini * Paolino Mattina * Pore Mosulishvili * Roland Morillot * Salvo D'Acquisto * Sandro Pertini * Teseo Tesei * Tito Minniti * Unat√π Endisciau, the only native soldier awarded the Gold Medal = Military units = The first military unit awarded a Gold Medal was His Majesty's Dragoons Regiment (Reggimento Dragoni di Sua Maest√†) on 21 April 1796 for unit's conduct during the Battle of Mondov√¨.

Biography Sadleir was the youngest son of Thomas Sadleir, barrister, by his first wife, Rebecca, eldest daughter of William Woodward of Clough Prior, co. Tipperary. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin, where he was elected a Scholar in 1794, and a fellow in 1805.Alumni Dublinenses : a register of the students, graduates, professors and provosts of Trinity College in the University of Dublin (1593-1860) George Dames Burtchaell/Thomas Ulick Sadleir p727: Dublin, Alex Thom and Co, 1935 He graduated B.A. 1795, M.A. 1805, B.D. and D.D. 1813. In 1816, 1817, and 1823 he was Donnellan lecturer at his college; from 1825 to 1835 Erasmus Smith's Professor of Mathematics, and from 1833 to 1838 Regius Professor of Greek. In politics he was a Whig, and an advocate of Catholic emancipation. With the Duke of Leinster, the archbishop of Dublin, and others, he was one of the first commissioners for administering the funds for the education of the poor in Ireland, 1831. In 1833 he was appointed, with the Primate, the Lord Chancellor, and other dignitaries, a commissioner to alter and amend the laws relating to the temporalities of the church of Ireland, but resigned the trust in 1837. On 22 Dec. of that year, during the viceroyalty of the Marquis of Normanby, he was made Provost of Trinity College, a post which he held for fourteen years. On more than one occasion he is said to have declined a bishopric. He upheld the principle of the Queen's colleges in Ireland. One of the treasures of the Library at Trinity College was given to it by Sadleir in 1837. This is the 14th century manuscript known as the \\"Dublin Apocalypse\\".Fox, Peter, Treasures of the Library: Trinity College Dublin, RIA, 1986. Sadleir died at Castle Knock Glebe, County Dublin, on 14 December 1851, and was buried in the vaults of Trinity College on 18 December. He married Letitia, daughter of Joseph Grave of Ballycommon, King's County, by whom he left five children. There is a portrait of Sadleir in the Provost's House, Trinity College Dublin.

It transfers knowledge of innovative transportation technology to both urban and rural local communities in the United States and to American Indian tribal governments. The program is a partnership effort with funding provided from Federal, State, and local agency resources as well as universities and the private sector. Each center is funded by a 50:50 match of state and federal funds, although some states choose to provide more than the minimum required amount. There are 58 Technology Transfer (T2) Centers established‚Äîone in each State, one serving Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and seven serving American Indian tribal governments‚Äîto provide training and technical assistance to local governments. Most centers are run by universities, and a few are hosted by their state's department of transportation. Several, like the Cornell Local Roads Program and Texas LTAP, are part of university-based cooperative extension services. It was founded in 1982, although several centers predate the national program. LTAP Centers assist nearly 38,000 local government agencies and over 540 federally recognized tribes in maintaining and improving transportation infrastructure and services with the latest technology and information available. Local transportation agencies expend over $30 billion annually to maintain 2.9 million miles of roads [1.3 paved/1.6 unpaved] with over 290,000 bridges. Many local road departments are managed by individuals who generally have practical experience but little formal technical education or training. LTAP has a variety of tools - training events, technology transfer resources, and personalized assistance - to assist local agencies in improving their transportation operations. Many state transportation departments also benefit from LTAP services. In 2011, LTAP centers trained over 151,000 people in over 5300 sessions. Common topics for training and assistance include pavement management and maintenance, road works safety, traffic signs and pavement markings, public works department management, snow and ice control, and drainage. Two important factors in LTAP's success are flexibility and networking. Although certain tasks are mandated, like providing a newsletter and a lending library for local highway officials, each LTAP center has considerable leeway in adapting its programs to address the unique challenges faced by the customers it serves. Centers also work together on many projects. If one center has a pavement specialist on their staff, they may provide training for another state's center, in exchange for work zone training. Also, should a local highway official ask a question that their center can't answer, it can be forwarded to the 57 other centers, as well as related FHWA and State DOT offices. Usually, an answer is supplied within short order.

Population The original inhabitants of Negur were from the Baluchi tribe of Shaikhzadah, who according to inscriptions on gravestones lived there before the invasion of the Mongolians. The existence of considerable underground water resources seems to have been the main reason for settling in Negur. In 1969, after Negur became an independent municipality, many people including government staff migrated to the town from other parts of the country. In recent years severe drought accelerated the immigration of people from other parts of Dashtyari district, posing a serious threat to water resources.

The lyrics use each letter of the alphabet to make a nonsense verse of the song: The song \\"Mairzy Doats\\" (1943) used blurred lyrics that sound non-lexical: However, the lyrics of the bridge provide a clue: Popular music Styles of popular music that frequently employ non-lexical vocables include: * A cappella (singing without instrumental accompaniment, sometimes accompanied by a chorus of nonsense syllables) * Doo-wop (style of rhythm and blues music that often employs nonsense syllables) Scat singing influenced the development of doo-wop and hip hop. It was popular enough in doo-wop that Barry Mann and Gerry Goffin made it the subject of a 1961 song, Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)\\". Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield, who worked with Mann and Goffin at the Brill Building at the same time, added non-lexical vocables at the start of their song \\"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do\\" when they could not come up with a good lyric for the opening line; Sedaka's first recording of the song was such a success that they made it a trademark for their next several songs, including \\"Next Door to an Angel\\" and \\"Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen.\\" (Sedaka and Greenfield had become so attached to the idea that when Sedaka dissolved his partnership with Greenfield in the early 1970s, he labeled his final album with him The Tra-La Days Are Over.) It has also appeared in various genres of rock music. Jim Morrison of The Doors sings a chorus of slow scat on the song \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\", trying to replicate a harmonica solo he had heard, as well as on the song \\"Roadhouse Blues\\"; scat singing also notably opens the B-side of Joe Walsh's 1973 album The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get with the song \\"Meadow\\". The technique was employed in the song \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" by Pink Floyd, as well as the R&B; song \\"Rubber Biscuit\\" by The Chips (also as by The Blues Brothers). The list of scat singers includes such greats as Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, Cab Calloway, Scatman Crothers, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Sammy Davis Jr., Mel Torm√©, Tony Bennett, Cleo Laine, Roger Miller, Aretha Franklin, Van Morrison, and the Pointer Sisters. Scatting also makes appearances in newer genres, including industrial music, in the chorus of Ministry's 1991 song \\"Jesus Built My Hotrod\\"; nu metal music, in the band Korn (whose lead singer Jonathan Davis has incorporated scat singing into songs such as \\"Twist\\", \\"Ball Tongue\\", \\"Freak on a Leash\\", \\"B.B.K.\\", \\"Beat it Upright\\", \\"Liar\\", and \\"Rotting in Vain\\"); and the heavy metal subgenre of death metal, where scat singing is used by John Tardy of the band Obituary. Jack Black incorporates scat into several Tenacious D songs, most notably: \\"Tribute\\", \\"Cosmic Shame\\", \\"Classico,\\" \\"Jesus Ranch,\\" Low Hangin' Fruit,\\" and \\"Bowie\\". Singer JoJo performs ad-libbed scats on the track \\"Yes or No\\". Other modern examples include \\"Under Pressure\\" by Queen (band), \\"Rag Doll\\" by Aerosmith, \\"Under My Voodoo\\" by Sublime, \\"No! Don't Shoot\\" by Foxy Shazam, \\"Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz\\" by Mr. Bungle, \\"In My Bed\\" by Amy Winehouse, and \\"Stuck in the Middle\\" by Mika. Scatman John combined scat and early-1990s electronic dance music. Due to the wide-ranging vocal styles used in popular music, occasionally songs have been mistakenly categorized as having non-lexical vocables, when in fact the singers are performing actual lyrics rendered partially (or completely) unintelligible to the ear of some (but not all) listeners. Two famous 1960s examples are \\"Louie Louie\\" as recorded by The Kingsmen and \\"Wooly Bully\\" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs.  Examples  Some bands have invented a language for their lyrics; examples include: * Koba√Øan (language used by French progressive rock band Magma) * Vonlenska, also called Hopelandic, (gibberish language employed by the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur R√≥s) Jack Black uses non-lexical vocables whilst singing as Tenacious D. Van Morrison employed scat in his performances. French singer Antoine Tom√© has used vocal percussions and sung several of his songs in an imaginary language since the 1970's. Examples by popular non-anglophone singers using such techniques include \\"Bla Bla Bla\\" by Gigi D'Agostino, \\"Eena Mina Dika\\" in the Bollywood film Aasha, Eduard Khil's \\"I Am Glad, Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home\\" (known as \\"Trololo\\") sung entirely without lyrics, \\"Fuzao\\" by Faye Wong, \\"Lagu Lagu\\" by Sa Dingding and \\"Din Daa Daa\\" by George Kranz. Disney songs A signature of some Disney musical films is their songs' use of nonsense words, the longest and most famous of which is from Mary Poppins, entitled \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\". A close second is \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\" from Song of the South, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Nonsense word song titles include: * \\"Heigh-Ho\\" from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) * \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\" from Song of the South (1946) * \\"Bibbidi- Bobbidi-Boo\\" from Cinderella (1950) * \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" and \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\" from Mary Poppins (1964) * \\"Substitutiary Locomotion\\" from Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), which includes the incantation \\"Treguna Mekoides and Tracorum Satis Dee\\" * \\"Whistle-Stop\\" from Robin Hood (1973), which was reused in The Hampsterdance Song (2000) * \\"Whoop-de-Dooper Bounce\\" from The Tigger Movie (2000) Nonsense lyrics also feature in the following Disney songs: * \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\" from The Jungle Book features a segment of improvisational nonsense words. * \\"Trashing the Camp\\" from Tarzan also contains a segment of improvisational nonsense words. * \\"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\\" from The Aristocats, sung by Scatman Crothers as \\"Scat Cat\\", contains lengthy scat sequences.

It was created by Super Unicorn members Erik Mona, Kyle Hunter, and Sean Glenn, who were the contracted design studio for the M&M; 1st edition line. The setting was initially created to give the character backgrounds in the Mutants and Masterminds 1st edition core book more life. It was further detailed with a full history in Crooks! Inhabitants =The META-4 Agency= META-4 is a government agency much like the CIA, whose task is to oversee superhuman activities. The agency consists of both human and superhuman operatives. They are also broken into four branches, each with its own color uniform. The agency is currently run by director Talia Thorne. The Reserve The current superhuman program run by META-4. The team acts as both a training ground for new recruits, as well as a force against superhuman threats. The team is known as the Reserve as they are generally utilized for larger threats; ordinary criminal activity is handled by local law enforcement and other non-affiliated superhumans. Current Core Group: * Marathon - A super speedster. * Minotaur - A former Green Beret, given superpowers through the ANTAG program's Man/Myth project. One of the most disciplined members of the project, he was moved to META-4 and the Reserve for active duty. His goal is to capture the other members of the Man/Myth project, who are now known as the Bestiary. Known powers are super strength and super toughness. * Inferna - Minotaur's longtime partner in the fight against the Bestiary. Known powers are various methods of fire control fire including flight. Other members: The Reserve has had a few rotating members who help occasionally for short stints: * Cyclone * Knock-Off * Protonik * The Pugilist Deceased members: * Argus - left in a vegetative state after a fight with Fuse. * Ant Devil - killed in a fight with Fuse. The Statesmen Initiative Following defeat in the Vietnam War, and faced with an ever- growing population of super-powered citizens, the United States government formed a team of government-sanctioned heroes ready to meet any domestic or international threat. The team was made up of 50 heroes, once from each state in the Union. The core team was made up of Trinity (NM), Skyscraper Joe (NY), Kittyhawk (NC), Calamity Jane Doe (SD), and Bigfoot (WA). Other members included Hotrod (MI), Jersey Devil (NJ), Bunyan Babe (MN), and the Connecticut Yankee (CT). Eventually poor publicity from the hero-turned-rogue St. Elmo (MA) coupled with Congressional investigations of financial irregularities and a string of defeats in the early 1980s led to problems for the team. After the loss of Trinity in their battle with the Atomic Brain in early 1982, the team splintered and was disbanded by the end of the year. =Other Superhuman Teams of Arcadia= Bestiary A group of villains seeking to grow stronger and show their real worth. Originally created by ANTAG, a government research program whose goal was to create new superhuman soldiers. They were part of the Man/Myth project along with Argus and Minotaur. These members however turned unstable during a mission to Iraq. The ANTAG program was subsequently taken over by META-4. Since then, The Reserve and Bestiary have become arch rivals. * Behemoth - A large blue beast of a man. * Chimera - The team leader. * Cockatrice - Can turn people to stone with just a look. * Griffon * Manticore * Undine - A woman who looks part fish & can control water. Courage Unlimited The Front Soon after becoming President in 1992, Ben Farmer began receiving threats from terrorist groups and super villains. In response to this threat, Farmer formed the Front, a group of presidentially-appointed super heroes who acted as body guards under direct order of the President. With his election in 2000, President Bert Lando replaced Farmer's team with a new group more loyal to him. New members included Alpha Male, Primute and Radiomega.

Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology p. 229. and, with Gabriel Delanne and Camille Flammarion, one of the principal exponents of spiritism after the death of Allan Kardec. Denis lectured throughout Europe at international conferences of spiritism and spiritualism, promoting the idea of survival of the soul after death and the implications of this for human relations. He is known as the apostle of French spiritism. Biography L√©on Denis was born in Foug, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France, on January 1, 1846,Biography (Bezerra de Menezes Kardecian Spiritist Center) of a humble family. Very early in life, out of necessity, he did manual work and had to bear heavy responsibilities for his family. From his first steps in the world, he sensed that invisible friends assisted him. Instead of participating in play appropriate to his youth, he tried to instruct himself as intensely as possible. He read serious works, thus striving through his own efforts, to develop his intelligence. He became a serious and competent self-didact. At the age of 18, he commenced work as a sales representative, and so had to make frequent trips. This situation continued up to the time of his reformation and beyond. He adored music and, whenever he had a chance, attended operas or concerts. He played well-known arias at the piano and also some compositions of his own. He did not smoke, and was almost exclusively a vegetarian, nor did he indulge in fermented drinks. He found water to be his ideal drink. It was his habit to review books with interest, of those displayed in the bookstores, at the age of 18, by ‚Äúchance‚Äù his eyes glanced at a work with an unusual title: The Spirits‚Äô Book by Allan Kardec. Having with him the amount needed to purchase the book, he bought it and rushed to his home immediately surrendering eagerly to the reading. Denis commented after reading it: ‚ÄúI found in this book the clear solution, complete and logical, to a universal problem. My conviction became strong and sound. The Spiritist Theory dissipated my indifference and my doubts.‚Äù Denis was not just a successor to Allan Kardec, as is generally supposed, but was an important figure in consolidating the spiritist movement. He undertook doctrinal studies, research into mediums, and propelled the Spiritist Movement in France, and all over the world. He deepened the moral aspects of the Doctrine and, above all, consolidated the Movement in the early decades of the 20th century. In Spiritism, the role of Kardec is that of the sage; the role of Denis is that of the philosopher. L√©on Denis was nominated the Apostle of Spiritism, due to his sustained work, and his words, written and spoken, on behalf of the new doctrine. Possessing great moral sensibility, he dedicated his entire existence to the defense of the postulates that Kardec had transmitted in the books of the spiritist Pentateuch. Denis himself, summarized his mission as follows: ‚ÄúI have consecrated this existence to the service of a Great cause, Spiritism or Modern Spiritualism that will certainly be the universal faith, and the religion of the future.‚ÄùLe G√©nie Celtique.

The breed was originally used as a herding dog for working with cattle.  Appearance  Male with cropped ears and docked tail The breed is large but not over-sized; up to a maximum of 60 cm (23.6 ins) at the withers and 35 kg (77 lbs) in weight, with females slightly smaller. The general appearance is of a normally proportioned, deep chested, muscular dog with a broad head and medium length neck, straight back, and long legs. The tail is held up and is slightly curved. The breed has drop ears, unless they are cropped. The coat is a brindle of brown (pale brown is described as fawn) or grey, with black; it is short, smooth and harsh to the touch, with a short fringe on the tail (if undocked) and on the backs of the rear legs.  History  Female with natural tail and ears (undocked/uncropped) The breed is named for S√£o Miguel Island in the Azores, settled by the Portuguese, beginning in 1439. Another of the Azores, Terceira Island, is known for bullfights and cattle raising; large dogs used on cattle there were brought to S√£o Miguel Island and contributed to the development of the breed. According to the original breed standard, the existence of the has been documented since the early 19th century. A breed standard was developed in the breed's area of origin and first published in 1984. This standard was recognised internationally in 1995 when the standard was published by the FCI, with the English name Saint Miguel Cattle Dog. Although described (and formerly used) as a cattle dog, the breed is actually a molosser, and is thus recognised by the FCI in its \\"Group 2, Section 2, Molossoid breeds\\" as breed number 340. Today it is primarily used as a companion dog. Traditionally, the tail is docked, and the ears cropped and rounded off on top, although these practices are now illegal in many areas. The reasons for these traditions are uncertain but believed to ensure tails and ears cannot be bitten by cattle when herding. Today, dogs from S√£o Miguel are exported to North America and other areas of the world where they are bred and promoted for the rare breed market. Minor kennel clubs, and registries maintained by individual breeders, write their own versions of the breed standard, which may vary from the breed standard developed on the island of S√£o Miguel and recognised internationally by the FCI. Dogs of the breed may be sold under the original breed name, , or any of the many translations and versions of the name in various languages. The breed is known as Azores cattle dog in the USA and England.  Temperament  Although the breed is a medium- sized working dog in origin, the actual suitability of an individual dog for a particular kind of work may depend on the quality of early training. This breed is said to be intelligent and to bond strongly with keepers, and to generally be gentle, even docile, when trained well. However, temperaments of individual dogs may vary greatly. =Activities= Saint Miguel Cattle Dogs can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Individuals exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.  Health  Specimens from Portugal have no documented health problems, but dogs bred elsewhere are often bred to be very over-sized for the breed (over 60 cm/23.6 in and 35 kg/77 lb) and may suffer ailments particular to deep-chested, very large dogs, such as bloat. Life expectancy of the breed is approximately 15 years.  See also  * (literally 'Brazilian catch-dog') * Castro Laboreiro Dog ( * (lit.

Position in 2009 Vellinga is the chairman of the Knowledge for Climate research program and vice chairman of the Climate Changes Spatial Planning program. These programs support the Dutch government and companies with operational knowledge required for investment decisions related to climate change adaptation and mitigation. He has a chair in Climate and Water at Wageningen University (WUR), where he is director of the Wageningen University climate program, and has a part-time chair in Societal Impacts of Climate Change at the Institute of Environmental Studies of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Career He was among the first scientists to publish on climate change and its implications regarding water and energy in the eighties. His education and training includes a Fulbright scholarship in the USA in 1967-68, an Msc (1976) and doctors degree at Delft University of Technology (1984). His 1986 PhD on Beach Erosion and Dune Erosion During Storm provided the basis for the coastal safety evaluation (the Dutch Delta Plan). In 1988, in a newly created position, he became advisor to the Minister of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment on the issue of Climate Change and the development of international CO2 policies. In this role he was key negotiator during the Netherlands EU-presidency of 1988. He was also one of the experts of the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases. For this advisory body he also chaired with Peter Gleick the ‚ÄúTargets and Indicators of Climatic Change‚Äù working group. In 1991 Professor Vellinga published an articleThe greenhouse marathon: A proposal for a global strategy , Climatic Change - January 1991, Volume 18, Issue 1, pp vii-xii with Robert Swart that became a cornerstone in the definition of the 2 ¬∞C target, than adopted by UNFCCC COP 15 in Copenhagen in 2009. This article also proposed for the first time a traffic-light visualization - based on red, yellow, green colours - that since then has been largely employed in risk management and climate change communication. In 1991/1992 he was one of the architects of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and in 1989 was actively involved in setting up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as vice chairman in its first bureau. He was as an author of various IPCC chapters (the work of the IPCC, including the contributions of many scientists, was recognised by the joint award of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize). From 1995 to 1998 he combined his work as director of the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (a position which he held from 1991 to 2001) with a part-time position at the World Bank, United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as Chairman of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). From 1991 to 2006 he has been a professor of earth sciences at the Vrije Universiteit. Joyeeta Gupta, Richard Tol, Robert Swart and Hasse Goosen were among his first PhD students. He is Professor in Climate Change and Water Safety at Wageningen University. In 2009 he initiated the international Delta Alliance, a collaboration among low-lying coastal areas in the world vulnerable to climate change. This initiative is still going on. Other activities In 2003 he presented the Erasmus Liga Lecture on Climate Change and the safety of the Netherlands. This triggered national debate on the vulnerability of the Netherlands with regard to flooding and the need to update the Delta Plan. He was advisor to the second Delta Committee (2008) on sea level rise and coastal protection. He is a member of the ‚ÄúUffizio di Piano‚Äù, a high level committee of scientists and policy makers charged by the Italian prime minister to supervise the high water protection and lagoon rehabilitation works in Venice. He is also a member of the supervisory board of the FMO-Bank (finance and development) At a national level he is chairman of the board of the Royal Dutch Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) and a member of the Energy Transition - Creative Energy platform. Lastly he is a member of the board of Urgenda. , Vellinga has published 28 scientific papers. In addition, he has more than 100 articles as author or co-author in books, scientific reports and proceedings of a more general nature. He has frequently appeared in news media and participated in several interviews and scientific documentaries made by national and international broadcasting cooperation's including BBC, ABC, CNN and Discovery.

They compete in the NCAA's Division III and the Southern Athletic Association. Millsaps's all-time record in football is 380 wins, 356 losses and 36 ties (.516). The gridiron Majors have posted two undefeated regular seasons in their history (1980 & 2008), earned three NCAA playoff tournament berths (1975, 2006 & 2008) and claimed six Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference championships (1991, 1996, 2006, 2007, 2008 & 2009). Its major rival is Belhaven University. History =Prior to 1964= Mississippi State University (then Mississippi A&M;) in football, 19‚Äì13. Millsaps fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1920. From 1920 to 1963 the Majors accumulated a 131‚Äì174‚Äì30 record over 40 seasons (no team was fielded in 1942, 1943 or 1945). Between 1920 and 1959 the Majors met their rival Mississippi College Choctaws in 39 games, constituting the historic Backyard Brawl rivalry between the two schools. During that time the Choctaws claimed a 24‚Äì9‚Äì6 lead in the series, which was discontinued after 1959. =The Harper Davis era (1964‚Äì1988)= In 1964, Harper Davis took over as the Majors' head coach. A Clarksdale, Mississippi native, Davis had been a four-time All-SEC selection as a defensive back at Mississippi State from 1945 to 19482009 Mississippi State football media guide who went on to a brief professional career. Davis's tenure at Millsaps got off to an inauspicious start: The Majors finished 0‚Äì8 in 1964, followed by losing seasons in two of the next three years. From there, however, Davis elevated the program to one of the most competitive in the South among the small college ranks, with 19 winning seasons between 1968 and 1988. In 1975, Davis guided the team to its first- ever berth in the Division III playoffs, where the Majors lost to eventual national champion Wittenberg in the semifinal round to finish the year with a 9‚Äì2 record. Five years later, in 1980, the Majors completed their first and only undefeated season to date. With Davis at the helm, the team went 9‚Äì0, racking up 350 points (38.9/game) while allowing opponents just 31 (3.4/game), recorded five shutouts and won four games by more than 50 points each, including setting the school record for points in a game in an 84‚Äì0 drubbing of Landmark Baptist College. The highlight of the season was an 8‚Äì7 victory over Central Florida's up-and-coming football program, played before 12,793 fans at the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando. It was Central Florida who returned to Jackson the following season and snapped the Majors 13-game winning streak dating back to the final contest of the 1979 season, 13‚Äì6. Davis retired after the 1988 season, having guided the Majors to a 140‚Äì78‚Äì4 record (.631) during his 25 year-tenure. All of the Majors' previous coaches had accumulated just 131 victories in 40 seasons. =After Davis (1989‚Äì2005)= After Davis stepped down, his longtime assistant, Tommy Ranager, was named to lead the football program. The 1989 season marked the first time the Majors played as a conference affiliate and not an independent team, having joined the expanding Collegiate Athletic Conference. In 1991, Ranager's Majors finished the year 7‚Äì2, including a 3‚Äì1 conference mark that earned Millsaps a share of the first conference championship of the newly restructured and renamed Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference and Ranager conference \\"Coach of the Year\\" honors. In 1994, however, Ranager's Majors finished 4‚Äì6 (2‚Äì2 SCAC), marking the team's first losing season since 1977, and followed that with a 2‚Äì7 (0‚Äì4 SCAC) campaign in 1995, prompting the program to seek new direction. Ron Jurney, who succeeded Ranager, guided the Majors to an 8‚Äì2 (4‚Äì1) finish and a share of the program's second SCAC championship in his first season in 1996, earning him conference \\"Coach of the Year\\" honors. The Majors snapped Trinity's streak of 12 consecutive victories by a 13‚Äì10 margin in the season finale in Jackson to share the SCAC title with the Tigers. However, Jurney's teams over the next three seasons never won more than three games in a season, accumulating a combined record of 8‚Äì22 (2‚Äì15 SCAC), resulting in Jurney being relieved of his post after the 1999 campaign. Former Mississippi State head coach Bob Tyler, who guided the Bulldogs to several successful seasons during the 1970s, was hired to replace Jurney. Under Tyler, Millsaps and Mississippi College renewed their historic Backyard Brawl rivalry in 2000. The much anticipated game was played at Memorial Stadium in Jackson before more than 10,000 fans, with the Majors kicking the winning field goal with 16 seconds left for a 20‚Äì19 victory. Since the series was renewed, the Majors and the Choctaws have faced off in the opening week of every season except 2005, when the teams did not meet. Tyler led the team to a .500 record in 2000 (5‚Äì5, 2‚Äì4 SCAC) and a winning season in 2001 (6‚Äì4, 3‚Äì3 SCAC), however, when the Majors finished the 2002 season with five consecutive loses, all against conference opponents, resulting in a disappointing 3‚Äì6 (1‚Äì5 SCAC) record, the program again opted to make a change. In 2003, Millsaps hired David Saunders to fill Tyler's vacated post, making him the program's fourth coach in the fourteen seasons since Harper Davis's retirement. Saunders had previously been the Recruiting Coordinator on David Cutcliffe's staff at Ole Miss. After three unsuccessful seasons resulting in a combined 7‚Äì21 record (5‚Äì13 SCAC), Saunders returned to the Rebels to join Ed Orgeron's staff. =Resurgence under DuBose (2006‚Äì2009)= After just one season at Millsaps, defensive coordinator Mike DuBose was promoted to head coach to replace Saunders in 2006. DuBose had previously been the head coach of Alabama's football team from 1997 to 2000, leading the Crimson Tide to an SEC championship in 1999. DuBose brought a bright football mind and a new-found confidence and enthusiasm to the program that produced results few could have foreseen. 2006 DuBose's first season of 2006 got off to a rocky start. The Majors were hammered 52‚Äì28 by Mississippi College in the season-opening Backyard Brawl game, which returned after a one-year hiatus in 2005. The Majors then lost their next two games in heartbreaking fashion, by a combined total of four points. However, DuBose's team managed an incredible turn-around that shocked the SCAC, when the team went on to win their next six games to set up a showdown with perennial SCAC juggernaut Trinity in the season finale. Each team entered the contest at 5‚Äì0 in conference play, meaning the winner would receive the SCAC's automatic playoff bid and claim the SCAC title outright. 2007 Having established themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the SCAC, DuBose and the 2007 Majors, led by a large group of seniors and returning starters, set their goals high, aiming to repeat as SCAC champions and gain another playoff berth. The season began on a sour note, however, when Millsaps suffered a disappointing loss at the hands of Mississippi College in the Backyard Brawl. Millsaps, having led comfortably for most of the game, took a 26‚Äì6 advantage into the fourth quarter. However, as the Majors were resting their starters and putting less experienced players into the game, the Choctaws began to find a rhythm. DuBose never returned his starters to the game as his team's lead began to dwindle and Mississippi College roared back with three touchdowns in the final quarter to claim a 27‚Äì26 victory. 2008 The 2008 season was a very successful season. The Majors rolled through the regular season, going 10‚Äì0 and outscoring their opponents 442 to 132. The team avenged 2007's crushing loses at the hands of Mississippi College and Trinity, pummeling the Choctaws 42‚Äì6 in the eighth edition of the renewed Backyard Brawl and punishing the Tigers 56‚Äì27 in San Antonio. The Majors captured their third consecutive SCAC championship, winning outright to earn the program's third NCAA tournament berth, became the first team in the program's history to reach double digit wins and climbed to their highest ever national ranking, #3, before finishing the season 11‚Äì1 and ranked #12 nationally. Once again, DuBose was named the conference's \\"Coach of the Year\\" and senior quarterback Juan Joseph was the SCAC's \\"Offensive Player of the Year\\" for the third consecutive season. Sophomore wide receiver and return specialist Michael Galatas was named the conference's \\"Special Teams Player of the Year\\" and freshman running back Shane Bowser was the SCAC's co-\\"Newcomer of the Year.\\" In all, 20 Majors were named to the All-SCAC first team, second team and honorable mention lists. 2009 In 2009, the Majors finished 5‚Äì1 in SCAC play to again earn a share of the conference title. The team's fourth conference championship in as many years was added to the accomplishments of the winningest senior class in the program's history, who finished their four-year careers with a 33‚Äì10 overall record. However, the team had hoped to attain another NCAA playoff berth, a cause derailed by three painfully close loses. First, the Majors lost to their rival Choctaws in two overtimes in the season- opening ninth edition of the renewed Backyard Brawl. Millsaps won their next three games, including an emotional 24‚Äì6 victory over Trinity after a week in which Coach DuBose's wife Polly underwent the first of several breast cancer surgeries that took place during the season. The team finished the season on a positive note, handily dispatching of their last four opponents, including a homecoming victory over previously undefeated Centre. A 61‚Äì7 dismantling of Sewanee the following week secured the program's share of a fourth consecutive conference title. Junior return specialist Michael Galatas was named the SCAC's \\"Special Teams Player of the Year\\" for the second consecutive season, the fourth consecutive season the award went to a Major, and junior linebacker Will Hawkins was the conference's \\"Defensive Player of the Year\\", and a first team All-American. A total of 20 Majors were voted to the all-conference first, second and honorable mention teams. =After DuBose (2010‚Äìpresent)= On March 1, 2010, Aaron Pelch was named as DuBose's successor. Pelch, a former Weber State University player and 2001 graduate, was a defensive assistant for DuBose's Majors from 2006 to 2008, before joining Tom Cable's Oakland Raiders staff as a special teams coach in 2009. 2010 Pelch guided the 2010 Majors to a 7‚Äì3 (5‚Äì1) record in his first season, but the team saw its streak of 4 consecutive SCAC championships snapped by virtue of a 21‚Äì35 home loss to DePauw, who finished the year 6‚Äì0 in conference play. The Majors' 2011 senior class tied the record set by the previous year's senior class of most career victories, with 33 in a four-year span. For the 5th year in a row, the Majors' offense was the SCAC's highest scoring unit.

Bald was the cousin of Robert Bald, surveyor and mining engineer. His life William Bald was born in Burntisland, Fife in 1789. He left school in Burntisland at the age of 12 and, after a brief period of schooling in Edinburgh, was apprenticed to John Ainslie in 1803. This was an impressive start to his working life, as Ainslie was the leading Scottish map-maker of his generation.Brown, Stephen; McDougall, Warren (2011). The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Volume 2: Enlightenment and Expansion 1707-1800. Edinburgh University Press. . p.101. Around this time, there was a strong demand for map-making services from Scottish landowners, who were keen to develop their estates and thereby increase their profitability. It was on such projects that Bald, supervised by Ainslie, initially worked. Within two years Bald, at age 17, was given personal responsibility for mapping the Western Isles of Scotland. The maps which he produced were a major factor in transforming the way in which the Western Isles were depicted in the new atlases of the day. Bald moved to Ireland by 1809, and at the age of 21 was embarking on his most significant period of work. In 1815, he was describing himself as a Land Surveyor, and was living in Castlebar, County Mayo. It was in Ireland that his principal mapping, surveying and civil engineering works were undertaken, and it is in Ireland that he is chiefly remembered today. He was responsible for the construction and improvement of roads, harbours and railways throughout Ireland. As Director of the Trigonometrical Survey of Co. Mayo he produced a 25-sheet map of the county, completed in 1830, which is regarded as a masterpiece. From 1826 to 1830, Bald worked in France, before returning to Ireland. Among his many projects there were improvements to the River Boyne and the harbour at Drogheda. He was also responsible for Ireland's first suspension bridge, at Kenmare in County Kerry. But his most famous work is the Antrim Coast Road, which is regarded as one of Ireland's most scenic drives. He built the 40 km route from Larne to Cushendall between 1832 and 1842. Bald had the vision of building the road along the foot of the cliffs, some of them over 100 metres high. This was a novel idea, as previous plans had been to build the road some distance inland. But this would have meant steep gradients as the road traversed the valleys of the Glens as they ran down from the Antrim Plateau to the sea. Bald decided to blast the cliff face which then fell down onto the foreshore to form the base for the new road. In 1834 Bald had the idea of opening up a limestone quarry on the Cavehill, near Belfast, and transporting the stone down to Belfast Harbour by a railway.Raymond O'Regan, Hidden Belfast, The Mercier Press, 2010 He estimated the work to cost ¬£12,000, but thought it would deliver an annual income of around ¬£2,300. The Cavehill Railway and Quarries company was formed and Bald constructed a double track tram road of 4' 9\\" gauge, operated by horse and gravity. The track crossed the Ballysillan Road under a twin arched bridge, crossed over the Antrim Road and ran down to the port by way of the Limestone Road. The company continued to trade until 1896 when it became bankrupt. In 1839 Bald was appointed as engineer to the Clyde River Trust in Scotland, where he was involved in the deepening and improving of the river, as well as redesigning Troon harbour. After being dismissed after differences of opinion after six years, he returned to work in France, while acting as at consultant engineer to the Admiralty. Bald was an innovative and imaginative civil engineer, whose work was highly regarded in the various countries in which he worked. He was a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1816, Bald was elected as a Fellow of the Geological Society of London, and he became a Member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1822. In 1829 he was proposed for membership of the Royal Society of Scotland by his cousin Robert Bald.Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 1783-2002. - William Bald. Ref. 93. p.48 After a stay in Paris he was elected as a Member of the Societe de Geographie, in Paris in 1828. William Bald married his first wife, Anne, in 1809 in Scotland, and in 1823 he married his second wife, Matilda Barrett, in Ballina. He is thought to have fathered 13 children. William died in 1857 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery, London. David Orr, the President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 2007‚Äì08, praised Bald as an \\"unsung hero\\" in his Presidential AddressPresidential Address: 'At the Heart of Society' of November 2007. Speaking of the Antrim Coast Road, Orr said that Bald had left \\"an immeasurable legacy to the people of the Glens of Antrim, and created one of the finest tourist routes in the world\\". In November 2009, the Institution of Civil Engineers in Northern Ireland launched the 'William Bald Scholarships',The William Bald Scholarships with the backing of the Northern Ireland Executive and local civil engineering contractors. These scholarships recognise post graduate work of the next generation of civil engineers, and graduates will benefit each year for a period of five years.

Meijer was born in Haarlemmermeer. Brought up a devout Roman Catholic and educated in a number of seminaries he soon became influenced by Wouter Lutkie, a Catholic priest and fascist.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890 After a brief stopover in the Roman Catholic State Party, which he found far too moderate, Meijer began to write for the authoritarian De Rijkseenheid and the General Dutch Fascist League's De Fascist. He soon joined the League and, having inherited money from his father, launched his own journal Zwart Front. Rising to a position of influence in the League, he quarreled with leader Jan Baars and in 1934 split from the group, taking a number of followers with him. Before long he had revived the Zwart Front name for his new movement and even visited Benito Mussolini with Lutkie to gain the fascist leader's approval. The Front failed to make much impact in elections, notably managing only 0.2% of the vote in the 1939 general electionR.J.B. Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 454 (although Meijer managed a 21.4% vote share in Oisterwijk). As a result, Meijer's faction was absorbed into the new National Front in 1940. This movement was banned on 13 December 1941 by the Nazis, largely due to their Catholicism.Bosworth, The Oxford Handbook of Fascism, p. 458 Despite the ban Meijer was allowed to simply retire from politics. He was arrested on October the 27th of 1944 and was imprisoned in the former SS concentration camp in Vught until on May the 7th 1945 he escaped to Belgium. That same year he published a book about the treatment of former collaborators, Pruisische practijken in herrijzend Nederland!. He returned to the Netherlands in 1946 to face a five-year jail sentence. He was released from prison in 1948 and returned to politics, writing for the Aristo journal which was sympathetic to Lutkie. He did not however resume his earlier involvement in party politics. He died, aged 60, in Oisterwijk.

It is a police detective story with comical twists featuring two inspectors of the Dortmund police, Balko (played by Jochen Horst until episode 48, then by Bruno Eyron) and his colleague Klaus Krapp (Ludger Pistor). Balko's main characteristics are his coolness and his consistently laid-back appearance, whereas ‚ÄúKrappi‚Äù is a typical mama‚Äôs boy and very clumsy. The series started in 1995 and has won several television awards.  Characters  Kriminalhauptkommissar Balko Balko, the main character of the series, is an easygoing and friendly police officer not always sticking to working rules. He is a conscientious objector and holds no high school diploma. Most of the time he is surrounded by incompetent colleagues he cannot rely on in cases of emergency. Balko originally comes from Wetter, a small village in the Ennepe Ruhr district, near Dortmund. His parents still live there. So far his Christian name has not been mentioned in any episode. Kriminalhauptkommissar Klaus Krapp Krapp, also called \\"Krappi\\", is a thoroughly honest public servant. He is never dressed improperly, is always up to date in his profession and well-educated. He graduated from a German high school (Abitur) and is a reserve officer of the Bundeswehr. Despite his many skills, in the domestic area as well as many others, he has no luck with women. His attempts to score with the opposite sex are legendary but have mostly been a failure. Krapp seems to cling to his mother, who is mentioned repeatedly and lives in Dortmund-Huckarde, though she never appears in person. Kriminaloberr√§tin Katharina J√§ger After a series of changes in the leadership of the homicide division (during the first years the part of the chief executive was played by Dieter Pfaff as well as for a short time by Horst A. Fechner and Arthur Brauss), Kriminaloberr√§tin Katharina J√§ger (played by Sabine Vitua) became Balko's boss from 1998 to 2000. After her death caused by assassination with a sabotaged car, which was originally directed at Balko, Wittek became the new chief detective. Polizeikommissar/Polizeiobermeister/Erster Kriminalhauptkommissar Hans \\"Quittek\\" Wittek Kriminalhauptkommissar Wittek, called \\"Quittek\\", was a patrolman until he is promoted to be Erster Polizeihauptkommissar and head of the homicide division of Dortmund by skipping five ranks. The reason for this is his marriage with the daughter of the Polizeipr√§sident. He is very simple-minded and often messes up inspections but because of his lack of competence he also always gives his investigators plenty of leeway. Polizeiobermeister Marek Polizeiobermeister Marek is the ultimate simple-minded patrolman, assigned to the Dortmund homicide division. His first name has never been mentioned in any episode. Polizeiobermeister Schafranek Polizeiobermeister Schafranek is a clumsy, not particularly clever, but very likable patrolman who was assigned to the homicide division after Wittek's promotion. His first name also remains unknown. Schafranek is Marek's best friend. Kriminalrat Holtmann When Wittek retired, Kriminalrat Holtmann became his successor and was appointed chief of the homicide division for the last seven episodes. He was clearly stricter than his predecessor, kept a tighter rein and appeared to be a very competent detective.

Large concentrations of the community are to be found in Wellington, and to a lesser extent Christchurch and Auckland. Smaller communities of Greeks reside in Palmerston North, Wanganui, Dunedin, Hamilton and Napier. Many Greek New Zealanders maintain their Greek identity through the observation of Greek customs and traditions, and their adherence to their Greek Orthodox (Christian) faith, whilst also assimilating into New Zealand society. The number of people reporting their ethnicity as Greek in New Zealand was 2,478 in the March 2013 census. Migration The vast majority of the Greeks immigrating to New Zealand came from the western prefecture of Aetolia-Acarnania, the Ionian Sea islands of Ithaca and Kephalonia, and from the island of Lesbos which is located in the northeastern Aegean Sea. Smaller numbers have come from Macedonia, Epirus, Attica, the Peloponnese, Crete, Romania and Cyprus. Chain migration has been popular. =The first Greek immigrants= It is believed that the first Greek in New Zealand was a Mr Constas, an officer in the merchant navy from Sparta, Laconia which is situated in the southeastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula. He arrived in New Zealand in 1798 aboard a Dutch-flagged merchant ship which later sank in Dunedin. He died in Dunedin in 1840 - the year the Treaty of Waitangi was signed. In 1832 Captain Economou arrived in New Zealand on a Dutch or British ship. He stayed in New Zealand and married a MƒÅori woman. He assisted his father-in law at the Treaty of Waitangi. Seaman Nicolas Demetriou Mangos from Syros arrived in New Zealand in 1844. He was 17 years old, and jumped ship because his Dutch captain was reportedly cruel. He was sheltered by an Irish family, and later he married their daughter. The earliest Greek presence recorded in the New Zealand census was in 1874 when forty men and one woman were reported. Nikolas Fernandos (or Mantzaris) from the island of Ithaca is considered the first known immigrant to New Zealand. Between 1890 and 1914 Greek immigrants established themselves as fishermen, street hawkers, confectioners and restaurateurs in Wellington, Auckland and Dunedin. Relatives of these early immigrants were encouraged to join them in New Zealand, setting up chain migration from poverty-stricken towns and villages. By 1936 there were 82 Greece born people living in Wellington with other immigrants residing in New Plymouth, Feilding, Palmerston North, Dannevirke, Napier, Hastings, Ashburton, Temuka, Timaru, Waimate and Oamaru. =War refugees= Greeks immigrated to New Zealand for a better life following World War II and the Greek Civil War, fought from 1946 to 1949. New Zealand, a member of the International Refugee Organization, assisted 1026 ethnic Greeks from Romania to settle in NZ in 1951. The displaced persons arrived in Wellington in May, August and December 1951 on the SS GOYA, from Piraeus, Greece. Although most arrivals were placed in jobs in Wellington, some were sent around the country to work in hydroelectric construction and heavy industry where there was a shortage of labour. A commemorative plaque was unveiled on the Wellington waterfront in 2012, close to where the SS GOYA docked in 1951. John Vakidis' acclaimed New Zealand play 'Tzigane', explores the Greek-Romanian refugee experience of emigrating and living in New Zealand. =The \\"Golden Age\\"= A big influx of Greek immigration took place in the 1950s and 1960s due to economic and political problems in Greece. More than seven million Greeks emigrated from Greece during this period, mainly to the United States, Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, France, Switzerland and New Zealand. Amongst those immigrating to New Zealand during this period were 267 young women who arrived between 1962 and 1964 through a New Zealand government scheme to provide domestic staff for hospitals, schools and hotels. The New Zealand Greek community's population peaked in the mid-1960s, with an estimated 5000-6000 Greeks, including New Zealand-born descendants. =Greek Cypriots= Most Greek Cypriots arrived in the late 1930s and after WWII between 1948 and 1960. Some Greek refugees arrived from Greek Cyprus following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Greek Cypriots have their own community hall and community association but are full and active members of the Greek Community. =Recent arrivals= Just under 100 Greeks have been granted New Zealand residency in the last 17 years.. =Dual citizenship= A number of Greek New Zealanders hold both New Zealand and Greek passports. Greek citizenship is acquired by birth by all persons born in Greece, and all persons born with at least one parent who is a registered Greek citizen. Any person who is ethnically Greek born outside Greece may become a Greek citizen through naturalization, providing they can prove a parent or grandparent was born as a national of Greece. Greek communities The largest concentration of Greek people reside in the country's capital city, Wellington. It is estimated that 65 percent of all Greek New Zealanders live there. The inner-city suburb of Mount Victoria developed a distinct Greek character after World War II as Greek immigrants clustered together for community support. Today the eastern suburb of Miramar is the city's main Greek enclave, with significant numbers also residing in Hataitai and Seatoun. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese and the Embassy of Greece are both located in Wellington. Smaller communities exist in Christchurch, Auckland and Napier/Hastings. Greek Orthodox churches exist in all these centres. Many Greek New Zealanders enjoy the riches of two cultures - maintaining Greek cultural customs whilst integrating into the Kiwi way of life. It has been estimated that about 50 percent of marriages of Greek persons are now mixed. It is common for the wedding to take place in the Greek Orthodox Church with the non-Greek non-Christian partner becoming baptised before the marriage. =Employment= Many Greek immigrants established food businesses such as restaurants, grill-rooms and fish and chips shops. Zisis Blades' book Wellington's Hellenic Mile: The Greek Shops of Twentieth Century Wellington documents the many Greek shops of 20th century Wellington. Today many Greeks are tertiary educated - professionals, public servants, tradespeople and business owners. =The Greek Orthodox Church= The Greek Orthodox faith plays a central part in the cultural life of many Greek New Zealanders. From 1924 New Zealand was part of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia and New Zealand. Until the 1940s when a church was built in Wellington, the all important sacraments of baptism and marriage could only be performed when a priest visited from Australia. In 1970, New Zealand became a separate diocese with its own archbishop. The distinctive Byzantine-syle domed Greek Orthodox Church - The Annunciation of the Virgin Mary on Hania Street (formerly Lloyd Street) in Mount Victoria, Wellington was consecrated in 1970 by Metropolitan Dionysios Psiachas (dec), the first Archbishop of the Holy Metropolis of New Zealand. The current Metropolitan of New Zealand, Bishop Erithron Amfilochios Tsoukos was elected in 2005 and elevated the church on Hania Street to cathedral status. The Holy Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of New Zealand oversees ten churches in New Zealand including the Holy Archangels Monastery which was built in 2009, east of Levin. =Greek organisations= The Panhellenic Club on Marion Street in Wellingtom was the first Greek club, established in 1927. It then moved to Wakefield Street. Today the largest and most active organisation is the Greek Orthodox Community of Wellington and Suburbs. The incorporated society, established in 1945, is governed by an elected executive which manages the Greek Community Centre on Hania Street in Mount Victoria, Wellington. The Community Centre consists of The Greek Orthodox Cathedral - The Annunciation of the Virgin Mary, the Parthenon Building which houses a functions hall and classrooms, and an adjacent apartment building with meeting rooms. Other cities and regions have active community associations as well, namely, Christchurch, Auckland, the Hutt Valley and Palmerston North. Greek organisations representing different regional or national sub-groups have helped sustain the culture. In Wellington there are a number of associations whose membership is based on regional origin: namely Macedonia, Crete, Ithaca, Lesbos and Alto-akarnania. The Hellenic New Zealand Congress was formed in 1994 with the aim to foster better understanding, goodwill and friendly relations between the Hellenic communities and all New Zealanders through the support and promotion of Greek culture, traditions, history and language. Membership is welcomed from all Greeks and New Zealanders. =Greek language= A 1990 study by Maria Verivaki of Greek language ability amongst Greek New Zealanders found that more than half of the community claimed a high level of ability for understanding and speaking Greek with the order of proficiency being: understanding, speaking, reading, writing. There was a decreasing proficiency across each succeeding generation across the four language skills. The study also found a higher level of proficiency for those who visited Greece, attended church or attended Greek language school. The study concluded that exposure to the Greek language seems to be the key to language maintenance in the Greek community of New Zealand. The Greek Orthodox Community of Wellington has been providing Greek language lessons for children for over 50 years, and more recently for teenagers and adults. The Greek Government generously provides a qualified teacher from Greece, who teaches alongside local Greek people at the Greek community school. Many Greek New Zealanders have installed cable television in their homes, with which they can receive Greek-language news and entertainment channels, in this way strengthening their Greek language skills. =Cultural activities= The different Greek communities, associations, clubs and families enjoy socialising by engaging in social activities that include Greek food and music. Non-Greek New Zealanders enjoy partaking and have come to appreciate the Greek culture through Greek Community organised cultural and fundraising events including: * the commemoration of Greek National days on 25 March and 28 October, and the Battle of Crete in May; * the annual Greek Food Festival in Wellington; * art exhibitions by Greek New Zealand artists; * dance performances; * concerts by local Greek musicians and visiting Greek musicians: George Dalaras (1997), Glykeria (2000), Nana Mouskouri (Farewell Tour, 2005), Vangelis Perpiniadis (1999), Stathis Aggelopoulos and Stelios Perpiniadis (2014). A Greek band has been operating in various guises in Wellington for the last thirty years. The bands have primarily performed at Gree19k functions in Wellington and across New Zealand. The first known amateur band operated in Wellington in the 1960s with members Taso Soulis (piano accordion) John Zaloumis (lead guitar), Jim Viatos (mandolin), Manoli Haldezos (rhythm guitar) and Gregory Koutopos (percussion) Which gave many nationalities including Yugoslavs Italians and Jewish community and also Greek various types of music which they played at the time, later in the 70s Robert Metohianakis joined the band as they gave the band A Modern Flavour in their repertoire months later George Metohianakis joined the band while one of the members went on a holiday back home. On his returned Taso Soulis decided They want him to stay on so the band became very popular because of the variety of different music played. In the early 1980s George Metohianakis (lead vocal and bouzouki) Robert Metohianakis (bass) With Jeff Boulieris (drummer) carried on the Greek Band which was started by Taso Souli 'The Greek Band' The band then decided we will bring George Photiadis, Bruce Maniadis and Alex Theodorides the to make the band more versatile which Later released the albums (The Greek Way) (Yia tin Ayape For the Love). In 1985 George Metohianakis decided to move to Australia. Robert Metohianakis and Jeff Boulieris carried on the Greek band until Robert decided to move to Australia as well so the band dispersed Two years later Mythos Band Came to life with some new blood helloreleased an album in 1987. Most recently the Children of Aphrodite'founded by Andronicos Economous, who along with Alex Theodorides and Doros Kyriakides were performing together from 1977 in the Wellington Greek music scene' has performed at various functions. Between 1987 and 1989, four Wellington Greeks, Bruce Magiannis, Dimitri Papadopoulos, Tasos Varelas and Costa Christie formed a group named MYTHOS and recorded two albums of original Greek songs penned by Magiannis and Papadopoulos. Although the songs are in Greek they have a contemporary western feel. The first album, With The Memory, reached No.37 on the album charts from which Air New Zealand chose to feature the track Monaxia on their in flight entertainment for almost two years. TVNZ used the video clip for this song as a filler between programmes for many months. In 1996 singer Christina Daglas founded To Fos, a Greek music ensemble which, for the next ten years, performed and recorded with an eclectic mix of musicians. In 2001 Daglas released Christina Daglas: Folk Songs of Greece. This CD was very well received both in New Zealand and internationally and led to an invitation to sing at the Nanning International Folk Festival in China and the Beijing International Music Festival. Daglas was for a while a member of Greek Nights an ensemble that performs authentic Greek music and dance at various venues in Auckland. John Psathas is one of a few New Zealand composers who have made a mark on the international scene, particularly in Europe and North America. He is widely considered one of the three most important living composers of the Greek Diaspora. Psathas' music has been commissioned and performed by many musicians and orchestras around the world including Michael Brecker, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Michael Houstoun, Joshua Redman, The New Zealand String Quartet, Federico Mondelci, the New Zealand Chamber Soloists, the New Zealand Trio, Pedro Carneiro, the Takacs Quartet, the Netherlands Blazers Ensemble, the Halle Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic, the Melbourne Symphony, the BBC Scottish Symphony, the Auckland Philharmonia, the Vector Wellington Orchestra, and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. Psathas composed the ceremonial music for the 2004 Olympic Games. The latest recurrence of a band is 'Anamnisi' (Memories) which was formed in 2012. The band regularly plays around the Wellington area and is composed entirely of new members - Peter Carras (vocals), Theo Sekeris (keyboard), Nicole Bee (violin), and Panayiotis Matsis (bass). =Sport= A lack of recreational opportunities for Greek youth led Greek Orthodox priest Father Ilias Economou to establish the Olympic football club (formerly called the Christian Youth Football Club) in 1958. Today Wellington Olympic AFC fields an array of senior and junior teams. In 2009 the club's premier team won the Chatham Cup. In the run-up to the 2004 Athens Olympics a number of successful cultural events were organized, with a substantial contribution from the Greek community. A number of Greek New Zealanders travelled to Greece to work as volunteers during the Games. Greek New Zealander John Psathas composed the music that was played at the Opening and Closing Ceremonies. In 2009 the Greek community in New Zealand was represented at the Oceania Pan Hellenic Games in Melbourne by a small team of athletes. About 600 athletes of Greek descent from all over Australia and New Zealand competed in a range of sports. =Media= For many years Greeks have had to rely on newspapers and magazines sent by family in Greece/Australia or purchased when on holiday in Greece for Greek news or entertainment. The Wellington Greek community has enjoyed different locally produced non- commercial community newsletters, newspapers and magazines for news from Greece or of Greek relevance, and music and news on the weekly Greek Community, Hellenic Youth and Cypriot radio broadcasts on Wellington Access Radio 738 HzM, hosted by volunteers from the Greek community. With the advent of the Internet and satellite television, Greek New Zealanders can enjoy a plethora of information and entertainment from the luxury of their homes. ERT World, the international service run by ERT, Greece's public broadcaster and the privately owned Antenna are broadcast in New Zealand. Political voice Map showing the current division of Cyprus =Cyprus= The Greek Cypriot community had a presence in Wellington well before the Second World War. Quite a few of its members served in the New Zealand Army in North Africa, Italy and the Pacific. The Cyprus Community Association was established in 1947 with the idea of helping Cypriot people to keep their identity and culture, and at the same time promote good relations between Cypriots and New Zealanders. The Cyprian Community of New Zealand has a political voice, demonstrating against continued occupation of northern Cyprus by Turkey. On 8 May 1996 the Hon. Annette King, Member of Parliament for Miramar, moved, \\"That the New Zealand House of Representatives reaffirms its total support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus as the only legitimate authority on the island.\\" The motion was agreed to. Flag of Macedonia. =Macedonia= The Greek community in New Zealand joined the worldwide opposition to the post-1991 constitutional name of Greece's northern neighbour, citing historical and territorial concerns resulting from the ambiguity between it and the adjacent Greek region of Macedonia. The Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens. =Parthenon Marbles= The New Zealand Parthenon Marbles Committee was formed in 2000, as part of a worldwide campaign to seek support for the return of the Parthenon Marbles which were removed by Lord Elgin from Greece in the early 19th century. The 100+ pieces are housed at the British Museum. On 24 May 2007 the New Zealand Parliament agreed to a motion urging the British Government to return the Parthenon Marbles to Greece. Moved by Hon. Marian Hobbs, Labour Member of Parliament for Wellington Central, the motion requested that \\"the House joins its voice to that of other countries throughout the world and urges the British Government to support the return of the Parthenon Marbles to Greece, stressing the need for the collections of marbles in different locations to be reunited so that the world can see them in their original context in relation to the Temple of Parthenon, as an act of respect to one of the most significant monuments of western heritage.\\" New Zealand joined a growing number of countries and international organisations also calling for their return.

Similarly, philosopher Stephen Hicks describes shock art as the inevitable conclusion of trends initiated in the late 19th century modernist art movement.Stephen Hicks. \\"Why Art Became Ugly\\" (1 September 2004). The Atlas Society, accessed 30 August 2020 Traditionally, art was usually intended to be a representation of reality and a celebration of human or natural beauty, but by the late 1800s modernists began questioning the boundaries of what constituted art. \\"[T]he first modernists of the late 1800s set themselves systematically to the project of isolating all the elements of art and eliminating them or flying in the face of them,\\" often by portraying the world as \\"fractured, decaying, horrifying, depressing, empty, and ultimately unintelligible.\\" The \\"grand-daddy\\" of this trend was Marcel Duchamp with his 1916 work Fountain, a urinal he signed and submitted to an art show. Similar works that broke with past aesthetic traditions included Edvard Munch's The Scream (1893) or Pablo Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907). A parallel trend was \\"reductionism\\": emphasizing the basic elements of art such as colors or shapes, often in a manner that minimizes the need for artistic skill. Hicks cites White on White (1918) by Kazimir Malevich. A subsequent trend was using art as ironic or kitschy commentary: \\"if traditionally the art object is a special and unique artifact, then we can eliminate the art object's special status by making art works that are reproductions of excruciatingly ordinary objects\\", as with Andy Warhol's factory produced silk screens of consumer products. With a shift to post- modernist art in the 1970s and '80s, a preoccupation with politics, sex and scatology appears as with Piss Christ (1987) by Andres Serrano, and the performance art/punk rock musician GG Allin who became notorious for defecating on stage. \\"[W]e have reached a dead end: From Duchamp's Piss on art at the beginning of the century to Allin's Shit on you at the end‚Äîthat is not a significant development over the course of a century.\\" In 1998, John Windsor in The Independent said that the work of the Young British Artists seemed tame compared with that of the \\"shock art\\" of the 1970s, including \\"kinky outrages\\" at the Nicholas Treadwell Gallery, amongst which were a \\"hanging, anatomically detailed leather straitjacket, complete with genitals\\", titled Pink Crucifixion, by Mandy Havers.Windsor, John. \\"Art 98: Collecting‚ÄîLet the love affair begin\\", The Independent, 17 January 1998.

However he soon became more interested in nationalism and combining it with his fervent Catholicism.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890 He was ordained in 1919 but never completed his studies and, following a clash with his bishop over articles he published in the rightist journal Vreugde, he was set up in Nuland where he spent the rest of his life. Initially a supporter of Charles Maurras, Lutkie became drawn to Benito Mussolini and travelled to Italy in 1924, which increased his zeal. Writing for a number of fascist journals, he also set up his own Aristo in 1930. This lasted until 1943 before reappearing after the war and continuing until 1965. He also translated Mussolini's works into the Dutch language and conducted and published a series of interviews with the Italian leader. He would also co-operate with Arnold Meijer and the Black Front. In all however Lutkie sought to weld traditional Christianity to fascism's youthful dynamism and he built up a small but fanatical group of followers with the publication of Aristo.R.J.B.

Player Born in Fife, Davis and his family moved to Perth after his father was injured during World War II. He began his senior football career at Scot Symon's East Fife and quickly gained praise as a tough tackling, no-nonsense defender, but was drafted for national service in 1951 and shunned easier alternative postings to join the Black Watch. Whilst in the army he fought in the Korean War and was seriously injured on the battlefield; he spent two years in hospitals recuperating from bullet wounds to his abdomen and foot. While recovering from his injuries, Davis was determined not just to live a 'normal' life but to be extremely fit and overcome any challenge, the first being the medical opinion that he would no longer be able to play professional football. His progress impressed David Kinnear, a physiotherapist at the facility who had once played for Rangers, now managed by Scot Symon, and as a result of the mutual connections Davis signed for the reigning Scottish league champions at the age of 22. He helped them retain their title in his first campaign at Ibrox. That was the first of seven winner's medals he would claim during eight years at the Glasgow club, making 272 appearances in all competitions and also taking part in a continental final when Rangers lost out to Fiorentina in the 1961 European Cup Winners' Cup Final. He missed out on the 1960 Scottish Cup Final after being injured by a heavy challenge in the semi-final victory over Celtic. He then spent a season with Partick Thistle before retiring. Coaching career Immediately after his playing days ended, Davis had a three-year spell as manager of Queen's Park in Scotland's second tier. He then returned to Rangers as a coach working with Davie White, followed a year as manager of Queen of the South and a stint coaching at Dundee (again under White, during which they won the 1973 Scottish League Cup Final) before leaving football to run a hotel in Wester Ross where he was able to continue a passion for fishing. In 1998, he survived a broken neck sustained in a road accident.

In the 1950s, LeeRoy was an actual tiger who was brought to sporting events, but today LeeRoy is portrayed by a student wearing a tiger suit. Early in its history, the school participated in Division I/II athletics, but by 1991 the entire program made the move to Division III, at which time it joined the SCAC.

On October 27, 2007, in a game played in Jackson, Mississippi, against conference rival Millsaps College, Trinity trailed by two points with two seconds left. With time for only one more play and being too far way for a field goal, the Tigers ran the \\"hook and lateral play,\\" in which a receiver runs a short hook route, and then laterals the ball to a trailing player. After the first lateral the Millsaps defense was not fooled and seemed about to tackle the ball carrier and end the game. At this point the Tigers showed their knowledge of rugby by lining up across the field, rather than gathering in front of the ball carrier as is typical in American football. This meant that there was always a Tiger player in position, either even with or behind the ball carrier, to legally receive another lateral. Every time the Millsaps defense closed on the ball carrier the Trinity player was able to complete a legal lateral to a teammate. In what ESPN said may have been the \\"longest play in football history,\\" in terms of time elapsed (sixty seconds exactly), Trinity completed 15 laterals before breaking through the Millsaps defense for a 61-yard touchdown. The score, known in Jackson, MS as the \\"Major Disaster,\\" (Millsaps' nickname is \\"The Majors\\") gave Trinity the victory and ultimately led to the conference championship. The Trinity community is especially proud of this play because it demonstrated not only the Tigers' athletic ability, but also their intelligence and poise under pressure. The unlikely play was named the top sports moment of the year by Time Magazine as well as the \\"Game Changing Performance of the Year\\" by Pontiac.http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Football/Pontiac_GCPOY.htm In November 2015, Trinity and Austin College announced they would affiliate with the Southern Athletic Association for football in 2017.

The women's team captured the first USLTA women's collegiate championship in 1968 and won several more titles.

Aims Albanian society lacks the active participation of youngsters, a very necessary element for the progress of a community. Most of the young people who wish to contribute to their community lack the abilities, methods and the necessary information to realize their objectives. The project aims to provide young people with the knowledge and skills that they will need to become active members in their community. This will be achieved through ‚ÄúLearn through participation‚Äù. Youngsters will learn how their actions like voting, participation, addressing certain community issues and undertaking actions may help them to change their community for the better. The civic project aims to promote active citizenship by providing opportunities to the youngsters to get involved in concrete actions. It will allow Albanian youngsters to attain their civic education by integrating their knowledge and abilities in projects and actions that will really help their community, develop social responsibility and promote citizenship participation. The civic project will provide youngsters with the ability to widen their knowledge of the needs of their community, teach them how to identify and design a project, how to apply for it and how to collect funds. The project meets the needs of the youngsters to participate and develop skills and practical experiences in activities designed by the youngsters themselves. It also offers many communication opportunities for the volunteers with the partner organizations and institutions like the Tirana Municipality, the ‚ÄúMjaft‚Äù movement and the Eko Movement. Projects The youngsters will have the necessary means to make their ideas concrete. They will have access to information and support and will gain a clear idea of their role in the community.

Title The title comes from Pope's The Rape of the Lock:The Rape of the Lock, Canto 1. > With varying vanities, from every part, > They shift the moving toyshop of their heart Dedication The novel is dedicated to the poet Philip Larkin, Crispin's contemporary at St John's College, Oxford. In chapter 10, tongue-in-cheek reference is made to Larkin, with the mention of an undergraduate essay called \\"The Influence of Sir Gawain on Arnold's Empedocles on Etna\\", about which Fen comments: \\"Good heavens, that must be Larkin: the most indefatigable searcher out of pointless correspondences the world has ever known.\\" Plot Famous poet Richard Cadogan takes an impromptu holiday to Oxford, where he studied at the university, after growing bored with the literary life in the suburbs. After finding himself in a high street, in the middle of the night and with no place to stay, he stumbles across a shop with its awning still up. Closer inspection reveals it to be a toyshop, and on finding the door unlocked, curiosity leads Cadogan inside, then up a flight of stairs to a flat where he finds the murdered body of an elderly woman, before being knocked unconscious. He wakes up the next morning in a supply closet, but after escaping and bringing back the police, the toyshop is no longer there, replaced, it seems, with a grocer's. Bewildered, Cadogan turns to an old friend at Oxford University, eccentric professor and amateur sleuth Gervase Fen, to help him solve the mystery of the moving toyshop. Influence The book provided the source for the famous merry-go-round sequence at the climax of Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train. All the major elements of the scene: the two men struggling, the accidentally shot attendant, the out-of-control merry-go- round, and the crawling under the moving merry-go-round to disable it, are present in Crispin's novel, though he received no screen credit for it. Reception and legacy In 2006, detective novelist P. D. James picked The Moving Toyshop as one of her five \\"most riveting crime novels\\".Wall St Journal, 3 June 2006 (Internet Archive) About Crispin, she said, \\"[He] is one of the few mystery writers able to combine situation comedy and high spirits with detection.\\" Other crime writers have also given praise to Crispin for the paciness and humour of his work. Scottish crime writer Val McDermid called The Moving Toyshop, \\"\\"A classic crime novel with a surreal streak‚Ä¶ It's a clever, energetic romp, written with wit\\", while A. L. Kennedy described Crispin as, \\"One of the undiscovered treasures of British crime fiction: [his] storytelling is intelligent, humane, surprising and rattling good fun.\\"http://www.edmundcrispin.com/ References External links Category:1946 British novels Category:Novels by Edmund Crispin Category:Novels set in Oxford Category:J.
