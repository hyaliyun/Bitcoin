The spacecraft is a small 12-unit CubeSat that will also test a navigation system that will measure its position relative to NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) without relying on ground stations. Overview The Lunar Gateway is an in-development space station being planned by several national space agencies, including NASA, ESA, CSA and Australian Space Agency. It is planned to be placed in lunar orbit and intended to serve as a solar-powered communications hub, science laboratory, short-term habitation module, and holding area for rovers and other robots. It would play a major role in NASA's Artemis program. Computer simulations indicate that this orbit offers long- term stability with low propellant requirements for orbital station-keeping, by using a precise balance point in the gravities of Earth and the Moon that offers a stable trajectory. The main objective of the CAPSTONE mission is to verify the calculated orbital stability simulations for the Gateway. CAPSTONE will be the first spacecraft to operate in that unique lunar orbit. The spacecraft will also test a navigation system called Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System (CAPS), that will measure its position relative to NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) without relying on ground stations. Spacecraft The orbiter is a 12-unit CubeSat. The $13.7 million contract was awarded to a private company called Advanced Space, Boulder, Colorado, on 13 September 2019 through a federal Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract. Advanced Space will handle overall project management and some of the spacecraft's key technologies, including its CAPS positioning navigation system, while Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Irvine, California, will develop and build the spacecraft platform, and Stellar Exploration, Inc will develop its propulsion systems. NASA announced on 14 February 2020, that CAPSTONE will be launched aboard a booster Electron of Rocket Lab from the company's new launch site, Launch Complex-2 at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS), Wallops Island, in Virginia, and the launch is scheduled for early 2021. Following a three-month trip to the Moon, the CAPSTONE lunar satellite will spend six months collecting data during this demonstration. Rocket Lab's new launch pad in Virginia, designated Launch Complex 2, was completed in 2019 and will be ready to support launches in 2020. The company said the new facility will primarily support Electron missions with U.S. government payloads. The launch contract with Rocket Lab ‚Äî U.S.-based company that currently launches from New Zealand ‚Äî has a value of $9.95 million, according to NASA.

Schoeninger is an American anthropologist. She is Professor Emerita of Anthropology at The University of California San Diego, and until recently she was a Co-Director for the Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropology, or CARTA. Her research is primarily focused on the evolution of the human diet and what this information can tell us about other aspects of human evolution.  Early life and education  In 1970, Schoeninger received her B.A. degree in Anthropology from the University of Florida, and her M.A. degree in Anthropology from the University of Cincinnati in 1973. She then received her Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Michigan in 1980.  Contributions to anthropology  Schoeninger is mainly interested in the changes that the human diet underwent through time and how diet has evolved in relation to other evolutionary changes. She researches this by looking at subsistence strategies and their anthropological connections. Schoeninger has published upwards of 60 research papers that investigate the isotopic ratios of various elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and zinc in extinct primate dentition in order to reconstruct prehistoric human diet. Schoeninger has completed field research in North and Central America, Pakistan, India, Kenya, and Tanzania.  Awards and honors  In 1990, Schoeninger was a Smithsonian Short Term Visitor in the Conservation Analytical Laboratory. In 1993 she was awarded the Faculty Development Award from the University of Wisconsin, and the following school year she was in the Vilas Associate Professorship at the same university. From 1997-1999, Schoeninger was recognized as a Distinguished Lecturer by the scientific research honor society Sigma Xi. In 2007, Schoeninger was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Summary Lemann provides a history and impact on the American economy of three economic and social thinkers. He described the history of corporations, economic conditions and policies in the United States in the 20th century. Background Lemann (b. 1954-), first worked as a journalist in his natal city, New Orleans. He worked for the Washington Monthly, The Washington Post, and the Texas Monthly. Over his long career in journalism, he contributed to a number of national magazines in the United States, including The Atlantic Monthly and The New Yorker. He also served as dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. In 1991 he wrote The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How It Changed America Description Lemann's book, which was described by David Leonhardt in his New York Times review as a sequel to William H. Whyte's 1956 The Organization Man, is a \\"story about a battle of ideas between the people who built postwar American culture and their critics, like Whyte.\\" Babinder Bradley's review in NPR said that the \\"broad strokes\\" in Transaction Man reflect the narrative that explains why the economy failed post 2008‚Äîa narrative that was made familiar through Michael Lewis's book The Big Short and the film based on the book directed by Adam McKay. Bradley said that Transaction Man \\"seeks to put the turn that led us there into context and take a look at where things have gone since.\\" Babinder described how Transaction Man provides the \\"top-down\\" worldviews of Adolf A. Berle Jr. (1895 ‚Äì 1971), Michael C. Jensen (born November 30, 1939), and LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman (born August 5, 1967)‚Äîwho were the epitomes of the seismic changes that they helped create‚Äîand supplements these views by \\"detailing the on-the-ground stories of those who lived the consequences.\\" For example, he includes \\"stories of people living in the Chicago neighborhood of Chicago Lawn, who were impacted by Jensen, the economist \\"whose theories undergirded much of the financialization in the 20th century, representative of the Transaction Man.\\" In Chapter 1, \\"Institution man\\", Lemann began by describing some of the early policies and laws that limited the power of big business, including the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and the 1911 Supreme Court ruling to dismantle the Standard Oil Company for violation of federal antitrust law. John D. Rockefeller, who had founded in 1870, who some consider to be the wealthiest American of all time, and the richest person in modern history. Lemann devotes much of chapter 1, to the life and work of Adolf A. Berle Jr. (1895 ‚Äì 1971) who introduced a revised theory of the firm, as described in The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932) ‚Äîa detailed empirical study with \\"statistical evidence\\" provided by Gardiner Means. In 'The Modern Corporation, revealed \\"how big and powerful corporations had become\\". and that the control of corporations‚Äîwhose shares were held by many shareholders‚Äîwas in the hands of managers who owned very little equity in the corporation. Lemann described Berle's Modern Corporation, which \\"became a classic almost instantly\\", as the \\"main intellectual achievement of Berle‚Äôs life.\\" Lehman described how Berle's book differed from earlier publications about corporations‚ÄîThorstein Veblen's Absentee Ownership: Business Enterprise in Recent Times (1923), and William Z. Ripley's Main Street and Wall Street (1927). These two books \\"were essentially hostile to corporations\\" and focused on \\"shenanigans\\", according to Lemann, whereas Berle combined a \\"much broader historical and social perspective\\" along with detailed statistical evidence. As well, The Modern Corporation was published following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 when the Great Depression was underway. Public sentiment had shifted from the glorification of achievements accomplished by corporations in the 1920s which had led to a \\"delirious moneymaking opportunity for the growing American middle class\\" to questioning of the 1920s \\"economic arrangements\\" that \\"had utterly failed and needed to be replaced.\\" Berle raised concerns that what he \\"called the corporate revolution was every bit as significant as the Industrial Revolution.\\" He warned against the concentration of power as \\"relatively small number of corporations had rapidly come to dominate the American economy.\\" Berle believed that the problem was not with finance or the big corporation itself. He wanted \\"government had to be empowered to counteract it.\\" In 1932 Berle wrote \\"The Nature of the Difficulty\\", a memorandum, in which he said that \\"for the first time in its history the federal government had to assume responsibility for the economic condition of the country.\\" Berle called for \\"dramatic new measures\\" which included \\"pumping more money into the economy through tax cuts; offering government guarantees of job security and of savings deposited in banks; creating a new federal agency that would regulate the stock market; developing a new system of federal old-age pensions and health and unemployment insurance; and relaxing the antitrust laws and the traditional restrictions on the size of banks in exchange for imposing greater regulation on them.\\" He presented his ideas to Franklin D. Roosevelt. According to Lemann, it was Berle and his wife Beatrice who wrote the September 23, 1932 speech that President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco‚Äîthe \\"blueprint for the enormous change in the American political order, which the public hadn't yet started calling the New Deal.\\" Roosevelt implemented the New Deal during the Great Depression, worst economic crisis in U.S. history. Through time, Berle's theories would be revised by John Maynard Keynes, whose 1936 publication The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money proposed a \\"new and more technical way for government to solve economic problems: by managing interest rates, the money supply, and the overall level of government spending.\\" During World War II, Roosevelt instituted \\"Berle-style policies that would have been inconceivable during the 1930s. It was directly setting the prices of consumer goods and telling General Motors and U.S. Steel and the others exactly what to produce in their factories.\\" In 1952, John Kenneth Galbraith, one of Berle's prot√©g√©s and \\" the leading champion of the liberal idea that the corporation, properly handled, could provide the economic foundation for a benign social order\\", published his book American Capitalism. During WWII Galbraith worked in Washington as an economist where in an administration that \\"directly intervened in the economic lives of big companies.\\" In 1960, Berle speaking to a group of students, acknowledged dissenting voices. At the University of Chicago, the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek, was the key right wing figure with a \\"passionate band of followers\\" who agreed with Hayek's \\"view that markets did a far better job than governments of responding to changing conditions.\\" Hayek felt that the power of the government should be to respond to \\"perceived social needs\\" only. A government that did more than that \\"represented an unpardonable step in the direction of totalitarianism.\\" Hayek's book, The Road to Serfdom sold millions of copies. The book warned that giving government increasing economic control over the means of production, would lead to totalitarian governments such as those of Nazi Germany, fascist Italy, and Joseph Stalin. Berle felt that Hayek's concerns were in response to the Nazis taking over Austria. Berle said there was no danger of totalitarianism in the United States. Berle then discussed the arguments from social critics on the left. They were preoccupied with the corporation and saw it as a \\"kind of disease to be overcome rather than an unstoppable force to be managed.\\" David Riesman's 1950 influential publication The Lonely Crowd said that corporations had transformed the United States from a country of \\"independent individuals into one of company men for whom the need for approval was an 'insatiable force.' In his 1951 book White Collar, C. Wright Mills described the middle class as the \\"minion of management. You are the cog and the beltline of the bureaucratic machinery itself.\\" In his 1948 highly-influential textbook Economics which was written in the wake of the Great Depression and the Second World War, Paul Samuelson, popularized the work of John Maynard Keynes and was \\"highly skeptical of Berle-style planning\\" and Galbraith's theories. Lemann said that the Council of Economic Advisers‚Äîa \\"permanent office in the White House\\"‚Äîconsisted mainly of academic economists focused on how \\"well markets functioned rather than how much power corporations\\". In the introduction of his 1959 book, The Corporation in Modern Society‚Äîa \\"symposium of essays\\" by a number of authors, about the way in which large corporations have contributed to American life, the editor Edward Mason, said that, \\"Innovation at the hands of the small-scale inventor and individual entrepreneur has given way to organized research. The role of government in the economy persistently increases. The rugged individualist has been supplanted by smoothly efficient corporate executives participating in the group decision. The equity owner is joining the bond holder as a functionless rentier.\\" The Corporation examined the role, responsibility, and selection of corporate managers and the degree of their power within their firm. They looked for similarities between the structure of government agencies and corporations and they compared the role corporations in the United States with corporations in Great Britain and the Soviet Union. Reviews and responses The review by Sebastian Mallaby in The Atlantic said it was an \\"elegant history\\". Mallaby reviewed Lemann's Transaction Man to Binyamin Appelbaum's The Economists‚Äô Hour. He said that they both \\"contribute to the second wave of post-2008 commentary.\\" Business Insider included an excerpt of Transaction Man on September 10, 2019 in their series on \\"Better Capitalism: The key to future economic growth is about more than just increasing shareholder value\\", a series overseen by Richard Feloni that explores \\"ways companies and individuals are \\"creating sustainable long-term value\\", not just \\"chasing quarterly results\\". The title of the accompanying article by Lemann reads, \\"The 'Organization Man' of the mid-20th century gave way to the 'Transaction Man,' and the latter's rise explains the decline of the American Dream.\\" In his review in the Wall Street Journal, Barton Swain disagreed with Lemann's \\"central argument‚Äîthat free-market theorists undermined the New Deal settlement and so unleashed chaos on the American economy.\\" Swain said that Lemann did not credit the \\"high-tax, tightly regulated economy dominated by a few giant unionized corporations\\" with the \\"extraordinary advantages afforded to the American economy in the 1950s and 1960s\\" which contrasted sharply with economies in Western Europe, Japan, Eastern Europe, China, and India. According to Swain, Lemann over-stressed the influence of the American economist, Michael Jensen's 1976 paper, Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure, which he co-authored with William H. Meckling. 'Theory of the Firm was one of the most widely cited economics papers of the last 40 years, it implied the theory of the public corporation as an ownerless entity, made up of only contractual relationships, a field pioneered by Ronald Coase. Swain said that the period from 1981‚Äì2008‚Äîwhat Conservatives call the \\"Reagan Revolution\\"‚Äîcame about because the post-WWII economic policies had become \\"untenable\\" by the 1970s. Swain called that economic approach, a \\"distant dream\\" in 2019, appealing only to democratic socialists. Swain also faults Lemann for not neglecting to mention Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)‚ÄîFannie Mae and its brother institution Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)‚ÄîFreddie Mac and the damage inflicted by the government by \\"treating financial institutions as too big to fail.\\" See also *The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1931) by Adolf A.

This house features a mixture of architectural styles and is a two-story, private residency, which is sometimes open to the public.  History  The house building starting in 1877 and was completed by 1882. Built by Willamette Arnett (1848‚Äì1901), heir to Anthony Arnett, one of the founders of the Boulder Land and Trust Company. Arnett-Fullen House featured one of Boulder's earliest indoor bathrooms, central heating, and cold running water systems. The St. Louis, Missouri-based architect, George E. King (1852‚Äì1912) designed the house. This house design features a mixture of architectural styles including Gothic Revival, Victorian, Carpenter Gothic, Second Empire, and Italianate styles and featuring farmhouse aesthetics and the use of cast iron throughout. During the Klondike Gold Rush, Willamette Arnett died in Dawson City. After Arnett's death, the house was then sold. The house was acquired by Hiram Fullen and the Fullen family around 1914, after there were many stories of spirits in the house and hauntings. Arnett-Fullen House was referenced as a model of a \\"gingerbread house\\" in the Marlys Millhiser horror novel, The Mirror (1978).

Carlson, \\"Charles Poyen Brings Mesmerism to America\\", Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, XV(2), 1960 (121‚Äì132), 121‚Äì122. Mesmerism was named after Franz Anton Mesmer, a German physician who argued in 1779 for the existence of a fluid that fills space and through which bodies could influence each other, a force he called animal magnetism.Craig Hazen, The Village Enlightenment in America: Popular Religion and Science in the Nineteenth Century, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2000, 118. Early life Born in France, Poyen studied medicine in Paris. In 1832, while still a student, he fell ill with what he called a \\"a very complicated nervous disease\\" and turned for help to a Dr. Chapelain. The doctor employed a woman, Madame Villetard, who presented herself as a \\"somnambulist\\" (clairvoyant). After being put in a trance by Chapelain, Villetard reportedly described Poyen's symptoms exactly, including which food and drink agreed with him, which convinced him to investigate mesmerism. Poyen had further experiences of mesmerism during a visit to his family's sugar plantation in Martinique and Guadeloupe in the French West Indies.Charles Poyen, Progress of Animal Magnetism in New England, Boston: Weeks, Jordan & Co., 1837, 39‚Äì41. Lecturing In 1834 Poyen decided to move to the United States for the climate and sailed from Pointe-√†-Pitre, Guadaloupe, arriving in Portland, Maine. After staying for five months with an uncle in Haverhill, Massachusetts, he moved to Lowell, where he taught French and drawing.Poyen 1837, 41‚Äì42. In January 1836 he began lecturing about mesmerism in and around Boston; as word spread, people would volunteer to be treated by him. The following month, the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal (BMSJ) published extracts from Poyen's second lecture: Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (left), briefly a follower of Poyen, putting Lucius Burkmar in a trance. > The person who is to be magnetized is placed in the sitting position ... The > magnetizer, sitting on a little higher seat, before his face, and at about a > foot distant ... holds the thumbs of the patient, and remains in this > position until he feels that the same degree of heat is established between > the thumbs of that person and his own. Then he draws off his hands in > turning them outwards, and places them upon the shoulders for nearly a > minute. Afterwards he carries them down slowly, by a sort of friction very > light, along the arms, down to the extremities of the fingers. He begins > again the same motion five or six times; it is what magnetizers call passes. > Then he passes his hands over the head, keeps them there a few moments, > brings them down in passing before the face, at the distance of one or two > inches, to the epigastrium ... And he thus comes down slowly along the body, > to the feet.Carlson 1960, 124.\\"M. Poyen's Lectures on Animal Magnetism\\", > Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, 14(1), 10 February 1836 (8‚Äì12), 8‚Äì9. Poyen said that his effect on patients differed: sometimes they felt calmer, sometimes more agitated, sometimes hot or cold, sometimes there was pain. But \\"[a]lmost always the patient feels relieved of his usual pain, and sometimes the symptoms of the existing sickness cease as by a charm.\\" Poyen believed this demonstrated the existence of a \\"magnetical agent\\".Poyen 1836, 10. The BMSJ described Poyen: \\"In person, Dr. Poyen was of a middle height; rather slender, yet well formed. Nearly one half of his face was covered, or rather discolored, by a naevus, of a dark-red hue, which greatly modified the natural expression. The cranial region for firmness was raised quite high enough to indicate obstinacy. He was habitually grave, thoughtful, industrious and studious, but not a close reasoner, nor by any means an original or profound thinker. Whatever was marvellous or extraordinary engaged his earnest consideration, particularly if it could be dragged into the service of the dearest of all interests‚Äîanimal magnetism.\\" Among those listening to Poyen lecture in 1837 in Belfast, Maine, was Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, at the time a watchmaker, later a self-described \\"mentalist\\" and founder of the New Thought movement. (In the 1860s Quimbly strongly influenced Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, who believed he had healed her.) According to Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine, writing for McClure's in 1907, Quimby was so excited by Poyen's lectures that he \\"followed him from town to town\\".Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993 [1909], 45.Also see Robert C. Fuller, Mesmerism and the American Cure of Souls, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1982, 119. Quimby hired an assistant, Lucius Burkmar, and from 1843‚Äì1847 put him in trances in front of audiences; Burkmar would purport to read minds and diagnose the audience's illnesses.Cather and Milmine 1993, 46‚Äì48. Later, when he had changed his mind about mesmerism, deciding instead that he was witnessing the power of suggestion, Quimby said he had heard just one of Poyen's lectures and had \\"pronounced it a humbug as a matter of course\\".Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, \\"Lecture Notes\\", in Erwin Seale (ed.), The Complete Writings, Volume I, Marina del Rey: Devorss and Company, 1988, (59‚Äì151), 103; Hazen 2000, 173, note 9. Death Poyen returned to France and died in Bordeaux in 1844, just as he about to sail back to the United States. \\"Having sown the seed,\\" the BMSJ wrote, \\"... a mighty host of animal magnetizers sprung up in a trice; they swarmed throughout the length and breadth of the northern States, like locusts; but having used up the resources of their silly admirers, and devoured the green leaves of vulgar Popularity, they gradually died away, one after another, and have now become, in vulgar parlance, the laughing stock of every commonsense community. After the manner of Lycurgus, when he had fairly imposed his system of laws upon the Spartans, Dr. P. left the Continent; and when on the point of returning to ascertain the workings of the machinery he had set in motion, death dropped the curtain, and his career on earth was closed forever.\\" Selected works *Husson, M., Charles Poyen, David K.

(September 12, 1871 ‚Äì February 26, 1948) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit, who served in many senior positions at Jesuit universities in the United States. Born in Massachusetts, he attended Boston College, and studied for the priesthood in Maryland and Austria. He taught at Fordham University and then at Georgetown University, where he was made Dean of Georgetown College in 1909, and simultaneously served as principal of Georgetown Preparatory School. Creeden became president of Georgetown University in 1918. Largely shaped by the First World War, during his presidency, the School of Foreign Service was founded, for which he was awarded the Medal of Public Instruction from the President of Venezuela. In order to support the post-war enrollment boom, he also expanded the size of the campus, and established the university's first endowment, to support major campus improvements. He proposed a transformation of the campus that would involve building a new quadrangle of neo-Gothic buildings, but this vision was thwarted by the Depression of 1921. Creeden undertook a major reform of the university's organization, which included relocating Georgetown Preparatory School to a new campus, installing Jesuit regents to oversee each of the professional schools, and placing the Law School under his direct control, where he initiated a drastic improvement in the school's curriculum and admissions standards. Following the end of his presidency in 1924, he returned to Boston College, where he briefly became Dean of the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, before founding Boston College Law School in 1926 and serving as its first regent until 1939. At the same time, he served as regent of Georgetown Law School from 1929 to 1939. In his final years, he was a spiritual counselor at Jesuit schools in Western Massachusetts, and then became Dean of Boston College's Evening Division, which later became the Woods College of Advancing Studies.  Early life  John B. Creeden was born on September 12, 1871, in Arlington, Massachusetts, to Irish immigrant parents. He attended Boston College, before entering the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Frederick, Maryland, on August 14, 1890. He taught at Georgetown from 1897 to 1902, and then returned to Woodstock College to study philosophy and theology; he also spent time studying in Linz, Austria. At Woodstock, he was ordained a priest by Cardinal James Gibbons in 1905. He then spent two years teaching at Fordham University in New York City. In 1909, he was made athletic director and prefect of studies at Georgetown, before being appointed as Dean of Georgetown College later that year. During part of his tenure as dean, he also served as principal of Georgetown Preparatory School. On February 2, 1910, he was conferred the rank of in the Society of Jesus. Upon being named president of the university, he was succeeded as dean by Edmund A. Walsh.  President of Georgetown University  alt=Closeup portrait of John B. Creeden Creeden was named president of Georgetown University in May 1918, succeeding Alphonsus J. Donlon. In 1918, with the Spanish flu making its way toward Washington, Creeden resurrected the St. Joseph's Lamp Association, which was responsible for keeping a lamp burning in front of a statue of St. Joseph in a garden between Gervase Hall, Mulledy Hall, and Old South. Creeden received Ferdinand Foch, the French marshal and Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies, on November 20, 1921, and presented him with an honorary Doctor of Civil and Canon Laws degree, as well as a golden sword on behalf of the American Jesuits. He voiced his opposition in 1921 to the Smith‚ÄìTowner Bill, which was an unsuccessful attempt to create the U.S. Department of Education, because he believed it was both unconstitutional and unwise for the federal government to assert control over education. In the summer of 1923, Creeden developed phlebitis, which severely impacted his ability to discharge the office. By early 1924, he felt that he was no longer able to fulfill his duties, and Charles W. Lyons was named as his successor in late October 1924. = Campus improvements = Following the end of the First World War, enrollment in all of Georgetown's schools increased greatly, especially in the Medical, Dental, and Law Schools. This put the existing facilities under significant strain. Creeden responded by buying up property bounded by 35th, 37th, P, and N Streets, adjacent to the main campus. He also sought to enhance the national reputation of the university by creating a Georgetown Publicity Bureau. Together with these concrete improvements, he established an endowment association, whose goal was to raise $5 million in two years, equivalent to $ million in . This represented the first time in Georgetown's history that an endowment was sought. The most ambitious of Creeden's visions was a vast expansion of the built campus known as the \\"Greater Georgetown Plan\\". This would involve constructing a new neo-Gothic quadrangle composed of several buildings on the site of the existing athletic field next to Healy Hall. This quadrangle would be a new home for the Medical and Dental Schools, a dormitory, a classroom building, and a science building. Creeden also planned to build a stadium nearby that could hold twenty thousand spectators. This grand plan never came to fruition because the Depression in 1921 made funding unavailable. = Separation of Georgetown Preparatory School = At the commencement ceremony of 1919, Creeden announced that Georgetown Preparatory School would move to a separate campus at the start of the following academic year. Construction of the North Bethesda, Maryland campus was begun under his predecessor, Donlon. The purpose of this relocation was to remove the younger students from what the Jesuits viewed as the indecent temptations of the city. It was also part of the larger movement among Jesuit institutions in the United States, facing pressure from the Association of American Universities, to create separate four-year high school programs and four-year college programs, instead of combined seven-year programs. Despite the move away from Georgetown's collegiate campus, Creeden continued to take an active interest in the administration of the preparatory school, frequently visiting and meeting with the headmaster to set policies. = School of Foreign Service established = Following the renaming of Georgetown's School of Foreign Service for Edmund A. Walsh in 1958, Henri Wiesel, a Jesuit contemporary and acquaintance of both Creeden and Walsh, wrote to the archivist of Georgetown University that, though Walsh was instrumental in the creation of the school, the true founder of the School of Foreign Service was Creeden. He said that Creeden envisioned the establishment of such a school and frequently discussed the subject, at a time when Walsh was still studying theology as part of his Jesuit formation. His motivation for the creation of the school was to bring the Society of Jesus into contact with prominent men in government and finance. President alt=Calvin Coolidge addressing Georgetown graduates in front of Healy Hall Creeden sought to establish the school at the start of his presidency, but this goal was delayed by the First World War. Another Jesuit contemporary verified that Creeden worked closely with Fr. Constantine McGuire to present the plan for the School of Foreign service to the board of regents in June 1918. Opening in 1919, the school quickly became well received in government circles in Washington, and Creeden sought to establish an endowment for it. He recruited Walsh, whose personality was more suited to public life, to recruit faculty and students and to be the face of the school, and appointed him as the first regent of the school. In recognition of Creeden's role in the founding of the School of Foreign Service, the President of Venezuela, Victorino M√°rquez Bustillos, awarded him the Medal of Public Instruction in 1920, the highest educational honor bestowed by Venezuela on a foreign citizen. He was presented with the award during the Venezuelan Minister of Public Education's visit to Washington. = Law School reform = alt=Georgetown Law School between 1910 and 1925 The Association of American Law Schools (AALS) gave Georgetown Law School a quality rating of B, prompting Creeden to undertake a major reorganization of the governance of the school. In the spring of 1920, he obtained the consent of the board of regents to effectively terminate the semi-autonomous status of the law school, bringing it under closer control of the university leadership. This involved appointing a Jesuit regent to ensure the school was conforming to the tradition and mission of the university (a reform Creeden and a later president, Coleman Nevils, implemented at all of the university's professional schools), and creating an executive faculty that consisted of the president, the dean of the law school, and six professors chosen by the president. In order to improve the quality of the school, he also had new bylaws adopted, which significantly raised the standards for admission to the law school. Applicants were required to have at least completed four years of high school. By 1925, this standard was raised to require at least two years of college, with courses in history, economics, political science, ethics, logic, and rhetoric. With the support of Dean George E. Hamilton, in October 1921, day classes were offered for the first time (while until then, there were evening classes designed for part- time students), and several full-time professors were hired to supplement the part-time faculty that maintained active law practices. Evening students were required to study for four years, instead of the previous three. These reforms resulted in the AALS upgrading Georgetown's rating to an A in 1925. Creeden and other administrators anticipated a decrease in enrollment due to these heightened standards, but this decrease was smaller than expected, and returned to previous levels within several years.  Later years  Creeden (far right) at the 1938 Jesuit alt=Five Jesuits at the 1938 General Congregation Creeden then went to Boston College, where he taught philosophy from 1924 to 1926. In 1926, he was appointed Dean of the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences. He then founded the Boston College Law School, and served as its first regent from 1926 to 1939. At the same time, he became the regent of Georgetown Law School in 1929, and held this position for ten years. Following his law school deanships, he served as spiritual counselor from 1939 to 1942 at Cranwell Preparatory School in Lenox, Massachusetts, and from 1942 to 1947 at Shadowbrook, the Jesuit novitiate in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. He also became the first Dean of the Boston College Evening Division, which later became the Woods College of Advancing Studies. On February 26, 1948, Creeden died in Boston.

History On February 27, 1965, the Direct-subordinate Artillery Regiment of Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps () was incorporated by the veterans from Shenyang Military Region, Beijing Military Region, Nanjing Military Region and the surviving family members of the veterans, and two production teams from the former Direct-managed Farm of the XPPC Agency (), Hongshan Branch of Bayi Livestock Farm of Shihezi Business Management (), Construction Brigade of Shihezi Management Service (), the Sideline Team of Bingtuan Agricultural College (). On May 22 of the same year, it was renamed the Independent Regiment of Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps () and was directly under the leadership of the Corps. In January 1969, the Shihezi Command of the Corps () was established, and the Independent Regiment was under its control. In August of that year, the Manas River Basin Management Office of the Corps () was incorporated into Water Conservancy Project Battalion () and later upgraded to Water Conservancy Project Regiment () in April 1971, under the command of Shihezi Command of the Corps. In September 1970, the 165th Regiment () was relocated to Emin County, the Hongshan portion of the Independent Regiment as its 3rd Battalion. With the abolishment of Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps in March 1975, the Independent Regiment of the Corps was transferred to Shihezi Prefecture (), and renamed as the Independent Regiment of Shihezi City. In December 1978, after the dissolution of Wuqi Farm (), its 5th and 7th companies were handed over to the Independent Regiment. In August 1978, Shihezi Prefecture was abolished, the Shihezi Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Joint Enterprise Group Corporation () was established, with a Shihezi City co-office. In December 1981, the XPCC's structure was restored and, in May 1982, the 8th Agricultural Construction Division was restored in Shihezi City. The Independent Regiment was under the 8th Agricultural Construction Division. On February 6, 1984, the Independent Regiment changed its name to the present 152nd Regiment. In August 2003, the 152nd Regiment established Xinjiang Baiyang Industrial (Group) Co., Ltd. (), with the administrative leadership of the 152 regiments as the same leadership team.

Written by vocalist Glenn Danzig, the song was first released as a live recording on their 1982 album Walk Among Us. A studio recording of the song was later released alongside the track \\"We Bite\\" as the B-side of the 1984 single \\"Die, Die My Darling\\". \\"Mommy, Can I Go Out & Kill Tonight\\" was later included on the 1986 compilation album Misfits (also known as Collection I), the cassette and CD releases of the album Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood, and the 1996 boxed set The Misfits. Background and release \\"Mommy, Can I Go Out & Kill Tonight\\" was first released on the Misfits' debut album Walk Among Us, released in March 1982 by Ruby Records, an imprint of Slash Records. This version of the song was recorded live on December 17, 1981 at the Ritz in New York City, and is the only live track on the album. In July 1983, the song was re-recorded at Fox Studio in Rutherford, New Jersey, and this version was included alongside the track \\"We Bite\\" as the B-side of the single \\"Die, Die My Darling\\", which was released in May 1984 through Danzig's own label, Plan 9 Records. Although they were not included on the original LP version of Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood, all three songs from the \\"Die, Die My Darling\\" single (including the studio version of \\"Mommy, Can I Go Out & Kill Tonight\\") were included on the album when it was first released on cassette in 1988 and on CD in 1992. The song was also included on the 1986 compilation album Misfits (also known as Collection I), which would later be included in the 1996 boxed set The Misfits. Critical reception Aaron Lariviere of Stereogum ranked \\"Mommy, Can I Go Out & Kill Tonight\\" No. 10 on his list of the 10 best Misfits songs, writing that the song's opening \\"leads into one of the best Misfits moments ever when the song lurches to a sudden stop. Everything hangs for a second before Danzig screams the title [...] and we bash our way through the song in double-time.\\" Chris Krovatin of Kerrang! included the song on his list of the 13 \\"best songs about mothers\\", calling it a \\"breakneck Misfits classic\\". In his book This Music Leaves Stains: The Complete Story of the Misfits, author James Greene, Jr. writes of the song and its inclusion on Walk Among Us: \\"Curiously enough, the Misfits chose to break up their debut's slick presentation midway through with a very rough live recording of the proto- speed metal half-joke 'Mommy, Can I Go Out & Kill Tonight?'

Implementation techniques of distribution-free control charts do not require any knowledge about the underlying process distribution or its parameters. The main advantage of distribution-free control charts is its in-control robustness, in the sense that, irrespective of the nature of the underlying process distributions, the properties of these control charts remain same when the process is smoothly operating without presence of any assignable cause. Early evidence of research on nonparametric control charts may be found in 1981 when P.K. Bhattacharya and D. Frierson introduced a nonparametric control chart for detecting small disorders. However, major growth of nonparametric control charting schemes has taken place only in the recent years.  Popular distribution-free control charts  There are distribution-free control charts for both Phase-I analysis and Phase-II monitoring. One of the most notable distribution-free control chart for Phase-I analysis is RS/P chart proposed by G. Capizzi and G. Masaratto. RS/P chart separately monitor location and scale parameters of a univariate process using two separate charts. In 2019, Chenglong Li, Amitava Mukherjee and Qin Su proposed a single distribution-free control chart for Phase-I analysis using multisample Lepage statistic. Some popular Phase-II distribution-free control charts for univariate continuous processes includes: * Sign charts based on the sign statistic \\\\- used to monitor location parameter of a process *Wilcoxon rank-sum charts based on the Wilcoxon rank- sum test \\\\- used to monitor location parameter of a process *Control charts based on precedence or exceedance statistic * Shewhart-Lepage chart based on the Lepage test \\\\- used to monitor both location and scale parameters of a process simultaneously in a single chart * Shewhart-Cucconi chart based on the Cucconi test \\\\- used to monitor both location and scale parameters of a process simultaneously in a single chart References Category:Statistical charts and diagrams Category:Quality control tools ","title":"Distribution-free control chart"},{"id":"61797937","text":"David T.

He was referred to as the \\"Mayor of Central Avenue\\" and a section of Main Street is named for him. Born in 1915 in Alapaha, Georgia, his parents were Tom White and Mary Shepard White. He was the seventh of 11 children. He received an education up to the third grade. By the 1950s, he owned businesses on Central Avenue and Main Street including the Palm Dinette (Tampa‚Äôs first sit-down restaurant for people of color), a rooming house, the Deluxe Cozy Corner, and Club Rayals. Known for its BBQ ribs, fried chicken sandwich and yellow rice, the Deluxe Cozy Corner offered three hotdogs for 25 cents and served the local community and military from MacDill Air Force Base. A civil rights leader, Moses' calming nature led to an important role in the 1967 Tampa race riots. He fed first responders and rioters, while calling for peace and facilitating conversations. White knew that the success of his community required engagement and advocacy that he could provide. He worked closely with government leaders to build a Veteran‚Äôs Administration Hospital for Tampa‚Äôs veterans so that they wouldn‚Äôt have to travel to St. Petersburg for treatment. He built a sense of community through events such as Easter egg hunts, Thanksgiving turkey giveaways and Christmas food baskets. White was honored by the Bay Area National Conference of Christians and Jews Brotherhood Awards Dinner in the 1970s community organizing. Following his death, parts of Main Street were renamed Moses White Boulevard in 2001 and an affordable housing development, the Moses White Estates, was named in his honor in 2011. He worked in the community until his death in 1984. The Moses White Foundation was created, in his honor, to support underprivileged populations in Tampa.

This is one of the most famous rank tests for the two-sample location-scale problem. The Lepage test statistic is the squared Euclidean distance of standardized Wilcoxon rank-sum test for location and the standardized Ansari‚ÄìBradley test for scale. The Lepage test was first introduced by Yves Lepage in 1971 in a paper in Biometrika. A large number of Lepage-type tests exists in statistical literature for simultaneously testing location and scale shifts in case-control studies. The details may be found in the book: Nonparametric statistical tests: A computational approach. K√∂ssler, W. in 2006 also introduced various Lepage type tests using some alternative score functions optimal for various distributions. Dr. Amitava Mukherjee and Dr. Marco Marozzi introduced a class of percentile modified version of the Lepage test. An alternative to the Lepage-type tests is known as the Cucconi test proposed by Odoardo Cucconi in 1968.  Conducting the Lepage test with R, an open-source software  Practitioners can apply the Lepage test using the pLepage function of the contributory package NSM3, built under R software. Andreas Schulz and Markus Neuh√§user also provided detailed R code for computation of test statistic and p-value of the Lepage test for the users.  Application in statistical process monitoring  In recent years, Lepage statistic is widely used statistical process monitoring and quality control. In a classical development, in 2012, Amitava Mukherjee, an Indian statistician, and Subhabrata Chakraborti, an American statistician of Indian origin, introduced a distribution-free Shewhart-type Phase-II monitoring scheme (control chart) for simultaneously monitoring of location and scale parameter of a process using a test sample of fixed size, when a reference sample of sufficiently large size is available from an in-control population. Later in 2015, the same statisticians along with Shovan Chowdhury, proposed a distribution-free CUSUM-type Phase-II monitoring scheme based on the Lepage statistic. In 2017, Mukherjee further designed an EWMA-type distribution-free Phase-II monitoring scheme for joint monitoring of location and scale. In the same year, Mukherjee, with Marco Marozzi, an Italian statistician known for promoting the Cucconi test, came together to design Circular-Grid Lepage chart ‚Äì a new type of joint monitoring scheme.  Multisample version of the Lepage test  In 2005, Franti≈°ek Rubl√¨k introduced the multisample version of the original two-sample Lepage test.

He currently holds the rank of vice-admiral, and since 2019 has served as deputy commander in chief of the navy. Born into a family with a distinguished military past, Kasatonov studied at naval institutions in Leningrad and on the Black Sea, before joining the navy's Northern Fleet. Much of his early service was spent aboard the heavy nuclear missile cruiser Kirov, rising through the ranks to eventually serve as her assistant commander. During his time with the ship he served through search and rescue operations for two Soviet submarines, the K-219 in 1986 and the Komsomolets in 1989. After service with the 5th Operational Squadron and undertaking the navy's , Kasatonov went on to take up his own commands, firstly the destroyer , and then her sister ship . After further study at the Naval Academy, he was appointed head of the department of the mobilization at the Northern Fleet headquarters, before becoming captain of the battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy in 2000. It was during exercises in August 2000, led by the admiral aboard the Pyotr Velikiy, that the submarine K-141 Kursk suffered a fatal accident and sank. Kasatonov's ship was the first to locate the stricken submarine sixteen hours after her sinking and became the command ship for the recovery efforts. He continued in command of Pyotr Velikiy until 2005, having been promoted to rear-admiral during this period. He then took up staff positions with the Northern Fleet's missile ship division and carried out several long distance voyages with divisions of ships. He became chief of staff and first deputy commander of the Pacific Fleet in 2012, and in 2016 took up the position of head of the Naval Academy. This was followed by his posting in 2019 to be deputy commander in chief of the navy. He has received numerous medals over his career, as well as the Orders of Military Merit and Naval Merit. His life, as well as those of his relatives, is commemorated in a museum in Belenikhino, Belgorod Oblast. Family and early career Admiral of the Fleet and Hero of the Soviet Union Vladimir Afanasyevich Kasatonov Kasatonov was born in Moscow, part of the Russian SFSR in the Soviet Union on 17 June 1962. He was born into a military family with strong connections to the naval service. His great-grandfather Afanasy Stepanovich was a non-commissioned officer who received the Order of St. George while serving with the Uhlan Regiment of Her Imperial Majesty Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. Afanasy's son, and Vladimir Lvovich's grandfather, Vladimir Afanasyevich, served in the Soviet Navy, rose to the rank of admiral of the fleet, and was awarded Hero of the Soviet Union. Vladimir Afanasyevich's son, and Vladimir Lvovich's uncle, , reached the rank of admiral and commanded the Black Sea Fleet before serving as First Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. Kasatonov entered the in Leningrad in 1977, and then from 1979 studied at the , graduating in 1984 with a gold medal. His active service began with the Northern Fleet, with the missile division of the armament section of the heavy nuclear missile cruiser Kirov. Over the next three years his group receiving ratings of 'excellent'. While serving aboard the Kirov in 1986, Kasatonov took part in the crew rescue operations for the submarine K-219, which had suffered a fire before sinking in the North Atlantic. In September 1987 he was appointed commander of the Kirovs missile division, and in February 1988 he was promoted to the rank of captain- lieutenant, one and a half years ahead of schedule. In September 1988 he was appointed assistant commander of the Kirov and in April 1989 participated in the rescue of the crew of the nuclear submarine Komsomolets, which sank in the Barents Sea after suffering a fire on board. First commands The damaged K-129 shortly before her sinking Between 1990 and 1991 he served in the Mediterranean Sea with the 5th Operational Squadron and in July 1991 graduated from the and was appointed senior assistant commander of the Sovremenny-class destroyer . In May 1993 he made a port visit to the United Kingdom aboard the Gremyashchy and from April 1994 was the senior assistant to the commander of the destroyer , becoming her commander in December 1994. He entered the Naval Academy in September 1997, graduating with honours in June 1999, and was appointed head of the department of mobilization at the Northern Fleet headquarters. =Pyotr Velikiy and Kursk= Between March 2000 to July 2005 Kasatonov was captain of the battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy. It was during the Northern Fleet's annual exercises in the Barents Sea in August 2000 that the Oscar II-class submarine K-141 Kursk suffered a fatal accident and sank. The exercises, which began on 11 August, were the largest Russian naval exercises since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. More than thirty warships took part, overseen by the commander of the Northern Fleet, Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, with the Pyotr Velikiy as his flagship. On the morning of 12 August, the Kursk was scheduled to make a dummy torpedo attack on the Pyotr Velikiy. During preparations for the attack, the Kursk suffered an explosion and fire in her torpedo room, followed by a second larger explosion that sank her. Kasatonov's sonar operators aboard the Pyotr Velikiy reported the sounds of two explosions from the vicinity of the Kursk, and when the submarine failed to report in as scheduled, search operations began. At 4:30 AM local time, five hours after the search began, and sixteen hours after the submarine had sunk, Pyotr Velikiys sonar detected the wreck of the Kursk lying at some from Severomorsk. Rescue operations began, co-ordinated by Admiral Popov aboard the Pyotr Velikiy. By this time the survivors of the explosion were probably already dead. Kasatonov and the Pyotr Velikiy guarded the site of the wreck during rescue and then salvage efforts until October 2000. The battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy, Kasatonov's command between 2000 and 2005 In October 2000, the Pyotr Velikiy was declared the best ship of the Northern Fleet. During an inspection visit by Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov in April 2002, Kasatonov was presented with a watch. Kasatonov was promoted to rear-admiral on 21 February 2003. In March 2004 Kasatonov was criticized for the condition of the Pyotr Velikiy by navy commander-in-chief Fleet Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov. Kuroyedov, who ordered the Pyotr Velikiy to put into port, was quoted as saying \\"In those places on board where the admirals actually go, everything's fine, but where they don't go, everything's in such a state it could go sky high at any minute... And by that I also mean the state of the nuclear reactor.\\" He later denied there was any threat from the nuclear reactor. Observers noted that the comments probably reflected in-fighting in the naval high command, where Kuroyedov was under pressure after a series of accidents, including the loss of the Kursk and the foundering of the K-159 in August 2003.

Hallvard Ophuus Devold (born 8 November 1898 , died 10 September 1957) was a Norwegian Arctic explorer, trapper and meteorologist. He was instrumental in the attempt to establish Eric the Red's Land in 1931. His brother Finn Devold (1902 - 1957) shared his vision and helped to establish a Norwegian station at Finnsbu, SE Greenland.Hallvard Devold - Polarhistorie.no - Norsk Polarinstitutt Biography Hallvard graduated from the University of Oslo in 1920. He worked as a meteorological assistant at the Haldde Observatory in Alta until 1922. He went for the first time to the Arctic in the summer of 1922 as a coal mining technician in Svalbard. On the following winter he took a radio telegraphy course, and in the spring of 1923 he was hired as a meteorology assistant and radio telegraphist at the Kvadehuken station in Br√∏ggerhalv√∏ya by the director of the Geophysical Institute, along with his brother Finn Devold. Hallvard Devold remained on Kvadehuken until October 1924, when the station was wrapped up for financial reasons. Between 1925 and 1926 Hallvard was the head of the Norwegian radio and weather station at Jan Mayen, which was manned by three Norwegians, not including him. The island was considered no man's land at the time and the League of Nations had given Norway jurisdiction over the island. Hallvard decided to call for its annexation on behalf of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. He placed several signs around the island which read: \\"Property of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute\\". By this action the foundation was laid for the acknowledgment of Norway's right to the island of Jan Mayen in 1928. The island came under the sovereignty of Norway by royal decree of 8 May 1929 and finally became officially part of the Norwegian Kingdom on 27 February 1930.Einar-Arne Drivenes & Harald Dag J√∏lle, Norwegian Polar History, vol. 2, Oslo, 2004 Together with geologist Adolf Hoel and jurist Gustav Smedal, Hallvard became one of the main leaders of the \\"Greenland case\\" (Gr√∏nlandssaken) that tried to bring large swathes of East Greenland under Norwegian sovereignty. With Hallvard's inspiration, based on his experiences in Svalbard and Jan Mayen, the movement began to build a network of Norwegian trapping stations, combined with surveys and explorations of the almost uninhabited area. By 1929 the Norges Svalbard og Ishavsunders√∏kelser (NSIU) ‚Äî\\"Norwegian Svalbard and Arctic Ocean Survey\\", established by Hoel in 1928, sent well-organized research expeditions to East Greenland. Expedition vessels also supplied the trapping stations with equipment financed by the Arctic Trading Co. (Arktisk N√¶ringsdrift), a company that Hallvard had helped to set up.Report on the Activities of Norges Svalbard- og Ishavsunders√∏kelser 1936-1944, Norsk Polarinstitutt, Oslo 1945 In the period between 1926 and 1933 Hallvard wintered in Northeast Greenland for six years, mostly in Myggbukta Station, where he was a meteorology assistant, radio telegraphist and leader of expeditions that were undertaken with the station as a base. By 1932 about 80 cabins manned by Norwegian trappers and fishermen were built in different areas of East Greenland, including some in the distant King Frederick VI Coast and Storfjord Station in the Kangerlussuaq Fjord.Norwegian Expedition to South-East Greenland, 1932 In 1932 Norway staked sovereignty claims in areas of Northeast and Southeast Greenland where Norwegian stations had been built. The Norwegian flag was raised at Myggbukta and Finnsbu, and Helge Ingstad was named governor.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008, pp. 188-189 Denmark protested and brought the case to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. Following the 1933 resolution of the court awarding Greenland to the Danish government, Norway's claims in Greenland were given up and most Norwegian outposts were closed. However some of the stations, such as Myggbukta and Torgilsbu continued operation for a few years under Danish jurisdiction and restrictions.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008, p. 192 After leaving Greenland, Hallvard travelled to Antarctica in 1933, where he took part in the expedition of Captain Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, together with renowned skier Olav Kjelbotn, who had formerly shared East Greenland experiences with him. The expedition attempted the exploration of the Princess Ragnhild Coast by dog sled. The venture, however, was a failure and ended dramatically when all their supplies and sled dogs were unloaded on an ice floe that broke up almost immediately and began to drift.Beau Riffenburgh , Encyclopedia of the Antarctic, Taylor & Francis, 2007 At the time of World War II Hallvard volunteered for military service in the spring of 1940 and took part in the Battle of Narvik as an Allied soldier of the Foreign Legion in French uniform, but partly under Norwegian command.Frode Skarstein, ‚ÄúA cursed affair‚Äù‚Äîhow a Norwegian expedition to Greenland became the USA‚Äôs first maritime capture in World War II.

Semi- trailer truck on March 24, 1999 as it transported money from Sacramento, California to San Francisco. At some point during the transit, one or more robbers boarded the truck, cut a hole in the roof, removed approximately 2.3 million dollars, and exited the truck with the money, completely evading detection by the truck's driver and guards. The robbery was not discovered until after the truck arrived at its destination. No suspects were ever identified by authorities and the robbery is now a cold case. Even the exact tools and methods used by robber or robbers were never conclusively determined. Robbery On a rainy night at approximately 7:30 PM on March 24, 1999, a semi-trailer truck departed the Loomis Depot in Sacramento for a money transport run to the depot in San Francisco, using Interstate 80. While the cab portion of the truck was armored, the trailer carrying the money was not. The trailer was made of simple aluminum, with the only security measures being a locked door equipped with an alarm. For years, Loomis had used unarmored trailers to transport their coin shipments, figuring coins alone were such a meager amount of money that they did not require heavy security. But starting in the 1990s, Loomis began including paper money in their shipments as a cost- saving measure. Onboard was 58-year old driver Howard Brown, along with guards Frank Bettencourt and Ken Montgomery. Other than traffic lights and stop signs, the trip from Sacramento to San Francisco involved only one stop, at a truck scale in near Fairfield, California. After this, the truck proceeded on to its destination, arriving at the Loomis depot in San Francisco around 9:40 PM. Bettencourt then unlocked the rear doors, opened them up, and was shocked to discover the floor of the trailer was covered in rainwater. Then he saw a large hole in the roof, later telling the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"My eyes just kind of looked up at the ceiling of the truck. The hole had a very jagged shape with the edges pointed down into the truck. It was not a very cleanly cut hole. It had a trapdoor-type of look to it.\\" At first the guards thought the truck had been hit by lightning, or maybe even by a meteor, but this was soon ruled out as they discovered roughly 270 pounds of cash, worth about 2.3 million dollars, was missing. Bettencourt told the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"He was a Houdini in my mind. ... This is the most daring robbery I can imagine. He did this without us even having a clue. Everything that he needed to go right, did go right.\\" Investigation The subsequent criminal investigation of the robbery was handled by the FBI, which cleared the driver and guards of the truck as suspects. The FBI determined the hole in the roof had been cut from the outside, not by a stowaway hiding in the trailer. The only significant piece of evidence they found in the trailer was an old worn out Dutch military duffle bag with the initials \\"MOV\\" on it, implying that it had been issued by the Netherlands Ministry of Defense some time around the 1950s or 1960s. They also found a baggage tag on the bag from the Netherlands railroad.https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article169273532.html The FBI eventually found two witnesses who had been motorists driving behind the truck. They reported that as the truck pulled into the weight station near Fairfield, they saw a man in dark clothing jump off the truck and run through roadside fields in the direction of nearby Solano Community College. The man did not appear to be carrying anything. The robber apparently counted on the truck stopping at the scales in Cordelia, \\"something we didn't do all the time but 99 percent of the time,\\" Bettencourt said. Ultimately it was never determined exactly how many people were involved, nor how exactly they carried the robbery out. Since the trailer did not have a ladder attached to the outside, and the doors were still locked with the alarm set when it reached its destination, the primary theory is that the robbery started back in Sacramento as the truck was pulling out of the depot. It is believed that the robber or robbers jumped from the roof of the depot onto the top of the trailer. Then during the 1 hour trip between Sacramento and the truck scale near Fairfield, they cut their way through the roof, dropped down into the trailer, put the stolen money in bags, and then threw them out onto the side of the road to be retrieved later, either by themselves or by accomplices following the truck in a vehicle. Then once the truck stopped at the weight station, the robber or robbers took the opportunity to jump off the truck and make their escape. Spokesman for the FBI's Sacramento office Nick Rossi told the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"I cannot think of any similar case nationwide. It almost harkens back to train robberies.\\" Aftermath No suspects were ever found, despite the FBI investigation and Loomis offering a large money reward for leads. Shortly after the robbery, Loomis discontinued the practice of transporting paper money in unarmored trailers. In fact, they had been in the process of switching to armored trailers at the time the robbery took place. Mike Tawney, an executive vice president at Loomis, told the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"This was one of the very few we had left. ... This may have been the last truck.\\"  References  Category:1999 crimes in the United States Category:Robberies in the United States Category:1999 in California Category:1990s crimes in California Category:March 1999 crimes ","title":"1999 Loomis truck robbery"},{"id":"61798686","text":"Littlepage is a surname.

They are famous for their massive burritos, ‚ÄúManuel‚Äôs Special Burrito‚Äù and the ‚ÄúHollenbeck Burrito.‚Äù The original location is located at 812 North Evergreen Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90033. Its secondary location is located at 13131 Crossroads Pkwy S, City of Industry, CA 91746  History  El Tepeyac Caf√© is an authentic Mexican restaurant that was founded in 1942 by the Rojas family. It was originally named El Tupinamba Caf√© and was located near downtown Los Angeles. The family later relocated to the Lincoln Heights area, just north of Boyle Heights, and opened a restaurant, La Villa Caf√©. In 1952, the Rojas family relocated the restaurant to Boyle Heights, the current location of El Tepeyac Caf√©. After the death of his grandfather, Salvador Rojas, Manuel Rojas took over El Tepeyac Caf√© and built it into the historic Boyle Heights landmark it is today. Manuel was known to his loyal customers as ‚ÄúManny‚Äù or ‚ÄúDon Manuel‚Äù and is the well known creator of El Tepeyac‚Äôs most famous dishes, ‚ÄúManuel‚Äôs Special Burrito‚Äù and the ‚ÄúHollenbeck Burrito.‚Äù The restaurant also boasts other authentic Mexican dishes including chile verde, fajitas, tacos, rice, beans, and many more. However, the ‚ÄúManuel‚Äôs Special Burrito‚Äù and the ‚ÄúHollenbeck Burrito‚Äù are the most well known additions to the El Tepeyac Menu. ‚ÄúManuel‚Äôs Special Burrito‚Äù is a five pound burrito that is the star of the Manuel‚Äôs Burrito Challenge, which has been attempted by many and successfully completed by few. Manuel‚Äôs Burrito Challenge was featured on Man vs. Food. The ‚ÄúHollenbeck Burrito‚Äù is another one of El Tepeyac Cafe‚Äôs most famous dishes. It is over five pounds and contains pork, red chile, rice, beans, guacamole, and is covered with chili verde sauce. It is said that this burrito was created specifically for LAPD officers, from the local Hollenbeck Division, who often frequented El Tepeyac. In 2009, there was concern over whether or not the restaurant would stay open due to land leasing issues. The Rojas family ensured customers their famous burritos would remain a Boyle Heights staple, and the restaurant did not relocate. El Tepeyac Cafe has become a Boyle Heights staple in the years since its original conception in 1952. In 2011, the El Tepeyac craze grew as the Rojas family opened a second location near the City of Industry. On February 12, 2013, El Tepeyac‚Äôs beloved owner, Manuel Rojas, died at age 79, after a year long battle with esophageal cancer. Rojas died on a Tuesday evening at White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles. In September 2020, Manuel's grandson Carlos Thome opened a second El Tepeyac Cafe location in Pasadena. He introduced the Pasadena area to the \\"Pasadena Bowl\\" that has quickly become a fan favorite.  Copycat restaurants  In 2015, loyal El Tepeyac customers came to the restaurants defense when reports of a copycat near Syracuse, New York surfaced. This restaurant, called El Tepeyac Hacienda, was created by Sean Martinez and had nearly identical menu items, and served the iconic ‚ÄúHollenbeck Burrito,‚Äù that the original El Tepeyac was famous for. Martinez claimed he had an agreement with the late Manuel Rojas, which the Rojas family vehemently denies. In 2015, Martinez stated ‚ÄúWe have never claimed to be a franchise of the original nor do we share the same name or menu.‚Äù He also claimed his restaurant was very popular and ran out of food each day. The El Tepeyac Hacienda restaurant located in Syracuse, New York has since closed. According to the Rojas family, Martinez first attempted to open a copycat establishment in 2010 in Chino Hills, California, only about 30 miles from the original El Tepeyac location. This restaurant ended up closing in 2010, shortly after its inception.  On television  On February 18, 2009, El Tepeyac Cafe was featured in one of the Travel Channel‚Äôs most popular shows, Man vs. Food. On July 24, 2014, El Tepeyac Cafe was featured on Esquire TV‚Äôs show, Best Bars in America. On January 15, 2017, El Tepeyac Cafe was featured on the Travel Channel‚Äôs show, Food Paradise.

The dark green leaves are long and wide. The leaf edge is smooth and the leaf surface covered in star shaped hairs. The stipule a small appendage at the base of the leaf, only present on young leaves, is long and quickly shed. The flower petals are two small lobes near the ovary.

The pedicel is long and covered in star-shaped hairs. The corolla is smooth and long. Flowering occurs from late autumn to late spring. Taxonomy and naming Thomasia angustifolia was first formally described by botanist Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel in 1845 who published the description in Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet (angustifolia) is from the Latin angustus meaning \\"narrow\\" and folium meaning \\"leaf\\".

He was a general of the Santa Familia galleon and served as Capit√°n General of the Philippines. In 1713, Carriedo was recorded to be the master of the Santo Cristo de Burgos galleon. Carriedo is known for being the benefactor of Manila's pipe water system. As a retired Spanish Captain General in December 1733, he donated ten thousand pesos drawn from his fortune from the Acapulco-Manila investments. This donation was to the city and commercial interests of Manila and was for the establishment of waterworks for the benefit of the poor in the city. As nothing happened to this offer, he again bequeathed in a will dated July 27, 1743, the same amount and for the same purpose, with the stipulation that the fund was to be kept separate and devoted to the establishment, erection, and maintenance of waterworks. The fund was kept separate, accumulated interest, and was further enlarged by a special tax upon meat, devoted to that purpose. The will also specified that water should be given free to the San Juan de Dios Convent, gave funding to San Juan de Dios hospital, and gave free education of military officers. Carriedo did not live to see his resolve of creating a water system in Manila take fruit as the works were finally completed in 1878. Today a museum stands on the grounds of Pinaglabanan Shrine in San Juan City where the El Deposito, or the former reservoir was located, and commemorates Carriedo's contribution to the improvement of Manila's water and sewage system.

Summary In the book, Taibbi recounts his travels in the months leading up to the 2008 United States presidential election. He covers his trips to Iraq, the United States Congress, a meeting of the 9/11 Truth movement and his time undercover as a born-again Christian in John Hagee's Cornerstone Church in Texas. Taibbi discusses 9/11 conspiracy theories as symptomatic of what he calls the \\"derangement\\" of American society; a disconnection from reality due to widespread \\"disgust with our political system\\". Drawing a parallel with the charismatic movement, he argues that both \\"chose to battle bugbears that were completely idiotic, fanciful, and imaginary\\", instead of taking control of their own lives. While critical, Taibbi explains that 9/11 conspiracy theories are different from \\"Clinton-era black-helicopter paranoia\\", and constitute more than \\"a small, scattered group of nutcases ... they really were, just as they claim to be, almost everyone you meet.\\" In an interview with Slate, Taibbi explained the book's title: Promotion Taibbi appeared on The Daily Show on May 27, 2008, to promote the book. He spoke with host Jon Stewart about his time as a member of John Hagee's church and a 9/11 conspiracy group. Reception Kirkus Reviews said, \\"Taibbi displays a Hunter S. Thompson-esque knack for poisoned jabs at America's complacent underbelly\\" but added that \\"Taibbi fails to weave together these wavering strands.\\" Publishers Weekly said, \\"Thoughtful Democrats, Republicans and independents will find common ground in this book that punctures pretense, hypocrisy and know-nothingness.\\" Steve Appleford, writing for the Los Angeles Times, praised the book, saying, \\"This book is no rant.

He specialized in mountain landscapes. Biography He was born into an old Pomeranian family and was the son of Rittmeister Albert von Kameke (1795‚Äì1860), who was also a Squire of Egsow and Kummerzin. Initially, he followed his father into a military career. In 1859, he married Valeska (Wally) von Ferentheil und Gruppenberg (1836-1914), daughter of Oberst Richard von Ferentheil und Gruppenberg, who was also a Squire in Leonhardwitz and Kammelwitz. He was already a Hauptmann when, in 1860, he decided to change careers and become an artist. After resigning his commission, he went to Italy, in the vicinity of Rome, where he spent two years studying nature. He then enrolled at the Grand-Ducal Saxon Art School, Weimar. His teachers there included Arnold B√∂cklin, Alexander Michelis and, later, Stanislaus von Kalckreuth, whose landscape paintings were the most influential in determining his style. He favored high mountain areas in Upper Bavaria, Switzerland and the Tirol, but occasionally painted on the plains in Northern Germany. He was also a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts and taught landscape painting there. He mainly worked with oil on canvas. he died in Berlin at the age of seventy-three and was buried in the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Cemetery.

Such blue-ice areas typically form when the movement of both air and ice are obstructed by topographic obstacles such as mountains that emerge from the ice sheet, generating particular climatic conditions where the net snow accumulation is exceeded by wind-driven sublimation and snow transports. Only about 1% of Antarctic ice area can be considered to be blue-ice area, but they have attracted scientific interest due to the large numbers of meteorites that accumulate on them; these meteorites either fall directly on the blue-ice area and remain there or they fall elsewhere into the ice sheet and are transported to the blue-ice area by ice flow. Additionally, ice up to 2.7 million years old has been obtained from blue-ice areas. Blue- ice areas are sometimes used as runways for aircraft.  Appearance  Blue- ice areas have a generally smooth and often rippled appearance, a blue colour and a sparseness of bubbles in the ice. This light blue colour is a consequence of the absorption of light by ice and air bubbles encased within it and the source of the name \\"blue-ice area\\". It contrasts markedly with the white colour of Antarctic plains and can be seen from space and from aerial images while the density of the blue ice makes it appear on radar images as a dark ice form. Scalloped or rippled surfaces have almost regular surface patterns, although wholly smooth blue-ice areas exist as well and the terrain even of rippled surfaces features very low aerodynamic roughness, perhaps among the lowest of all permanent natural surfaces. This is because most aerodynamic drag is caused by surface anomalies less than a centimetre long, not larger uneven forms. The occurrence of supraglacial moraines at blue-ice areas has been reported, these form when debris contained within a glacier accumulates at the surface due to melting or sublimation. Small depressions in the ice known as cryoconite holes are common and are formed where rocks got embedded in the ice, but are absent on more mountainous blue-ice areas. Typical blue-ice areas often feature intense katabatic winds, with average winds reaching and gusts of up to ; such winds can remove and take up large amounts of snow. They are usually warmer than comparable snow-covered areas, sometimes by up to , which makes them identifiable from brightness temperature imaging. This warming is due to the lower albedo of the blue ice compared to snow, which results in them absorbing more sunlight and warming more. Blue-ice areas also alter the climate above them. As commonly defined, blue-ice areas display little or no evidence of melting, thus excluding glaciers and frozen lakes in the Antarctic Dry Valleys where sublimation-dominated ice also occurs but which may be more comparable to the ablation areas of regular glaciers.  Occurrence  Occurrence of blue-ice areas (dark blue) in Antarctica Blue-ice areas have been identified only in Antarctica although similar ice patches on Greenland have been reported and blue ice is widespread at glaciers worldwide. Blue-ice areas make up only about 1% of the Antarctic surface ice; however, they are locally common and scattered across the continent, especially in coastal or mountainous areas, but not directly beside the coastline. They have been found in Dronning Maud Land, the catchment of the Lambert Glacier, the Transantarctic Mountains and Victoria Land. Individual locations in Antarctica include areas of the Allan Hills, the Queen Fabiola Mountains (the Yamato ice field there covers an area of and is the largest such structure), Scharffenberg-Botnen and the S√∏r Rondane Mountains.  Origin and processes  Blue-ice areas are regions where more snow is removed by sublimation or by wind than accumulates by precipitation or wind-driven transport, leading to the emergence of (blue) ice. In most of Antarctica, the net tendency is for snow to accumulate except in coastal Antarctica where melting occurs and blue- ice areas where sublimation dominates. This sublimation occurs at rates of snow water equivalent and is balanced by ice flow, with the sublimation rate decreasing with elevation and increasing with temperature. Summer also increases the sublimation rate, although it still occurs during winter. Winds remove snow that rest on the surface and could even scour exposed ice away, although the occurrence of scouring is not established without doubt and the role of abrasion is also unclear. Such areas exist even in the coldest parts of Antarctica, and they are characterized by high mean wind speeds and low precipitation. Once they have formed, the smooth surface prevents snow from accumulating as it is quickly blown away by the wind, and the blue colour increases the absorption of sunlight and thus sublimation; both these phenomena act to maintain the blue-ice area, and wind-driven transport of warm air can cause the blue-ice area to expand downwind. Blue-ice areas are common in mountainous regions. Presumably, irregular surface topography obstructs ice flow and locally creates atmospheric conditions suitable for the development of blue-ice areas. Irregular topography does not need to be exposed to the surface to generate blue-ice areas, although they must have an effect on the ice surface topography to induce the formation of blue-ice areas. Consequently, many blue-ice areas form when ice thicknesses decrease, which has been postulated to happen during interglacials although in general the past history of blue-ice areas is poorly known. Such areas may not have existed at all during glacial times when the ice sheet was thicker. Changes in mean wind speeds cause short-term fluctuations in the land covered by blue-ice areas. Global warming is predicted to decrease wind speeds across Antarctica causing a small decrease in the land surface covered by blue-ice areas. = Age = Ages of particular blue-ice areas have been inferred from the ages of the meteorites there discovered, although redistribution of meteorites between various areas through ice flow can cause this procedure to yield erroneous age estimates. The oldest blue-ice areas may be up to 2.5 million years old and the ice in them can be quite old as well, with ages of several hundred thousand years estimated on the basis of ice flow dynamics and radiometric dating and the development of a horizontal stratigraphy. This occurs because ice blocked by obstacles stagnates and moves at a rate commensurate with the ablation rate. Younger ages have been found as well however, such as 250,000 years old at the Allan Hills and 75,000 years old at the Yamato Mountains. = Types = Several subtypes have been defined, which encompass most blue-ice areas. * Type I form in the lee of an obstacle and are the most common type of blue-ice area although they usually cover only a small surface area, compared to the other three types. They are often 50 ‚Äì 100 times as long as the obstacle is high, which is often a mountain. * Type II form where katabatic winds clear snow from the surface until ice appears. They form on valley glaciers. * Type III form where winds blowing on steep slopes ‚Äì or even over flat terrain ‚Äì remove snow from the surface. * Type IV form by wind removing snow from the lowest part of a glacier basin.  Meteorites  Pathways of meteorites in ice Blue-ice areas are known primarily for the meteorites that accumulate there. They originally fell on ice elsewhere and were transported by ice flows to the blue-ice area, where they accumulate when the ice they were encased in ablates away; this mechanism has been compared to a conveyor belt that transports meteorites to blue-ice areas. Additionally, meteorites that fell directly on the blue-ice areas are represented; because of the often great age of the surface a number of meteorites can accumulate even without ice-driven transport. Over 20,000 meteorites from blue-ice areas were known by 1999, a large share of all known meteorites on Earth. Meteorite findings occur only on a minority of all blue-ice areas and are mostly limited to inland blue-ice areas whereas coastal ones tend to be lacking in meteorites. This might reflect the fact that at low altitude the ice surrounding the meteorites can melt due to solar heating of the meteorite, thus removing it from view.  Research history  The earliest research in blue-ice areas occurred during the Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition in 1949‚Äì1952, and was followed by two decades of mostly geological and geomorphological research. The discovery of meteorites in a blue-ice area of the Yamato Mountains led to an uptick in scientific interest; a number of programs to collect meteorites began. This also led to increased research in the glaciological and dynamical properties of blue-ice areas, and later to their meteorological and climatological implications.  Use  The hard, flat and smooth surfaces of blue-ice areas have been used as aircraft runways (Blue ice runways) in parts of Antarctica. The very old ice in blue-ice areas has been used to reconstruct past climate, and the temporal resolution may be larger than in deep ice cores. Blue-ice areas are candidate sites for ice core drilling aimed at recovering 1.5 million year old ice, and 2.7 million year old ice has been recovered from such areas.

The state was made up of three distinct cultural regions of Telangana, Rayalseema and Coastal Andhra. Telangana was part of Hyderabad State formerly ruled by Nizam of Hyderabad, where as Rayalseema and Coastal Andhra were part of Andhra State which was again formerly part of Madras state ruled by British Raj. History Map of the United Andhra Pradesh In an effort to gain an independent state based on linguistic identity, and to protect the interests of the Telugu people of Madras State, Potti Sreeramulu fasted to death in 1952. As Madras became a bone of contention, in 1949 a JVP committee report stated: \\"Andhra Province could be formed provided the Andhras give up their claim on the city of Madras (now Chennai)\\". After Potti Sreeramulu's death, the Telugu-speaking area of Andhra State was carved out of Madras State on 1 October 1953, with Kurnool as its capital city. On the basis of the gentlemen's agreement of 1 November 1956, the States Reorganisation Act formed Andhra Pradesh by merging Andhra State with the Telugu-speaking areas of the already existing Hyderabad State. Hyderabad was made the capital of the new state. The Marathi speaking areas of Hyderabad State merged with Bombay State and the Kannada speaking areas were merged with Mysore State which was later renamed as Karnataka. In February 2014, the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed by the Parliament of India for the formation of the Telangana state comprising ten districts. Hyderabad will remain as a joint capital for not exceeding ten years. The new state of Telangana came into existence on 2 June 2014 after approval from the President of India. Number of petitions questioning the validity of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 is long pending for the verdict since April 2014 before the supreme court constitutional bench.

It is owned and operated by Norled, and crosses the Sognefjord, the longest and deepest fjord in Norway. History MV Ampere is the world's first battery electric car ferry, developed and built in Norway. Its development was the result of a competition, launched by the country's Ministry of Transport and Communications in 2011, to develop an environmentally friendly ferry service between the two villages. It is reported that she avoids the use of one million litres of diesel annually and offsets 570t of carbon dioxide and 15t of nitrogen oxide emissions compared to a conventional ferry on the same route. Layout MV Ampere has 260 ft twin hulls constructed from aluminum to minimise weight. She is propelled by Rolls- Royce Azipull thrusters, powered by two 450 kW electric motors with batteries. The 10t lithium-ion batteries were developed by Corvus Energy and integrated by Siemens with an overall output of 1,000kWh. They can be recharged in 10 minutes between crossings from high-capacity batteries at each port. Other energy saving features are LED lighting, solar panels and air conditioning with a waste heat recovery system.

Early life Kay was born in 1923 in Croydon. He and his mother, a missionary doctor, moved to Lahore, where his father worked as an Anglican minister. The family returned to England when Kay was four years old, and he attended The Downs Malvern prep school, where he was taught English by W. H. Auden. He then attended Bryanston School and qualified from St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in 1945. After joining the RAF Volunteer Reserve in 1947, he was transferred to the Aden Protectorate. He married April Powlett, a rheumatologist, in 1950. Career After returning to London from Aden, Kay worked for six years as a pathologist at St Thomas' Hospital. He was appointed a consultant pathologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital, a specialist cancer treatment hospital in London, in 1956. At the Royal Marsden, Kay's research interests shifted to haematology, and particularly leukaemia. At the time, leukaemia was a fatal disease, usually causing death within weeks of diagnosis, and there was little consensus about treatment options. Kay organised and oversaw multiple clinical trials funded by the Medical Research Council relating to leukaemia treatments and served as secretary to the MRC's Leukaemia Committee from its founding in 1968 to its disbanding to 1977. Other MRC trials that Kay coordinated at the Royal Marsden focused on multiple myeloma and polycythaemia rubra vera. He was editor of the Journal of Clinical Pathology from 1972 to 1980. At the Royal Marsden, Kay helped to design and was the first administrator of an isolation ward for patients with weakened immune systems that was built in 1963. The concept was so successful that a larger version of the ward was opened in 1973 and was equipped for intensive treatment of acute leukaemias. At the time of his retirement as a professor of haematology in 1984, leukaemia had become a largely curable disease. Later life After his retirement, Kay became a keen naturalist and conservationist in the Wiltshire area. He was elected to the council of the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust in 1983 and was awarded the Christopher Cadbury Medal by the Wildlife Trusts in 1996. Kay's first wife, April Powlett, died in 1990; he remarried to Sallie Perry in 1996. He died in Marlborough, Wiltshire, in 2009.

Cricket career Tom Eden was a prominent bowler in a period of low scores. In his second first-class match he took 9 for 43 and 5 for 20, as well as top-scoring in Nelson's first innings with 17 at No. 10, when Nelson beat Wellington by four wickets at the Basin Reserve in Wellington in 1875-76. He was Nelson's most successful bowler, with four wickets, when James Lillywhite's XI visited in February 1877 shortly before playing the inaugural Test match in Melbourne. At the Basin Reserve in 1877-78 Eden took 11 wickets when Nelson beat Wellington by 85 runs. The complete bowling analyses are unavailable, but as he bowled unchanged through both innings, in which Wellington's batsmen scored only 88 runs, his match figures are likely to have been 11 for around 40 to 50. Later in his career he played as a batsman, making his highest first-class score of 25 (which was also Nelson's top score) in his last innings. Personal life Tom Eden married Marion Hastilow on 21 July 1883 in St Paul's Church, Brightwater, south-west of Nelson. He established a hop farm at Bridge Valley, south-east of Wakefield, where he lived for the rest of his life. He died at home aged 59 after a long and painful illness.

The concept was publicized through Toufani's lectures over five years at Singularity University and subsequently at Adaptability University, which defines AQ as \\"the ability to realize optimal outcomes based on recent or future change.\\" The earliest use of the phrase \\"Adaptability Quotient\\" dates back to an article on the state of the advertising industry published by Stuart Parkin in 2010, although Parkin does not operationalize the concept, nor offer a precise definition. , there is a growing body of literature surrounding adaptability and consequent interest in being able to harness, measure, and quantify adaptability in the workplace. Adaptability was identified as the ‚Äúnew competitive advantage‚Äù by the Harvard Business Review in 2011. In 2014, The Flux Report (published by Right Management in the UK) revealed that 91% of HR managers thought that: \\"People will be recruited on their ability to deal with change and uncertainty\\" as opposed to other skills. Specifically adaptive performance in the research literature means numerous organizational scholars have recognized that traditional models of performance are static and need to be augmented to include \\"responsiveness to changing job requirements\\" ‚Äî labeled adaptive performance (AP; Allworth & Hesketh, 1999, p. 98; Griffin, Neal, & Parker, 2007; Pulakos, Arad, Donovan, & Plamondon, 2000). Lisa Leong published an article in BBC Worklife101 (July, 2019) citing Adaptability Quotient as the \\"X-factor for career success\\", and outlining Otto Scharmer‚Äôs three-tier model: \\"keeping an open mind, so you see the world with fresh eyes and remain open to possibilities; keeping an open heart, so you can try to see any situation through another person‚Äôs eyes; and keeping an open will, letting go of identity and ego to sit with the discomfort of the unknown\\". In September, 2019, Ross Thornley offered a response to Leong‚Äôs article, discussing the wider implications of AQ outside of the workplace. Etymology The root of the word adaptation is apt, from the Latin aptus, meaning 'fitting or suited' (OED), a root meaning already used in the career construct of ‚Äúaptitude‚Äù. The word adapt can be traced, through Latin and French, to aduptare, meaning ‚Äúto fit.‚Äù The idea of fit (or congruence) remains the central construct in trait-and-factor or person-environment theory. History The popular understanding of adaptability as a factor in survival and human endeavour can be traced back to Charles Darwin‚Äôs On The Origin of The Species (1859): \\"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, it is the one that is the most adaptable to change\\". Current literature, however, describes a shift from a mindset of survival to one of ‚Äòthriving‚Äô; rather than simply adapting in response to change, becoming more adaptable to predict it: \\"Staying ahead of the curve is not just about responding to change, but predicting and influencing it\\". The term \\"Career adaptability\\" was first coined in 1981 by Super and Knasel, but the earliest mention of ‚ÄúAdaptability Quotient‚Äù specifically was in 2010. In his article What‚Äôs Your Adaptability Quotient Stuart Parkin outlines the link between motivation and adaptability and how we may be more willing to adapt in some areas than others. Parkin also outlined that adaption should not be simply in ‚Äòresponse to change‚Äô, or in other words survival, but a constant: ‚ÄúGiven that there are many aspects of a job to which we might have to adapt -- such as location, new responsibilities, new reporting structures and new skills -- the worst time to adapt is when you are told to. Conversely, the best time to adapt is quite simply, always. This is unless you believe that nothing around you will change.‚Äù Parkin also links the need for adaptability in the modern world to Moore‚Äôs Law. In 2012, Jo Ayoubi‚Äôs article \\"Adaptability is critical for successful organisations ‚Äì but how adaptable is HR?\\", outlines the four key success factors of Adaptability Quotient in large organisations: (1) \\"The ability to quickly appreciate when change is happening (or even before it starts) and to respond quickly. (2) The ability to test and experiment quickly and often. In the past the focus of testing has focused on products and services, but this ability also applies to business models, processes and strategies. (3) The ability to recognise and effectively manage stakeholders in complex relationships and roles; in particular in multinational locations. (4) The ability to motivate and lead in a rapidly changing environment.\\" Adaptability Quotient is linked to Intelligence Quotient (IQ), established in 1912; Emotional Intelligence (EQ), made popular in 1995 by Daniel Goleman‚Äôs book of the same title; and SQ or Social Intelligence Quotient: \\"capacity to know oneself and to know others\\". In 2018, LinkedIn revealed that adaptability made the top five most in-demand soft-skills. Definitions Forbes‚Äô Adapt or Die whitepaper defines AQ as: ‚Äúthe ability to adjust course, product, service, and strategy in response to unanticipated changes in the market.‚Äù Whereas Forbes‚Äô definition is exclusively business-orientated, Martin, Nejad, Colmar, and Liem in their article \\"Adaptability: How Students' Responses to Uncertainty and Novelty Predict Their Academic and Non-Academic Outcomes, defined AQ more broadly as: ‚Äúthe capacity to adjust one‚Äôs thoughts and behaviours in order to effectively respond to uncertainty, new information, or changed circumstances\\". Whereas Martin, Nejad, and Colmar, and Liem, focus on adaptability or AQ solely as a ‚Äòcapacity‚Äô, or in other words, a learned ability, The National Institutes for Health defines it as: \\"a disposition and skill\\", identifying it as a characteristic or personality trait as well as an ability. The extent to which AQ is inherent or learned has yet to be determined. However, there is critical consensus that adaptability can be improved. Ross Thornley and Mike Raven, Co-Founders of Adaptai, define it as: ‚ÄúAQ or Adaptability Quotient: The ability to adapt to and thrive in an environment of continual and accelerating change.‚Äù Building on Slavick's paper on career adaptability, the Adaptai model expands the previous model by emphasizing the role the environment (context) and the process/ changeable nature of adaptability have: ‚ÄúWe measure adaptability across three core dimensions (ACE): Ability (your adaptability skills), your Character (the innate aspects of Self that determine the ways in which you may approach adapting), and Environment (how your environment can help or hinder your adaption).‚Äù Because it touches each segment, the construct of adaptation offers a potential bridge across the individual differences, developmental, self, and contextual segments in life-span, life-space theory. The four perspectives on careers bring into focus different aspects of adaptation. The individual differences perspective focuses on the objective status of an individual‚Äôs adaptive skills and styles for fitting self into situation. The phenomenological perspective centers on the subjective goals of adaptation that a self constructs and values as she or he subjectively authors a life story and strives to become more complete and more fully engaged with the world. The developmental perspective highlights the functions and processes of adaptation across the life course. And finally, the contextual perspective concentrates on the historical and cultural situation, with its attendant barriers and affordances, within which the individual must adapt and flourish. Ross Thornley also links AQ to Moore‚Äôs Law of exponential progress and the emerging world of abundance (as outlined by Peter H. Diamandis in his book Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think). ‚ÄúThere is no dispute technology directly influences our way of life, our culture, and now the collective potential of the human race. As a result, with every new advance comes obsolescences and alterations.‚Äù Because the pace of the world is increasing, therefore, our ability to adapt and change in response to these developments needs to increase with it. Models There are several measures of ‚ÄòAdaptability‚Äô and a very small number of ‚ÄòAdaptability Quotient‚Äô measures in existence. Career adaptability Super and Knasel defined the term \\"career adaptability\\" in 1981 as an adult‚Äôs \\"readiness to cope with changing work and working conditions\\". In her review of Career Adaptability literature Claire S. Norton defines career adaptability as: \\"a psychosocial construct including both readiness and resources for successfully facing vocational tasks, occupational transitions, and unexpected challenges\\". In The Best of Both Worlds: The Role of Career Adaptability and Career Competencies in Students‚Äô Well-Being and Performance (2018), Jos Akkermans, Kristina Paradnik√©, Beatrice I. J. M. Van der Heijden, and Ans De Vos apply the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory in an educational setting. Their findings suggest that career adaptability and career competencies are: \\"important career resources that predict both life satisfaction and academic performance via students‚Äô satisfaction with the choice of their major and study engagement...The results revealed that career adaptability and career competencies were positively linked to students‚Äô life satisfaction, both directly and via study engagement. In addition, these career resources were positively, yet indirectly, related to academic performance via study engagement. Overall, the results suggest that career resources contribute to study engagement, life satisfaction, and academic performance\\". Whilst this study focuses on an academic environment, there is emerging literature around ‚Äòcareer adaptability‚Äô in the workplace. In The association of psychological capital, career adaptability and career competency among hotel frontline employees, Homayoun PashaSafavi and MonaBouzari found that ‚ÄúThere is a positive significant relationship between career adaptability and career competency‚Äù and that ‚ÄúCareer adaptability mediates the effect of psychological capital on career competency.‚Äù Adaptability Predictors Individual predictors of sensorimotor adaptability (Rachael D. Seidler, Ajitkumar P. Mulavara, Jacob J. Bloomberg, and Brian T. Peters) approaches adaptability from a physiological and neuroscientific standpoint, specifically, adapting to altered gravity. ‚ÄúThe capacity to rapidly adapt to changing gravitational environments is increasing in importance as NASA targets having the capability to send humans to Mars in the 2030s (U.S. National Space Policy, 2010).‚Äù Weightless gravity environments create the need for new postures and movement dynamics, as well as a shift in the way sensory stimuli are processed. Crews generally adapt to these conditions over a few days. When they subsequently return to Earth, however, and experience Earth-gravity: ‚Äúthe responses that are adaptive in space cause immediate maladaptive motor behavior on Earth‚Äù. The purpose of their study was to ascertain predictors of fast-adapters for future spaceflight programs. There are specific genetic polymorphisms associated with faster adaptation on manual joystick tasks and faster recovery of function following a stroke. Moreover, neuroscience has demonstrated that observing the extent of recruitment of specific brain regions during learning and adaptation can predict the ‚Äúmagnitude of subsequent learning\\". In other studies, factors such as career concerns, learning orientation and performance-prove orientation (Yousefi, Abedi, Baghban, Eatemadi, & Abedi, 2011), and hope (Hirschi, 2014) have been identified as predictors of adaptability responses. All in all, studies suggest that future research should disentangle the effect personality plays on adaptive performance. Something the ACE model does by linking the Big Five and Regulatory Focus to adaptive performance across industry settings: \\"For example, researchers may begin to examine the extent to which personality traits predict above and beyond cognitive ability or even interact with cognitive ability to affect adaptive performance. In addition, future studies may include personality measures outside the trait domain (Funder, 2001). In particular, recent research has examined how individuals may adjust their momentary personality dynamically in various situational contexts (Huang & Ryan, 2011; Minbashian, Wood, & Beckmann, 2010).\\" (Huang et al. 2014) Model for adaptability (frontiers in psychology) In Combine Your \\"Will\\" and \\"Able\\": Career Adaptability‚Äôs Influence on Performance (2019), Xueyuan Gao, Xun Xin, Wenxia Zhou and Denise M. Jepsen outline the link between adaptability and CCT (Career Construction Theory): \\"Adaptivity and adaptability are two key elements representing one‚Äôs ‚Äúwillingness‚Äù and ‚Äúability\\", respectively, in the career construction theory (CCT) framework.‚Äù Their study of 232 Chinese employees revealed that: ‚Äúcareer adaptability positively predicts performance, with this relationship partially mediated by career self-management. The positive effect of career adaptability on career self-management is stronger among those who are more proactive than less proactive. ‚Äù Assessments =Kai model= The KAI model or \\"Kirton Adaption-Innovation Inventory\\" was established in 1976. It is used predominantly as a change-management strategy and training tool for managers and teams. The KAI is both a model and psychometric. ‚ÄúAdaption-Innovation‚Äù theory can be used by practitioners in coaching and personal development. The theory distinguishes between level and style of creativity, problem solving, and decision-making. Cognitive style differences lie on a distributed continuum, ranging from ‚Äúhigh adaption‚Äù to ‚Äúhigh innovation‚Äù. The psychometric itself is a form with 32 questions. Only certified practitioners can use the KAI model. The \\"key assumptions\\" of the KAI theory are as follows: All people problem solve (and are, therefore, creative); creativity is a sub-set of problem solving. Problem solving is the product of cognitive function operating within environment. Cognitive function influences behavior producing stable characteristic patterns; from its operation are derived dimensions of personality, of which Adaption-Innovation is one. One element of cognitive function is cognitive effect, which is made up of cognitive (preferred) style and cognitive (potential) level (or capacity). Cognitive Style: People differ in the amount of structure they require and the degree to which that structure is consensually agreed, to feel comfortable in tackling any problem, allowing for different importance of outcome (levels of reward and punishment). Cognitive style is early set and highly stable and correlates with a cluster of related, entrenched, characteristic well listed personality traits. The elements in cognitive affect are unrelated (uncorrelated) with those of cognitive style; cognitive style is uncorrelated with cognitive (potential) level and all elements in cognitive resource (e.g., manifest capacity). All elements of cognitive function are influenced by, but are independent of, environment. All the main elements of cognitive function are associated with cognitive processes: problem solving, learning & memory, motive; so is social environment: group dynamics. It follows that the key assumption relevant in the development of the measurement of this theory is that people can be located on a continuum of cognitive style, ranging from adaptor to innovator, dependent on the characteristic mode in which they solve problems (create or make decisions). The Kirton Adaption-Innovation Inventory (KAI) is the measure devised to locate respondents on this continuum. =AQai= AQai‚Äôs model is three-tier (Ability, Character, Environment). Ross and Co-Founder Mike Raven describe their assessment as the ‚Äúfirst AI powered holistic measure of adaptability‚Äù. Each of the three primary dimensions also has five sub-dimensions (for a total of 15). Their model is based on behavioral psychology models and research conducted at the IE Business School and IE University, with the support from Professor Nicolas Till Deuschel, researcher on employee effectiveness and human capital. Innovation and change literature has shown that employees are likely to perform best in diverse workplaces when they bridge between competing (and sometimes opposing) demands of their traits or states and the context. In The 4 Key Success 'abilities' of Adaptability You Can Learn Today, Ross Thornley outlines the sub-dimensions that correspond with the first of the five dimensions ‚ÄúAbility‚Äù. He defines these sub-dimensions as: Resilience: ‚Äúthe capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness‚Äô, or, in other words, the ability to ‚Äòbounce back‚Äù (OED) In their study 'Resilience Training That Can Change the Brain‚Äô (2018), Golnaz Tabibnia & Dan Radecki stated that: ‚ÄúOne of the challenges of consulting and coaching psychology is helping individuals, teams, and entire enterprises weather life and work stressors. These stressors can be one-time and acute, such as unexpected job transfer or job loss, or more chronic, such as bad bosses, broken peer relationships, and dysfunctional team members. Some people are more resilient than others in the face of such stressors, but many of the skills that make for resilience can be learned.‚Äù Flexibility: \\"the quality of bending easily without breaking\\" (OED) In their article 'Transitioning Towards New Ways of Working: Do Job Demands, Job Resources, Burnout, and Engagement Change?', Elianne F. Van Steenbergen, Cilia van der Ven, Maria C. W. Peeters and Toon W. Taris outline factors that may help transitioning into new work modalities: \\"Judge, Thoresen, Pucik, and Welbourne (1999) found that managers higher in Openness to experiences were better able to cope with organizational change. Moreover, practical personal resources such as flexibility (i.e., adapting to changes at work)‚Ä¶ may enable employees to make an optimal transition to telecommuting. (Lapierre et al., 2015)\\". Learning Drive: \\"characterised as our passion and hunger for more knowledge\\" [16] Learning Drive has been linked with ‚Äòunlearning‚Äô. Unlearning was first introduced by Marshall Goldsmith in 2008 with his book What Got You Here, Won‚Äôt Get You There, which outlines the philosophy of letting go of redundant methodologies in order to succeed. In 2018, Barry O‚ÄôReilly published Unlearn: Let Go of Past Success to Achieve Extraordinary Results, a ‚Äútransformative system‚Äù for leaders. Mindset: 'The Direct and Indirect Effects of Employees‚Äô Mindsets on Job Performance' by Matt Zingoni & Christy M. Corey, defines mindset as a continuum: \\"At one end of the continuum are those with an entity mindset; they believe that human attributes are fixed and cannot be changed. At the other end of the continuum are those with an incremental mindset; they believe that human attributes can be changed through effort and hard work. Where individuals fall on this continuum has been found to have profound effects on their thoughts and behaviors (e.g., Dweck, 1999; Dweck, Chiu, & Hong, 1995)\\". In 2019, AQai carried out a study of over 1000 participants working in more than 20 companies in 28 countries. Their analysis helps to highlight some critical levers in improving adaptability in an individual or a team. =Pulakos= Pulakos et al. (2000) represents the only work to date that articulated the construct space for adaptive performance. It defined adaptive performance as the proficiency with which an individual alters his or her behavior in response to the demands of a new task, event, situation, or environmental constraints. Using a content analytic procedure to map critical incidents at work onto different dimensions of adaptive performance, Pulakos et al. (2000) created an eight-dimensional taxonomy. However, a single factor was found to underlay supervisor ratings of soldiers‚Äô performance (Pulakos et al., 2002). Similarly, Ployhart and Bliese (2006) proposed an adaptability second-order factor to account for co-variation across the eight behavioral dimensions. Griffin et al. (2007) situated adaptive performance at three work role contexts‚Äîindividual, team, and organization‚Äîand subsequently obtained empirically distinct measures of adaptability in each work context; however, each of their adaptability measures collapses across behavioral dimensions (e.g., coping with changes, learning) and captures overall adaptive performance. Thus, to date, despite acknowledgment that there are different behaviors that may be labeled as adaptive performance, there is a lack of empirical support for considering adaptive performance as multidimensional. Improving AQ Despite differing models and measures, there is widespread critical consensus that Adaptability Quotient is not fixed, but improvable. Parker and Collins (2010) explore the links between pro-activity and career adaptability, creating three overarching categories to describe pro-activity: (a) proactive work behavior, including taking charge, innovative behavior, voice, and problem prevention; (b) proactive strategic behavior, including issue selling and strategic scanning; and (c) proactive person‚Äìenvironment fit behavior, including feedback seeking and job change negotiation (idiosyncratic deals). Proactive personality can strengthen the benefits of career adaptability on enhancing career self- management and improving performance. The effects that proactive personality has on the mediated relationship between career adaptability and performance indicate that some interventions could improve employees‚Äô career adaptability and proactivity. For example: increasing career confidence by giving useful and positive feedback or providing them with opportunities to solve some problems; or help them to make clearer career goals to enhance their sense of control and thus improve the overall level of career adaptability. For those wanting to expand their understanding of AQ, the podcast series on The Success Network - DECODING AQ, hosted by Ross Thornley, shares insights from world leaders in business, psychology and academia.

This temple belongs to the Kalchuri Period.. The temple is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. Temple witnesses high footfall during Mahashivratri when the devotees form nearby villages gather here for Lord Shiva‚Äôs blessing. The event is also accompanied by small fair Overview It is an ancient temple built by Kalchuris during the 13th century AD.. It is said that this temple was built in just 6 months and that is why it is also called 6 Maashi (Maasi or Masi, in English - Months) temple. The temple is having a Kund and it is believed to be connected to another old town Arang of Chhattisgarh state through a tunnel Architecture The temple is east facing, built of sand stone. It has a Garbhagriha and a pillared Navaranga Mandapa(hall). The shikhara which is supposed to have been built in Nagara style is missing. The Garbhagriha houses a Shiva Linga of about 1.5 feet in height, which is approached through a highly ornate door entrance guarded by Shaiva Dwarpalas.Inside the garbhgriha one can find idols of Goddess Parvati, Ganesha and Hanuman among others. The mandapa pillars are adorned with images of Bhairava, Vishnu, Mahishasur mardini (a form of Devi Durga who killed the demon Mahishasura), shiva, musicians, dancers and Kirtimukha designs.

The Temple courtyard has a store house like shed where one can see antique idols and statues that have been found during excavation, which may have belonged to the temple. Legend It is believed that the sculptor who was building the temple got so much engrossed in his work that he didn‚Äôt care about his clothes. He became naked while continuing to work day and night to complete the temple. His wife used to bring food for him, but one day his sister came. Seeing this they both got ashamed and to hide himself he jumped in the Kund(holy pond inside the temple complex) near to the temple from the rooftop. Seeing this his sister also jumped in the nearby pond. Both pond and kund exist till date. The pond is called Kasara Talab because the sister was believed to be carrying the Kalasha for water. A Kalash Type stone is still present there. The locals believe there is a secret tunnel inside the Kund that leads to a temple in Arang. The sculptor when he jumped , found the tunnel and reached Aaang where he became a stone. At that place Bhanadeva temple is built. The Kund is having 23 steps and 2 wells beside it. In one the flow of water is never stops. Location The Mahadev Temple is built in the small town of Deobaloda in Bhilai Charoda.It is well connected by train and road.

It took place between 7 and 9 October 1916, between Central Powers forces (Germany and Austria-Hungary) on one side and Romanian forces on the other side. As Brass√≥ was the second largest city in Transylvania and the largest Transylvanian settlement taken by the Romanians during their August- September offensive in the region, the retreating Romanian forces decided to make a stand there. However, when its defense proved untenable, the Romanian 2nd Army withdrew from the city, leaving behind only 1,175 prisoners. As the Romanians failed to defend Brass√≥, so did the Central Powers fail to cut off their escape route, enabling the Romanians to regroup and - under better leadership - thwart the German and Austro-Hungarian attempts to break through the mountains in the region throughout the following month. Background Romania declared war on Austria-Hungary on 27 August, and two days later it captured Brass√≥, which - at 41,000 inhabitantsPrit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, p. 358 \\\\- was the second largest city in Transylvania, behind Kolozsv√°r, which had almost 63,000 inhabitants. German forces soon reinforced the Austro- Hungarians, and the two Central Powers began a counteroffensive in the region in late September. In early October, the Romanian 2nd Army succeeded in thwarting a Central Powers attack, but - instead of exploiting its victory offensively - the Romanians unexpectedly began to retreat, preventing the Central Powers from pinning them down. The defensive line of the half-strength Romanian 2nd Army was broken on 5 October, and the battle for Brass√≥ started on 7 October. =Romanian conquest of Brass√≥ (27 - 29 August)= Airborne leaflet dropped by the Romanian Army over Brass√≥, calling on the local population to support the Romanian offensive The Romanian 2nd Army, under the command of General Alexandru Averescu, used its covering forces to quickly rout the forces defending the border on the night of 27 August. As they advanced, the Romanians began meeting the forces of the Austro-Hungarian 82nd Infantry Regiment. The regiment's 1st Battalion, assisted by Armored Train IV, stopped three Romanian regiments, holding its ground for the entire day of 28 August, being pushed back only that night. In the west, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions also put up a lively fight, despite running low on ammunition. By nightfall of the 28 August, the 1st Battalion had retreated into Brass√≥ itself. On that same night, Austro-Hungarian government officials withdrew from the city, amid scenes of confusion and suffering. Panicked and desperate Hungarians and Germans attempted to storm trains leaving the city. The Romanians closed in on Brass√≥ in the afternoon of 29 August. Hardly any fighting took place within the city itself, save for Romanian artillery destroying the last train leaving Brass√≥. That afternoon, a delegation of ethnic Romanians from Brass√≥ surrendered the city to the commander of the Romanian 6th Infantry Regiment. At around 5 pm on that day, Romanian army units entered Brass√≥, parading to the city square.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 23 oct. 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 24-26 =Further developments (September - October)= After taking Brass√≥, General Averescu was transferred to the command of the Romanian 3rd Army on 7 September. His replacement, Grigore C. CrƒÉiniceanu, was a major downgrade in leadership. CrƒÉiniceanu's appointment caused consternation, as elements of the General Staff did not think he was qualified, and Alexandru Marghiloman - leader of the Conservative Party - went as far as to say: \\"How is that possible?...Do not make such a mistake; he has been confused all his life, and he is absolutely worn out.\\" Adding to the 2nd Army's problems, its forces were halved in mid-September when three of its divisions were sent elsewhere.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 23 oct. 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 56, 86 and 127 In sharp contrast to CrƒÉiniceanu, Averescu was - according to historian John Buchan - \\"the ablest of Rumanian generals\\".John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 226 At the start of October, after a counterattack which severely mauled the German 89th Division, the Romanians made an unexpected retreat, preventing the Germans from pinning them down. It was only late on 4 October that the Germans reached the Romanian defensive line west of Brass√≥. The line was located on the western slopes of the Per»ôani Mountains, in the forest known to the Germans and Austrians as the Geisterwald.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, pp. 353-354 and 356 =Battle of the Geisterwald (5 October)= The German 9th Army moved forward to attack the Romanian line in the Geisterwald on 5 October. The initial German attack succeeded in ascending the steep slope without apparent difficulty, but before they could exploit their gains, the Germans had to beat off several powerful Romanian counterattacks. Early on that day, German artillery opened fire in a hellish concert that the Germans have not experienced for a long time. Towards midday, as the German guns were still blazing away at the Romanian fortifications, the Romanians launched a counterattack. Reckless, death-defying groups repeatedly filled the wide holes torn into their lines by the German artillery, which was so powerful that three Romanian counterattacks were completely crushed. German artillery fire rose to a crescendo during the afternoon, as the Germans stormed the heights against no more opposition. The Romanians who were still alive threw away their weapons in fear. The attacking German companies stormed a bloody and gruesome defence line: churned up ground, shattered corpses, the dead and the groaning wounded, along with the survivors who had held on to the last. Despite the destructive fire, some Romanians advanced with admirable tenacity and determination. Relatively few pushed to within 50 meters of the railway embankment, where they were killed by accurate rifle and machine gun fire.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, pp. 356-358 On the night of 5 October, the Geisterwald was lost by the Romanians.John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 242 CrƒÉiniceanu's growing panic was evidenced by his hasty retreat through the Geisterwald. Panic had completely taken hold of him, and his staff thought he had lost his mind. Retreating from the forest, the Romanians left behind a few hundred prisoners and 48 guns of varying sizes.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 23 oct. 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 119-120 On 6 October, official reports from Bucharest for the first time abandoned their tone of confidence, announcing that in Southern Transylvania the Romanian Army was retiring before superior forces.John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 234 Battle As 9th Army approached Brass√≥ on 7 October, some elements ran into defensive positions. After German artillery broke up a determined Romanian counterattack, elements of the 187th Infantry Division (two regiments) penetrated into the northern part of the city, where they encountered further determined resistance and counterattacks throughout the following night. The next morning, when the fog lifted, the soldiers of the 187th Regiment realized that enemy soldiers were located between them and the rest of their division. Walls of Romanian infantry stood between General Edwin Sunkel's two regiments in Brass√≥ and the 187th Regiment. Well-aimed artillery fire quickly dissolved the Romanian formations, but they soon reformed and began to advance, despite the holes appearing in their skirmish lines as the artillery shells landed. The Romanian riflemen advanced steadily towards Barcaszentp√©ter (S√¢npetru), until they were halted by German machine guns and small arms. The Romanians withdrew to their initial positions, save for a few who found cover in cornfields, from where they could not be dislodged despite repeated attempts. The Romanians did not retreat any further, but neither did they resume their attack. Inside Brass√≥, house-to-house battles raged, as the two German regiments in the city were engaged in a bitter struggle in the outskirts of the city. Powerful Romanian counterattacks repeatedly failed. Early on 8 October, the 51st Honv√©d Infantry Division moved up in support and attacked the heights which dominated the western and northern parts of Brass√≥. Accompanied by a brigade from the Honv√©d Division, the Germans and Hungarians slowly scattered several Romanian battalions. At around 3 pm, heavy gunfire was heard from the north. General Curt von Morgen's 89th Division had finally arrived and was attacking the Romanians surrounding Barcaszentp√©ter, although it failed to press all the way to the village. The 89th Division never got its act together: destroyed bridges, poor reconnaissance and minor Romanian resistance all contributed to its slow progress. The soldiers were tired, and the commanders were unaware of the opportunity: attacking immediately would have exposed the Romanian divisions besieging the village to a partial crossfire. Instead, after firing off a few shots, the German infantry began to set up camp. By the end of the 8th, it was clear to the Romanians that Brass√≥ could not be held, and rear area units were ordered to withdraw, followed by the rearguard. The Germans watched the Romanians retreat throughout the night from their vantage points in and around the city, trying to keep them under machine gun fire. Trains fully loaded with military materiel and war plunder were abandoned, as was a train full of soldiers. As soon as it was daylight, the 187th Infantry Regiment marched into the city. The bells in all the town's towers rang victory. =\\"Death trench\\" at the Bertalan railway station= Fallen Romanian soldiers at the Bertalan railway station To the right of the Brass√≥-Bertalan train station, a company of 168 soldiers from the (Tecuci) had dug in for along the railroad in order to defend the city from an attack coming from M√©heskert. The entire company had only a machine gun available. In the heat of the battle, the Romanian soldiers didn't notice that their left flank was completely open. German reconnaissance discovered quickly the weak spot and, using darkness to their advantage, a machine gun section of the 189th Regiment quietly sneaked into a ruined depot, away from the Romanian trench, while other German soldiers with hand grenades took position behind the Romanians. In two-three minutes the Germans mowed down the whole company of 168 soldiers. A German war correspondent described the scene afterwards: \\"The dead company lies now in dirt, by the roadside. Man to man they lie down, as they fell on the battle day under the terrifying fire of the machine guns, with a look of dread imprinted on their pale faces and with spread out hands, as if they tried to defend themselves from the misfortune that had befallen them\\". Aftermath The battle for Brass√≥ was over. The Germans had captured 1,175 prisoners and 25 artillery pieces. Erich von Falkenhayn, observing the fighting from a church steeple in Feketehalom (Codlea), sent several messages to von Morgen, urging him to keep moving. On the morning of the 9th, von Falkenhayn stormed into von Morgen's headquarters at F√∂ldv√°r (Feldioara) and made his displeasure clear, ordering the 89th Division to \\"stay glued to the retreating enemy\\". However, hindered as much by poor roads and difficult terrain as by Romanian resistance, the Germans were unable to cut off the escape route.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 23 oct. 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 123-125Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, p. 359 The Battle of Brass√≥ lasted two days, from 7 to 9 October 1916.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 23 oct. 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 122 The German failure to cut off the escape route of the Romanians would have serious consequences for the Central Powers. General Alexandru Averescu, who had returned to the command of the 2nd Army after the end of the battle, would successfully defeat the Central Powers during the Battle of Predeal Pass. His defence would turn out to be brilliant, as by the first days of November, the Central Powers had not advanced more than across the Romanian border. On the Romanian side, the last major location captured by the Romanians during their initial advance into Transylvania was back in the control of the Central Powers, causing morale in Bucharest to further plummet. Chaotic preparations began to move the seat of Government to the east and some began to question the wisdom of going to war with the Central Powers, resulting in suggestions to seek a separate peace. However, the Romanian King and Prime Minister were determined to fight on. Despite the \\"disappointing\\" haul of prisoners, Falkenhayn was confident that he had inflicted enough damage on the Romanian 2nd Army that it would not be able to seriously resist him, even with reinforcements. General Averescu would render Falkenhayn's confidence unfounded throughout the following month.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, pp. 359-360John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 244 Romania was the only minor power during World War I which managed to invade the territory of a European Great Power and hold one of said Great Power's cities, with tens of thousands of inhabitants, for over one month (29 August to 7 October), including one entire calendar month (September 1916). It is difficult to find anything to compare this to, given that minor powers could hardly invade Great Powers. During the war, Bulgaria invaded Serbia (Morava Offensive, Ovƒçe Pole Offensive), Romania (Battle of Turtucaia, Battle of Bazargic) and Albania (Bulgarian occupation of Albania), but all of these were minor powers. One somewhat comparable example was the Serbian invasion of the Syrmia region of the Austro-Hungarian Bosnia. On 6 September 1914, Field Marshal Radomir Putnik ordered the Serbian 1st Army to cross the Sava River into Austro-Hungarian Syrmia. By 11 September, the Serbs had penetrated 20 miles into Austro-Hungarian territory. On that same day, however, the Serbian advance faltered, and by 14 September the Serbs had evacuated Syrmia.Spencer Tucker, ABC-CLIO, 2006, World War I: A Student Encyclopedia, pp. 594-595  References  Category:Battles of the Eastern Front (World War I) Category:Battles of World War I involving Germany Category:Battles of World War I involving Romania Category:Battles of World War I involving Austria-Hungary Category:History of Transylvania (1867‚Äì1918) Category:Conflicts in 1916 Category:1916 in Romania ","title":"Battle of Brass√≥ (1916)"},{"id":"61799989","text":"The Shihezi Headquarters Farm () is an economic and paramilitary formed unit at regiment-level in Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), that is part of the 8th Division of the XPCC (). The farm is headquartered in Beiqun Town () of Shihezi City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. It is composed of 23 companies and 11 residential communities. As of 2018, its population was about 8,5000. The Shihezi Headquarters Farm is co-located with Beiquan Town Government. With the approval of the government of the autonomous region and the Ministry of Civil Affairs in 1999, the Beiquan Town Government was formally established, the town was implemented a special management system with Shihezi Headquarters Farm for co-location work and named as Beiquan Town of Shihezi Headquarters Farm (), it is also the first administrative town directly managed by the Corps (XPCC). The total area of Shihezi Headquarters Farm is 475.76 square kilometers (including 195.2 square kilometers of Beiquan Town), and its cultivated land is 18,733 hectares. Within the jurisdiction, there are national Agricultural High-tech Park (), provincial-level Beiquan Town Industrial Park (), and the 8th Division Industrial Park of the Corps (). As of 2017, the farm's GDP was CNÔø•5,670 million (US$840 million) with the proportion of the three industries 20:31:49, its fixed asset investment was CNÔø•1,636 million (US$242 million). History At the beginning of 1950, the formerly 78th Regiment of the 26th Infantry Division of the 9th Army of the 22nd Corps of the PLA arrived in the place and began an arduous start. In May 1953, the 78th Regiment was renamed the 24th Regiment of the 8th Agricultural Construction Division of the Corps (the XPCC). At the same time, there was a Tractor Training Farm directly under the Corps (), and later it was renamed as the Tractor-plowing Farm (). In February 1958, it was renamed Shihezi Farm (). In April 1959, the 24th Regiment and Shihezi Farm merged to form the Shihezi Headquarters Farm. In November 1969, Shihezi Headquarters Farm was divided into 145th Regiment and 146th Regiment farms; in December 1978, the two farms were incorporated into the present Shihezi Headquarters Farm. Geography The Beiquan Town of Shihezi Headquarters Farm is located in the northern edge of Tianshan Mountain, the southern side of the Jungar Basin, the west bank of the Manas River and the northern suburb of Shihezi City. It lies along the economic belt of the Northern Slope of Tianshan Mountain and the central area of the Golden Triangle between √úr√ºmqi, Karamay and Wusu in the province. The farm is only 9 kilometers away from Shihezi Railway Station and Wuyi (√úr√ºmqi - Yining) Expressway, 130 kilometers away from √úr√ºmqi International Airport in the east and is connected by highway, and three high-grade highways of the G312, S201 (Emin - Yushugou), S204 (Mosuowan - Shihezi) cross north to south in the farm.

Background The second wave of the general offensive began at 04:00 on 5 May with a Viet Cong (VC) mortar attack on the Newport Bridge, a two-lane concrete and steel span that conveyed traffic across the Saigon River from the capital to Bi√™n H√≤a. When the barrage ended a few minutes later, several hundred soldiers from the 4th Thu Duc Battalion and the 2nd Battalion, 274th Regiment, emerged from a nearby rubber plantation and assaulted the men from the South Vietnamese 5th Marine Battalion that were guarding the eastern end of the bridge but the assault was repulsed. The VC made a second attempt to cut Saigon off from Bi√™n H√≤a at 05:00 when elements from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Dong Nai Regiment attacked the Binh Loi Bridge (), where Highway 1 crossed the Saigon River approximately two kilometers northwest of the Newport Bridge. Troops from the South Vietnamese 6th Marine Battalion prevented sapper teams from getting close enough to destroy the bridge with Satchel charges. The VC eventually withdrew after losing 54 killed and 5 captured. Within a few hours, both of the major bridges between Saigon and Bi√™n H√≤a were open for military traffic. As those two attacks were taking place, a company of People‚Äôs Army of Vietnam (PAVN) soldiers from the K3 Battalion, all wearing South Vietnamese uniforms, crossed the Saigon River in sampans. Making it to the other side without being spotted, the disguised PAVN continued on foot to the Phan Than Gian Bridge (), one of the crossing points that spanned the canal that traced the northern edge of downtown Saigon. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Regional Force soldiers and Marines guarding the bridge challenged the new arrivals. Unable to give the correct password, the PAVN opened fire and stormed the bridge, but the South Vietnamese repulsed the assault. When more government troops arrived on the scene, the PAVN fell back to the suburb of Thi Nghe () where they continued the fight. A few hours later, National Police commander General Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Loan arrived with more policemen and took charge of the clearing operation. As he was leading his men a bullet struck him in the thigh. The wound nearly proved to be fatal, Loan lost his leg and the injury forced him to resign as National Police director. As the fighting got under way on the eastern side of Saigon, II Field Force, Vietnam commander Lieutenant general Frederick C. Weyand and ARVN III Corps commander General L√™ Nguy√™n Khang learned that the enemy had entered the western outskirts of Saigon. Ambush patrols from the ARVN 30th Ranger Battalion screening the farmlands west of Ph√∫ Th·ªç reported numerous VC squad and platoon-size groups moving through their sector. When fired upon, most of the VC tried to evade contact and continued moving toward the city. When the ARVN Airborne Task Force north of Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Allied forces south of the city reported little or no enemy activity, General Khang concluded that the main effort was indeed originating from the west. He moved the 33rd Ranger Battalion into Phu Lam (), three kilometers south of the 30th Ranger Battalion, to block Route 10 into Ch·ª£ L·ªõn and ordered the 38th Ranger Battalion to move from southern Saigon to fill the gap between Phu Lam and Ph√∫ Th·ªç. At II Field Force headquarters at Long Binh Post, Weyand ordered his deputy, Major general John H. Hay, to establish a forward command post at Camp L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát, just as Maj. Gen. Keith L. Ware had done during the Tet Offensive, to control the US units that would soon be fighting on the periphery of Saigon. Hay and some staff from II Field Force flew into Saigon at around 07:00 to organize Hurricane Forward, which Weyand planned to activate by the morning of 6 May. Battle While those preparations were under way, Weyand received word that Colonel Charles Thebaud‚Äôs 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, had engaged several enemy units between the Phu Loi and Dƒ© An Base Camps. The first battle had begun when a pair of companies from the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, had gone to the hamlet of T√¢n Hi·ªáp (), three kilometers northeast of Dƒ© An, to investigate a tip from local authorities about a VC ammunition dump. The troops came under heavy fire from machine guns and recoilless rifles as they tried to enter the hamlet. Thebaud dispatched two more companies of the 1/18th Infantry, along with several troops from the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment and Troop D, 7th Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment. The task force first surrounded T√¢n Hi·ªáp and fought its way through the hamlet, which turned out to contain several battalions from the Dong Nai Regiment as well as support elements from the VC 5th Division. When the fighting ended that evening, the Americans had killed 260 VC and the remainder retreated from the hamlet in disorder. The second engagement in Thebaud‚Äôs sector took place south of Phu Loi when Troops A and B from the 1/4th Cavalry, discovered several battalions from the People‚Äôs Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 165th Regiment hiding in the hamlet of Xom Moi. After giving the residents a chance to flee, the province chief authorized air and artillery strikes. The bombardment lasted all day, and when the US cavalrymen and ARVN soldiers swept through the hamlet the next morning they found 500 PAVN dead in the ruins of Xom Moi, US casualties were 4 killed. The commander of the 165th Regiment, Col. Phan Viet Dung, was so disheartened that he turned himself over to the Americans, telling them what he knew about COSVN‚Äôs plans. By the afternoon of 5 May, the fighting had died away on the eastern side of Saigon and there were no indications of an assault along the southern edge of the capital. North of Tan Son Nhut, the ARVN Airborne task force had skirmished with reconnaissance elements of the PAVN 101st Regiment, but those fights had been brief and the main enemy force had yet to appear. Moreover, the 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division had intercepted six PAVN/VC battalions that had been headed toward the northern side of Saigon, meaning that any future thrust from that direction was likely to be relatively weak. For the moment it appeared that the main battle of the offensive was going to take place in the five kilometers between Tan Son Nhut and Phu Lam, where the latest intelligence indicated that the VC 9th Division and the Cuu Long II Regiment were trying to push into the heart of Saigon. After conferring with Khang, Weyand decided to move two battalions from the 199th Infantry Brigade currently stationed near Long Binh Post to the western side of Saigon to shore up the left flank of the Ranger task force. Weyand instructed the brigade commander, Brigadier general Robert C. Forbes, to block Route 10 and Highway 4, which both entered the city through the suburb of Phu Lam. On the morning of 6 May, trucks from the 48th Transportation Group carried the infantrymen over the Newport Bridge and through the heart of Saigon before depositing them at their destinations. The brigade‚Äôs forward command post and the 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant colonel Kenneth W. Hall, occupied Firebase Horseshoe Bend () on the shoulder of Highway 4, two kilometres southwest of Phu Lam, while the 4th Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Lt. Col. William Mastoris Jr., manned Firebase Stephanie () on Route 10 two kilometers west of Phu Lam. Six 105mm howitzers from Battery C, 2nd Battalion, 40th Artillery Regiment, four M109 howitzers from Battery C, 2nd Battalion, 35th Artillery Regiment and mechanized Troop D, 17th Cavalry Regiment, strengthened the position at Stephanie. General Forbes also regained from the 9th Infantry Division operational control of the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, commanded by Lt. Col. William C. Carper III, which operated from Firebase Smoke ten kilometers south of Horseshoe Bend. As soon as the 4/12th Infantry, had settled into Firebase Stephanie, located next to a Regional Forces post, Mastoris dispatched Company D to search the woods that lined Route 10 farther to the west. After moving around 200 meters, the company spotted a VC force moving east toward the city and opened fire. The firing drew in more VC, and soon Company D found itself outnumbered. Artillery fire from Firebase Stephanie and helicopter gunships from Troops C and D, 3/17th Cavalry, based at T√¢y Ninh Combat Base, more than evened the odds, and Mastoris soon sent another company to assist the one in contact. The fighting ebbed and surged throughout the day, with the VC repeatedly attempting to push up Route 10 toward the city. When darkness fell, at least 139 VC soldiers lay dead on the field, while US losses amounted to 4 killed. When Hurricane Forward became operational at Camp L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát on the morning of 6 May, General Weyand turned his attention to the other major battle that was developing in the western suburbs, a clash between the Cuu Long II Regiment and the 30th Ranger Battalion just southeast of Tan Son Nhut AB. Weyand gave Hay control over the 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry (minus Troop C), from the 25th Infantry Division, with instructions that he use the tanks and armored personnel carriers to support the 30th Ranger Battalion as it tried to retake a pair of hamlets, Ap Binh Long () and Ap Hoa Thanh (), that the Cuu Long II Regiment had turned into makeshift fortresses. Led by Lt. Col. Glenn K. Otis, the 3/4th Cavalry, travelled south from Cu Chi Base Camp along Highway 1, reaching the air base at around 08:30 without incident. While Colonel Otis developed an attack plan with the commander of the 30th Ranger Battalion, government officials armed with loudspeakers spent several hours calling on the VC in Ap Binh Long and Ap Hoa Thanh to surrender. None did, but many civilians fled the hamlets. The Allies then doused the settlements with Tear gas, hoping to win them back without a destructive battle, but gusting winds dispersed the chemicals before they had any real effect. The cavalrymen and Rangers began their assault late in the afternoon, moving south across a field toward Ap Binh Long. The Rangers and armored vehicles faced steadily increasing fire the closer they got to the hamlet, first from mortars and recoilless rifles, and then from machine guns, small arms, and Rocket- propelled grenades (RPGs). The VC, protected by a network of makeshift bunkers and trenches they had constructed since the previous day, shrugged off the suppressive fire that the US vehicle crews attempted to lay down to cover the advance of the Rangers. Realizing the gap could not be closed without taking excessive casualties, Otis and the Ranger commander pulled their men back. Unwilling to let the VC hold a position so near to Tan Son Nhut Air Base, General Khang authorized the use of air strikes and artillery to evict the Cuu Long II Regiment from Ap Binh Long and Ap Hoa Thanh. Three PAVN dead just off Plantation Road in an area which was devastated by air strikes and fires during a battle in and around the Old French Cemetery, 7 May 1968 As the fighting intensified at Ap Binh Long and Ap Hoa Thanh on the morning of 6 May, South Vietnamese officials received word that VC troops had been spotted in the old French military cemetery () just south of the main gate of Tan Son Nhut. General Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n ordered a company from the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, barracked on the southern side of the air base, to investigate. Upon reaching the cemetery, a rectangular park lined with white tombstones and surrounded by a wall of two-story shanty houses, the paratroopers discovered several dozen VC armed with light machine guns, small arms, and a few mortars. The paratroopers spent the entire day battling those troops, killing 60 with help from helicopter gunships and Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) A-1E Skyraiders, and capturing another 11. South Vietnamese losses were light, though among the fatalities was Col. Luu Kim Cuong, commander of both the 33rd Air Wing and the Tan Son Nhut Special Zone. The VC prisoners, all from the 9th Division, said that the cemetery had been designated as a waypoint for planned attacks on Tan Son Nhut AB, the Vietnamese Joint General Staff compound and Camp L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát. Members of the Tan Son Nhut Defense Force and the 7th Airborne Battalion pinned down by heavy enemy sniper fire in the French Cemetery, 6 May ARVN Airborne forces in the French Cemetery, 7 May Concerned that more enemy troops might be on their way to the cemetery, Khang and Hay agreed that Ap Binh Long and Ap Hoa Thanh must be retaken the next day so the Allies could restore the security zone around the air base. To help in that effort, Weyand gave Hay operational control over the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment, a mechanized unit from the 25th Infantry Division stationed at Cu Chi. The battalion commander, Lt. Col. Thomas C. Lodge, brought his unit to Tan Son Nhut early in the morning where it joined up with the 3/4th Cavalry and the 30th Ranger Battalion, arrayed in attack formation just north of Ap Binh Long. On the morning of 7 May, the two battalions of US tanks and armored personnel carriers rolled forward in a line-abreast formation with Rangers screening their advance. The volume of VC fire was less intense than it had been previously, indicating that the air and artillery strikes had taken their toll on the defenders. Hostile fire knocked out one vehicle and damaged seven others, but the Allies got inside the hamlet with few casualties. Employing the firepower of the armored vehicles and the tenacity of the Rangers, the Allies outflanked the VC bunkers one by one and silenced each machine gun or recoilless rifle team within. As evening fell, the surviving VC withdrew to the adjacent hamlet of Ap Hoa Thanh, leaving behind more than 100 dead. On the left flank of the Ranger and US mechanized units, the 199th Infantry Brigade‚Äôs 4/12th Infantry and 3/7th Infantry, maintained their blocking positions in the Phu Lam area along Route 10 and Highway 4, respectively, despite continued efforts by the VC 9th Division to break into the city. From what General Forbes could determine, at least four VC battalions had congregated in the hamlet of B√¨nh Tr·ªã ƒê√¥ng () just west of the line held by the 4/12th Infantry and Troop D, 17th Cavalry. Despite its size, the 9th Division never managed to organize a large-scale and sustained attack. Artillery strikes from Firebase Stephanie and air strikes from Bien Hoa Air Base inflicted additional though uncounted casualties on the VC trapped in B√¨nh Tr·ªã ƒê√¥ng. The VC‚Äôs growing disorganization became apparent later in the day when Forbes sent Company B, 4/12th Infantry and Companies A and D, 3/7th Infantry, in a wide flanking maneuver around the southern side of Binh Tri Dong to establish a block on the opposite side of the hamlet. Right before noon just after the three companies had finished preparing their new positions, a battalion from the 271st Regiment came marching down Route 10 oblivious to the danger. The US soldiers opened fire at close range. Startled, the VC broke formation and headed north into a wooded area after having lost 44 of their number killed; 2 Americans died in the brief firefight. When night fell, the 199th Infantry Brigade‚Äôs blocking forces remained firmly ensconced on either side of B√¨nh Tr·ªã ƒê√¥ng. Also on 7 May units from the 1st and 25th Infantry Divisions had intercepted several VC battalions outside the capital. Approximately five kilometers south of Dƒ© An Base Camp, elements from the 1st and the 2nd Battalions, 28th Infantry Regiment, killed some 95 soldiers from the K3 Battalion, Dong Nai Regiment, the unit that had been responsible for the attack on the Binh Loi and Phan Tan Gian Bridges on 5 May. On the opposite side of Saigon, Companies A and B of the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment and Troop C, 3/4th Cavalry, engaged the PAVN 3rd Battalion, 88th Regiment, a few kilometres southwest of H√≥c M√¥n District, killing a reported 199 PAVN, including the battalion commander and his entire staff. Several kilometers to the south in the countryside just west of Tan Son Nhut, Company C, 1/27th Infantry and elements of the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, took turns attacking a battalion from the 271st Regiment, killing 100 VC over the course of two days. By the morning of 8 May, all of the intelligence available to Weyand and Khang indicated that the VC‚Äôs western thrust against Saigon had failed. Although soldiers from the Cuu Long II Regiment and the 9th Division were still fighting in the sector west of Ph√∫ Th·ªç and Phu Lam, they were no longer trying to reach the city; most were hunkered down in defensive positions and some were beginning to retreat. The most visible sign of progress came late that afternoon when the 30th Ranger Battalion and the 3/4th Cavalry, regained the hamlet of Ap Thanh Hoa, killing a rearguard force of some 50 VC that had stayed behind to cover the withdrawal of the Cuu Long II Regiment‚Äôs headquarters. As for the 9th Division battalions farther to the south in the hamlet of B√¨nh Tr·ªã ƒê√¥ng, those units remained pinned in place by the 4/12th Infantry and the 3/7th Infantry. Subjected to incessant bombing and shelling for the last several days, some of the 9th Division battalions were no longer combat effective. The 4th Battalion, 272nd Regiment, for example, now had 43 men fit for duty out of an original complement of some 500 soldiers. When his subordinates reported their predicament, 9th Division commander General Thai gave them permission to withdraw from the B√¨nh Tr·ªã ƒê√¥ng pocket. To assist the breakout, COSVN organized several diversionary attacks. In the first, the Sub- Region 1 command north of Saigon directed the PAVN 101st Regiment to assault Tan Son Nhut in the early morning hours of 9 May. After finding its way blocked by the ARVN 5th Airborne Battalion four kilometers north of Tan Son Nhut and just west of the Quang Trung Infantry Center (), the 101st Regiment attacked. The PAVN began their assault with a concentrated barrage of RPGs that knocked the defenders back on their heels. PAVN soldiers got within fifty meters of the ARVN command post before the paratroopers steadied their line. The tide of battle soon turned in favor of the South Vietnamese when reinforcements from the ARVN 1st and 7th Airborne Battalions arrived led by the commander of the Airborne Division, Maj. Gen. D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng. He organized a defensive line that stymied all efforts by the 101st Regiment to penetrate or outflank the position. The fighting continued all day and into the night. When it ended on the morning of 10 May, a few dozen survivors from the 101st Regiment retreated north, leaving behind nearly 300 of their dead or badly wounded, while the ARVN had lost 17 dead and 52 wounded. COSVN initiated a second diversion on the morning of 9 May, this one to open an escape route through H·∫≠u Nghƒ©a Province. The command ordered Sub-Region 2 to attack Firebase Maury (), an outpost that the commander of the 25th Infantry Division, General Fillmore K. Mearns, had just established in ƒê·ª©c H√≤a District approximately nine kilometers south of Cu Chi, and which stood squarely in the path of retreat that the 9th Division intended to use. Manning the post were Companies A and B, 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, Troop I, 3rd Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and artillery made up of the towed 105mm howitzers from Batteries B and C of the 7th Battalion, 11th Artillery Regiment and the M109 howitzers of Battery A, 3rd Battalion, 13th Artillery Regiment. To assist the assault, Sub-Region 2 headquarters instructed elements from the 208th Artillery Regiment to rocket the 25th Infantry Division‚Äôs base camp at Cu Chi. At 01:00 on 9 May, PAVN artillery crews sent a salvo of thirty rockets crashing into Cu Chi, killing 7 Americans and wounding 48 others. An hour later, PAVN infantry assaulted Firebase Maury from the north and from the south in battalion strength. While the defenders were preoccupied with these attacks, a team of sappers used some encroaching woodlands to reach the western portion of the perimeter undetected. After cutting their way through the wire, the sappers destroyed five M109 howitzers and two ammunition trucks with satchel charges before slipping back out of the perimeter. When the shooting stopped a few hours later, 10 Americans were dead and another 66 wounded. The PAVN left behind 18 dead. The troops at Firebase Maury spent the better part of the day clearing away destroyed equipment. The beleaguered 9th Division units at B√¨nh Tr·ªã ƒê√¥ng exploited the diversions on the morning of 9 May to make their escape. VC soldiers crept out of the bunkers and spider holes that had kept them alive during the last five days and began marching west in small groups, leaving behind a great deal of equipment and most of their dead in order to travel quickly. The VC showed their usual efficiency in slipping past the US troops positioned along Route 10 west of the village. When the sun came up, ARVN engineers moved in to disable any booby traps the VC might have left behind and to bury the 277 dead VC they found in the rubble. Over the next few days, Allied units to the west of Saigon continued to engage small groups of withdrawing PAVN/VC. The three Ranger battalions west of Ph√∫ Th·ªç and Tan Son Nhut killed a reported 87 VC on 10 May and another 101 the next day. Farther west in the swamplands that lay on the border of Gia ƒê·ªãnh and H·∫≠u Nghƒ©a Provinces, the 4/9th Infantry, killed several dozen soldiers from the retreating 9th Division, while the 1/27th Infantry, mauled an element of the 208th Artillery Regiment, killing 66 gunners and capturing three 122mm rocket launchers. In the 199th Infantry Brigade sector to the south, the 4/12th Infantry, completed its sweep of the Route 10 corridor west of Phu Lam, while the 2/3rd Infantry, cleared out the last VC diehards along the edge of the city south of Highway 4 and to the east of Firebase Horseshoe Bend, killing 16 VC on 11 May. To expedite clearing operations in western Gia ƒê·ªãnh Province, General Mearns ordered the 4/9th Infantry, to establish a firebase approximately four kilometers west of Tan Son Nhut next to Route 234, a north-south road that crossed the enemy‚Äôs line of retreat. As Firebase Pike VI () took shape on the morning of 11 May, Mearns moved two batteries of 105mm howitzers and a battery of M109 howitzers into the perimeter. Mindful of the recent disaster at Maury, Means also sent engineers to construct earthen walls for all three batteries before evening fell. The preparations paid off later that night when the PAVN/VC bombarded the firebase with several hundred rounds of 82mm mortar fire. None of the howitzers were knocked out of action and the defenders sustained only light casualties. When the barrage ended, a battalion from the 272nd Regiment assaulted the base. Facing a storm of fire that included Beehive anti-personnel rounds from the 105mm howitzers that filled the air with steel darts, the PAVN withdrew after losing 110 men. The failed assault on Firebase Pike VI proved to be the last major contact in the western suburbs as the fighting thereafter gravitated into H·∫≠u Nghƒ©a and T√¢y Ninh Provinces. In that same period between 9 and 12 May, the VC units that had entered areas to the north and to the east of Saigon made their own escape from the Capital Military District. Before retreating, soldiers belonging to Sub-Regions 4 and 5 tried again on four separate occasions to destroy the Binh Loi () and Newport Bridges. The final attack that took place on the morning of 12 May was the most successful. Gunners from the 4th Thu Duc Battalion scored a direct hit on the Newport Bridge with a recoilless rifle, sending a chunk of steel-reinforced concrete almost sixty meters long and half the width of the bridge crashing into the river. The VC then promptly packed up his weapons and hustled away before helicopter gunships could retaliate. For the Allies, the damage inflicted on the bridge proved to be little more than an inconvenience. The temporary loss of one lane did not seriously impede traffic, and over the next four weeks engineers repaired the otherwise intact bridge. Aftermath Weapons captured in the fighting at the French Cemetery PAVN/VC losses exceeded 2,600 killed in the fighting west and north of Saigon. PAVN/VC losses in and around Saigon between 5 and 13 May amounted to 3,058 dead and 221 captured. ARVN losses were 90 dead and 16 missing while US losses were 76 dead and 1 missing.

It was conceived in 1886 by Charles Jones the first architect, engineer and surveyor of Ealing Council. Its construction next to Ealing Town Hall was funded entirely by public donations and its operations governed by the Victoria Hall Trust, established in 1893. In 2015 the Council announced plans to sell off the Grade II listed building to a development partner on a long lease. The plan led to protests by local residents' groups who called for the Hall to continue to be available for use as a public asset. History =1800s= Charles Jones' original drawing of the interior of the Victoria Hall The hall's origins and early history are recorded in Jones' 1904 book Ealing: From Village to Corporate Town. He noted that following the start of building a new Town Hall for the Council: \\"One great desideratum for a growing district like Ealing, viz a public assembly room, was wanting...The happy thought occurred to me that a permanent benefit to the poor might be associated with a Jubilee Hall, and be a perpetual memorial of our beloved Queen.\\" He put the idea to the Chairman of the Ealing Local Board, Edward Montague Nelson, who agreed \\"with alacrity\\". The Middlesex County Times reported at a public meeting at the end of January 1887 that the project was launched to what the paper reported as enthusiastic applause.  Initial funding  It was made clear from the start that no public money was to be involved in the project. While the Town Hall itself was being paid for largely from the sale of the old building, the Memorial Hall, as it was then called, would be paid for by public subscription. An initial sum of nearly ¬£2,000 had already been raised at the time of the public launch, and more subscriptions promised. Mr Montague Nelson, who chaired the 1887 public meeting, said as part of his address: \\"It is fair to assume that from a hall which is to be built in this way by public subscriptions, on which there is no interest to pay on capital, there will be an income over and above its working expenses [which] should he vested in the existing Local Board, for the time being, as Trustee and devoted by them to local objects‚Ä¶. We might grant a substantial sum annually to, say, the Cottage Hospital and the Almshouses, to the School of Science and Art of which we have one; or a grant to the Free Library.\\" The scheme quickly took off. \\"Although the whole of the ¬£5,000 for the hall was not obtained at once, a proposal to raise the balance by debentures of ¬£10 each, repayable out of the profits without interest, soon cleared off the remaining debt, and left the memorial hall free as a charitable bequest forever,\\" notes Jones.  Original extent  The original design was for a high main hall at first-floor level with smaller rooms, including the Prince's Hall at ground and basement level beneath. It allowed for the installation of an organ at the east end with the rose window visible behind, as shown in Jones' own drawing of 1888. As Jones notes this had not been fully achieved by the official opening by Edward, Prince of Wales on 15 December 1888: \\"The only regret we have is that the organ, as shown in the original design, was not carried out: ¬£500 still remains at deposit for this object, and some day we may hope to see it accomplished, when Ealing will take its place, as it should have done years ago, as a first-class musical suburb.\\" =Further development= The hall was made available for hire from an early stage for events such as dances, wedding receptions and political rallies. Victoria Hall became a separate building from the Town Hall after the latter was extended at the northeast corner.Ordnance Survey map of 1918 The only significant alteration after that date was the infilling of the open 'area' in the basement to the south, which had been a light well to the Prince's Hall.Ordnance Survey map of 1934 In the 1920s and the 1930s some internal changes were made. The platform inside the Victoria Hall at the west end, which had been accessed from an internal staircase at the southwest, was removed. The external stairs to the second west bay on the north side were also removed, which led to the closure of the access through the bay. At around the same time an external covered way was removed. Public access to the Prince's Hall and its related spaces became mainly through stairs below the main internal staircase to the Victoria Hall.Ealing Borough Surveyor's 1934 Plan The organ, which had lain unused for some time, was removed and sold to the organ building firm J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1957. The disposal of the organ caused a protracted discussion between Ealing Council and the Charity Commission over the use of the money which was eventually donated to local charities. With the organ no longer in the Hall there was space to simplify the stage, which previously had been on two levels, thereby enlarging the capacity of the hall. In the 1960s modernisation of the halls took place with false ceiling panels and contemporary lighting. The Prince's Hall was converted into a tea room and was used as a staff canteen with access directly onto the street. This development significantly changed the character of the building. =Redevelopment= In July 2016, in the context of large budget deficit and the need to reshape its services, the council announced an agreement with a hotel developer to convert part of the Town Hall and the Victoria Hall into a boutique hotel. Continuing controversy led to an investigation started in 2018 by the Charity Commission to consider whether the Council has the right to sell the Trust's assets. On 27 November 2019, the Charity Commission published a draft 'Scheme' that would allow the council to sell off the Victoria Hall, which is held by a charitable trust, to a developer. The scheme prompted criticism from campaigners and concern about the limited amount of time available in a consultation period that would run over the Christmas period.

It is classified as the second rank of royal temple and can be considered a temple of Prince Pinklao. This temple built since late Ayutthaya period by wealthy Chinese named Hong, who was donated funds to build a temple on the banks of the Khlong Bangkok Yai. Hence the names Wat Hong, Wat Chao Sua Hong or Wat Chao Khrua Hong after the benefactor. After the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, King Taksin decided to locate his new capital further away from Burma, he chose this area in Thonburi between two canals Bangkok Yai and Bangkok Noi. He built his palace, Wang Derm near the old fort (Wichai Prasit Fort) and chose to worship at Wat Hong just 500 m (1,640 ft) to the south. During his reign, he also has patronized this temple in the royal support since it was a religious educational centre. Until the reign of King Nangklao (Rama III) there was a major restoration of the temple. Within the ordination hall, the principal Buddha statue was enshrined, named \\"Phra Saen\\", which is a bronze Buddha statue in the Lan Xang art style. Its history was enshrined at one temple in Chiang Taeng (Steung Treng). Later, King Mongkut (Rama IV) invoke along with Emerald Buddha and enshrined it in this temple. Phra Sean is considered to be a very sacred Buddha statue, there are many people worshiping and vowing. When those who had vowed had achieved the desired results often preferred to make a votive offering on sticky rice, pla ra (pickled fish) and boiled eggs. The ordination hall has beautiful architecture with ornate frames for the doors and windows and sculptured doors. The murals of the hall adorn all four walls inside depict the Mahanipata Jataka (Ten Great Birth Stories of the Buddha), tales of the ten previous lives of Lord Buddha. The sermon hall and where Buddha statues are enshrined. The main Buddha statue in this hall is one of gold from the late Sukhothai period. Originally it was encased in cement, when cement was cracked in the year 1957, it was found that it was actually a golden Buddha statue. Believe that it is a contemporary Buddha statue to the golden Buddha statue of Wat Traimit in Chainatown. The temple there is a shrine in honour of King Taksin located just outside the temple near the Khlong Bangkok Yai. This was built by members of the community in gratitude for the king‚Äôs restoration of the temple. As well as a sacred pool that is believed to be a source of holy water for those who worship to bring water to bath or drink. In the year 1915, the land of the temple was also the location of the Bangkok Yai district office. Before moving to the current location at the Ratchadaphisek road near Tha Phra intersection in year 1988. Besides, the nearby Itsaraphap MRT station, the extension station of the MRT Blue Line. The main theme of this station is the golden swan, which pays tribute to the majestic Wat Hong Rattanaram and the ceilings and columns of the main terminal are decorated with golden swan iconography. This is because the word \\"Hong\\" in Thai means hamsa, a mythical swan according to the beliefs of Thais and Hindus and is also a steed of Lord Brahma.

Krider, 1876 Peter Lewis Krider (February 14, 1821 - May 12, 1895), also known as P.L. Krider, was a noted American silversmith, active in Philadelphia. Krider was born in Philadelphia and worked on a farm from ages 10 to 14. From 1835-1841 was apprentice to Philadelphia silversmith John Curry, and worked as a journeyman for about 15 months at the well-known firm of Robert & William Wilson. Around 1842 he moved to Boston, where he worked for silversmith Obadiah Rich. When Rich sold out his establishment to Brackett, Crosby & Brown, Krider took charge. He later returned to Philadelphia to serve as the Wilsons' foreman. In 1850 he established his own firm, Krider & Co., working from 1859 until about 1870 as Krider & Biddle with his partner John W. Biddle, and subsequently as Peter L. Krider. According to the Federal Industrial Censuses of 1860, 1870, and 1880, and a short description in Philadelphia's Leading Industries (1866), his business was well capitalized and employed as many as 35 skilled workers. The firm was sold to August Weber in 1888 and renamed the Peter L. Krider Co., which remained in business until 1910. Krider produced large amounts of solid silver flatware and hollowware, often sold through retailers such as Bailey and Company, J. E. Caldwell, and firms outside Philadelphia. He also created society and exposition medals, including award medals for the Centennial Exposition in 1876. His works are collected in the Art Institute of Chicago, Carnegie Museum of Art, Cooper Hewitt Museum, Dallas Museum of Art, De Young Museum, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Winterthur Museum, and Yale University Art Gallery.

The book contains 71 pages of back matter largely detailing independent corroboration of Sheeran's confessions that came to light after the book was first published. The book is the basis for the 2019 film The Irishman, which was directed by Martin Scorsese and starred Robert De Niro as Frank Sheeran.

Chip Fleischer, the book's publisher, wrote a detailed reply to Tonelli's piece, calling it \\"irresponsible in the extreme, not to mention damaging,\\" which Slate also published.

Description In criminal prosecutions, a voluntary act may be excused as the product of duress if another person procures the actor's cooperation in a crime by an illegal threat that would overcome the resistance of a person of ordinary firmness. Certain crimes, such as murder, have been considered by the common law of most Commonwealth jurisdictions as so heinous as to be excepted from this doctrine, which is sometimes considered paradoxical in light of the fact that a mere provocation can serve as a partial defense to such charges. In the United States, if a person of ordinary firmness would be deterred by a reprisal from exercising his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, then this reprisal is considered to have a chilling effect, and it is unlawful for the government to engage in it. Some individuals are not deterred by such reprisals, but rather are riled up by them, and their determination to speak out is increased. However, in Bennie v. Munn, the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska ruled, \\"It would be unjust to allow a defendant to escape liability for a First Amendment violation just because an unusually determined plaintiff persists in his protected activity.\\" Cases In Ford v. City of Yakima, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit found that \\"a retaliatory police action such as an arrest or search and seizure would chill a person of ordinary firmness from engaging in future First Amendment activity.\\" Jason Kessler and three white nationalist and neo-Nazi organizations, as organizers of the Unite the Right Rally, filed a suit alleging that Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas and Virginia State Police Lt. Becky Crannis-Curl, by issuing orders not to engage crowds, allowed counter-protesters a heckler's veto that \\"injured Plaintiffs in a way likely to chill a person of ordinary firmness from further participation in that activity\\".

She began her career as a gynaecologist and obstetrician and later took up law, specialising in family law and medical negligence. Early life and medical career Margaret Hale was born on 25 July 1915 in West Bromwich to Reginald Wood Hale, an iron merchant, and Clara Lilian (n√©e Poulton). She was raised in Stourbridge and attended Abbey College in Malvern, Worcestershire. Turning down a place at Oxford University, she instead chose to read veterinary medicine at Birmingham University, later transferring to medicine. She married her first husband, Ralph Weddell, in 1937, and had two children as a student without interrupting her studies. She graduated in 1942 with a gold medal in obstetrics and gynaecology. After graduating, she was a house officer and then a gynaecology registrar at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. She married her second husband Peter Puxon, a solicitor, in 1944 and moved to Colchester. She passed her membership examination for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (MRCOG) in 1946; the next year, she received an MD in obstetrics from Birmingham University and was made a consultant gynaecologist by Essex County Council. Legal career When Puxon became pregnant with her third child in 1949, she was advised to take time off work because she had had two earlier miscarriages. To avoid boredom, she started a correspondence course in law which she completed after her son was born. She later moved to London, where she was offered a pupillage. When she was called to the bar in 1954, a clerk warned her that he would not give her any work; she initially made a living by taking on legal aid cases and divorce cases for returned servicemen, cases that were undesirable to most other barristers. She married her third husband, Morris Williams, also a solicitor, in 1955, though she continued to use her second married name, Puxon. She established a divorce practice and gradually built a reputation in family law; she represented the Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman in his divorce from singer Mandy Smith, and in J v C she represented an adopting mother in a case where the natural mother wished to regain custody of a child she had put up for adoption. In the 1970s, Puxon switched interests from family law to medical negligence, typically representing plaintiffs; her dual qualifications in medicine and law gave her a niche advantage in this area. She provided advice to Bourn Hall Clinic, an infertility clinic, about the wording of consent contracts for sperm and egg donors. When the Family Planning Association was threatened with legal action, they consulted Puxon about whether the prescription of the morning-after pill was equivalent to providing an abortion; Puxon advised that if the pill was used within 72 hours, its use did not amount to abortion by the meaning of the law because the ovum had not yet implanted in the wall of the uterus. Puxon was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1979 and was appointed as Queen's Counsel in 1982. She was a deputy circuit judge from 1970 to 1986, and a recorder from 1986 until her retirement in 1993. Although she had left obstetric and gynaecological practice by the 1950s, she continued to contribute to leading medical textbooks including Progress in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (1983), In Vitro Fertilisation: Past, Present and Future (1986), Gynaecology (1991), and Safe Practice in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (1994). Death Puxon died from pneumonia on 1 April 2008 at King Edward VII's Hospital in London.

He is known for his artwork, depicting living and extinct animals as well as surrealist scenes, and for his speculative evolution project \\"Snaiad\\", which explores a fictional alien planet and its diverse biosphere. Together with Australian paleoartist John Conway and British paleontologist Darren Naish, Kosemen co-authored All Yesterdays, a 2012 book exploring speculative ideas in paleoart, and Cryptozoologicon, a book applying speculative evolution ideas to cryptids, both of which were widely covered in international media.  Biography and career  Born in Ankara, Turkey in 1984, Kosemen studied at the Sabancƒ± University in Istanbul and at the Cornell University in New York. Kosemen also studied at the Goldsmiths College in London, from which he holds a Master's degree in Documentary Film and Media Studies. He has worked as an editor for the magazine Colors by Benetton and in several different advertising agencies. From a young age, Kosemen was interested in paleontology, extinct animals and evolutionary history, envisioned by him as a way to explore \\"strange creatures and strange worlds\\". In 2010, Kosemen met Kerimcan G√ºlery√ºz, head of an art exhibition project called The Empire Project, which prompted him to further explore symbolism in art. Since 2010, Kosemen's artwork has been the subject of several exhibitions in Istanbul, such as the exhibition \\"Sanctuary\\" which was held at the art space in the quarter Karak√∂y called Space Debris from January 19 to February 17 of 2018. His artwork ranges from scientifically accurate depictions of prehistoric life to surrealist paintings. In 2011, Kosemen discovered that he is descended from D√∂nmeh, Jews forced to convert to Islam in the 17th century. He published a book about them, Osman Hasan and the Tombstone Photographs of the D√∂nmes, in 2014. In 2012, Kosemen co-authored the book All Yesterdays with Australian paleoartist John Conway and British paleontologist Darren Naish. The book, which garnered wide attention and positive reviews, explores speculative ideas in paleoart, art reconstructing prehistoric animals. Conway and Kosemen began working on the book together after they realized that a vast majority of modern dinosaur artwork did not really portray dinosaurs as real animals, ignoring features such as various type of soft tissue (e.g. skin flaps, pouches, fat) that are unlikely to have survived through fossilization. Both All Yesterdays and Conways's, Naish's and Kosemen's later book Cryptozoologicon were widely featured in the media. Kosemen's 2019 book The Disappearing City, explores and collects photographs of 20th century Turkish street signs and architecture in Istanbul. Describing the book, Kosemen has stated that it came about since Istanbul is rapidly replacing its 20th century buildings and that the city as such is \\"losing some valuable buildings of a type that are being preserved in, say, Tel Aviv\\". Kosemen is also known for his \\"Snaiad\\" speculative evolution project, which explores a fictional alien world called Snaiad, with a diverse ecosystem of creatures designed by Kosemen himself. Kosemen hopes to eventually publish the project as a book.  Tangent Realms  A documentary about C. M. Kosemen and his work, titled Tangent Realms: The Worlds of C. M. K√∂semen and directed by indie filmmaker Kevin Schreck, was released in 2018. The film explores not only Kosemen's art, but also his personal life and questions he and other people face at some point in their lives. The film received awards at several indie film festivals.

Named after the NBC logo, the service launched on July 15, 2020. Early availability for Xfinity Flex customers began on April 15, 2020, with X1 customers receiving the preview by May 1. As of September 2020, Peacock has over 15 million subscribers. History On January 14, 2019, NBCUniversal announced that it would launch an over-the-top streaming service in 2020, and at the same time announced a reorganization created NBCUniversal Direct-to-Consumer and Digital Enterprises under chairman Bonnie Hammer. NBCUniversal announced the name \\"Peacock\\" and April 2020 availability on September 17, 2019. The announcement also included new original programming, NBCU property reboots, and that NBC series The Office and Parks and Recreation would be taken off from rival streaming services Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video. The series would join the service once their exclusive streaming rights to rival streaming services expire, with Parks and Recreation joining in October 2020 and The Office joining in January 2021. On January 16, 2020, Comcast announced that Peacock would soft launch for Xfinity cable and broadband customers on April 15, 2020, before launching nationally on July 15, 2020. Distribution Peacock has three tiers of service: Free, Premium, and Premium Plus. The Free tier has a subset of the content of the upper two tiers and targets its users with advertising. The middle tier, Peacock Premium, has the advertising as well but provides the full library of content. In both ad-supported tiers, commercials are limited to five minutes per hour. The upper tier, Peacock Premium Plus, provides the full library without ads. Peacock Free is available at no charge to all U.S. Internet users. Peacock Premium is available as a monthly subscription but also is included in some services from TV service providers including Xfinity and Cox. Subscribers to Peacock Premium, whether subscribing directly or receiving service through a provider, can upgrade to the ad-free service, Peacock Premium Plus, for an additional monthly cost. On May 6, 2020, a distribution deal with Apple was announced. As part of the deal, Peacock will be available on iOS devices and Apple TV on launch. Furthermore, content from both Peacock tiers will be listed in the Apple TV app and users from Apple devices will have the ability to subscribe to Peacock Premium with an in-app purchase. On July 20, the service became available on PlayStation 4. On June 23, 2020, Canadian broadcaster Corus Entertainment announced that it had acquired exclusive Canadian broadcast rights to Peacock original programming. On September 18, 2020, NBCUniversal and Roku reached an agreement to add Peacock to Roku's devices in the United States, narrowly avoiding a blackout of NBCUniversal's TV Everywhere apps due to a dispute over revenue sharing and advertising inventory assignment. On September 21, Peacock officially launched on Roku. Content The service is drawn primarily from the NBCUniversal library, including subsidiaries such as Universal Pictures and Universal Television. It is suggested to include at least 15,000 hours of content on- launch without a subscription, and an additional 5,000 hours of content for Premium subscribers. Current episodes of NBC series will become available on Peacock the day after their premiere for Premium subscribers; non-subscribers will receive them on a week's delay. On January 26, 2020, it was announced that The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers will stream on Peacock at 8:00 and 9:00 p.m. ET, respectively, ahead of their television premieres on NBC. The decision, however, was criticized by many of NBC's affiliate groups out of concern that the \\"pre-airs\\" of both late-night talk shows on Peacock would cannibalize viewership for the shows on local NBC stations. Peacock also offers a lineup of around 25 curated digital linear channels, featuring long-form and digital-originated programming content from NBCUniversal's broadcast and cable properties (such as Today All Day, a digital extension of NBC's morning show Today), as well as third-party content providers. They are designed to emulate a traditional broadcast programming experience (similar to services such as Pluto TV and Xumo, the latter of which was purchased by NBCUniversal parent Comcast in February 2020). = Original programming = =Third-party content= On December 23, 2019, Lionsgate announced it would license library content for Peacock, as part of a larger agreement by Comcast to renew its carriage of Starz. In turn, NBCUniversal will license content for StarzPlay in the U.S. and internationally. On January 16, 2020, Peacock acquired the streaming rights to the Warner Bros. series Two and a Half Men and George Lopez, as well as The Matrix films. In February 2020, A&E; Networks licensed some titles from the A&E; and History libraries to Peacock. On July 1, 2020, ViacomCBS announced that it would non-exclusively license some of its television series and films to Peacock, such as The Affair, Everybody Hates Chris, Ray Donovan, and Undercover Boss among others. The service will also hold rights to several Paramount Pictures films under a limited exclusivity window from 2021 to 2023. On July 14, 2020, the service acquired the Canadian drama Departure for a U.S. premiere. On July 17, 2020, Cinedigm announced that they had licensed over a dozen films and three streaming channels for Peacock's launch, with hundreds of other films and TV episodes to follow. = Sports programming = In January 2020, NBC announced that the service would carry non-televised Premier League soccer matches and NBC's coverage of the Olympic Games (with plans to stream their opening and closing ceremonies live on the service). On July 9, 2020, NBC announced that the NBC Sports Gold Premier League Pass would be discontinued and its content moved into Peacock Premium at no additional charge, offering 175 Premier League games not on television per-season, along with on-demand replays of all matches. As part of the national launch, all matches played on July 15, 2020 were carried exclusively by Peacock for free. = News programming = The service was to feature an international news channel as part of a joint venture with Britain's Sky News (whose parent company Sky plc had been recently acquired by Comcast), but the proposed service was scrapped in August 2020.

At the 2016 census, it had a population of 3,415. Sandylands, one of the first houses built in Busselton, was constructed in the area beginning in 1840 by Charles Bussell, the younger brother of John Bussell. Geographe was developed as an urban area in the mid-1990s, with the Port Geographe Marina, which was opened in 1997, being constructed as part of the development; a state school, Geographe Primary School, was opened in the suburb in 2002. The construction of the marina caused seaweed to be trapped at the west of the development during winter, generating piles of the plants up to high that rendered the beach unusable and resulted in health problems due to the hydrogen sulphide (rotten egg) smell; erosion also occurred at nearby Wonnerup Beach to the east due to the new marina. Therefore from 2013 to 2015 the government Department of Transport funded works that reconfigured the port structures to reduce the severity of the seaweed accumulation and erosion.

Over the years, the building changed many times, including its architecture and purpose. One alteration was to build a theatre hall inside. __TOC__  History  The area included several buildings. The main building was inaugurated on 1 January 1898 as Ljubljana's power plant. Shortly after opening, the plant struggled as the electricity generated was expensive. The high cost was due to poor calculations and the price of coal imports. Everything changed in 1901 once the tram service became a large daily user of electricity. The power station stood during the World Wars and worked until the 1960s. Other power stations were built, and electricity production moved to them. The old building was gradually abandoned. Until the fall of the Iron Curtain the complex of buildings was not used. Stara mestna elektrarna Bunker - organisation of artist activities Change came in the mid-1980s and 1990s, when young alternative artists such as Ema Kugler and theatre directors Matja≈æ Berger(1997 Rotacija kozmosa 100, Ob stoletnici Mestne elektrarne ljubljanske) and Enrique Vargas within the framework of the Exodus festival. They started a new life called (in Slovenian) Stara elektrarna. After the 1980s the building was called old power station. Keeping the historical exterior, the building housed technology and cultural organizations. In the twentieth century the theatre hall opened. Electric company Elektro Ljubljana opened a museum of electricity and supported theatrical activities. The artistic field is supported by institute Bunker. They hosted artistic festivals including Mladi levi , Exponto, Exodos and Mesto ≈æensk.

Its main image is a statue of Amida Ny≈çrai. It was the bodaiji of the Imagawa clan, a powerful Sengoku period daimy≈ç clan. The temple is noted for its Japanese garden, which is a nationally designated Place of Scenic Beauty; however, the temple is only open to the public for two days each autumn, and it is not possible to view this garden other than during that period. History Rinzai-ji was founded in 1536, by Imagawa Ujichika for his son, Imagawa Yoshimoto, on the site of a villa owned by his mother at the base of Shizuhata Castle. Yoshimoto had been sent into the priesthood as he was the third son, and was not regarded as being in the line of succession. His uncle, Sessai Ch≈çr≈ç was the founding priest. However, when both of Yoshimoto's elder brothers died, he returned to a secular life and became chieftain of the Imagawa clan after a bloody succession dispute. The temple continued to be used as the bodaiji for the clan. The temple was burned down in 1568 wen the Takeda clan of Kai Province invaded Suruga Province. When the young Tokugawa Ieyasu was held hostage in Sunpu by the Imagawa clan, he was sent to Rinzai-ji to be tutored by Sessai Ch≈çr≈ç. During the invasion of Suruga Province by the Takeda clan in 1568, Rinzai-ji was burned down. It was rebuilt by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1582. A number of buildings at the temple date from the Edo period, including the current Main Hall and Sanmon.

She was married to the actor and theater manager Charles Langlois. Jeanne Perrette Le Chevalier and her spouse and son Alexandre came to Sweden as members of the French theatre and opera company Acad√©mie royale de musique, which was engaged by Jean-Baptiste Land√© to perform at the royal court and at the Bollhuset in Stockholm in 1723‚Äì1727. She was a leading member of the theatre and her specialty was queen- and character roles. In 1726, she was noted for her performance as Premi√©re Berg√©re in a libretto created by her husband and performed in honour of the birthday of Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden. The Langlois family chose to remain in Sweden when the French theatre was dissolved. In 1729, she was engaged as an agent to recruit a new French theatre company to perform in Sweden, and she accompanied Carl Gustaf Tessin and Ulla Tessin to France. However, in the end, nothing came of the project. In 1730, her husband acquired a permit from the guilds to trade in smaller luxury articles to support the family. He applied for it because she was a married woman and therefore legally a minor, but in practice, his wife used the permit and supported the family with the luxury trade for several years, becoming a successful businesswoman. She occasionally continued to perform on stage when French-language plays were performed in Bollhuset theatre, such as in La M√©d√©e et Jason in 1740 and La scene de reconniassance in 1748. In 1752, it is noted the Langlois couple gave French lessons; her husband was the instructor of the pages of the royal court, while she hosted a Pension school for daughters of the nobility.

He founded and directs the ‚ÄúBerlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology‚Äù. (BIMSB, Max-Delbr√ºck-Center for Molecular Medicine). He leads the Rajewsky lab, where he studies how RNA regulates gene expression. He also co-chairs ‚ÄúLifeTime\\", a pan-European research initiative of more than 90 academic institutions and 70 companies, which aims to revolutionize healthcare by mapping, understanding, and targeting cells during disease progression. LifeTime integrates several technologies: single-cell multiomics, machine learning, and personalized disease models such as organoids. Rajewsky has received numerous awards and honors, including the most prestigious German award, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, endowed with 2.5 million euros by the German Research Foundation (DFG).  Early life and education  Nikolaus Rajewsky is the son of the Immunologist Klaus Rajewsky and the political scientist Christiane Rajewsky. He was born in Cologne. Between 1988 and 1993 he studied mathematics and physics at the University of Cologne and received his doctorate in theoretical physics in 1997 with his thesis Exact results for one-dimensional stochastic processes. From 1991 to 1996, Rajewsky studied piano at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen and completed his studies with the artistic diploma (k√ºnstlerische Reifepr√ºfung). Career and research Starting 1998, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow for mathematical statistical physics at Rutgers University in New Jersey and then, from 1999 to 2001, on computational biology at the Rockefeller University in New York City where he became a research professor in 2002. In 2003, he became an assistant professor at New York University (tenure track, Department of Biology and Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences). In 2006, Rajewsky returned to Germany where he became a full professor at the Max-Delbr√ºck-Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in Berlin-Buch and at the Charit√© ‚Äì Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin. In 2008, Nikolaus Rajewsky founded the ‚ÄúBerlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology‚Äù (BIMSB). The mission of BIMSB is to directly integrate different levels of gene regulation to better understand how genotypes translate into phenotypes. This is achieved by promoting a highly collaborative environment and the synergistic application of computational and experimental methods. More recently, BIMSB engages in applying novel methods to disease progressions to find points where cells deviate from health. By understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these deviations, new therapeutic targets can be identified. BIMSB integrates experimental and computational methods. BIMSB received initial funding from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Berlin Senate as a pilot project. After a successful evaluation by the BMBF, it secured permanent funding of about 18 Million Euros per year. Since its beginning, BIMSB is headed by Nikolaus Rajewsky. The Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin (HU) included BIMSB in their (successful) application for the Excellence Initiative and provided the real estate on the new HU life science Campus in Berlin- Mitte. This neighbourhood is important for the BIMSB scientific mission and promotes collaborations between the HU, the Charit√© and the MDC. The BMBF provided additional money for the new building (33.5 million euros). Altogether, 21 group leaders have been recruited to BIMSB; currently 16 are there. In spring 2019 the labs moved from the Campus in Buch into the new building in Mitte. This building is designed to optimize communication between labs and the interaction between computation and experiments. On February 26, 2019 it was formally opened by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel who referred to BIMSB as a ‚Äúbeautiful gem‚Äù of the MDC. Rajewsky's research focuses on understanding the role of RNA in gene regulation. He made fundamental contributions to understanding the function of microRNAs (miRNAs) and the mechanisms by which miRNAs exert function in animal cells. More recently, his lab published highly cited papers about circular RNAs (circRNAs). Very recently, the Rajewsky lab used single-cell methods to molecularly reconstruct animal tissues in space and time, including the lineage tree for an entire animal. His contributions were featured in the journal ‚ÄúScience‚Äù as part of the ‚ÄúBreakthrough of the year 2018‚Äù Since 2017, Nikolaus Rajewsky chairs a pan-European consortium that is now called ‚ÄúLifeTime‚Äù, co-chaired by Genevi√®ve Almouzni from the Institute Curie. LifeTime's mission is to revolutionize healthcare by mapping, understanding, and targeting cells during disease progression. To accomplish this goal, LifeTime will integrate and apply single-cell multiomics, machine learning, and personalized disease models such as organoids. LifeTime is the shared vision of leading scientists from around 90 renowned organizations across Europe (17 Partners and 70 Associated Partners). LifeTime partners are supported by more than 70 companies across different sectors as well as other research institutions, national research funding agencies, research ministries, the EU Life Alliance and national science academies: the German Academy of Sciences (Leopoldina), the French Academy of Sciences, the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Society. The Science and Technology Advisory Board of LifeTime comprises internationally renowned scientists and industry leaders (including 3 Nobel laureates). In June 2020, under Rajewsky‚Äôs coordination, LifeTime released the LifeTime Strategic Research Agenda which presents a detailed roadmap of how to leverage the latest scientific breakthroughs and technologies over the next decade, to track, understand and treat human cells throughout an individual‚Äôs lifetime. In August 2020, the journal Nature published the Perspective article ‚ÄúLifeTime and improving European healthcare through cell-based interceptive medicine‚Äù where scientists explain how these technologies should be rapidly co-developed, transitioned into clinical settings and applied to the five major disease areas (cancer, neurological-,infectious-, chronic inflammatory- and cardiovascular diseases). = Awards and honors = * 2019 Elected member of the Leopoldina (Academy of Sciences Germany) * 2017 ‚ÄúVisiting Professor for research activities‚Äù at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy (1 month) * 2016 ‚ÄúVisiting Professor for research activities‚Äù at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy (1 month) * 2014 Honorary PhD in Human Biology and Medical Genetics by Sapienza University of Rome, Italy * 2012 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize by the German Research Foundation (DFG, 2.5 Million Euros; this is Germany's most prestigious research award) * 2011 ‚Äì 2017 Member of the Advisory Board of the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin * 2010 Member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the MRC Institute \\"London Clinical Sciences\\" * 2010 Elected Member of European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) * 2010 Elected Member of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin * 2009 ‚ÄúBerlin Science Award‚Äù (presented by the Governing Mayor of Berlin) * 2008 For several years: ‚ÄúGlobal Distinguished Professor of Biology‚Äù at New York University, USA * 2008 First prize from the ‚ÄúDeutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Gentherapie‚Äù for the best paper * 2008 Anniversary Price of the German Society for Biochemistry, awarded by FEBS * 2008 IUBMB - Medal for outstanding contributions. = Publications = Google Scholar reports >40,000 citations for Nikolaus Rajewsky, with a h-index of 66 and an i10-index of 101.

As a nurse, she was sent to Algeria where she worked in Bab El Oued, in Algiers. She was murdered in Algiers on October 23, 1994 with sister Caridad √Ålvarez Mart√≠n. On January 27, 2018, Pope Francis recognized the martyrdom of Esther Paniagua Alonso among the martyrs of Algeria and authorized the signing of the beatification decree. She was proclaimed blessed on December 8, 2018.  Biography  At 18 y.o., Esther Paniagua entered the novitiate of the Congregation of the Augustinian Missionary SistersFounded in Madrid in 1890.. In August 1970, she pronounced her perpetual vows. Nurse, she was sent to Algiers. The contact with the Arab world seduced her and refined her sensitivity to Arab culture and Muslim religion. She worked in the hospital where she gave herself totally to the sick, especially to disabled children. In 1994, when faced with the Algerian civil war situation, when asked if she was afraid of the situation she replied : \\"No one can take our life because we have already given it. Nothing will happen to us since we are in the hands of God ... and if something happens to us, we are still in His hands\\"Martin McGee, 2008. Despite the solicitations of her hierarchy and of the Spanish ambassador to Algeria, she refused to leave the country. Thus, during the community reflection to make discernment between the choice to stay or to leave, she said to her sisters \\"At this moment, for me, the perfect model is Jesus: he suffered, he had to overcome difficulties and ended in the failure of the cross, from which springs the source of life.\\"Martin McGee, 2008 On October 23, 1994, on her way to Sunday Mass at St. Joseph's Chapel of the Little Sisters of Jesus, a few hundred meters away, she was killed, three bullets in the head, she died instantly.

Background  During the colonial era Africa was exclusively represented exclusively by Western filmmakers, which resulted in portrayals of Africa and African people as \\"exoticized\\", \\"submissive workers\\" or as \\"savage or cannibalistic\\".Hayward, Susan. \\"Third World Cinemas: African Continent\\" in Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 426-442 The African independence movements that rose out of the 1950s and 1960s resulted in cinema that aimed to use the camera as a tool to counter these colonial portrayals. Women were active in the African film industry prior to and during this time, however their roles were predominantly limited to supportive positions such as acting. The emergence of women into other roles in the film industry during this period coincided with a collective assembly of film professionals that desired to promote African cinema. These film professionals, several of whom were women, began to establish organizations and festivals geared towards the cultivation and recognition of African films such as the Pan African Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO) and the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI), both created in 1969. The World Festival of Black Arts, a month-long culture and arts festival, also emerged during this time period and highlighted literature, fine arts, music, cinema, theatre, fashion, architecture, design, and dance from creators from the African Diaspora, particularly from filmmakers in the United States. During the 1970s there was a global call to action in various spheres of the lives of women with the evolution of universal women‚Äôs rights movement, the development of second-wave feminism, the emergence of the Senegal-based bilingual feminist research group the Association of African Women for Research and Development (AAWORD), and the declaration of the United Nations Decade of Women from 1976 to 1985, all of which drastically influenced the development and analysis of women‚Äôs academic studies, feminist film theory, and the visual representation of women, globally. These movements have been credited by scholars as having engendered an understanding of universal sisterhood, from which emerged a flurry of conferences and media that reflected the diverse experience of women internationally.  Women directors  Africans were limited in what roles they could take in film until the 1950s and 60s, when indigenous Africans began freeing themselves from colonial rule, however few women were given access to the creative process beyond acting. Director Safi Faye is credited as the first African woman to direct a film with the release of her 1975 film Kaddu Beykat, which film scholar N. Frank Ukadike has stated is indicative of a wider struggles by black filmmakers in the African diaspora. Filmmaker and author Tsitsi Dangarembga has cited patriarchal biases in the film industry and African society as reasons why African women in particular struggle as filmmakers. Scholar Nancy Schmidt has further noted in 1997 that at the time there were only recently online platforms, publications, filmographies or bibliographies that acknowledged all the feature films, documentaries, shorts and works in video, television, and digital media that African women have directed over the past several decades. Non-profit organizations have been formed to help address these issues and promote African women in film and television, such as the Ladima Foundation, and woman-centric film festivals such as the International Images Film Festival for Women have been launched. Examples of online resources on African women in cinema include Beti Ellerson's Centre for the Study and Research of African Women in Cinema, which launched in 2008 and manages the blog African Women in Cinema. Some directors such as Sarah Maldoror have experienced difficulty receiving recognition as an African film director, resulting in exclusion from lists of African filmmakers while their films are discussed in studies on African cinema. Paulin Soumanou Vieyra has cited citizenship as a major component on identification as an African film director, stating that films directed by non-citizens about Africa are ‚Äúof African inspiration/film d‚Äôinspiration africaine\\", which scholar Alexie Tcheuyap argues \\"would automatically disqualify directors like Sarah Maldoror or Raoul Peck who are too often, almost intuitively, considered ‚ÄúAfrican.‚Äù\\" Some scholars, such as art historian Beatriz Leal Riesco have noted that Maldoror is \\"African with respect to her motivation and themes\\" Common issues experienced by African woman directors include sexual harassment and sexism.  History of women in African film  = 1960s and 1970s = During the colonial era cultures and laws such as the 1934 Laval Decree that governed French colonies prohibited Africans from making their own films, which has been credited as stunting the growth of film as a means of African expression, political, cultural, and artistic.Halhoul, Khalid (2012). \\"Using African Cinema to Shift Cultural Perceptions.\\" Utne Reader (June/July 2012 edition). Mixed Media Section, pp. 78‚Äì79.Diawara, Manthia (1992). African Cinema: Politics and Culture. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, pp. 22‚Äì23. As Africa emerged as a postcolonial world region Africans began creating their own films and women took on more prominent roles while still being largely limited to acting roles only. Despite the apparent defeat of colonialism, however, certain conservative notions of European civilization lingered, finding an echo in a form of village traditionalism and patriarchal authoritarianism, with Kenneth W. Harrow stating that \\"Whereas the protests of the 1950s and 1960s were directed against European colonialists as outsiders, or against Europe itself as an outside force, now they were directed internally against African figures of authority‚Äìoppressive, domineering figures, including those who fled the nation and the economy as well as those who governed villages or families.\\" He argued that even if the colonial overlord has been removed, the mechanisms of conquest are therefore repeated on the body of the African woman in 1960s and 1970s film. Films made during this era that featured or were created by African women directors featured themes of sexual impression that included polygamy, conflict between modern romance and traditions of arranging marriage, the marginalization of widows and single women, and genital mutilation. Scholars such as Sheila Petty have argued that they should not only be read as portraying an unshakeable patriarchy but as expressions of a general loss of identity, with extreme examples of sexual politics functioning as a \\"process in which cultural roles can be modified through affective partnerships between men and women.‚Äù In 1975 Safi Faye released Kaddu Beykat, which is widely considered to be the first feature film to be commercially released that was directed by an African woman. She had previously released a short film, \\"La Passante\\" about three years prior in 1972. She is also credited as being the first African woman film director to gain international recognition, as Kaddu Beykat won several awards among which is the FIPRESCI Prize.Beti Ellerson, \\"African through a Woman's Eyes: Safi Faye's Cinema\\" in Focus on African Cinema(ed) Francoise Pfaff, (Bloomington: Indiana University, 2004), 185 Other films that were released during this time period include Maldoror's 1972 film Sambizanga. = Women in 1980s and 1990s Cinema = Per Harrow, African women filmmakers became prolific during the 1980s and 1990s, \\"finally providing us with something more significant than Sembene's images of long-oppressed wives or daughters\\" and that \\"Perhaps the best way to understand post-engagement cinema is as that of a cinema that has begun to turn in the direction of women as harbingers for Africa's future.‚Äù Woman centric films were traditionally less essentialist and less about double repression by African patriarchal culture and Western colonising forces.  Themes  Themes are a common element in cinema and the cinema of Africa often covers colonialism and its aftermath, among other topics and events that have impacted life in Africa. Films that feature or are directed by African women may contain themes such as eroticism, African feminism, objectification, or arranged marriage and polygamy.The Women‚Äôs Companion to International Film by Annette Kuhn and Susannah Radstone. University of California Press, 1990, pp. 85 Other themes can include resilience and female independence, as in the case of Cameroon filmmaker Rosine Mbakam's Chez Jolie Coiffure. Some themes, such as education, health, childhood, or the fight for equality, are seen as traditionally feminine per Beatriz Leal Riesco, but are subjected to \\"the perennial authoritarian gaze, the cardinal characteristic of which is the erection of a hermetic symbolic order codifying the distance between the creator and the reality represented\\". = Representation of women in African cinema = The representation of women in African cinema is seen as a common theme among women directors such as Safi Faye and Sarah Maldoror, and historians have noted that women have made the bulk of the theme's research. Some films, such as Karmen Gei and U-Carmen eKhayelitsha feature female protagonists, but have been criticized as \\"[representing] a departure from the situation of the contemporary woman in Africa\\" as the films identify women with music and the voice. Riesco has noted that while these films portray the idealization of the feminine, they also \\"offer a vibrant alternative to the previous wave of cinema, largely characterized the exaltation of the rural, of traditions and their recuperation, and of a specific kind of narration, slow and measured, based in oral conventions in which silence and speech were equally stressed.\\" = Eroticism and sexuality = N. Frank Ukadike has noted that African women are often \\"at best, sexual objects enveloped in a culture of chauvinism; and, in the words of Ousmane Sembene, they are \\"still refused the right of speech.\\"\\" Some films, such as Ceddo and Sarraounia have been credited as dispelling assumptions that African women are \\"simply sexual objects or exotic clich√©s\\", which Ukadike has credited in part to colonialist and traditionalist assumptions. On the theme of eroticism and sexuality, director Francois Pfaff has argued that African films are less exploitative because they anticipate spectators to be religious, while Isabelle Boni-Claverie in Pour la Nuit treats sexuality as emblematic of freedom and choice. The film Puk Nini has been cited by Jyoti Mystri and Antje Schuhmann as a movie that reflects on the multiple roles women are expected to perform both professionally and domestically, motivated many discussions addressing how gender relations operate, how ‚Äútradition‚Äù is a constructive factor in the relations. They state that in the film a wife seeks out the assistance of her husband's sex worker mistress in order to learn varying methods of seduction and that it reflects on the dual roles of homemaker and professional workers that some women are expected to adopt, while men do not generally carry this same social expectation.Mistry, Jyoti, and Antje Schuhmann. ‚ÄúChapter 7 Puk Nini ‚Äì A Filmlic Instruction in Seduction: Exploring Class and Sexuality in Gender Relations.‚Äù Gaze Regimes: Film and Feminisms in Africa, Wits University Press, 2015, pp. 81‚Äì96. = Feminism = Themes of feminism are present in films such as Faces of Women, which Ukadike states \\"[questions] Africa's cultural patrimony and the strategies of patriarchal subordination of women\\". Feminist films became popular in Kenyan films during the 1990s and continue to be popular as of 2017, resulting in many repeated feminist themes such as a female character escaping an early marriage by running away being present in films such as Price of a Daughter and Saikati, as well as Saikati's sequel. Kenneth W. Harrow has written that African feminism has some differences from Western feminism, in that \\"One would overturn the club; the other would join it\\" as African feminism is \\"more a concern over gender equality and social or economic justice\\" whereas European or Western feminism focuses on issues such as \\"the status of the subject, gender identity, gendered language, partriarchy and above all oppositionality predominante\\". He in turn also questions whether European feminism would be at odds with African feminist filmmakers and see them as \\"inadvertently sustaining a partriarchal order and thus subverting their own goals\\". = Exploitation = In the 1960s, African feminism came out of the Third Cinema movement, which regarded film as a medium of social and political activism. Films by Sembene, Safi Faye, Sarah Maldoror and others used linear narratives in order to clearly convey the systematic exploitation of certain groups of women. Employing film to further emancipation, these films took part of a more general effort by film-makers of this period to assert independence and reclaim national identities from colonial rule. This close association with the struggle for independence meant a certain marginalization of the cause of women and the challenges specific to their struggle. = Female health = Female health has been a theme in films such as Ousmane Sembene‚Äôs Moolaade, which focuses on the topic of female genital mutilation, which is a common coming of age ritual in many parts of Africa. Feminists and practitioners have debated over how the practice is seen, with feminists stating that it is a violent kind of women‚Äôs oppression while proponents see it as a cultural perception of purification, and critics have argued whether or not Sembene subverts or upholds the status quo. The term \\"pornotroping\\", which describes how myths surrounding the image of black women are imposed on their bodies via visual modes of representation, such as film, that effectively support the ‚Äúothering‚Äù of black womanhood, has been brought up in the discussion of Moolaade.Chikafa-Chipiro, Rosemary. ‚ÄúThe Representation of African Womanhood in Sembene‚Äôs Moolaade: An Africana Womanist Reading.‚Äù Journal of African Cinemas, vol. 9, no. 2/3, Dec. 2017, pp. 243‚Äì258. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1386/jac.9.2-3.243_1.  Challenges  Common challenged faced by African women in film include sexual harassment and sexism, as well as the balance of work and life. Lucy Gebre-Egziabher has described African women filmmakers as \\"warrior; they face a lot of obstacles. [...] I remember seeing a picture of a Kenyan filmmaker [...], she had her baby behind her on her back as she was directing. That was a most powerful image, it has stayed with me. To me, that is an African woman filmmaker.‚Äù‚ÄúLucy Gebre-Egziabher, Ethiopia.‚Äù In Sisters of the Screen. Women of Africa on Film, Video and Television, 109‚Äì24. Trenton, NJ; Asmara, Eritrea: Africa World Press, Inc., 2000. Others, such as Kenyan director Wanjiru Kinyanjui, have cited issues with cooperation, once remarking in an interview that her basic problem in studying film at the Deutsche Film und Fernsehakademie was to \\"get the Europeans to co-operate with 'an ignorant black woman.'\\"‚ÄúWanjiru Kinyanjui, Kenya.‚Äù In Sisters of the Screen. Women of Africa on Film, Video and Television, 146‚Äì57. Trenton, NJ; Asmara, Eritrea: Africa World Press, Inc., 2000. Other problems faced by African women directors in the newly global conditions of filmmaking involve the divide between local and global expectations of African life and values. Benin documentary filmmaker Giovannia Atodjinou-Zinsou has stated that there are problems with awareness of issues that impact African women, as \\"Women's expression hasn't taken the way it should\\" and that there is much silence surrounding issues and that it is not limited to only sexual abuse. = Sexual harassment and abuse = Multiple women directors have reported experiencing sexual harassment and abuse and per Deutsche Welle, the South African group Sisters Working in Film and Television \\"found that just under two-thirds of the South African women they surveyed had been non-consensually coerced or touched at work.\\"  References  Category:African cinema Africa ","title":"Women in African cinema"},{"id":"61802160","text":"Jona is a Bangladeshi film actress who acted in more than 40 films.

Violators would face fines of up to ‚Ç¨250,000 and up to five years in prison. Support and opposition The bill was tabled in the Oireachtas by independent senator Frances Black in January 2018, who stated that \\"trade in settlement goods sustains injustice\\". She consulted Sadaka, Tr√≥caire, Christian Aid, Amnesty International, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN) during the drafting process. It was supported by the parties Fianna F√°il, Sinn F√©in, the Labour Party, Solidarity‚ÄìPeople Before Profit, the Green Party, the Social Democrats, and independents. It has also been supported by the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. The bill has been passed by majorities in both the Seanad (upper house) and the D√°il (lower house). Fianna F√°il foreign affairs spokesperson Niall Collins introduced the bill in the D√°il, saying that his party's support was due to \\"[increasing concern] about the actions of Israel and its continued and blatant disregard for international law\\". Sinn F√©in's strong showing in the 2020 Irish general election led to specualation that the bill would be advanced by the new government, although the bill was not an election issue. Sinn Fein and Fianna Fail both indicated in their manifestos that they wish to see the Occupied Territories Bill enacted. The Fine Gael party has opposed the bill. Former Irish Fine Gael politician Alan Shatter, in an opinion piece for the Jerusalem Post noted that, even if the bill is passed, the foreign ministry could decline to implement it. In December 2019, Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, on a trip to Israel, said that the government had \\"effectively blocked\\" the bill. Potential effects Purchasing products of the Golan Heights Winery could be punishable by up to five years in jail. Tr√≥caire estimates that, , Irish imports from Israeli settlements amount to between ‚Ç¨500,000 and ‚Ç¨1,500,000 each year, out of ‚Ç¨50 million total Irish imports. Ireland has a $1 billion trade surplus with Israel, exporting more than $1.2 billion to the country in 2018. The bill would ban any goods or services produced, even partially, in the Israeli-occupied territories‚Äîincluding the Golan Heights‚Äîor by Israelis who travel, even temporarily, beyond the Green Line. It affects goods or services imported to Ireland as well as the transactions of Irish citizens, Irish companies, and companies with Irish subsidiaries worldwide. The effects of this would cause companies operating in Israel, Ireland and the United States to choose between obeying the Irish law or United States anti-boycott legislation. Especially considering that Ireland is a tax haven for many tech companies, from which the Irish government collects billions in corporate tax, the legislation has the potential to encourage some of them to relocate operations, according to a Bloomberg editorial and the Lawfare Project. According to foreign minister Simon Coveney‚Äîrelying on legal advice from the Attorney General of Ireland, S√©amus Woulfe‚Äîthe law could result in Ireland being fined by the European Union for violating EU trade regulation. Woulfe also said that the law would be \\"quite vague\\" and impractical to enforce. The Lawfare Project is already preparing a lawsuit against the legislation on the grounds that it violates European Union law. The Ireland Palestine Alliance, Sadaka, noting that one key argument by Coveney and the Government is that the Bill is not compatible with EU law, point to a legal opinion by Takis Tridimas, Professor of EU law at King's College London and practising EU lawyer, that the Bill is compatible with EU law. Other legal authorities, including former Attorney General Michael McDowell argue that the bill would not contravene existing law or international obligations. Tr√≥caire cites two formal legal opinions that the bill is legal and permissible under EU law. Jackie Goodall of the Ireland Israel Alliance stated that Christian pilgrims could be adversely affected, as taking tours guided by Jews based in the West Bank or buying souvenirs from Jews in the West Bank would be a criminal action. International reaction Various American officials contacted Coveney, warning that commercial relations between their countries could be adversely affected by the passage of the bill. Several politicians from Massachusetts‚Äîa state with a large Irish-American population‚Äîhave criticized the bill. This includes criticism from Steven S. Howitt, a state representative, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, and Mintz Levin chairman Robert Popeo, who characterized the bill as antisemitic. Indiana's Secretary of Commerce, James A. Schellinger, expressed concern that the bill would \\"unfairly target certain countries or groups of people\\" and harm Indiana businesses. In a letter signed by ten United States Members of Congress, signatories warned of \\"potentially severe implications\\" to Ireland's economy. Fianna F√°il foreign affairs spokesman Niall Collins characterized this as a \\"veiled threat to Ireland\\". In response, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar wrote to members of the House of Representatives emphasizing his government's opposition to the bill. The Israeli embassy in Ireland called the bill \\"immoral\\" and stated that \\"Closing doors will not in any way facilitate Ireland's role and influence.\\" Defence minister Avigdor Lieberman proposed shuttering Israel's embassy in Dublin. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, stated that the bill is \\"utterly contrary to the principles of free trade and justice\\". Isaac Herzog wrote to Coveney, stating that the legislation \\"sets a dangerous precedent which is detrimental to the relations between our countries and to the chances of resolving the Israel Palestinian conflict by a negotiated compromise.\\" He warned that the boycott might extend into Israel's 1948 borders, as most Irish people are not familiar with the intricacies of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It has been characterized as \\"BDS bill\\" in Jewish and Israeli media. An editorial in The Jerusalem Post criticized the omission of other territories considered occupied under international law in the debate over the bill, such as Turkish Cyprus, Western Sahara, and the Crimea.According to Trocaire the legislation would apply to territories where there is a clear international legal consensus on the status of the occupation. Currently only the occupied Palestinian territories have been confirmed as occupied by the International Court of Justice but it allows for other territories to be included so long as there is consensus between the Minister for Foreign Affairs & Trade and both houses of the Oireachtas.

The first cases were identified in Illinois and Wisconsin in April 2019; as of 21 January 2020, a total of 2,711 hospitalized cases, including 60 deaths have been confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Cases peaked in September 2019, and have been slowly declining since. CDC investigators identified direct exposure to chemicals present in vaping products as responsible for the outbreak. Vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in the lung illnesses related to THC-based vaping products, but the CDC did not rule out other chemicals as possible causes. Though patients have reported using vaping products containing THC, nicotine, or both types, about 86% of patients studied by the CDC admitted THC use. The majority of those affected were young adults 18-34, which is the group with the greatest prevalence of cannabis use in the US. Nicotine-containing products are regulated in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration; THC products are illegal under federal law, but allowed and regulated by some states. Prior to the outbreak, vitamin E acetate was used in low concentrations, or lower than 20% of the formula in vape cartridges, as a thickening agent. As a result of a limited availability of cannabis in California as well as high demand, illicit sellers had used about 50% or higher of diluent thickeners in their formulas to bulk up tiny potency vape cartridges, and vitamin E acetate is a common choice because it resembles THC oil. Some jurisdictions took action to restrict the sale of products containing vitamin E acetate and other chemicals in response to the outbreak, but THC products in states where it is illegal and some nictotine-containing products are produced illegally (and sometimes obtained illegally in jurisdictions where legal, by underage consumers). Public health recommendations The CDC recommends that the public should consider not using any vaping products during their investigation, particularly those containing THC from informal sources like friends, or family, or in-person or online dealers as of 20 November 2019. The US FDA considers it prudent to avoid inhaling vitamin E acetate. On 6 September 2019, the US FDA stated that because consumers cannot be sure whether any THC vaping products may contain vitamin E acetate, consumers are urged to avoid buying vaping products on the street, and to refrain from using THC oil or modifying/adding any substances to products purchased in stores. The CDC recommends that e-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults, or women who are pregnant. Adults who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, according to the CDC. Background Though this is the first time that vaping products have been linked to an outbreak of lung illness, at least 19 cases of vaping-associated pulmonary injuries had been reported worldwide prior to 2019. The first case of e-cigarettes inducing lipoid pneumonia was documented in the medical literature in 2012, though the causative agent was identified as glycerin, not vitamin E acetate. Glycerin was long thought to be a safe additive in e-cigg liquid. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as a product of propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation, these ingredients may also cause lung inflammation.  United States  Cases involved in the outbreak of severe lung illness associated with vaping products were first identified in Illinois and Wisconsin in April 2019. As of 21 January 2020, a total of 2,711 hospitalized cases of lung illness associated with the use of vaping products have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two US territories (Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands). The potential cases of severe lung illness have been associated with the use of vaping products such as devices, liquids, refill pods, and cartridges. On 12 September 2019 the CDC no longer reported possible cases. The CDC changed its reporting methodology from counting possible cases to reporting probable and confirmed cases where patients recently vaped, developed a breathing illness, and either had some tests were performed to rule out infection or testing did not show an infection. The CDC stated the possible cases are still under investigation at the state level. As of 3 December 2019, the CDC is only reporting hospitalized vaping-associated lung illness cases and vaping-associated lung illness deaths regardless of hospitalization status. As of 15 October 2019, the CDC has reported on 1,358 people with data on age and gender: 70% of people are male. The median age of persons is 24 years and ages range from 13 to 75 years. 79% of persons are under 35 years old. Prevalence of lung disease attributable to vaping is likely under reported as cases brought to the CDC are some of the most severe. Symptoms typically develop over a period of days but sometimes can manifest over several weeks. Many cases, patients reported a gradual start of symptoms, including: breathing difficulty, shortness of breath, and/or chest pain before hospitalization. Based on reports from several states, patients have experienced respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain), and some have also experienced gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) or non-specific symptoms (fatigue, fever, or weight loss). Some cases reported mild to moderate gastrointestinal illness. Some patients have reported that their symptoms developed over a few days, while others have reported that their symptoms developed over several weeks. Some patients have reported gastrointestinal symptoms began before respiratory symptoms. Fever, elevated heart rate, and elevated white blood cell count have been reported, even though no infectious disease has been identified. Many patients sought medical care in ambulatory settings, sometimes over several visits, before they were admitted to the hospital. alt=Percentage of persons needing intubation and hospitalization among persons with vaping-associated lung injury. Many patients have required medical treatment with supplemental oxygen. Some required assisted ventilation. Some patients have been treated with corticosteroids with demonstrated improvement. Evidence does not suggest an infectious disease is the cause of the severe pulmonary disease. Antibiotic therapy alone has not consistently been associated with clinical improvement. A handful of individuals have been re-admitted for clinical care after discharge for lung injury. The CDC does not know whether individuals who were re-admitted continued or restarted use. The range of time that the CDC is aware of for these re-admissions ranges from approximately five days after discharge to 55 days after discharge. As of 5 September 2019, the New York State Department of Health reported 34 cases of severe lung illness in patients who were reportedly using different vaping products. Tests conducted by the Wadsworth Center found exceedingly high amounts of vitamin E acetate in most of the cannabis e-cigarette products. \\"At least one vape product containing vitamin E acetate has been linked to each patient who submitted a product for testing,\\" the New York State Department of Health stated. None of the nicotine-based product samples contained vitamin E acetate. According to the reports from Illinois and Wisconsin, the onset of respiratory findings appeared to have occurred over several days to several weeks before hospitalization. As of 5 September 2019, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported 42 cases of lung illness, seven that were still being investigated, and one death. Severe lung illness among young adults and youth who used vaping products required hospitalization in 11 cases in Wisconsin and others were being investigated in August 2019. Symptoms were difficulty breathing, tiredness, chest pain, cough, and reduced weight. Some required help to breathe. On 9 August 2019, the California Department of Public Health issued a statement regarding a cluster of seven healthy adults in Kings County, California, all of whom required hospitalization. Since June 2019, at least seven cases of severe acute pulmonary illness in previously healthy adults were reported from a hospital in Kings County, California. Cases were among residents of multiple counties. The patients presented with progressive respiratory distress, sometimes initially diagnosed with pneumonia or bronchitis, and some with preceding fevers and gastrointestinal symptoms. All cases failed to respond to an initial course of antibiotic treatment. All patients required admission to the hospital with significant respiratory support, including high-flow oxygen, bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), or intubation with mechanical ventilation. Diagnoses included pneumonitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Several cases of vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in California were connected to vaping cannabis products that were traced back to pop-up retailers. Patients have improved with systemic steroids. Evaluation for infectious etiologies has been negative to date in all patients. All patients reported vaping in the weeks prior to hospital admission, and a reported common exposure among these patients is that they have been vaping cannabis or CBD oils. = Deaths = thumbright450pxA total of 60 deaths linked to vaping products have been confirmed as of January 21, 2020 among 27 states and the District of Columbia. alt=A total of 60 deaths linked to vaping products have been confirmed among 27 states and the District of Columbia: Alabama, California (4), Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia (3), Illinois (5), Indiana (4), Kansas (2), Louisiana, Massachusetts (3), Michigan, Minnesota (3), Mississippi, Missouri (2), Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York (2), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee (2), Texas, Utah, and Virginia. As of 21 January 2020, a total of 60 deaths linked to vaping products have been confirmed in 27 states and the District of Columbia: Alabama, California (4), Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia (3), Illinois (5), Indiana (4), Kansas (2), Louisiana, Massachusetts (3), Michigan, Minnesota (3), Mississippi, Missouri (2), Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York (2), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee (2), Texas, Utah, and Virginia. The median age of deceased persons was 51 years and ranged from 15 to 75 years, as of 14 January 2020. Canada  On 18 September 2019, a case of severe lung illness associated with vaping in Canada was reported. A high school student in Ontario needed to be put on life support. The person had been vaping every day. His health improved and he was sent home. This case has not been confirmed, as 27 September 2019. He vaped intensively, adding THC to his devices. He initially showed symptoms aligning with bronchiolitis (lung condition normally caused by a bacterial or viral infection), but many patients that have vape-related illnesses in the United States have experienced damage to the alveoli; this type of injury was not found. Instead, his case aligned more with an injury called popcorn lung, an ailment most commonly seen in factory workers of microwave popcorn plants nearly 20 years ago. On 27 September 2019, it was announced the first confirmed case of a vaping-related lung illness in Canada. A Montreal resident in Quebec in their 50s was admitted to a hospital with breathing difficulties. The person had been vaping to help them give up smoking. Chief Public Health Officer of Canada announced on 11 October 2019 that they are aware of the initial cases of vaping-associated lung illness and they stated that a few other occurrences are being investigated. Three probable cases have been reported in British Columbia as of 7 November 2019 and other cases are under investigation in British Columbia. Two probable cases have been reported in New Brunswick as of 16 October 2019. A case in Newfoundland and Labrador was reported as a probable case of a lung illness tied to vaping in January 2020. A person became sick in late 2019 following the use of a cannabis product. The person has since been released from the hospital. As of 4 February 2020, 17 cases of lung injuries have been reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Reported cases were from Alberta (1), British Columbia (3), New Brunswick (2), Newfoundland and Labrador (1), Ontario (4), and Quebec (6). 14 people needed to be hospitalized.  Other countries  What has occurred in the US has not occurred in other places where vaping is frequent such as the UK, John Britton, the director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, stated in October 2019. In European countries such as France, there is no evidence of an outbreak of the vaping-associated lung illness that occurred in the US.

Investigators from multiple states in the US are collaborating with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) to determine the cause of the lung illnesses associated with the use of vaping products. On 6 September 2019, Dr. Dana Meaney-Delman, serving as the incident manager of CDC's response to this outbreak, said that \\"Based on the clinical and laboratory evidence to date, we believe that a chemical exposure is likely associated with these illnesses. However, and I really want to stress this, more information is needed to determine which specific products or substances are involved. We are aware that some laboratories have identified vitamin E acetate in product samples, and we have connected those laboratories with the FDA Forensic laboratories to compare results. At this time, no one device, product, or substance has been linked to all cases. Continued investigation is needed to better understand if a true relationship exists between any specific product or substance and the illnesses observed in patients. To find the answer we will need to combine information about e-cigarette use, and product sample testing and the clinical information from patients.\\" Patients have acknowledged recent use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing e-cigarette products while speaking to healthcare personnel, or in follow-up interviews by health department staff. On 6 September 2019, The New England Journal of Medicine reported that \\"Information on product use is based on reports by the patients, and patients may be reluctant to report illicit drug use.\\" On 2 October 2019, The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the histologic evidence suggests that the \\"vaping-associated lung injury represents a form of airway-centered chemical pneumonitis from one or more inhaled toxic substances rather than exogenous lipoid pneumonia as such, but the agents responsible remain unknown.\\" They also stated that this \\"finding should be interpreted with caution.\\" On 17 October 2019, the American Journal of Clinical Pathology reported that lung biopsies from eight patients with vaping-associated lung injury show acute lung injury patterns, not exogenous lipoid pneumonia. Of the 2,506 reported cases, information is available in the three months prior to symptom onset for 1,782 of them as of 3 December 2019. 80% reported THC use, 35% reported exclusive THC use, about 54% reported using nicotine-containing products, and 13% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. The CDC reported that their findings suggest vaping products containing THC, particularly those obtained off the street or from other informal sources (e.g. friends, family members, illicit dealers), are linked to most of the cases and play a major role in the outbreak. On 8 November 2019, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, said, \\"for the first time we have detected a potential toxin of concern ‚Äî Vitamin E acetate ‚Äî in biologic samples from patients with lung injuries associated with the use of e-cigarette or vaping products.\\" The sample types were bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples (fluid samples collected from the lungs). The chemical was found in samples collected from ten different states from the lungs of 29 patients with the disease. \\"These findings provide direct evidence of Vitamin E acetate at the primary site of injury within the lungs,\\" said Dr. Schuchat. The CDC tested for a wide range of substances that might be found in e-cigarette or vaping products including plant oil, petroleum distillates like mineral oil, medium-chain triglyceride oils ‚Äì or MCT oils ‚Äì and terpenes which are compounds found in or added to THC products. No other potential toxicants were detected in the testing conducted so far. The CDC did not rule out other possible compounds or ingredients that may be causing the lung injuries. No one compound or ingredient has emerged as the cause of these illnesses so far; and it may be that there is more than one cause of this outbreak. Many of the samples tested by the states or by the US FDA as part of the 2019 investigation have been identified as vaping products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (or THC, a psychoactive component of the cannabis plant) and further, most of those samples with THC tested also contained significant amounts of vitamin E acetate. Vitamin E acetate is a substance present in topical consumer products or dietary supplements, but data is limited about its effects after inhalation. While the US FDA does not have enough data presently to conclude that vitamin E acetate is the cause of the lung injury in these cases, the agency believes it is prudent to avoid inhaling this substance. The US FDA's Forensic Chemistry Center serves as the FDA's national laboratory and is playing a critical role in fact-gathering and analysis for the incidents of lung illnesses following vaping product use.  Illicit vaping  alt=Some of the vaping products that contained exceedingly high amounts of vitamin E acetate, including those pictured here. alt=Frequently reported brand names of THC and nicotine-containing e-cigarette or vaping products reported by patients with lung injury ‚Äî Illinois and Wisconsin, 2019. What people are inhaling is causing the lung illnesses. The lung illnesses are likely to be caused by a chemical exposure. Counterfeit cannabis cartridges are being sold to users at a reduced cost. Dank Vapes is an illicit brand that uses a cartridge. There is no singular company that owns Dank Vapes. There have been hundreds of people selling Dank Vapes cartridges. Dank Vapes appears to be the most prominent in a class of largely counterfeit brands, with common packaging that is easily available online and that is used by distributors to market THC-containing cartridges with no obvious centralized production or distribution. Some of the vaping products that contained exceedingly high amounts of vitamin E acetate include Chronic Carts and Dank Vapes. Illicit vape brands have been sold across multiple states in the US. As of 27 August 2019, the most frequently used product reported by patients experiencing respiratory, gastrointestinal, and/or constitutional symptoms in Illinois and Wisconsin was the THC product called Dank Vapes. Dank Vapes was the most commonly reported product brand used by patients nationwide, although there are regional differences. While Dank Vapes was most commonly reported in the Northeast and South, TKO and Smart Cart brands were more commonly reported by patients in the West and Rove was more common in the Midwest. The composition of THC based oils is to a large extent not known. Public health recommendations The CDC recommends that the public should consider not using any vaping products during their investigation, particularly those containing THC from informal sources like friends, or family, or in-person or online dealers as of 20 November 2019. The US FDA considers it prudent to avoid inhaling vitamin E acetate. On 6 September 2019, the US FDA stated that because consumers cannot be sure whether any THC vaping products may contain vitamin E acetate, consumers are urged to avoid buying vaping products on the street, and to refrain from using THC oil or modifying/adding any substances to products purchased in stores. The CDC recommends that e-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults, or women who are pregnant. Adults who do not currently use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, according to the CDC. Various diluent thickening products were sold online via wholesale suppliers. There has been an increase in attention to companies that sell diluent products that are made with vitamin E acetate. A lot of speculation has focused on Honey Cut. Honey Cut, used as a diluent thickener, became wildy used in Los Angeles' vape pen manufacturing plants in late 2018. After Honey Cut became widely used in THC vape cartridges many other similar products from other companies were introduced into the market in early 2019. The maker of Honey Cut's product is not known, and the only way to purchase the product was from the company's website. In early September 2019, the Honey Cut website went offline and Honey Cut told sellers in the Toy District, Los Angeles area to discontinue offering its products for sale. Counterfeit products from China that look like Honey Cut products were being sold, which increased the confusion in regard to which products people may have been vaping. The company Floraplex in Michigan has shutdown the buyers page for their Uber Thick brand. The diluent products called Clear Cut were sold by Connoisseur Concentrates from Tigard, Oregon. Clear Cut is no longer available from the company's website. The company acknowledged the products contained vitamin E acetate. The company stated that it began selling the products in May 2019 and was reviewed by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. As of 10 September 2019, Mass Terpenes' Pure Thickener diluent is no longer available on its website. A cache of the product on its website stated, \\"a proprietary formula composed simply of flavorless terpenes and a derivative of Vitamin E (to preserve color and consistency).\\" Aaron Riley, CEO of CannaSafe, stated that likely about 75-80% of illicit vapes use some type of diluent agent. Drew Jones of Mr Extractor stated in September 2019 that as high as 70% of illicit cannabis vape cartridges in the US contain vitamin E acetate. It is estimated that at least 40 companies in the US sold a cutting agent containing vitamin E acetate. Thickening agents have been sold online as a less costly and safer substitute. Thickening agents were used to water down and bulk up vape oils. Thickening agents were used mostly in THC vape products. Vitamin E acetate was used to cut THC oil to dilute it. Vitamin E acetate dilutes vape oil without making it look like the oil was watered down. Previously, vitamin E was used in low concentrations, or lower than 20% of the formula in vape cartridges. As a result of a limited availability of cannabis in California as well as high demand, illicit sellers had used about 50% or higher of diluent thickeners in their formulas to bulk up tiny potency vape cartridges. Thomas Whitten, a consultant at WeedRAR, said to Rolling Stone that \\"there's so much cutting agent even the people who made the cutting agent didn't expect it to be cut that much.\\" Some cannabis laboratories began making arrangements in September 2019 to provide testing services for vitamin E. Regulations in legal markets for cannabis use allow the use of many additives such as tocopherols (various forms of vitamin E). However, regulators may be considering banning such substances in the near future, as of September 2019. As of December 2019, Washington state has now banned vape products containing vitamin E acetate, thought to be linked to illness. Although the substance is not banned in the United States and has not been officially declared as a deadly substance, many states are making advances to ban the use of the chemical in vape products. States like Massachusetts are considering a ban on flavored tobacco and vape products, and in New York, Manhattan is expected to become the largest city to ban all vaping flavors except tobacco. Other states that have already banned the use of vitamin E acetate in vape products include Colorado and Ohio.  Legal proceedings  = Subpoenas = In September 2019, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo instructed the state health department to issue subpoenas against three sellers of thickening agents used in illicit vaping products. The subpoenas are being served against Honey Cut Labs in Santa Monica, California, for its Honey Cut product; Floraplex Terpenes in Ypsilanti, Michigan, for its Uber Thick product; and Mass Terpenes in Amherst, Massachusetts, for its product. All three firms sell a product used as a thickener in vape liquids. The thickeners from all three firms were found to contain mostly vitamin E acetate, according to test results from the Wadsworth Center. = Criminal cases = On 5 September 2019, Tyler Huffhines and Jacob Huffhines were arrested. Search warrants were served on a house at their place of residence and at a leased condominium. In September 2019, an investigation in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, is underway to determine whether a major operation ran by the Huffhines brothers for purportedly making illicit THC vape cartridges, which were packed in containers to resemble candy and were thought to have been marketed to youth, could be related to a series of vaping-induced lung illness and deaths in the US. The purportedly candy-themed containers used names such as Sour Patch. In January 2018, Tyler Huffhines purportedly began the operation. The vape cartridges purportedly contained as high as 1,000 milligrams of THC, when the packaging stated it was just 5 milligrams. Roughly $1.5 million worth of THC products were seized during the raid. 57 mason jars containing THC oil were also seized during the raid. Each jar was worth about $6,000. An initial appearance in Kenosha County court was held for both brothers on 16 September 2019. Tyler Huffhines is facing multiple drug-related charges including possession with intent to deliver THC. Jacob Huffhines is facing charges including being a felon in possession of a firearm and possession of THC. Bond for Tyler Huffhines was set $500,000. Bond for Jacob Huffhines was set at $50,000. Both are scheduled to return to court on 26 September 2019. The Huffhines brothers pleaded not guilty on 23 October 2019. Courtney Huffhines, the mother of Jacob and Tyler Huffhines, was charged with assisting her sons run the illegal THC vape operation. A woman was arrested in connection with the THC vape operation. On 3 October 2019, Hannah Curty was charged with making THC, as a party to an offense against the law. She is scheduled to return to court on 11 October 2019. Courtney Huffhines and Hannah Curty were in court on 11 October 2019. Both women are due to return to court on 23 October 2019. Courtney Huffhines and Hannah Curty pleaded not guilty on 23 October 2019. On 17 October 2019, 22-year-old Jordan Lynam was charged with making THC vape cartridges in relation to the Huffhines's purportedly illicit vaping operation. Daniel Graumenz, Wesley Webb, and Tarail King are facing charges in relation to the illicit vaping operation. = Civil lawsuits = On 23 September 2019, a product liability lawsuit, Charles Wilcoxson v. Canna Brand Solutions LLC et al., was filed in Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, against makers of THC vape cartridges. Wilcoxson, a peace officer, had used THC vape products between January 2018 and September 2019. He bought cannabis products that included Conscious Cannabis, Rainbows Aloft, Leafwerx, MFused, and Jane's Garden, and a Canna Brand Solutions vaporizer, all of which were cited as defendants. The plaintiff was hospitalized for three days in September 2019 with wheezing and lipoid pneumonia as a result of his vaping, according to the complaint. In September 2019, 35-year-old Erin Gilbert from Virgin Islands filed a lawsuit against Just CBD in a Broward County, Florida court, contending that her sickness was the result of a CBD vape oil containing mango flavor that she had purchased from a merchant in Saint Croix. After just a few days of using the vape oil, she had severe respiratory problems, multiple organ failure, and deficient supply of oxygen, resulting in necrosis of her legs, both of which had to be amputated. In May 2019, a 21-year-old was hospitalized for more than two weeks due to fluid in his lungs and was in a medically induced coma for 8 days. He had purportedly developed an addiction to Juul mint pods, which he had been using since age 19. In October, the patient sued Juul, complaining the company did not disclose the dangers of its pod system and deceptively advertised its products as being safer than combustible cigarettes. The suite also claimed Juul advertised its products to intentionally entice underage individuals and young adults as well as people who are never frequent smokers. In September 2019, a lawsuit was brought on behalf of an 18-year-old from Illinois who had been hospitalized with lung damage from vaping. The sued charged Juul with targeting teens with false marketing of a dangerous product, and a gas station for allowing him to buy vaping products as a minor. On 29 October 2019, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest district in the nation filed a class action suit against Juul for creating an epidemic of youth vaping that impedes student learning and risking the health and safety of more than 600,000 students in the Los Angeles School District. As of January 2020, a total of 10 California school districts have filed a lawsuit against Juul Labs, Inc. The suit seeks injunctive relief and abatement remedy to fight against the vaping epidemic in the California school districts.  Responses  = E-cigarette industry = The e-cigarette industry is placing the blame on illicit vaping liquids for the lung injuries. \\"Each day of this crisis brings more evidence that street vapes containing THC or other illegal drugs are responsible for these illnesses, not nicotine vaping products,\\" said Gregory Conley of the American Vaping Association, in August 2019. \\"Like any health-related events reportedly associated with the use of vapor products, we are monitoring these reports,\\" Juul Labs stated to Reuters in August 2019. The company also stated that some news reports state that several cases of lung illness are associated with vaping THC, found in cannabis, \\"a Schedule 1, controlled substance that we do not sell.\\" = United States = The CDC recommends that people should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products that contain THC, particularly from informal sources like friends, or family, or in-person or online dealers. Until the relationship of vitamin E acetate and lung health is better understood, vitamin E acetate should not be added to e-cigarette, or vaping, products. In addition, people should not add any substance to e-cigarette or vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer, including products purchased through retail establishments. CDC also recommends that people should not modify or add any substances such as vitamin E acetate to e-cigarette, or vaping, products that are not intended by the manufacturer, including products purchased through retail establishments. According to the CDC, if you are an adult using e-cigarettes, or vaping, products, to quit smoking, do not return to smoking cigarettes. Adults addicted to nicotine using e-cigarettes should weigh all risks and benefits, and consider utilizing FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapies. The US FDA considers it prudent to avoid inhaling vitamin E acetate. On 6 September 2019, the US FDA stated that because consumers cannot be sure whether any THC vaping products may contain vitamin E acetate, consumers are urged to avoid buying vaping products on the street, and to refrain from using THC oil or modifying/adding any substances to products purchased in stores. On 4 October 2019, the US FDA strengthened its warning to consumers to stop using vaping products containing THC amid more than 1,000 reports of lung injuries‚Äîincluding some resulting in deaths‚Äîfollowing the use of vaping products. \\"The legal vapes have been actively regulated by FDA since Aug 2017. FDA has conducted thousands of inspections of manufacturers and vape stores, published manufacturing guidance, sought product removals etc. These tragedies point to illegal vapes and THC,\\" former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted in August 2019. During an interviewed on CNBC's Squawk Box on 9 September 2019, Gottlieb said that \\"the current belief is the illnesses are linked to illegal vapes containing vitamin E oil.\\" He also stated that cannabis products in the US should be regulated. \\"The e-cigarette-related lung illnesses currently sweeping across the country reaffirm our belief that the use of e-cigarettes and vaping is an urgent public health epidemic that must be addressed. We must not stand by while e-cigarettes continue to go unregulated. We urge the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to speed up the regulation of e-cigarettes and remove all unregulated products from the market. We also call on the FDA to immediately ban flavors, as well as marketing practices, that enhance the appeal of e-cigarette products to youth,\\" Patrice A. Harris, the president of the American Medical Association, stated on 9 September 2019.
