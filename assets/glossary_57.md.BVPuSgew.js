Biography Ricky, Robert, and Randy were hemophiliacs who contracted HIV from blood transfusions when they were less than 8 years old. Born to Arcadia, Florida natives Louise and Clifford Ray, the family was exiled from Arcadia as community members feared contracting the disease. Memorial Elementary, in DeSoto County, would not allow them to attend school due to their diagnosis. They became the subject of a federal court battle against the DeSoto County School Board to allow the children to attend public school despite their diagnosis. The Rays were victorious in their legal battle, winning a $1.1 million settlement. They were allowed to go back to school, but the Ray home was burned down a week after the 1987 decision, forcing the family to leave Arcadia. After the arson of their home, the Ray Family settled in nearby Sarasota. The brothers attended Gocio Elementary School in spite of opposition from groups like Citizens Against AIDS.http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-09-23/news/0150050182_1_andy- ray-ray-family-varnadore Ricky Ray became an activist in the fight against AIDS. In 1992, he allowed camera crews to document his declining health and stated he wanted America to see what AIDS did to people. President Bill Clinton spoke to him and thanked him for his work raising awareness on AIDS. Ricky Ray died in 1992 at age 15. Prior to his death, he made headlines by planning to marry his 17-year-old girlfriend, but a judge blocked the wedding because of his age. Robert died of AIDS related causes in 2000 at the age of 22. Shortly thereafter, their father, Clifford Ray, attempted suicide but survived. Randy Ray married in 2001 and lives in Orlando, Florida. He manages his HIV through medication.

The purpose of the Holy Trinity columns was usually simply to celebrate the church and the faith, though the plague motif could sometimes play its role in their erection as well. Erecting religious monuments in the form of a column surmounted by a figure or a Christian symbol was a gesture of public faith that flourished in the Catholic countries of Europe especially in the 17th and 18th centuries. Thus they became one of the most visible features of Baroque architecture. This usage also influenced some Eastern Orthodox Baroque architecture. Types Most common are Marian columns dedicated to the Virgin Mary, but other saints are also depicted on the plague columns. A typical one is St. Roch, who is said to have fallen ill when helping the sick during an epidemic of plague and who recovered through the strength of his faith. St. Sebastian, a martyr whose statue also often decorates these structures, was originally the patron of archers. In the Middle Ages Sebastian took the place of the plague-dealing archer Apollo, as people sometimes metaphorically compared the random nature of plague to random shots of archers, and thus he started being connected with the plague too. Other frequently depicted saints are St. Barbara, a patron of the dying, and two more recent and historical saints: St. Francis Xavier, who, according to the legend, raised people from the dead, and St. Charles Borromeo, known for working among the sick and the dying. The Marian column in front of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. History In Imperial Rome, it was the practice to erect a statue of the Emperor atop a column. The last such a column was the Column of Phocas, erected in the Roman Forum and dedicated or rededicated in 608. The Christian practice of erecting a column topped with a statue of the Virgin Mary dates back at least to the 10th century (in Clermont-Ferrand in France), but it became common especially in the Counter- Reformation period following the Council of Trent (1545‚Äì1563). The column in Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome was one of the first. The column itself was ancient: it had supported the vault of the so-called Basilica of Constantine in Rome, destroyed by an earthquake in the 9th century. By the 17th century only this column survived; in 1614 it was transported to Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore and crowned with a bronze statue of the Virgin and Child. Within decades it served as a model for many columns in Italy and other European countries. Charles IV of Hungary, taking his Coronation Oath on 30 December 1916 at Holy Trinity Column in Budapest. The first column of this type north of the Alps was the Mariens√§ule built in Munich in 1638 to celebrate the sparing of the city from both the invading Swedish army and the plague. The Virgin Mary is standing on its top on a crescent moon as the Queen of Heaven. It inspired for example Marian columns in Prague and Vienna, but many others also followed very quickly. In the countries which used to belong to the Habsburg Monarchy (especially Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia) it is quite exceptional to find an old town square without such a column, usually located in the most prominent place. The Prague column was built in Old Town Square (Staromƒõstsk√© n√°mƒõst√≠) shortly after the Thirty Years' War in thanksgiving to the Virgin Mary Immaculate for helping in the fight with the Swedes. At noon its shadow indicated the so-called Prague Meridian, which was used to check the exact solar time. Many Czechs connected its placement and erection with the hegemony of the Habsburgs in their country, and after declaring the independence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 a crowd of people pulled this old monument down and destroyed it in an excess of revolutionary fervor. Plague Column, Vienna, Austria The basic model which inspired building most Holy Trinity columns is the Pests√§ule or Dreifaltigkeitss√§ule (\\"Plague\\" or \\"Holy Trinity column\\") in the Grabenplatz, Vienna, built after the 1679 plague; in this monument the column has entirely disappeared in marble clouds and colossal saints, angels and putti. The era of these religious structures culminated with the outstanding Holy Trinity Column in Upper Square (Horn√≠ n√°mƒõst√≠) in Olomouc. This monument, built shortly after the plague which struck Moravia (nowadays in the Czech Republic) between 1714 and 1716, was exceptional because of its monumentality, rich decoration and unusual combination of sculptural material (stone and gilded copper). Its base was made so big that even a chapel was hidden inside. This column is the only one which has been individually inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \\"one of the most exceptional examples of the apogee of central European Baroque artistic expression\\".

The triggering antigen is usually a bacterial protein (particularly from Staphylococcus aureus), but may also be a virus, fungus (particularly Candida albicans), or nematode. Symptoms  * Irritation * Discomfort or pain * Foreign-body sensation * Tearing * Blepharospasm * Photophobia * Mucopurulent discharge (rarely) In cases where the cornea is affected, pain and photophobia are more likely, and corneal scarring can occur (potentially impairing vision). Presentation The syndrome is marked by the appearance of characteristic lesions, known as phlyctenules, on the cornea and/or conjunctiva. These usually manifest as small (1 - 3 or 1 - 4 mm) raised nodules, pinkish-white or yellow in color, which may ulcerate (or, more rarely, necrose) and are often surrounded by dilated blood vessels. Corneal lesions are usually triangular in shape, with the base at the limbus and the apex pointing towards the center of the cornea. Diagnosis Clinical findings of Corneal lesion or corneal ulceration. Treatment The symptoms of phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis are primarily treated with application of an appropriate corticosteroid eye drop, such as prednisolone acetate (Pred Forte) or loteprednol (Lotemax). Loteprednol is increasingly preferred due to its lower risk of elevating intraocular pressure. The corticosteroid suppresses the immune response, reducing inflammation and improving most symptoms. The causative agent (i.e. the source of the antigen that triggered the hypersensitive immune response) should also be identified. Staphylococcus aureus is usually the primary suspect, along with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in areas where TB is endemic, followed by Chlamydia trachomatis. Active bacterial infections may be treated with a topical antibiotic or a combination antibiotic-steroid eye drop, such as tobramycin/dexamethasone (Tobradex). An oral tetracycline antibiotic (such as doxycycline) may be used in systemic or particularly severe/intractable infections. Erythromycin may be an effective alternative, especially in pediatric cases where the side effects of tetracyclines are unacceptable. Artificial tears can reduce dryness and discomfort from corneal lesions. Photophobic discomfort can be mitigated with dark sunglasses.

He is known for his Social Realist novels describing working class life and political struggles in the mid-twentieth century. His best-known book is Le Sang noir (Blood Dark), which has been described as a \\"prefiguration of Sartre's La Naus√©e.\\"Greene, Francis J. - Louis Guilloux's \\"Le Sang noir\\" : A Prefiguration of Sartre's \\"La Naus√©e\\" , French Review : Journal of the American Association of Teachers of French (Chapel Hill, USA ; ISSN 0016-111X), 1969, 43, p. 205. Life and work Guilloux's father was a shoemaker and socialist activist, a background that Guilloux describes in his first book La Maison du Peuple (The House of the People), which centres on the struggles of a shoemaker called Qu√©r√© as seen through the eyes of his young son. The story describes how Qu√©r√©'s idealistic political activism threatens his small business as he loses custom by pushing against ingrained conservatism. Nevertheless, he manages to build self-help cooperatives on the model of Proudhonism.Walter D. Redfern, \\"Political Novel and Art of Simplicity: Louis Guilloux\\", Journal of European Studies, 1971; 1; 115. In high school, Guilloux befriended the philosophy tutor Georges Palante, an anarchist thinker who later killed himself. Palante's despair inspired Guilloux to create the character of Cripure, the anguished anti-hero of Le Sang Noir (1935), which is considered his masterpiece. The name Cripure is a contraction of \\"Critique de la raison pure\\" (Critique of Pure Reason). He also commemorated his old tutor in a memoir.Louis Guilloux, Souvenirs sur G. Palante. Paris, Calligrammes, 1980 Before becoming a professional writer, literary translator and interpreter, Guilloux worked in various trades, including journalism. He was well known for his fluency in the English language. He married in 1924, and published La Maison du Peuple in 1927. The success of the book led to a long series of novels on socially committed themes, usually based in his native Brittany. His masterpiece Le Sang Noir was notable for its departure from his earlier, more straightforwardly socialist literature, since it contains elements of what was later associated with an existentialist or absurdist vision. It centres on the suicidal thoughts of the anti-hero, Cripure, who feels overwhelming disgust at humanity in the destructive circumstances of militarism during World War I. Contrasted with the figure of Cripure is the nominal hero, Lucien, who aspires to work for a better future. But the grotesque and self-excoriating visions of Cripure are repeatedly portrayed as more powerful and compelling than Lucien's idealism.JH King, \\"Louis Guilloux's Ambiguous Epic Le Sang Noir\\", Forum for Modern Language Studies, Jan 1972, vol vii, no.1. The book was translated into English under the title Bitter Victory. Le Pain des R√™ves (Bread of Dreams), which he wrote during the Occupation, won the Prix du roman populiste in 1942. After the liberation of France, Guilloux worked as an interpreter for the American army of occupation. In OK Joe! he explored racial inequalities and injustice in the segregated American army of the time.Kaplan, Alice, On Violent Judgment : Louis Guilloux's Novel about Race, Justice, and the Segregated Army that Liberated France , French Literature Series, Vol. 35, No. 1. (1 October 2008), pp. 105-122. Guilloux's experiences at this time are described by Alice Kaplan in her 2006 book The Interpreter.Alice Kaplan, The Interpreter. (New York and London: Free Press, 2005). 256 pp. $25.00 US (hbk). . His 1949 novel Le Jeu de Patience (Game of Patience) won the Prix Renaudot. It has been described as his most experimental work, \\"an intricate text demanding patient reconstitution by the reader. Micro- and macro-history collide: the horrors of war, and anarchist and Popular Front politics or right-wing coups, impinge violently on private dramas. It is a haunted kaleidoscope, often hallucinatory.\\"Walter Redfern, \\"Louis Guilloux\\", French Literature Companion. Guilloux was also a translator of a number of books, including the novel Home to Harlem written by black American author Claude McKay, published in 1932 under the title Ghetto Noir. He also translated John Steinbeck, Margaret Kennedy, and Robert Didier, and some of the Hornblower series of novels by C.S. Forester. Towards the end of his life he created scripts for television adaptations of literary classics. Louis Guilloux was friendly with many notable writers. He knew the philosopher Jean Grenier from his teenage years, and was close to Albert Camus. He was also friends with Andr√© Malraux and Jean Gu√©henno. Camus praised his work highly, and compared his story Compagnons (Companions) to Leo Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Political activities Guilloux was active in left wing causes. In 1927, he signed the petition, published April 15 in the magazine Europe, against the law on the general organization of the nation for war, objecting to the restrictions on intellectual independence and freedom of opinion. He was Secretary of the first World Congress of Anti-fascist Writers in 1935, then became head of Red Aid International (later known as Secours Populaire - The People's Aid), which helped refugees from Nazi Germany and later assisted the Spanish Republicans. Following a discussion with Ilya Ehrenbourg, Andr√© Gide invited him to accompany him on his famous trip to the USSR in 1936, in which Eug√®ne Dabit also travelled. However he refused to endorse the Soviet system. After World War II he helped to establish several provincial Maisons de la Culture. In 1953 he worked for √âditions Rencontre in producing the \\"Great Novels\\" series, offering reprints of classic novels. He died in Saint-Brieuc in 1980 and was buried in the Cimeti√®re Saint-Michel. Prix Louis Guilloux In 1983 the Conseil g√©n√©ral des C√¥tes-d'Armor created the Prix Louis-Guilloux \\"to perpetuate the literary ideals and values of the Breton writer\\". The prize is granted each year to a work in the French language which is characterised by \\"the humane qualities of generous thought, refusing all dualism and all sacrifice of individuality in favour of ideological abstractions\\".

They are also known as paper wasps, which is a misleading term, since other wasps (including yellowjackets) also build nests out of paper, and because some epiponine wasps (e.g., Polybia emaciata) build theirs out of mud, nonetheless, the name \\"paper wasp\\" seems to apply mostly, but not exclusively, to the Polistinae, especially the Polistini. Many wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, Polistes annularis, and Polistes exclamans, make their nests out of paper. Polistes annularis suspends its paper nests from cliff overhangs via a pedicel, whose free fatty acids induce the necrophoric response in ants and causes them to avoid the pedicel rather than cross and prey on the nest‚Äôs inhabitants. Polistes metricus foragers take off from their nests as if they already know how long their trip is. For short flights, they exit the nest flying horizontally, while for long flights they exit the nest flying straight up into a high altitude before pursuing their direction. Polistine brood cells are arranged in a hexagonal array, similar to the comb structure in a honey bee nest. Some species of the epiponine genera Polybia and Brachygastra store honey in the comb, among the few insects other than bees to store honey (also some ants store honey in their bodies). Polistes africanus Characteristics of the Polistinae are: * The queens (reproductive females) are morphologically similar to workers, though sometimes slightly larger or differently colored. * The abdomen is spindle-shaped, often petiolate. * The antennae of males are curled. * The nest is sometimes open (the nests of vespines are typically enclosed in several layers of paper). * Wasps have stingers, and their sting hurts. Some people are very sensitive to wasp stings, and wasp stings can be fatal.  Colony lifecycle  Nest of a Polistes sp. Polistine wasps found colonies in one of two ways. In some species, nests are founded by a small number of reproductive females, possibly a single one. One of the foundresses eventually acquires dominance over the other and is the sole reproducer. The nest is open (not enclosed by an envelope) and contains a single comb. In the other group, called \\"swarm-founding\\", the nest is founded by a large number of workers and a few queens. It is usually protected by an envelope, like a vespine nest.

Within the Gambia, the highway consists of two main stretches, the North Bank Road and South Bank Road, each corresponding to the parts of the country on either side of the River Gambia. The two roads ultimately connect to each other, via car ferry across the River Gambia, at the village of Fatoto, at the far eastern end of the country. The more centrally located Senegambia bridge opened in January 2019. The road is also economically important for Senegal, in which it is designated as the N4 road. Geography The Gambia is an elongated state forming a country that is almost surrounded by Senegal (but not an enclave, as it also borders the Atlantic Ocean). The Gambia almost separates the Casamance region from the remainder of Senegal. South Bank Road The South Bank Road in the Central River Division The southern portion of the Trans-Gambia Highway begins in the island capital city, Banjul, before crossing onto the mainland at the Denton Bridge. From here, the route passes through metropolitan Kombo and the principal cities of Kanifing, Serekunda, and Yundum, where it passes near the Banjul International Airport. Leaving the capital, the route proceeds along the full length of the southern half of the country, connecting the major towns of Brikama (36 km), Soma (185 km), Janjanbureh (319 km), Bansang (335 km), and Basse Santa Su (396 km) before terminating at Fatoto (436 km). At Soma, the highway intersects with an extension of the Trans-Gambia Highway (also known as Senegal Route N4) that provides northward access to the town of Farafenni, on Gambia's northern bank, via the newly-opened Senegambia Bridge. If taken south into Senegal, N4 provides access to Casamance and Ziguinchor. As of 2019, the South Bank Road is paved for its entire length. Aside from a short four-lane section in Kombo, the road is a two lane highway. North Bank Road The northern portion of the highway begins at Barra, at the Banjul‚ÄìBarra Ferry. Heading eastward, the route traverses the full northern half of the country, passing through the major towns of Farafenni (113 km), Wassu (207 km), Laminkoto (227 km), and Sutukoba (325 km) before reaching the river ferry at Fatoto. At Farafenni, the highway connects with the extension of the Trans-Gambia Highway (Route N4) that crosses the River Gambia at the Senegambia Bridge, linking the northern half of the Gambia with the town of Soma and points southward in Senegal. Taking N4 northward, meanwhile, leads into Senegal, in the direction of Kaolack and, eventually, Dakar. As of 2019, the North Bank Road is paved for the distance between Barra and Laminkoto, with the remaining section under construction. The road is two lanes for its entire length. Senegal The Trans-Gambia Highway provides the most important connection between the two parts of Senegal. As the N4, it runs from Kaolack and Nioro, across Gambia and then into Bignona and Ziguinchor in the Casamance. The actual Gambian section is only 25 km long. History With establishment of the Gambia River Development Organization in 1978, plans for a bridge were developed. Despite being repeatedly raised, these plans have not come to fruition. In August 2005, the Gambia River Authority doubled the prices for the ferry crossing. In response, the Government of Senegal closed the border crossings. The prices were reduced at the beginning of October, but Senegal felt the issue was unresolved and threatened that they would construct a tunnel under Gambia, with the claimed support of China. President of the Gambia Yahya Jammeh and President of Senegal Abdoulaye Wade met on 21 October 2005 and reached an agreement over the fare and a basis for its future calculation. The bridge construction project was again placed into the foreground.

REMICs are used for the pooling of mortgage loans and issuance of mortgage-backed securities and have been a key contributor to the success of the mortgage-backed securities market over the past several decades.Lemke, Lins and Picard,Mortgage-Backed Securities, ¬ß 4:20 (Thomson West, 2014 ed.). The federal income taxation of REMICs is governed primarily under of Part IV of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.). To qualify as a REMIC, an organization makes an \\"election\\" to do so by filing a Form 1066 with the Internal Revenue Service, and by meeting certain other requirements. They were introduced in 1987 as the typical vehicle for the securitization of residential mortgages in the United States.S.L. Schwarcz, Securitization, Structured Finance and Capital Markets (LexisNexis, 2004), p. 114. REMIC usage REMICs are investment vehicles that hold commercial and residential mortgages in trust and issue securities representing an undivided interest in these mortgages. A REMIC assembles mortgages into pools and issues pass-through certificates, multiclass bonds similar to a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), or other securities to investors in the secondary mortgage market. Mortgage-backed securities issued through a REMIC can be debt financings of the issuer or a sale of assets. Legal form is irrelevant to REMICs: trusts, corporations, and partnerships may all elect to have REMIC status, and even pools of assets that are not legal entities may qualify as REMICs.Peaslee, James M. & David Z. Nirenberg. Federal Income Taxation of Securitization Transactions and Related Topics. Frank J. Fabozzi Associates (2011, with periodic supplements, www.securitizationtax.com): 432. The Tax Reform Act eliminated the double taxation of income earned at the corporate level by an issuer and dividends paid to securities holders, thereby allowing a REMIC to structure a mortgage- backed securities offering as a sale of assets, effectively removing the loans from the originating lender's balance sheet, rather than a debt financing in which the loans remain as balance sheet assets (as is the case for covered bonds). A REMIC itself is exempt from federal taxes, although income earned by investors is fully taxable. As REMICs are typically exempt from tax at the entity level, they may invest only in qualified mortgages and permitted investments, including single family or multifamily mortgages, commercial mortgages, second mortgages, mortgage participations, and federal agency pass- through securities. Nonmortgage assets, such as credit card receivables, leases, and auto loans are ineligible investments. The Tax Reform Act made it easier for savings institutions and real estate investment trusts to hold mortgage securities as qualified portfolio investments. A savings institution, for instance, can include REMIC-issued mortgage-backed securities as qualifying assets in meeting federal requirements for treatment as a savings and loan for tax purposes. To qualify as a REMIC, an entity or pool of assets must make a REMIC election, follow certain rules as to composition of assets (by holding qualified mortgages and permitted investments), adopt reasonable methods to prevent disqualified organizations from holding its residual interests, and structure investors‚Äô interests as any number of classes of regular interests and one ‚Äì- and only one -‚Äì class of residual interests.Peaslee and Nirenberg have dubbed these tests the interests test, assets test, and arrangements test. Peaslee & Nirenberg at 431-432. The Internal Revenue Code does not appear to require REMICs to have a class of regular interests.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 435. Pooling and Servicing Agreement (PSA) A pooling and servicing agreement (PSA) is generally incorporated into each REMIC. A PSA is the legal document that defines the rights and obligations of the servicer, the trustee, and other parties over a pool of securitized mortgage loans. A typical PSA is worded, in part, as follows: ‚ÄúAs promptly as practicable after any transfer of a Mortgage Loan under this Agreement, and in any event within thirty days after the transfer, the Trustee shall (i) affix the Trustee‚Äôs name to each assignment of Mortgage, as its assignee, and (ii) cause to be delivered for recording in the appropriate public office for real property records the assignments of the Mortgages to the Trustee,‚Äù Qualified mortgages Qualified mortgages encompass several types of obligations and interests. Qualified mortgages are defined as ‚Äú(1) any obligation (including any participation or certificate of beneficial ownership therein) which is principally secured by an interest in real property, and is either transferred to the REMIC on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests, or purchased within three months after the startup day pursuant to a fixed-price contract in effect on the startup day, (2) any regular interest in another REMIC which is transferred to the REMIC on the startup day in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC, (3) any qualified replacement mortgage, or (4) certain FASIT regular interests.‚ÄùPeaslee & Nirenberg at 452-453. In (1), ‚Äúobligation‚Äù is ambiguous; a broad reading would include contract claims but a narrower reading would involve only what would qualify as ‚Äúdebt obligations‚Äù under the Code.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 453. The IRC defines ‚Äúprincipally secured‚Äù as either having ‚Äúsubstantially all of the proceeds of the obligation . . . used to acquire or to improve or protect an interest in real property that, at the origination date, is the only security for the obligation‚Äù or having a fair market value of the interest that secures the obligation be at least 80% of the adjusted issue price (usually the amount that is loaned to the mortgagor)Peaslee & Nirenberg at 459. or be at least that amount when contributed to the REMIC.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 458-459. Prohibited Assignments to REMICs ‚ÄúAs trust documents are explicit in setting forth a method and date for the transfer of the mortgage loans to the trust and in insisting that no party involved in the trust take steps that would endanger the trust‚Äôs REMIC status, if the original transfers did not comply with the method and timing for transfer required by the trust documents, then such belated transfers to the trust would be void.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf the trust is expressed in the instrument creating the estate of the trustee, every sale, conveyance or other act of the trustee in contravention of the trust, except as authorized by this article and by any other provision of law, is void.‚Äù Permitted investments Permitted investments include cash flow investments, qualified reserve assets, and foreclosure property. Cash flow investments are temporary investments in passive assets that earn interest (as opposed to accruing dividends, for example) of the payments on qualified mortgages that occur between the time that the REMIC receives the payments and the REMIC‚Äôs distribution of that money to its holders.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 481. Qualifying payments include mortgage payments of principal or interest, payments on credit enhancement contracts, profits from disposing of mortgages, funds from foreclosure properties, payments for warranty breaches on mortgages, and prepayment penalties.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 482. Qualified reserve assets are forms of intangible property other than residual interests in REMICs that are held as investments as part of a qualified reserve fund, which ‚Äúis any reasonably required reserve to provide for full payment of‚Äù a REMIC‚Äôs costs or payments to interest holders due to default, unexpectedly low returns, or deficits in interest from prepayments.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 484. REMICs usually opt for safe, short term investments with low yields, so it is typically desirable to minimize the reserve fund while maintaining ‚Äúthe desired credit quality for the REMIC interests.‚ÄùPeaslee & Nirenberg at 488. Foreclosure property is real property that REMICs obtain upon defaults. After obtaining foreclosure properties, REMICs have until the end of the third year to dispose of them, although the IRS sometimes grants extensions.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 489. Foreclosure property loses its status if a lease creates certain kinds of rent income, if construction activities that did not begin before the REMIC acquired the property are undertaken, or if the REMIC uses the property in a trade or business without the use of an independent contractor and over 90 days after acquiring it.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 491-492. Regular interests A REMIC may include any number of classes of regular interests; these are often identified by letters such as \\"A\\" class, \\"B\\" class, etc., and are assigned a coupon rate and the terms of payment.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, ¬ß 4:20 (Thomson West, 2014 ed.). It is useful to think of regular interests as resembling debt; they tend to have lower risk with a corresponding lower yield. Regular interests are taxed as debt.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 4. A regular interest must be designated as such, be issued on the startup day, contain fixed terms, provide for interest payments and how they are payable, and unconditionally entitle the holder of the interest to receive a specific amount of the principal.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 444-445. Profits are taxed to holders. Residual interests A REMIC can have only one class of residual interest. Residual interests tend to involve ownership and resemble equity more than debt. However, residual interests may be neither debt nor equity. ‚ÄúFor example, if a REMIC is a segregated pool of assets within a legal entity, the residual interest could consist of (1) the rights of ownership of the REMIC‚Äôs assets, subject to the claims of regular interest holders, or (2) if the regular interests take the form of debt secured under an indenture, a contractual right to receive distributions released from the lien of the indenture.‚ÄùPeaslee & Nirenberg at 436. The risk is greater, as residual interest holders are the last to be paid, but the potential gains are greater. Residual interests must be designated as such, be issued on the startup day, and not be a regular interest (which it can effortlessly avoid by not being designated as a regular interest). If the REMIC makes a distribution to residual interest holders, it must be pro rata; the pro rata requirement simplifies matters because it usually prevents a residual class from being treated as multiple classes, which could disqualify the REMIC.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 445. Re-REMIC In the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, the ratings of many REMICs collapsed. In order to extract some higher ratings for regulatory risk-capital purposes, several REMICs were turned into re-securitized real estate mortgage investment conduits (re- REMICs). In a simple re-REMIC, an investor transfers ownership of mortgage- backed securities to a new special purpose entity; by transferring a sufficient amount of assets to the new structure, the new structure's tranches may receive a higher rating (e.g., an \\"AAA\\" rating).Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, ¬ß 4:21 (Thomson West, 2014 ed.). However, a number of re-REMICs have subsequently seen their new AAA ratings reduced to CCC.Did Investors Really Get Double-Duped with Re-REMIC Ratings?, HousingWire May 19th, 2010 Forms A REMIC can issue mortgage securities in a wide variety of forms: securities collateralized by Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) pass-through certificates, whole loans, single class participation certificates and multiclass mortgage-backed securities; multiple class pass-through securities and multiclass mortgage-backed securities; multiple class pass-through securities with fast-pay or slow-pay features; securities with a subordinated debt tranche that assumes most of the default risk, allowing the issuer to get a better credit rating; and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations with monthly pass-through of bond interest, eliminating reinvestment risk by giving investors call protection against early repayment. The advantages of REMICs REMICs abolish many of the inefficiencies of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and offer issuers more options and greater flexibility.Silverstein, Gary J. REMICs, Tax Management: FASITs and Other Mortgage-Backed Securities. Tax Management Inc.: Securities Law Series (2007): A-54. REMICs have no minimum equity requirements, so REMICs can sell all of their assets rather than retain some to meet collateralization requirements. Since regular interests automatically qualify as debt, REMICs also avoid the awkward reinvestment risk that CMO issuers bear to indicate debt. REMICs also may make monthly distributions to investors where CMOs make quarterly payments. REMIC residual interests enjoy more liquidity than owner‚Äôs trusts, which restrict equity interest and personal liability transfers. REMICs offer more flexibility than CMOs, as issuers can choose any legal entity and type of securities. The REMIC‚Äôs multiple-class capabilities also permit issuers to offer different servicing priorities along with varying maturity dates, lowering default risks and reducing the need for credit enhancement.Silverstein at A-54, A-55. REMICs are also fairly user-friendly, as the REMIC election is not difficult, and the extensive guidance in the Code and in the regulations offers \\"a high degree of certainty with respect to tax treatment that may not be available for other types of MBSs\\".Silverstein at A-55. The limitations of REMICs Though REMICs provide relief from entity- level taxation, their allowable activities are quite limited \\"to holding a fixed pool of mortgages and distributing payments currently to investors\\".Peaslee & Nirenberg, 44. A REMIC has some freedom to substitute qualified mortgages, declare bankruptcy, deal with foreclosures and defaults, dispose of and substitute defunct mortgages, prevent defaults on regular interests, prepay regular interests when the costs exceed the value of maintaining those interests,Peaslee & Nirenberg at 1309. and undergo a qualified liquidation,Peaslee & Nirenberg at 497-498. in which the REMIC has 90 days to sell its assets and distribute cash to its holders.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 441. All other transactions are considered to be prohibited activities and are subject to a penalty tax of 100%,Peaslee & Nirenberg at 495. Lynn, Theodore S., Micah W. Bloomfield, & David W. Lowden. Real Estate Investment Trusts. Securities Law Series, Vol. 29. Thomson West (2007): 6-22. as are all nonqualifying contributions. To avoid the 100% contributions tax, contributions to REMICs must be made on the startup day. However, cash contributions avoid this tax if they are given three months after the startup day, involve a clean-up call or qualified liquidation, are made as a guarantee, or are contributed by a residual interest holder to a qualified reserve fund.Peaslee & Nirenberg, 501. Additionally, states may tax REMICs under state tax laws.Silverstein, A-48. ‚ÄúMany states have adopted whole or partial tax exemptions for entities that qualify as REMICs under federal law.‚ÄùPeaslee & Nirenberg, 13 REMICs are subject to federal income taxes at the highest corporate rate for foreclosure income and must file returns through Form 1066.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 504, 581 The foreclosure income that is taxable is the same as that for a real estate investment trust (REIT)Peaslee & Nirenberg at 504 and may include rents contingent on making a profit, rents paid by a related party, rents from property to which the REMIC offers atypical services, and income from foreclosed property when the REMIC serves as dealer.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 505-506. The REMIC rules in some ways exacerbate problems of phantom income for residual interest holders, which occurs when taxable gain must be realized without a corresponding economic gain with which to pay the tax.Peaslee & Nirenberg at 44,841. Phantom income arises by virtue of the way that the tax rules are written. There are penalties for transferring income to non-taxpayers, so REMIC interest holders must pay taxes on gains that they do not yet have. Major issuers of REMICs Among the major issuers of REMICs are the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the two leading secondary market buyers of conventional mortgage loans, as well as privately operated mortgage conduits owned by mortgage bankers, mortgage insurance companies, and savings institutions.

It specialized in retailing on-trend apparel, accessories, cosmetics, footwear, and housewares. It was a successor to a chain of clothing retailers that was based in Knoxville, Tennessee. At one time Goody's operated close to 500 stores in the U.S South and Midwest, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. In late 2010, Goody's opened 17 new stores in the Southeast. Brands exclusively found at Goody's include Valerie Stevens; Signature Studio; Sun River; Rustic Blue; Rebecca Malone; and Wishful Park. History Goody's was founded in 1953 in Athens, Tennessee, by M. D. Goodfriend as an offshoot of a family retail business, The M. Goodfriend Store, that the founder's father, Mike Goodfriend, had started in Athens in 1913. The new store, Athens Outlet Store, focused on the sale of closeout, irregular, and previous-year merchandise. The business grew, operating 20 stores by 1970.Carly Harrington, Goody's legacy in Knoxville one of growth, charity , Knoxville News Sentinel, January 18, 2009, page C1 In 1978, the name was changed to \\"Goody's\\". \\"Goody\\" was the college nickname of M. D. Goodfriend's son Bob, who had joined the family business in 1972. In 1979, Bob Goodfriend became president of the business and the company changed its merchandise focus from the outlet model to offering current, first-quality, brand-name merchandise. With this new strategic direction, the chain expanded rapidly. A private-label clothing line was launched in 1993. By 1998, the chain recorded $1 billion in annual sales, and in 2000 it opened its 300th store. By 2004, there were more than 350 stores recording annual sales of $1.3 billion. In 2006 Goody's became a privately held company again when it was acquired by GMM Capital and Prentice Capital Management in January 2006. Sales in 2006 totaled $1.6 billion.Carly Harrington, \\"Goody's to close 69 of its stores\\", Knoxvillebiz.com, June 10, 2008 In 2008 Goody's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced it was to close 69 stores. While Goody's successfully left Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it was announced four months later in early January 2009 that Goody's had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and planned to liquidate all of their stores. The chain was then acquired by Stage Stores Inc in July 2009, from the bankruptcy auction. In September 2019 it was announced that Goody's, along with all other stores operated by Stage Stores Inc, would be converted to Gordmans stores by the end of 2020. On May 10, 2020, Stage announced it had filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, and that it would liquidate all locations, Goody's and Gordmans included, unless a buyer could be found for the chain. No buyer had been found, and going out of business sales had begun at all locations.

A quantity described by multiple scalars, such as having both direction and magnitude, is called a vector.Mathwords.com ‚Äì Scalar In linear algebra, real numbers or other elements of a field are called scalars and relate to vectors in a vector space through the operation of scalar multiplication, in which a vector can be multiplied by a number to produce another vector. More generally, a vector space may be defined by using any field instead of real numbers, such as complex numbers. Then the scalars of that vector space will be the elements of the associated field. A scalar product operation ‚Äì not to be confused with scalar multiplication ‚Äì may be defined on a vector space, allowing two vectors to be multiplied to produce a scalar. A vector space equipped with a scalar product is called an inner product space. The real component of a quaternion is also called its scalar part. The term is also sometimes used informally to mean a vector, matrix, tensor, or other usually \\"compound\\" value that is actually reduced to a single component. Thus, for example, the product of a 1√ón matrix and an n√ó1 matrix, which is formally a 1√ó1 matrix, is often said to be a scalar. The term scalar matrix is used to denote a matrix of the form kI where k is a scalar and I is the identity matrix. Etymology The word scalar derives from the Latin word scalaris, an adjectival form of scala (Latin for \\"ladder\\"), from which the English word scale also comes. The first recorded usage of the word \\"scalar\\" in mathematics occurs in Fran√ßois Vi√®te's Analytic Art (In artem analyticem isagoge) (1591): http://math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m4010/s08/lcviete.pdf Lincoln Collins. Biography Paper: Francois Viete :Magnitudes that ascend or descend proportionally in keeping with their nature from one kind to another may be called scalar terms. :(Latin: Magnitudines quae ex genere ad genus sua vi proportionaliter adscendunt vel descendunt, vocentur Scalares.) According to a citation in the Oxford English Dictionary the first recorded usage of the term \\"scalar\\" in English came with W. R. Hamilton in 1846, referring to the real part of a quaternion: :The algebraically real part may receive, according to the question in which it occurs, all values contained on the one scale of progression of numbers from negative to positive infinity; we shall call it therefore the scalar part. Definitions and properties Scalars are real numbers used in linear algebra, as opposed to vectors. This image shows a Euclidean vector. Its coordinates x and y are scalars, as is its length, but v is not a scalar. Scalars of vector spaces A vector space is defined as a set of vectors, a set of scalars, and a scalar multiplication operation that takes a scalar k and a vector v to another vector kv. For example, in a coordinate space, the scalar multiplication k(v_1, v_2, \\\\dots, v_n) yields (kv_1, kv_2, \\\\dots, k v_n). In a (linear) function space, k∆í is the function x k(∆í(x)). The scalars can be taken from any field, including the rational, algebraic, real, and complex numbers, as well as finite fields. Scalars as vector components According to a fundamental theorem of linear algebra, every vector space has a basis. It follows that every vector space over a scalar field K is isomorphic to a coordinate vector space where the coordinates are elements of K. For example, every real vector space of dimension n is isomorphic to n-dimensional real space Rn. Scalars in normed vector spaces Alternatively, a vector space V can be equipped with a norm function that assigns to every vector v in V a scalar v. By definition, multiplying v by a scalar k also multiplies its norm by k. If v is interpreted as the length of v, this operation can be described as scaling the length of v by k. A vector space equipped with a norm is called a normed vector space (or normed linear space). The norm is usually defined to be an element of V's scalar field K, which restricts the latter to fields that support the notion of sign. Moreover, if V has dimension 2 or more, K must be closed under square root, as well as the four arithmetic operations; thus the rational numbers Q are excluded, but the surd field is acceptable. For this reason, not every scalar product space is a normed vector space. Scalars in modules When the requirement that the set of scalars form a field is relaxed so that it need only form a ring (so that, for example, the division of scalars need not be defined, or the scalars need not be commutative), the resulting more general algebraic structure is called a module. In this case the \\"scalars\\" may be complicated objects. For instance, if R is a ring, the vectors of the product space Rn can be made into a module with the n√ón matrices with entries from R as the scalars. Another example comes from manifold theory, where the space of sections of the tangent bundle forms a module over the algebra of real functions on the manifold. Scaling transformation The scalar multiplication of vector spaces and modules is a special case of scaling, a kind of linear transformation.

According to the grandson of Meshadi; during March Days Meshadi was responsible of Shamakhi district and he saved the large part of population from the mass killings of Dashnaks as he believed the poor village population can not be dangerous to the revolution. Azizbekov was friends with Mammad Amin Rasulzade in the early 1900s when he was also the member of Hummet organization. When the Commune was toppled by the Centro Caspian Dictatorship, a British-backed coalition of Dashnaks, SRs and Mensheviks, Azizbekov and his comrades were captured by British troops and executed by firing squad between the stations of Pereval and Akhcha-Kuyma of the Transcaucasian Railroad.

While a close servant of the King, he also supported the faction in court led by Queen Anne Boleyn, and when Anne fell out of favour, he was among those accused of treason and adultery with her. He was found guilty and executed, together with the Queen's brother, George Boleyn (Viscount Rochford), Sir Francis Weston, William Brereton and Mark Smeaton. Most historical authorities argue that the accusations were untrue and part of a plot to get rid of Anne. Family Many sources state that Henry was the second son of Sir Edward Norris of Yattendon Castle in Berkshire, by his wife Lady Frideswide Lovell, daughter of John Lovel, 8th Baron Lovel and 5th Baron Holand of Titchmarsh, Northamptonshire and his wife Joan de Beaumont (about 1440 ‚Äì 5 August 1466) of Edenham. Some of these also state that Edward Norris died in 1487. So the birth date of 1482 for Henry would be consistent with this. However, Eric Ives claimed that Henry was younger, born in the 1490s, and stated that he was \\"apparently the second son of Richard Norris\\". Richard was Edward's younger brother, but according to the Heralds' Visitations of Berkshire (1664/6), he was the father of only a single daughter, Anne. This is consistent with the descent of his manor of Great Shefford which she inherited around 1522, before Henry's execution in 1536. Had he been Richard's son and not Sir Edward's, he would have inherited the manor. Therefore, it is likely, in this instance, that Ives was incorrect. Whichever version is correct, all sources agree that Henry's grandfather, Sir William Norris, had taken part in the Battle of Stoke Field on 16 June 1487 at the conclusion of the Wars of the Roses. Marriage and issue Henry married Mary Fiennes, daughter of Thomas Fiennes, 8th Lord Dacre and Anne Bourchier, and by her he had three surviving children: * Henry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys of Rycote, born around 1525, was educated with Mary Boleyn's son, Henry Carey. * Edward (1524 ‚Äì 16 July 1529) * Mary (1526‚Äì1570). Mary married, firstly, Sir George Carew who died in the sinking of the Mary Rose in 1545 and, secondly, Sir Arthur Champernowne. Henry's brother, John Norreys (Usher of the Chamber) (about 1481 ‚Äì 21 October 1564), served four successive English monarchs during his lifetime. John occupied the post of Esquire of the Body under Henry VII of England, going on to become Usher of the Outer Chamber under both Henry VIII of England and Edward VI of England, and finally the Chief Usher of the Privy Chamber under Mary I of England. Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell (1454 ‚Äì after 1488), Henry's maternal uncle, was a notable champion of the House of York during the Wars of the Roses until he mysteriously disappeared after the Battle of Stoke Field. Henry's aunt, Joan Lovell (after 1450 ‚Äì ??), was married to Brian de Stapleton about 1476. Spelling of name The name Norreys has at least two potential derivations: one who came from the north or who lived in the north (there was a word \\"noreis\\" or \\"norreis\\" meaning a northerner), or from one who cared for others (the word \\"norrice\\" for nurse). There are also references to Noreis back in the 12th century, and to a Robert le Noris in the 1297 Yorkshire Subsidy Roll. Career Henry Norris arrived at Court during his youth and became a close friend of King Henry VIII, who appointed him a Gentleman of the Bedchamber and granted him many offices, the first (in 1515) being keeper of Foliejon Park in Winkfield. He was serving in the King's Privy Chamber by 1517. In 1518 he became weigher at the common beam at Southampton, then the great mart of the Italian merchants. On 28 January 1518/19 he was appointed bailiff of Ewelme and in 1519 was awarded an annuity of 50 marks (about ¬£33). He attended the meeting between King Henry VIII and King Francis I of France now known as the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. In 1523 he received the Keepership of Langley New Park, Buckinghamshire, and was made bailiff of Watlington. In 1526 he replaced Sir William Compton in the post of Groom of the Stool and was in charge of the gentlemen of the King's Privy Chamber. According to Ives (2004) in this position he was not only the King's confidant but also perhaps the closest friend the King had. In October of the same year, he succeeded Compton as Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. Norris risked the wrath of Anne Boleyn's faction when, just before the fall of Thomas Wolsey, he offered the Cardinal his own rooms when the Cardinal had deliberately been left without accommodation. He was present when Wolsey resigned the Great Seal. On 24 October 1529 he was the King's only attendant when Henry went with Anne and her mother to inspect Wolsey's property. He was the bearer of Henry's kind message to Wolsey at Putney about the same time, and it seems he was affected by Wolsey's fallen condition. Also in 1529 he received a grant of ¬£100 a year from the revenues of the see of Winchester. In 1531 he was made chamberlain of North Wales. In 1534 he was appointed constable of Beaumaris Castle. In 1535 he received various manors which Sir Thomas More had held. He was present at the execution of the Charterhouse monks on 4 May 1535, and Henry granted him the important constableship of Wallingford Castle on 29 November. Norris had helped Anne Boleyn while she established her position at Court and became one of her close friends and a leader of the faction that supported her attempts to wield political power. This brought him into conflict with Thomas Cromwell, a leader in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. At the time of his death Norris's gross annual income from crown annuities, fees of offices, farms and grants amounted to ¬£1241 2s 3d per annum and his income from private sources raised this figure to ¬£1327 15s 7d. This income combined with additional gratuities made Norris wealthier than many of the nobility. Arrest, trial and execution In 1536 Anne Boleyn fell out of favour with the king, and Norris, as a close confidant and supporter, was immediately put at risk. The growing threat was a consequence of the negotiations which were being carried out with the French ambassador at Greenwich on 18 April 1536. It was clear to Thomas Cromwell that Anne Boleyn and her associates stood in the way of what he sought to achieve and the King's approval he started to investigate and to secure evidence for charges of treason to be laid against Anne, Norris, and four other courtiers (Mark Smeaton, Sir William Brereton, Sir Francis Weston and Anne's brother George). Norris was accused of being solicited by Anne at Westminster on 6 October 1533, and of adultery on 12 October and again at Greenwich in November. The prosecution's choice of these dates appears now particularly improbable and therefore careless. At that time Anne was in Greenwich, not Westminster, and recovering from the birth of Elizabeth on 7 September. As well as specific charges, there was a catch-all charge of committing adultery at diverse times and places. Most historians think that all the charges were fabrications. A grand jury was assembled at Westminster Hall on 9 May and decided there was a case to answer for the offences that had occurred at Whitehall. John Baldwin, a chief justice, presided with six of his judicial colleagues. On 10 May, Baldwin with 3 assistants went to Deptford, where a Kent jury decided there was a case to answer on the events that had taken place at Greenwich. With the committals in hand, Cromwell proceeded to arrange the trial for the four who were not members of the higher nobility (i.e. Norris, William Brereton and Sir Francis Weston, who were landed gentry, and Mark Smeaton, who was a commoner). The trial was held in Westminster Hall on 12 May. The jury was packed with people who had reason to be hostile to Anne Boleyn's cause or had a personal enmity with one of the accused, but also with Anne's own father Thomas Boleyn, her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk and the man she had wished to marry thirteen years before, Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland. Sir William Paulet, controller of the King's household, was one of the judges. All four pleaded not guilty to all the charges with the exception of Smeaton, who, as a commoner, was subjected to torture and pleaded guilty to one charge of adultery. The accused had to improvise their defences on the spot, with no help from any defence counsel, and no advance warning of the evidence. The hostile prosecutors duly secured a guilty verdict. All four were sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. Because all were in service of the Royal Court, this sentence was commuted to the less terrifying one of beheading by the executioner's axe. The execution was carried out on 17 May, 1536 on Tower Hill. Unlike the other accused, who with carefully chosen words indicated their innocence, Norris did not risk reimposition of the harsher method of execution and so said little on the scaffold. According to Sir Robert Naunton, Queen Elizabeth I always honoured his memory, believing that he died \\"in a noble cause and in the justification of her mother's innocence.\\" Portrayals In Wolf Hall, a TV mini-series adaptation of the historical novels, Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel, Harry Norris was portrayed by Luke Roberts.

Eisenhower. He was known for providing much more detail on the lifestyle of the president than previous press secretaries; for example, he covered in great detail Eisenhower's medical condition. Most of the time, he handled routine affairs such as daily reports on presidential activities, defending presidential policies, and assisting diplomatic visitors. He handled embarrassing episodes, such as those related to the Soviet downing of an American spy plane, the U-2 in 1960. He handled press relations on Eisenhower's international trips, sometimes taking the blame from a hostile foreign press. Eisenhower often relied upon him for advice about public opinion, and how to phrase complex issues. Hagerty had a reputation for supporting civil rights initiatives.Eleanora W. Schoenebaum, ed., Political Profiles: The Eisenhower Years (1977) 244-245 Career After his Irish Catholic family moved to New York when he was 3 years old, James Hagerty attended Evander Childs High School in the Bronx, before enrolling in and graduating from Blair Academy, which he attended for his last two years in high school. He graduated from Columbia College in 1934, and work as a reporter for The New York Times. He became the press secretary to Governor Thomas E. Dewey in 1943, and handled Dewey's presidential campaigns in 1944 and in 1948. He was in charge of candidate Eisenhower's press office in the 1952 campaign, leading to his appointment as Press Secretary in January 1953. He introduced television cameras to press conferences in 1955. He occasionally handled political assignments from Eisenhower, such as liaison with the Senate. After Eisenhower left office in January 1961, Hagerty became a vice president of the ABC television network, serving 1961‚Äì1975.

A scalar is usually said to be a physical quantity that only has magnitude, possibly a sign, and no other characteristics. This is in contrast to vectors, tensors, etc. which are described by several numbers that characterize their magnitude, direction, and so on. The concept of a scalar in physics is essentially the same as a scalar in mathematics. Formally, a scalar is unchanged by coordinate system transformations. In classical theories, like Newtonian mechanics, this means that rotations or reflections preserve scalars, while in relativistic theories, Lorentz transformations or space-time translations preserve scalars. Scalar field Since scalars mostly may be treated as special cases of multi-dimensional quantities such as vectors and tensors, physical scalar fields might be regarded as a special case of more general fields, like vector fields, spinor fields, and tensor fields. Physical quantity A physical quantity is expressed by a numerical value and a physical unit, not merely a number. Its quantity may be regarded as the product of the number and the unit (e.g. for distance, 1 km is the same as 1000 m). Thus, following the example of distance, the quantity does not depend on the length of the base vectors of the coordinate system. Also, other changes of the coordinate system may affect the formula for computing the scalar (for example, the Euclidean formula for distance in terms of coordinates relies on the basis being orthonormal), but not the scalar itself. In this sense, physical distance deviates from the definition of metric in not being just a real number; however it satisfies all other properties. The same applies for other physical quantities which are not dimensionless. Non-relativistic scalars=Temperature An example of a scalar quantity is temperature: the temperature at a given point is a single number. Velocity, on the other hand, is a vector quantity. Other examples Some examples of scalar quantities in physics are mass, charge, volume, time, speed, and electric potential at a point inside a medium. The distance between two points in three-dimensional space is a scalar, but the direction from one of those points to the other is not, since describing a direction requires two physical quantities such as the angle on the horizontal plane and the angle away from that plane. Force cannot be described using a scalar, since force has both direction and magnitude; however, the magnitude of a force alone can be described with a scalar, for instance the gravitational force acting on a particle is not a scalar, but its magnitude is. The speed of an object is a scalar (e.g. 180 km/h), while its velocity is not (e.g. 108 km/h northward and 144 km/h westward). Some other examples of scalar quantities in Newtonian mechanics are electric charge and charge density. Relativistic scalars In the theory of relativity, one considers changes of coordinate systems that trade space for time. As a consequence, several physical quantities that are scalars in \\"classical\\" (non-relativistic) physics need to be combined with other quantities and treated as four-vectors or tensors. For example, the charge density at a point in a medium, which is a scalar in classical physics, must be combined with the local current density (a 3-vector) to comprise a relativistic 4-vector. Similarly, energy density must be combined with momentum density and pressure into the stress‚Äìenergy tensor. Examples of scalar quantities in relativity include electric charge, spacetime interval (e.g., proper time and proper length), and invariant mass. See also *Relative scalar *Pseudoscalar **An example of a pseudoscalar is the scalar triple product (see vector), and thus the signed volume. Another example is magnetic charge (as it is mathematically defined, regardless of whether it actually exists physically). *Scalar (mathematics) NotesReferences * * Category:Concepts in physics ","title":"Scalar (physics)"},{"id":"3588426","text":"Highway 3 (AR 3, Ark. 3, Hwy. 3, formerly State Road 3) was a state highway in southern Arkansas.

He became notorious during the 1990s for committing a string of undercover \\"gentleman robberies\\" in and around Budapest, Hungary, while working a day job as a goaltender. He became infamous in Hungary as a folk hero symbolic of the times in the decade after the introduction of capitalism to the former Communist state. Ambrus was eventually caught and imprisoned for about 12 years, released in 2012. His story was told in the 2004 book Ballad of the Whiskey Robber by author Julian Rubinstein and the 2017 film A Viszkis directed by Nimr√≥d Antal. Life and career Ambrus was born in a Sz√©kely Hungarian family in Fitod, a small village in eastern Transylvania, Romania, right outside Miercurea Ciuc (Cs√≠kszereda). Ambrus had trouble with the law from a young age for committing petty thefts. In 1988, Ambrus illegally crossed Romania's borders by riding underneath a freight train and applied for political asylum and citizenship in Hungary, the latter of which he obtained in 1994. Ambrus made a living through a variety of odd jobs, including being a gravedigger and a pelt smuggler, after which he tried out for the professional hockey team √öjpesti TE. Despite his abysmal performance, he was admitted to the roster as goaltender while doubling as the team's janitor. Ambrus' hockey teammates gave him the nickname \\"The Panther from Cs√≠k.\\" Ambrus's income continued to be insecure as he worked a variety of side jobs, and he committed his first robbery of a post office in 1993. After this success, Ambrus continued a string of 27 robberies of banks, post offices, and travel agents that ended with his arrest in 1999, stealing in all about 100 million forints (about half a million US Dollars). He became known as \\"The Whiskey Robber\\", because he was often seen drinking whiskey at a nearby pub prior to the robbery. While he later carried a gun, Ambrus never harmed anyone in his robberies, and was famous for his outlandish disguises, for presenting female tellers with flowers prior to robberies, and for sending the police bottles of wine. Immensely popular at the time of his arrest on January 15, 1999, a flag honoring the Whiskey Robber was flown at the UTE stadium for years afterwards. Ambrus escaped from prison on July 10, 1999 using a rope made of shredded sheets, electric cords, and shoe laces. Nobody had ever escaped from that prison before. He evaded police custody for three months while living in a downtown Budapest apartment and was caught again after another robbery when police located his hideout after Ambrus accidentally left a piece of evidence behind at the crime scene. Ambrus was sentenced to 17 years in a maximum security prison. He was released early on parole because of good behavior on January 31, 2012. His accomplice on one of his earlier heists, K√°roly Antal (also a Romanian of Hungarian ethnicity), was caught at the Romanian-Hungarian border in 2004 and was sentenced to two and a half years of prison. His accomplice on most of his latter heists, G√°bor Orb√°n, served an eight-year sentence in a medium security prison. Being released from jail, in 2012 he continued pottery production in his native country, Romania, in Cs√≠kszereda (Miercurea Ciuc). Attila has been the subject of six songs. In other media Promotion for A Viszkis in downtown Budapest Ambrus was the subject of the award-winning book, Ballad of the Whiskey Robber (2004) by Julian Rubinstein. Rubinstein's book was adapted to audiobook with a full cast starring Eric Bogosian, Demetri Martin, novelist Gary Shteyngart, HBO Bored to Death's Jonathan Ames, novelist Arthur Phillips, singer Tommy Ramone and others; it was noted for its new approach to the medium. There have been Hungarian and German theater productions of scenes from the book. The book was optioned for film by Johnny Depp and Warner Bros. of which a screenplay was written that was named to Hollywood's 2008 Black List of best unproduced scripts of the year. His story was adapted to film by Nimr√≥d Antal; the film, titled The Whisky Robber (Hungarian: A Viszkis), was released in November 2017.

Contact Us It is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. History The earliest trace of the Catholic faith in the Green Bay area was in 1634. Jesuits followed Jean Nicolet to the area and started to spread the Gospel around the important rivers of the Green Bay area. This set a foundation for the creation of the Diocese of Green Bay, which was not officially formed until 1868. People of the area helped keep the faith until the framework of Christianity was finalized.Diocese of Green Bay. \\"A History of the Diocese of Green Bay,\\" 2002, accessed September 30, 2011. Father Claude-Jean Allouez, a Jesuit missionary, celebrated Mass with the Native Americans near the present site of Oconto on December 3, 1669, the feast of St. Francis Xavier. There he established St. Francis Xavier Mission. The mission was moved to Red Banks (northeast of Green Bay) for a short time in 1671, and then to De Pere, where it remained until 1687, when it was burned. The missionaries continued working with the Fox, Sauk, and Winnebago tribes under the protection of the French in newly constructed Fort Francis (west of the present Green Bay) until Fort Francis was destroyed in 1728. Catholicism then lay dormant in the area for almost a century. In 1825, a church school was constructed of the lumber taken from St. Francis Xavier Chapel, but was soon after burned. This church was inspired by the borough of Fort Howard, which continued to expand with the settlement of the Catholic French Canadians. This group had lived in the area since the eighteenth century. The next church to go up in the area was called St. John the Evangelist. This church is the longest surviving place of worship in Wisconsin today. In the early 19th century, St. John's church members spoke mostly French. It eventually became the mother church for all the churches in the Diocese of Green Bay. These churches included St. John Nepomucene in Little Chute, 1836; Holy Maternity of Mary, Manitowoc Rapids, 1848; St Edward, Mackville, 1849; St. Luke, Two Rivers, 1851; St. Anna, St. Anna, 1851; St. Peter, Oshkosh, 1853; and St. Mary (now St. Francis Xavier Cathedral), Green Bay, 1854. In the spring of 1868, Pope Pius IX created the Diocese of Green Bay. Although the area had many French-Canadian Catholics, their numbers shrank as new settlements were set up in other places and immigrants of other nationalities came to the area. Throughout the mid- to late-19th century immigrants poured in, forming their own ethnic churches. In Green Bay, the Germans established St. Mary (now St. Francis Xavier Cathedral) in 1854; the Dutch St. Willebrord in 1864; the Irish St. Patrick in 1865; the Belgians Sts. Peter and Paul in 1875; and the Polish St. Mary of the Angels in 1898. Intermarriage with non- French speakers and the growth of the English language in the area gradually weakened the bonds of the ethnic churches.

An appeal to the District Court failed, and in 2004 the original sentence was upheld.Mati Caspi convicted of bigamy; Haaretz, 6 February 2002Singer Matti Caspi's conviction for bigamy upheld by court; Haaretz, 10 February 2004 Musical career As a child, Caspi developed an interest in music through his piano lessons. His first public appearance as a performer was at the age of 16, performing on Kol Yisrael's Teshu'ot Rishonot, a talent show directed at teenagers. He recorded a song, \\"Lei·∫ìan Kippurim\\", the following year. For his mandatory service in the Israel Defense Forces, he performed with the Southern Command Troupe. He formed a trio with two of his friends, Gadi Oron and Ya‚Äôakov Noy, called The Three Fat Men. With this trio Caspi came out with his first big hit, Ani Met (I am dying). After Caspi's military service, The Three Fat Men became the They Don't Care trio. In the Yom Kippur War he toured army bases along with Leonard Cohen, who arranged his 1974 song \\"Lover Lover Lover\\" with Caspi. During the 70s he worked closely with Ehud Manor, another Israeli songwriter, and released some of his most popular songs: Lo Yadati SheTelchi Mimeni (I Didn‚Äôt Know You Would Leave Me), Brit Olam (Covenant of Love), and Shir HaYonah (The Song of the Dove). Over the next few decades, Caspi had a prolific musical career, released dozens of records and collaborated with some of the biggest and most well known Israeli artists of the time: Shlomo Gronich, Ehud Manor, Yehudit Ravitz, and Shalom Hanoch. He has released several more albums, of which the latest is Like in a Dance, released in 2017. Caspi has released close to 1,000 songs, both remakes of older songs and his original creations. His musical style is well known, especially for his harmony and popular writing style. Musicologist Tzipi Fleischer said: :\\"He is the genius among his fellow artists, he set an important milestone in the history of the music of the world. Caspi has invented his own new musical language. As I sit and analyze his harmonies I find myself amazed all over again each time. The fact that he functions as the performer, arranger and conductor has formed a certain reservedness and introversion, but the truth is that he is a musical wild man. He is the one who promoted sophistication and western standards to the region.\\" With some Israeli artists (chiefly Riki Gal), he not only took on the role of composer, but also of the producer. For Riki's 1996 album (I Love You More), he took responsibility for complete production and also songwriting. At least once, at the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest, he also served as a conductor, leading the Netherlands' prestigious Metropole Orkest in his composition \\"Emor Shalom,\\" performed by Chocolate, Menta, Mastik and also arranged by Caspi.

Gameplay Summer Heat follows the basic rules of the sport of beach volleyball. Two teams of two players each face off in a sectioned-off area of sand that serves as the playing area. One player serves the ball, and play begins. The objective is to land the ball on the ground within the play area of the other team's side. Players alternate hitting (\\"volleying\\") the ball, up to three volleys per turn, and the ball must travel over the net no later than the third hit. The game supports up to four players, though the use of a multitap accessory is required for three and four player games. Summer Heat is styled similarly to other arcade-style volleyball games of the era, where there is an emphasis on the sex appeal of the bikini-clad female characters as well as having the overall tone and atmosphere of a summer beach party. Music Summer Heat's soundtrack features music from Pink, Sum 41, Kylie Minogue, Sprung Monkey, Freshmaka, and Suburban. Reception The game was released during a period where volleyball video games were experiencing a period of renewed popularity for the first time in many years, although it received considerably less hype and critical praise than its contemporaries Beach Spikers, Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, and Outlaw Volleyball. It currently has a score of 68.09% on GameRankings and 65 out of 100 on Metacritic. The game was one of several poor-selling titles that would lead to Acclaim's bankruptcy in 2004. Future In 2006, Canadian game publisher Throwback Entertainment acquired the property rights for Summer Heat Beach Volleyball from Acclaim. Throwback had planned on developing another Summer Heat volleyball game for release on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, but there is no word on the status of such a game. Summer Heat Volleyball is expected to keep its identity and will not be dissolved or merged.

The summit, at , is the highest point in Ventura County. The mountain is the highest point of the Transverse Ranges west of Tejon Pass, as well as the southernmost point of the Salinian Block. Mount Pinos was named after its pine timber, \\"pinos\\" meaning \\"pine\\" in Spanish.  Geography  The summit of the mountain itself is relatively flat and open with several subsidiary summits. Open stands of conifers separated by chaparral shrub areas predominate. The view from the summit on a clear day encompasses the southern Central Valley, the southernmost Sierra Nevada, much of northern Ventura county, much of the Santa Barbara County mountains, the Caliente Range and the Carrizo Plain. The trace of the San Andreas Fault, clearly visible to the northwest, cuts between Mount Pinos and the mountains immediately to the north. The trace extends all the way to Soda Lake in the Carrizo Plain along the Elkhorn Scarp. The lights of Bakersfield and surrounding towns are visible on a clear evening to the north and northeast. Geology The mountain primarily consists of granitic rocks of the southern Salinian Block, in contrast to the nearby San Emigdio Mountains, which is primarily made of Precambrian metamorphic rock or Cenozoic sedimentary rock. Mount Pinos is therefore considered a geologically separate formation. Communities The small community of Pine Mountain Club lies due north of Mount Pinos. Lake of the Woods and Frazier Park are about to the east. Summit of Mount Pinos in the summer, from the east southeast  Climate  The summit plateau experiences harsh winters in comparison to most of Southern California. Most of the precipitation falls as winter snow. The area experiences several feet of snow each year with snowfields lasting till early June on the north facing slopes. In heavy snowfall years snowfields can last till late July or later. Temperatures fall to near freezing most days but can drop well into the single digits in the coldest months. Summer months are mild with high temperatures between and . The mountain experiences occasional thunderstorms with some delivering intense, localized downpours. Ecology=Flora Habitats on Mt. Pinos include: *Southern mixed evergreen forests *California montane chaparral and woodlands Fauna Mount Pinos is considered by ecologists to be home to one of the most significant populations of birds of prey in California. In the area live five owl species, Northern Goshawks, as well as California Condors.Bob Garrison, \\"Watchable Wildlife: Birds of Prey,\\" Outdoor California, September/October 1994. Found at: It is also home to alpine endemics such as the mountain quail, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay and pygmy nuthatch (best seen in campground), as well as hermit warbler (typical during migration) and green-tailed towhee.  Significance to Chumash people  Mount Pinos, or 'Iw…®h…®nmu in Samala and other Chumashan languages, is considered by Chumash peoples to be the center of the world or Liyikshup‚Äîthe point where everything is in balance. The summit is the highest in the region and near the center of Chumash lands. Throughout history, the peak has been utilized by Chumash peoples as a place of ceremony, prayer, and shrine offering. These traditions continue to be practiced by Chumash peoples today.  Hiking  The summit of Pinos can be reached by a hike along a dirt road from a parking area at the end of Los Padres National Forest Road S349S. The trail continues to the west entering the Chumash Wilderness and ends at Mount Abel (Cerro Noroeste). Almost all of this trail is above .  Snow sports  Mount Pinos on a cold winter evening. Consistent snow conditions on Mount Pinos allows for many types of winter recreation. This includes Backcountry skiing, cross country and telemark skiing, snowshoeing, snowboarding, sledding, and snow camping. The network of ski trails and backcountry ski and snowboarding bowls on Mount Pinos are documented on several locally produced maps. The ski trails are part of a dispersed recreation area administered in partnership by the United States Forest Service, Los Padres National Forest and the Southern California Nordic Ski Patrol. The patrol operates the Nordic Base facility on weekends only in the winter. It is located at the top of Mount Pinos Road and adjacent to the Chula Vista parking lot. From the Chula Vista parking lot a trail network spreads both uphill towards Condor Point and downhill reaching as far as McGill Campground. Skiing and boarding are also available in backcountry bowls on the north face of the peak and ridges that drop all the way down the mountain to about the level. Popular destinations include Condor Point, 1st and 2nd Meadows, and Inspiration Point. The Overlook trail accesses the North Ridge area which hosted an alpine ski area during the 1960s. The area lifts were rope tows situated on the three fingers of the drainage just north of Overlook trail. More ambitious back country skiing can include trips to nearby Sheep Camp on Sawmill Mountain, Mount Abel (Cerro Noroeste) and if snow conditions allow a descent all the way to Pine Mountain Club. During and immediately after heavy snow storms it may not be possible to drive to the top of Mount Pinos Road due to the lack of snow plow availability. In such cases it is common for the Kern County Roads Department to close a snow gate lower on the mountain. It is still possible to ski from the snow gate and enjoy the lower slopes of Mount Pinos. Snow at lower elevations also facilitates cross country skiing to Iris Point which provides great views of Lockwood Valley. It is important to note that some of these trails depend on sufficient snowpack. The trails are not declared hiking trails in the summer and consequently a separate hiking map is available from the Forest Service. Other nearby recreational opportunities include astronomy, fishing, off-roading, horseback riding and bouldering. Mount Pinos is often referred to by Adam Carolla on his radio show and podcasts.  Astronomy  Mount Pinos, top right, taken from Pine Mountain located to the north- northwest. Mount Pinos is considered to be one of the best viewing sites in Southern California due to its relatively low light pollution, dry air and frequently clear skies and is one of the favorite gathering places for amateur astronomers in the region. The usual viewing area is not the summit of the mountain, but the large tree-surrounded parking area of Chula Vista Campground at the end of the paved road about two miles east of the peak.

It is located above the River Nethan, a tributary of the River Clyde, at . The castle is two miles west of the village of Crossford, and 4.5 miles north-west of Lanark. Built in the first half of the 16th century, Craignethan is recognised as an excellent early example of a sophisticated artillery fortification,See Tabraham (1997) p.102, and Mason (2000) p.94. although its defences were never fully tested. History The barony of Draffane, in which Craignethan was located, was a property of the Black Douglases until their forfeiture in 1455. The land was granted to the Hamilton family, and in 1530 was given by James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran to his illegitimate son James Hamilton of Finnart. James Hamilton of Finnart had travelled in Europe, and had become an accomplished architect and military engineer. Appointed Kings Master of Works, he was responsible for the defences at Blackness Castle, as well as the renaissance facades of Linlithgow Palace. At Craignethan, he set out to build a \\"showcase\\" to display his talents in both domestic and military architecture.Mason, p.94-98 Despite his earlier Royal favour, Hamilton was executed for treason in 1540, and his properties were forfeit to the crown. The Hamilton family, in the person of the 2nd Earl of Arran, regained Craignethan Castle two years later. The second earl added a large outer courtyard to the west of the castle. Arran, who became Duc de Ch√¢tellerault following Mary, Queen of Scots' marriage to the French Dauphin, served as regent in her infancy. However, he later opposed Mary's second marriage to Lord Darnley, and was forced to surrender his castles at Craignethan and Cadzow. The situation was reversed once more following Mary's abdication, when Arran aided her escape from Loch Leven Castle, and regained his castles. Arran's son, Lord Claud Hamilton, is said to have entertained Mary at Craignethan on the night before the Battle of Langside in 1568.This story is questioned by Lindsay (1986), p.164, who suggests that an alternative tale placing Mary at Castlemilk on the eve of the battle, is \\"topographically more plausible\\". The battle, at which the Hamiltons fought the forces of Regent Moray, ended in defeat, and Mary was forced to flee to England. Craignethan and Cadzow were surrendered again, Moray came in person to the castle to receive the keys on 15 May 1568.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (1900), 407. Lord Claud attempted to recover the castle by force in October,Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (1900), 516. and his brother Lord John began to starve out Moray's soldiers in November. The Hamiltons regained the castle by March.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 1 (1883), 374:CSP Scotland, vol.2 (1900), 630. Feuding continued between the Hamiltons and the opponents of Mary. In 1570, Moray was shot in Linlithgow by James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh. After an English army assisting in the Marian civil war went to Glasgow in May 1570 the Hamiltons withdrew to Craignethan, and the Earl of Sussex was informed of Craignethan's defensive shortcomings; > \\"Draffin, a strong house of the Duke's, but situate in a hole, so that it is > commanded on every part, and has no ordnance.\\"Boyd, William, ed., Calendar > State Papers Scotland, vol.3 (1902), p.182 no.250 In the same month Lord Sempill now a King's man was captured and imprisoned in the castle.Boyd, William, ed., Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.3 (1902), p.191 no.263 A treaty was signed between the King and Queen's parties in 1573, but by 1579 the Hamiltons were outlawed, and Lord Claud fled to France. Levies of troops were raised to capture Craignethan and Cadzow, and both surrendered to government forces in May 1579. Claud's older brother the 3rd Earl of Arran, who had been confined at Craignethan since 1575, their younger brother David, and mother were captured and taken to Linlithgow. Six soldiers of the Hamilton family who had defended the Hamilton strongholds were taken to stand trial for Moray's murder at Stirling.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5, (1907), 338. By royal authority, Craignethan was slighted by James Hamilton of Libertoun, this involved the demolition of the north-west tower and the massive west wall, the 'inner barmkin', which was tumbled into the ditch, rendering the castle relatively defenceless.Register of the Privy Council, vol. iii, (Edinburgh, 1887), 189: Order given by Council to James Hamilton to proceed, July 1580 (e.g., NAS E22/4 f45v.) On 1 July 1592 Lord John Hamilton captured Archibald Wauchope of Niddrie with other rebel followers of the Earl of Bothwell at the meadow of Lesmahagow and imprisoned them in the castle. James VI sent Sir John Carmichael, captain of the royal guard, to collect the prisoners, but one of Hamilton's sons released them.David Calderwood, History of the Kirk, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 169-170. Craignethan was regained by the Hamiltons, but was sold by Duchess Anne in 1659. The new owner, Andrew Hay, a covenanting laird, built himself a two-storey house in the south-west corner of the outer courtyard. In 1730 Craignethan was sold to Archibald Douglas, Duke of Douglas. The property passed to his supposed collateral descendants, the Earls of Home, and the ruins were stabilised by the 12th earl in the late 19th century. The property was given into state care by the 14th Earl in 1949, and is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument managed by Historic Scotland. Architecture Craignethan is built on an imposing site above a bend in the River Nethan. Steep slopes protect the castle on the south, north and east sides, but the castle is actually overlooked by higher ground to the west, making it far more vulnerable than it appears. Craignethan's defences are therefore concentrated towards the west. The castle comprises a low central keep, within a rectangular walled courtyard. To the west is a deep ditch and beyond, a larger outer courtyard. MacIvor writes that \\"Craignethan was the last private castle of high defensive capability built de novo in Scotland\\", comparing it to the contemporary remodelings undertaken at Blackness Castle and Tantallon Castle.Ian MacIvor, \\"Craignethan Castle\\", 1978, Edinburgh, HMSO. Keep The rectangular keep measures 21m by 16m, and was originally of two storeys plus an attic. Attic and roof are now gone, but the walls are complete up to decorative corbels which supported a parapet walk. Round bartizans top each corner, and machicolations guard the door. Inside, the keep differs from the usual tower house layout in several ways. The entrance leads into a large stair lobby on the main hall floor, which was more commonly located on the first floor. Below this level are subterranean vaulted cellars containing four rooms, a prison, and a well. Access was from the main entrance lobby or direct from the kitchen. The keep is divided internally by a wall running west to east. South of this wall on the ground floor is the hall, measuring 6m by 12m. The hall was accessed from the entrance lobby to the west, and was lit by three large windows. A fireplace stood in the internal wall, and a minstrel's gallery overlooks from the west wall. The hall ceiling was a stone vault, and the room fills the whole height of the keep. North of the internal wall was the kitchen, and a private room. Above these, within the height of the keep, were two additional rooms accessed from below. Another four rooms were located in the attic. The roof was a double gable, the central valley supported by the internal wall. Inner courtyard The inner courtyard measures , with walls strengthened by rectangular towers at each corner. The entrance was via a dog-leg passage through a gate tower midway along the north wall. The west wall was designed to stand up to artillery bombardment, and was up to 5m thick. It was destroyed in the late 16th century, and only the foundations remain. It is thought that the west wall was as high as the relatively low keep, and that this arrangement would have protected the keep from bombardment from the higher ground to the west. Of the towers, the south-east was the largest, and is the only one still standing. Known as the \\"Kitchen Tower\\", it may in fact have housed the chapel. It is of three storeys, the lowest a subterranean vaulted chamber. Gunloops in the upper parts overlook the eastern approaches to the castle. Each of the four towers had space for storage and service areas, as well as additional accommodation for guests. The defences of the original castle were completed by a ditch, 3.5m deep and 9m wide, at the base of the west wall. This ditch, originally crossed via a drawbridge, was filled in when the castle was slighted, and not re-excavated until the 1960s. In the base of the ditch a caponier was uncovered, a highly unusual feature in a Scottish castle. The caponier was accessed from the south-west tower, and comprised an enclosed tunnel with gunports overlooking the ditch, allowing the defenders to fire on any attackers attempting to cross or bridge the ditch. The only other known surviving caponiers in Scotland are at Blackness Castle, also designed by James Hamilton of Finnart, and a later example by Theodore Dury at Stirling Castle. Outer court The outer court was less heavily defended than the inner, and was added in the 1540s by the 2nd Earl of Arran. The court would have had service buildings around the perimeter, and possible gardens at the centre. There are towers at the two western corners, the north-west including a dovecot. The south-west tower was incorporated into Andrew Hay's House, the two storey dwelling built here by Andrew Hay in 1665. Gunloops are located along the west wall, which contains the main gate halfway along. Walter Scott In the Autumn of 1799 Walter Scott visited Bothwell Castle as a guest of Archibald Lord Douglas, and on a morning excursion to Craignethan Castle was so enraptured by the scene that his hosts offered him lifetime use of Andrew Hay's dwelling. He did not immediately turn this option down, but later circumstances prevented from making this area his summer residence. Scott's novel Old Mortality, published in 1816, was largely set in and around Tillietudlem Castle. Chapter XI describes the location: \\"All heads were now bent from the battlements of the turret, which commanded a distant prospect down the vale of the river. The Tower of Tillietudlem stood, or perhaps yet stands, upon the angle of a very precipitous bank, formed by the junction of a considerable brook with the Clyde.\\" In June 1829 he wrote to his friend James Skene, who was preparing etchings to illustrate Scott's books, \\"I did not think on Craignethan in writing about Tillietudlem, and I believe it differs in several respects from my Chateau en Espagne. It is not on the Clyde in particular, and, if I recollect, the view is limited and wooded. But that can be no objection to adopting it as that which public taste has adopted as coming nearest to the ideal of the place.\\" In the revised Magnum Edition of Old Mortality, published in 1830, Scott added a footnote: \\"The Castle of Tillietudlem is imaginary; but the ruins of Craignethan Castle, situated on the Nethan, about three miles from its junction with the Clyde, have something of the character of the description in the text\\"., Gutenberg online edition chapter XI, The Journal of Sir Walter Scott by Sir Walter Scott: June 1829Mason states that Scott denied the connection, although Lindsay (1985) reports that Scott considered buying and renovating Craignethan as an alternative residence to Abbotsford. In September 1834 Scott's son in law John Gibson Lockhart took the artist J. M. W. Turner to visit Craignethan. Turner made a sketch of the castle from the north, seen across the Nethan Gorge, then made several drawings in and around the ruins. Due to the association with Scott's novel, Craignethan castle became a popular place to visit. In 1876 Tillietudlem railway station was constructed on the Coalburn branch of the nearby Caledonian Railway line.Railscot page on the Coalburn Branch, , see also Lanarkshire, Sheet XXIV - OS Six-inch 1st edition, 1843-1882 - National Library of Scotland, survey date 1858, published 1864.

They are consecrated to God by public profession (of solemn vows) of the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience. They have the full Habit, monastic customs and regular observances of the nuns of the Order of Preachers. This community is a member of the Second Order of Friars Preachers and has gained full recognition by the Dominican Order. The Dominican Nuns came into existence 800 years ago (1206) when Saint Dominic began his Order of Preachers by first establishing a cloistered monastery of women in Prouille, France. In 1880, Dominican monastic life took root in the United States. Approximately 50 years later, only days after her sixteenth birthday, the then Anna Rita McKanna (later receiving the name in religion, Sister Mary Henry of Jesus, O.P.) entered the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Sacrament in Detroit, Michigan (since relocated to Farmington Hills, Michigan). Shortly after her solemn profession of vows there, this exemplary young religious was chosen to be one of the foundresses of the Dominican Monastery of the Infant Jesus in Lufkin, Texas (1945). Thirty-six years later, the Reverend Mother Mary Henry of Jesus, O.P., set out to found the Dominican Monastery of the Heart of Jesus in Lockport, Louisiana.  Hospitality  There is also a guesthouse on the monastery grounds with accommodations for individuals or groups. There are openings available year round. Discernment-based days consist of sharing in the liturgical prayer life of the Dominican Nuns within a balanced schedule that includes a daily series of personal/group interviews and question sessions in the grille parlor. It is during this time that a particular vocation to the Community may be explored. Private or silent retreats are an option generally exclusive to priests and religious.

The stadium was covered up during the construction of the House of the People. As of 2006, the remnants of the stadium are being converted into an underground parking lot. After World War I, the hill gave its name to a famous trial (the Dealul Spirii Trial) that involved the members of the Romanian Communist Party, after a bomb was detonated on 8 December 1920 in the Romanian Senate (situated on the hill), which was detonated by Max Goldstein, a communist sympathizer. Uranus Hill Around the hill was located the Uranus quarter, named after the main thoroughfare, which ran up the hill from Calea Rahovei to the Stadium, and thence to Splaiul Independen≈£ei and Izvor. This was one of the historic districts completely destroyed by Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's communist regime, in order to build the \\"House of the People\\" (see Ceau»ôima).

Production Riefenstahl was best known for her documentary film Olympia (1938), on the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin and her Nazi propaganda films, Der Sieg des Glaubens (1933), Triumph of the Will (1935), and Tag der Freiheit (1935), which are regarded by historians as among the greatest propaganda films of all time. The United States release of this film, in 1993, coincided with the publication of Riefenstahl's autobiography Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir (New York, 1993), as well as with her ninetieth birthday. The two releases are not unrelated. The Wonderful, Horrible life of Leni Riefenstahl was born from an idea of Riefenstahl herself, who, motivated by her old age and already working on her memoirs, decided to commission a documentary about her life. Concerned about being associated with the 'Nazi director', eighteen filmmakers declined the project, before M√ºller agreed to portray Riefenstahl in what ended up being a three-hour-long documentary (three times its contract length). The length of the film is therefore the result of a decision by the director: M√ºller justifies it as an attempt to give a fair representation of Riefenstahl's life, which cannot be reduced to the eight years she worked for the Nazi regime, but presents much more interesting stories and facts that are relevant to understand her personality. Showing more historical material about her life, according to M√ºller, also helps to compensate the strong image of herself that Riefenstahl tries to impose throughout the movie, giving the viewer a better chance to draw their own conclusions. The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl encapsulates a historical figure at the end of her life. Through this film, it is shown how Riefenstahl dealt with the repercussions of her early work. Reception The film garnered a strong critical response. It currently has a 95% rating amongst critics cited on the Rotten Tomatoes film review website.The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl (1993) Rotten Tomatoes > \\"This movie is fascinating in so many different ways: As the story of an > extraordinary life, as the reconstruction of the career of one of the > greatest of film artists, as the record of an ideological debate, as a > portrait of an amazing old woman.\\" Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-TimesThe > Wonderful Horrible Life Of Leni Riefenstahl (review) Chicago Sun-Times.

October 14, 1993 Release and awards Belgian, British, and German production companies financed the film and it was distributed by American, Japanese, Canadian, and French companies. It premiered at the Toronto Festival of Festivals in September 1993, followed shortly thereafter at several American film festivals. When broadcast in the United States, the film received a primetime slot of 8:00pm on stations like PBS. When televised in Germany and Austria, the film met opposition and wasn't aired until 11:00pm. It won an Emmy Award at the International Emmy Awards in 1993, for Arts Documentary. Ray M√ºller won the Golden Space Needle Award for best documentary at the Seattle International Film Festival in 1994. The film is consistently found on ‚Äúbest documentary‚Äù lists.

The person who designs the decision-making procedure needs to know the preferences of the participants to achieve the most desirable outcome by shifting majorities.

He ran again in 1951, this time defeating his PC opponent by 88 votes. Wren sat with the Liberal caucus and ran twice in Ontario Liberal Party leadership conventions. He placed second in 1954 with 162 votes when he lost to Farquhar Oliver (a former United Farmers of Ontario MPP). In 1957, Wren and fellow MPP Arthur Reaume were expelled from the Liberal caucus for attacking Oliver's leadership and demanding a new leadership convention. Oliver subsequently resigned and a new leadership vote was held in 1958. Wren ran, placing last with only seven votes on the first ballot and then threw his support to John Wintermeyer who ultimately came from behind to win the convention.

A short stretch of this is visible in South Norwood at Heavers' Meadow, near Selhurst railway station, where the brook can be seen in a concrete channel next to the British Rail works as it runs north west along the bottom of the site before disappearing beneath Selhurst Road. It is fenced off here because it can be very dangerous, especially after a rain storm, where the water level can rise several feet in a few minutes as the water rapidly drains from the roads and hard surfaces around and into the surface water drain. The brook reappears in Thornton Heath Recreation Ground, running along the western boundary of the park in a deep concrete channel. Most of the time the brook is fairly shallow, but during heavy rainfall water quickly drains from the adjacent built up areas and the water level rapidly rises. It then continues behind several private houses in between before reaching Norbury Park where, once again, it is hidden behind a tall fence. The brook continues west, to form the boundary between Norbury and Streatham on London Road at Hermitage Bridge, where it is one of the few rivers remaining overground in the area. As the boundary between the London County Council and Croydon for many years people wishing to travel south had to get off an LCC tram, walk across the bridge and catch a Croydon tram. West of the bridge the brook becomes the River Graveney, where it flows on to join the Wandle, and ultimately the River Thames.

It was originally called Summerfield and used to have a subsidiary school, Summerfields, St Leonards-on-Sea, (known as \\"Summers mi\\"). History Summerfield became a boys' preparatory school in 1864, with seven pupils. Its owner, Archibald Maclaren, had been educated at Dollar Academy and was a fencing teacher who ran a gymnasium in Oxford. He believed strongly in the importance of physical fitness. His wife, Gertrude, was a classical scholar and teacher, a daughter of David Alphonso Talboys. The school motto is Mens sana in corpore sano, \\"A healthy mind in a healthy body\\". The school grew and needed more staff, two of whom married into the Maclaren family: the Reverend Dr Charles Williams (\\"Doctor\\"), who took over the scholarship form from Mrs Maclaren and married Mabel Maclaren in 1879, and the Reverend Hugh Alington, who married Margaret Maclaren in 1885 and took over the boys' games. The school remained in the hands of the Maclaren, Williams, and Alington families for its first 75 years. At the end of the 19th Century, \\"Doctor\\" became headmaster and there was much building at the school. A second school, \\"Summers mi\\", was opened at St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, for boys to benefit from the sea air. In 1918 Doctor passed the headmastership on to Hugh Alington. There was a lean spell in the 1930s, and numbers fell, but John Evans and Geoffrey Bolton (\\"G.B.\\") took over in 1939. During the Second World War three other schools were evacuated to Summer Fields - Famborough School, Hampshire, Summers mi, and St Cyprian's School from Eastbourne - and this restored the numbers. In 1955, the school became a charitable trust, with a board of governors, including Harold Macmillan, who had been at the school as a boy and was soon to become Prime Minister. Drawing of Summer Fields from A Century of Summer Fields, 1964 During the 1960s, Pat Savage was headmaster, with the assistance of Jimmy Bell and Pat Marston. By the centenary year in 1964, the school's appearance had changed relatively little (see illustration), but it was thriving and energetic enough to celebrate with a hardback book of 332 pages, with contributions from \\"O.S.\\", or Old Summerfieldians, including stories about Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell, and Harold Macmillan, and a friendly greeting in verse from the arch-rival Horris Hill School.Richard Usborne, 1964. One O.S. recollected Pat Marston as follows: However, another former pupil described a culture of brutality at the school, epitomised by 'the Ogre': \\"Any honest account would have described Pat Marston as a brutal sadist. 'Bend over the arm of that sofa and pull down your pyjama trousers, boy. And then the beating would begin ... The result was a web of welts and cuts that descended as far as the back of your knees, or even lower.\\" In 1975, Nigel Talbot Rice took over as headmaster. He put the school on a sound financial footing through a series of appeals which paid for an ambitious building programme: new classrooms, the Macmillan Hall and Music Centre, an indoor swimming-pool, the Wavell Arts and Technology Centre, named after Earl Wavell, and the Sports Hall. In 1997, Talbot Rice retired and was succeeded by Robin Badham-Thornhill. In 2010 David Faber, an old boy and governor, took over as headmaster. In 2002 a new lodge called \\"Savage's\\" was built. Later a new year group was added at the bottom of the school. Summer Fields today The boys are organised into four \\"leagues\\". One of them is named Maclaren, after the Founder; the others are Moseley, after Henry Moseley, Congreve, after William La Touche Congreve, and Case, after William Sterndale Case, a master from 1910 to 1922. Each league has its own identifying colour: Case red, Congreve yellow, Maclaren green, and Moseley blue. In leagues, the boys wear a polo shirt in the league colour, along with the rest of the uniform, blue corduroys, and brown shoes. On Sundays as well as on special days, such as the school concert, and the end of term, boys wear a tweed jacket, with a light blue coloured shirt, black shoes, and grey flannel trousers. Their ties are in their league colours. The school has traditionally been a rival of the Dragon School, which is also in north Oxford.

He was highly regarded at the time for his motets, which anticipate the style of Palestrina, and in addition he was an early pioneer of polychoral writing. Life He may have been French in origin, since Girolamo Cardano, writing about him in his Theonoston (1560) called him \\"Gallus\\", and French was evidently his native language. Few details of his life are known with certainty, but some inferences can be made. Much of his career he spent in Italy, and he worked at both the court and cathedral in Urbino in 1544 and 1545. Some of his life he also probably spent in Lyon, as evidenced by several publications there, the music of which contains items of local interest; in addition the dedications are to citizens of Lyon. While stylistically some of his music seems likely to have been connected with Venice, there is no evidence of his activity there; however he published two books of psalm settings in Venice in 1554. According to CardanoJacob, Grove online he was executed for \\"homosexual practices\\", probably in Lyon in 1556. Music Phinot's music was widely distributed, and he was highly praised by writers of the time, including Heinrich Finck and Pietro Cerone. Cerone called Phinot \\"one of the first and best composers of the time\\" and also said \\"had there been no Phinot, ... Palestrina's music would not have been possible.\\" Reese, p. 350 Heinrich Finck ranked him with Crecquillon, Clemens non Papa and Gombert, three contemporary composers who wrote similar music; indeed Phinot's style strongly resembles Gombert's. More motets by Phinot survive than any other type of composition. A total of 2 masses, 4 magnificats, 2 madrigals, more than 60 chansons and approximately 90 motets have been attributed to him. Most of the motets are for five voices, and like those of Gombert, use pervasive imitation with all the voices being equal; there are few rests, so there is little contrast between groups of high and groups of low voices, or groups of few versus groups of many voices, contrasts which were popular with composers of the previous generation (for example Josquin). Phinot seems to have been most highly regarded by the next generation of composers, including Palestrina and Lassus who both admired his music, for his polychoral works. The polychoral motets, including a setting of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, foreshadow the work of Willaert and the Venetian school. The Lamentations are for eight voices in two groups of four, who answer each other antiphonally and then gradually build to a climax as the groups increasingly overlap, eventually singing together in eight independent contrapuntal parts. These polychoral motets are considered by some scholars to be the earliest examples of mature polychoral writing (for example, A. F. Carver).A.F. Carver, Cori spezzati: the Development of Sacred Polychoral Music to the Time of Sch√ºtz. Cambridge, 1988. They were reprinted time and again during the 16th century, indicating their popularity and influence. Phinot's chansons use most of the techniques current at the time, and contain a variety of textures and approaches to setting text. Subjects range from satirical attacks on clerical abuses to love songs, some in the manner of Catullus and Ovid. They were published in two separate collections in Lyon in 1548.

She was named for the Mohican tribe. Construction Mohican was laid down by Mare Island Navy Yard, California, 4 September 1872, funded with the repair money allocated for the first ; launched 27 December 1883; sponsored by Miss Eleanor W. Much; and commissioned 25 May 1885, Commander Benjamin F. Day in command. Service history=First Cruise Assigned to the Pacific Squadron, Mohican departed San Francisco, California 27 June 1885 to patrol the coast of Mexico and South America. Steaming as far south as Callao, Peru, the sloop of war spent the winter at that port and then departed 6 March 1886 for the South Pacific. For the remainder of the year, the warship cruised in tropical waters, visiting the Marquesas, Tahiti, and the Tuamotu Archipelago, and patrolling Samoan waters to protect American interests from German political interference. In July she paid an official call in Auckland, New Zealand. She surveyed Easter Island in December for the Smithsonian Institution, and then sailed on the 31st for South America, arriving Valparaiso, Chile, 14 January 1887. Mohican operated off the South American coast until sailing from Callao for Honolulu 10 September, and then following protocol activities and patrol in the islands through January 1888 cruised in the South Pacific until returning to Mare Island via Honolulu 1 August. The warship underwent an 11-month overhaul and then returned to Polynesian waters to patrol, in addition visiting Sydney, Australia, and Auckland. After a year- and-a-half cruise, she returned to San Francisco 9 April 1891. Second Cruise Sailors on USS Mohican in 1888. Mohican visiting Vancouver, British Columbia. Two months later, 19 June, Mohican stood out to assist the short lived Bering Sea Squadron in anti-poaching operations by protecting the sealing plants and fisheries from trouble Mohican remained in northern waters until 19 October 1892. While returning to San Francisco, Mohican twice ran aground and required repair of her keel and boilers. A court of inquiry, which included Captains Benjamin F. Day and Alfred Thayer Mahan, was conducted in December to try its captain, Commander H. L. Johnson for the matter. Commander Johnson was acquitted. Third Cruise After completion of repairs in January 1893, Mohican was outfitted as flagship for Rear Admiral Joseph S. Skerrett, commander of the Pacific Squadron. Following the overthrow of Hawaii 's last reigning monarch, Queen Liliuokalani, on 17 January 1893, Skerrett and his new flagship, Mohican were ordered to depart for Honolulu on 29 January 1893. With a new Hawaiian provisional government established, Mohican returned to San Francisco in May 1893. She subsequently sailed in June for Alaska to continue her Bering Sea patrols, ending a 22-month cruise at San Francisco 8 October 1894. The ship remained on the Pacific coast, visiting ports in the Northwest and patrolling. On 13 August 1895, during his around the world tour, Samuel Clemens and his family dined aboard at the invitation of Mohicans Executive Officer, Lieutenant Commander Albion Wadhams, described as an old acquaintance of Clemens. Mohican was decommissioned at Mare Island 16 September 1895. Fourth Cruise Mohican was recommissioned 8 February 1898 because of imminent danger of war with Spain. She then made two voyages to Hawaii to protect American interests, March to May and June to September. Following the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, she was assigned duty as a school ship for landsmen at Mare Island. The venerable sloop cruised the Pacific coast into 1902 and then in January 1903 sailed across the Pacific, steaming via Honolulu, Christmas Island, Samoa, and Guam to Yokohama, Japan, on a goodwill visit. She returned to Mare Island in August following stops at Honolulu and Dutch Harbor, Unalaska, and then resumed cruising the Californian and Mexican coasts. On 8 April 1904, the ship was assigned as station ship at the Naval Station, Olongapo, Subic Bay, Luzon, Philippines, and 1 month later sailed via Honolulu, Guam, and Cavite for her new station, arriving 4 February 1905. As tender Mohican served as station ship into 1910, being ordered to additional service as tender for submarine divisions, Asiatic Fleet, 30 December 1909. The veteran warship steamed to Cavite 30 March 1910 for duty as submarine tender there and three years later 17 March 1913 was designated receiving ship at Cavite and stationary tender, 1st Submarine Group, Torpedo Flotilla, Asiatic Fleet. Though relieved of this duty by monitor 27 June 1914, she continued her tending duties through the end of 1915. Decommissioned Mohican decommissioned at Cavite 21 October 1921 and was sold 4 March 1922 to A. E. Haley of Manila.

It originally aired on February 21, 1963 on CBS. The story centers on a man's obsession with a dollhouse whose figures seem to be alive. Opening narrationPlot Charley Parkes thinks he sees a figure in a museum dollhouse that comes alive. He returns to the museum numerous times and gazes into the dollhouse. He keeps coming back and sees the doll in the house become animated (portrayed by a human actress). A guard tells him that the doll is not mechanical, but merely carved from a single block of wood, but this does not dissuade Charley. Charley gradually falls in love with the figure, a woman who is in an abusive relationship with a male figure in the dollhouse. There is also a female housekeeper in the dollhouse. Charley is committed to a psychiatric hospital because of his belief that the figures in the dollhouse are alive and because he smashes the glass case of the dollhouse in an attempt to rescue the doll from the abusive male doll. He eventually is \\"rehabilitated\\", after some resistance, by pretending to be disabused of the delusion, and is returned to the care of his mother. On the evening of his return home, his mother, sister, brother-in-law and a friend of his sister (who is interested in dating him) plan to celebrate his release with him, but discover that he has snuck out the house. They contact the psychiatrist who treated Charley in the hospital and surmise that he has returned to the museum and the dollhouse. At the museum, Charley reveals his feelings for the figure. He relates to her in certain aspects (the woman dealing with an abusive suitor and Charley dealing with his overbearing mother). The family members, psychiatrist, and museum guards search the museum for Charley but find nothing. Except for one guard, who glances into the dollhouse and sees Charley, now a miniature figure, finally together with his love in the dollhouse, sharing a stereoscope. Smiling, the guard decides never to reveal what he has witnessed.

Vegetable oil can be used as an alternative fuel in diesel engines and in heating oil burners. When vegetable oil is used directly as a fuel, in either modified or unmodified equipment, it is referred to as straight vegetable oil (SVO) or pure plant oil (PPO). Conventional diesel engines can be modified to help ensure that the viscosity of the vegetable oil is low enough to allow proper atomization of the fuel. This prevents incomplete combustion, which would damage the engine by causing a build-up of carbon. Straight vegetable oil can also be blended with conventional diesel or processed into biodiesel or bioliquids for use under a wider range of conditions. History Rudolf Diesel Rudolf Diesel was the father of the engine which bears his name. His first attempts were to design an engine to run on coal dust, but later designed his engine to run on vegetable oil. The idea, he hoped, would make his engines more attractive to farmers having a source of fuel readily available. In a 1912 presentation to the British Institute of Mechanical Engineers, he cited a number of efforts in this area and remarked, \\"The fact that fat oils from vegetable sources can be used may seem insignificant today, but such oils may perhaps become in course of time of the same importance as some natural mineral oils and the tar products are now.\\" Periodic petroleum shortages spurred research into vegetable oil as a diesel substitute during the 1930s and 1940s, and again in the 1970s and early 1980s when straight vegetable oil enjoyed its highest level of scientific interest. The 1970s also saw the formation of the first commercial enterprise to allow consumers to run straight vegetable oil in their automobiles, Elsbett of West Germany. In the 1990s Bougainville conflict, islanders cut off from oil supplies due to a blockade used coconut oil to fuel their vehicles. (2000) a documentary film Application and usability= Modified fuel systems  Most diesel car engines are suitable for the use of straight vegetable oil (SVO), also commonly called pure plant oil (PPO), with certain modifications. Principally, the viscosity and surface tension of the SVO/PPO must be reduced by preheating it, typically by using waste heat from the engine or electricity, otherwise poor atomization, incomplete combustion and carbonization may result. One common solution is to add a heat exchanger and an additional fuel tank for the petrodiesel or biodiesel blend and to switch between this additional tank and the main tank of SVO/PPO. The engine is started on diesel, switched over to vegetable oil as soon as it is warmed up and switched back to diesel shortly before being switched off to ensure that no vegetable oil remains in the engine or fuel lines when it is started from cold again. In colder climates it is often necessary to heat the vegetable oil fuel lines and tank as it can become very viscous and even solidify. Single tank conversions have been developed, largely in Germany, which have been used throughout Europe. These conversions are designed to provide reliable operation with rapeseed oil that meets the German rapeseed oil fuel standard DIN 51605. Modifications to the engines cold start regime assist combustion on start up and during the engine warm up phase. Suitably modified indirect injection (IDI) engines have proven to be operable with 100% PPO down to temperatures of . Direct injection (DI) engines generally have to be preheated with a block heater or diesel fired heater. The exception is the VW Tdi (Turbocharged Direct Injection) engine for which a number of German companies offer single tank conversions. For long term durability it has been found necessary to increase the oil change frequency and to pay increased attention to engine maintenance.  Unmodified indirect injection engines  Many cars powered by indirect injection engines supplied by in-line injection pumps, or mechanical Bosch injection pumps are capable of running on pure SVO/PPO in all but winter temperatures. The most popular of these are the OM616 and OM617 engines found in the Mercedes-Benz W123 and W124 vehicles manufactured from 1980 through 1985. Indirect injection Mercedes-Benz vehicles with in-line injection pumps and cars featuring the PSA XUD engine tend to perform reasonably, especially as the latter is normally equipped with a coolant heated fuel filter. Engine reliability would depend on the condition of the engine. Attention to maintenance of the engine, particularly of the fuel injectors, cooling system and glow plugs will help to provide longevity. Ideally the engine would be converted.  Vegetable oil blending  The relatively high kinematic viscosity of vegetable oils must be reduced to make them compatible with conventional compression-ignition engines and fuel systems. Cosolvent blending is a low-cost and easy-to-adapt technology that reduces viscosity by diluting the vegetable oil with a low-molecular-weight solvent. This blending, or \\"cutting\\", has been done with diesel fuel, kerosene, and gasoline, amongst others; however, opinions vary as to the efficacy of this. Noted problems include higher rates of wear and failure in fuel pumps and piston rings when using blends.Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission: \\"Coconut Oil Fuel Research in the Republic of the Marshall Islands\\"  Home heating  When liquid fuels made from biomass are used for energy purposes other than transport, they are called bioliquids or biofuels.Renewable Energy Association 2009 Handbook With often minimal modification, most residential furnaces and boilers that are designed to burn No. 2 heating oil can be made to burn either biodiesel or filtered, preheated waste vegetable oil (WVO). New standard oil burners are certified to operate on 20% biodiesel (B-20). Higher blends are possible with care, since biodiesel tends to liberate existing tarry deposits in fuel tank, which may tend to clog one or more filters. Conventional oil burners tend to clog and char if more than a smaller fraction of vegetable oil is mixed with conventional oil fuel. If the vegetable oil is cleaned at home by the consumer, WVO can result in considerable savings. Many restaurants will receive a minimal amount for their used cooking oil, and processing to a biofuel is fairly simple and inexpensive. Making the oil into biodiesel involves some toxic and hazardous chemical transformations. Burning filtered WVO directly is somewhat more problematic, since it is more viscous and has a higher ignition temperature; nonetheless, its burning can be accomplished with suitable preheating or burners designed to operate on it. WVO can thus be an economical heating option for those with the necessary mechanical and experimental aptitude. = Combined heat and power = A number of companies offer compressed ignition engine generators optimized to run on plant oils where the waste engine heat is recovered for heating. Properties The main form of SVO/PPO used in the UK is rapeseed oil (also known as canola oil, primarily in the United States and Canada) which has a freezing point of . However the use of sunflower oil, which gels at around , is currently being investigated as a means of improving cold weather starting. However, oils with lower gelling points tend to be less saturated (leading to a higher iodine number) and polymerize more easily in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. Material compatibility Polymerization also has been consequentially linked to catastrophic component failures such as injection pump shaft seizure and breakage, injector tip failure leading to various and/or combustion chamber components damaged. Most metallurgical problems such as corrosion and electrolysis are related to water based contamination or poor choices of plumbing (such as copper or Zinc) which can cause gelling- even with petroleum based fuels. Temperature effects Some Pacific island nations are using coconut oil as fuel to reduce their expenses and their dependence on imported fuels while helping stabilize the coconut oil market. Coconut oil is only usable where temperatures do not drop below , unless two-tank SVO/PPO kits or other tank-heating accessories, etc. are used. The same techniques developed to use, for example, canola and other oils in cold climates can be implemented to make coconut oil usable in temperatures lower than Availability Biodiesel bus in Sweden Recycled vegetable oil Recycled vegetable oil, also termed used vegetable oil (UVO), waste vegetable oil (WVO), used cooking oil (UCO), or yellow grease (in commodities exchange), is recovered from businesses and industry that use the oil for cooking. , the United States was producing in excess of 11 billion liters (2.9 billion U.S. gallons) of recycled vegetable oil annually, mainly from industrial deep fryers in potato processing plants, snack food factories and fast food restaurants. If all those 11 billion liters could be recycled and used to replace the energy equivalent amount of petroleum (an ideal case), almost 1% of US oil consumption could be offset.See Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States Utilizing recycled vegetable oil as a replacement for standard petroleum-derived fuels like gasoline would reduce the price of gasoline by preserving the supply of petroleum.  Virgin vegetable oil  Virgin vegetable oil, also termed pure plant oil or straight vegetable oil, is extracted from plants solely for use as fuel. In contrast to used vegetable oil, is not a byproduct of other industries, and thus its prospects for use as fuel are not limited by the capacities of other industries. Production of vegetable oils for use as fuels is theoretically limited only by the agricultural capacity of a given economy. However, doing so detracts from the supply of other uses of pure vegetable oil. Legal implications=Taxation of fuel Taxation on SVO/PPO as a road fuel varies from country to country. It is possible that the revenue departments in many countries are even unaware of its use or consider it too insignificant to legislate. Germany used to have 0% taxation, resulting in it being a leader in most developments of the fuel use.

The novel is set during World War II, with most of the action occurring on or near a fictional Army Air Forces base in central Florida. The action occurs during a period of approximately 48 hours. The novel is chapterless in form, using three progressively longer parts entitled \\"Thursday\\", \\"Friday\\" and \\"Saturday\\". From dates on various memoranda quoted, the story takes place on September 2, 3, and 4, 1943. Before entering the USAAF during 1943, Cozzens had already published 10 novels; his duties included writing speeches and articles for Henry H. Arnold, commanding general of the USAAF. Cozzens worked in the USAAF Office of Information Services, a liaison and \\"information clearinghouse\\" between the military and the civilian press (like his Guard of Honor character Nathaniel Hicks, Cozzens' first duty was revising field manuals). One of the functions of his office was in controlling news, and it became Cozzens‚Äô job to defuse situations potentially embarrassing to Arnold. One such incident occurred during April 1945: African- American officers protested the segregation of officer club facilities in what became known as the Freeman Field Mutiny. Cozzens included a fictional but similar incident in Guard of Honor, not as a dramatic recreation of the incident but as backdrop for his analysis of the relationship between fate and the character and personality of leaders. Although several African-American characters appear in Guard of Honor, none are point-of-view figures. Guard was one of Cozzens' \\"professional novels\\", in which he drew detailed portraits of individuals, centering on their professional lives and the details of their work. He expertly recreates the feel of the stateside Army Air Forces, accurately recalls historical facts pertinent to the story line without becoming academic, and references airplanes and technical aspects without excessive explanation and without bogging down the action. All characters in the novel, except Nathaniel Hicks, are named throughout using their rank or title and last name. Plot introduction The novel begins with seven characters flying to Ocanara Army Air Base, Florida, after a daylong visit to Sellers Field, Mississippi, aboard an AT-7 navigation trainer. It concerns the activities of a fictional administrative command named Army Air Forces Operations and Requirements Analysis Division, acronymed AFORAD. This organization is a fictional amalgamation of its real-life counterparts, the office of the Assistant Chief of Air Staff for Operations, Commitments, and Requirements (OC&R;) and the organizations in Florida that OC&R; supervised, the Army Air Forces Tactical Center (AAFTAC), and the Army Air Forces Board. The beginning segment, the shortest of the novel, introduces the major characters and their traits by examining their reactions to a minor subplot of the handling of the querulous base commander at Sellers Field: an old Regular Army colonel who is an alcoholic. Much of the chapter is spent examining Colonel Ross' thoughts while he perfunctorily reviews his seemingly routine daily paperwork, which he has brought with him on the brief visit. Two memoranda foreshadow major incidents in the storyline: the arrival of officers of Project 0-336-3, a group of African-American pilots slated to form a bombardment squadron; and an ever-expanding grandiose plan by another problem colonel (this one General Beal's own Executive Officer) to hold a surprise birthday parade ceremony for General Beal on Saturday using numerous military aircraft and troops in a flyover. The opening segment ends when the general's AT-7, in the midst of the harrowingly described turbulence of a nighttime thunderstorm, barely avoids a mid-air collision with a B-26 bomber landing at Ocanara. After an angry exchange with his own co-pilot, in which he impetuously has the co-pilot arrested, General Beal is distracted while mollifying Colonel Ross; his co-pilot confronts the bomber's crew, who are all African-American, and punches the black pilot in the face. Events quickly begin to happen early the next morning. A local newspaper, using leaks from classified memos, skewers AFORAD both for the coming parade and its many old colonels. Indignation among the newly arrived African-American pilots over the assault and the arbitrary decision of the AFORAD Executive Officer to create a separate officer's club for them results in a protest being organized. General Beal has calmed and wants to ignore his co-pilot's behavior. A black newspaper reporter shows up on base at an inopportune moment. The alcoholic base commander of Sellars Field has committed suicide after General Beal's visit. Two generals are due to arrive in the afternoon from the Pentagon, one bearing a high decoration to be presented to the black pilot for prior heroism, the other investigating the suicide. Guard of Honor then begins to examine the motivations behind and interlocking effects of these problems (and those of a tragic accident yet to come) on General Beal, Colonel Ross, and Nathaniel Hicks as each tries to juggle his part in them with as little consequence as possible while still \\"doing the right thing.\\" Characters=Major characters * Major General Ira \\"Bus\\" Beal ‚Äì Commander of AFORAD, youngest major general in the USAAF by virtue of heroics in the Philippines and the invasion of North Africa, about to celebrate his forty-first birthday.

He was signed by the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted free agent in 2004 out of Southern Arkansas University. Babineaux is most notable for his game-saving effort in the 2006 NFC Wild Card game when he tackled Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo on a fourth down scramble just short of the first-down marker after Romo fumbled the snap for what might have been a game- winning field goal for the Cowboys. He also intercepted a Drew Bledsoe pass against the Cowboys in 2005 with three seconds remaining, allowing his kicker to kick the game-winning field goal as time expired. College career Babineaux was Dopke.com‚Äôs National Special Teams Performer of the Year, was a second team selection on the D2Football.com All-America team, was a first team All-South Region pick on defense, and was a first team All-GSC defensive back. He tied two NCAA Division II records, set two GSC records and tied another, and set two school records for Southern Arkansas University. Professional career=Seattle Seahawks Babineaux was signed as an undrafted free agent out of Southern Arkansas University on April 29, 2004. He was a member of the practice squad following training camp, and signed to the active roster on November 26, 2004. In Seattle, he was known as \\"Big Play Babs\\". He earned this nickname after a game-changing interception against the Dallas Cowboys on October 23, 2005. He intercepted a pass by quarterback Drew Bledsoe and returned the ball to the Cowboys' 32 yard-line with five seconds left in the game, setting up a game-winning Josh Brown field goal. On January 6, 2007, late in the final quarter of the Wild Card Round game against the Dallas Cowboys during the 2007 NFL playoffs, the Cowboys attempted a 19 yard field goal. Babineaux made a diving, game-saving ankle tackle of Dallas quarterback and place kick holder Tony Romo, who was scrambling to the end zone with the football after bobbling the snap for what might have been a winning field goal. The tackle stopped Romo inches short of a first down, and about a yard shy of a touchdown. As a result, Seattle took possession on downs and won the game by a score of 21-20 and advanced to the Divisional Round. In September 2007, Babineaux signed a five-year extension to remain with the Seahawks. The deal was worth an aggregate value of between $10-$17 million. While he could have tested the free agent market, Babineaux's loyalty to the Seahawks organization and the fans of Seattle, along with his desire to lead the Seahawks back to the Super Bowl, were all factors in keeping the versatile defensive back in Seattle. During the 2008 NFC Wild Card Game against the Redskins, he made an interception and returned it 57 yards for a touchdown which secured a win for the Seahawks. Babineaux used his versatility to play cornerback, safety, and special teams. Babineaux was suspended for the first game of the 2008 season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. The Seahawks opened the season away at Buffalo, losing 34-10. In 2009, Babineaux became the starting free safety after Brian Russell was released and subsequently signed in Jacksonville. In 2010, Earl Thomas became the starting free safety, forcing Babineaux to go back to a backup role. He mainly played in the nickel and dime defense as a cornerback. One of the Seahawks' formations (the \\"Nickel Babs\\") was named after him. He also was a key special team player. He finished the season with 46 tackles, 1.5 sacks, a forced fumbled, and two interceptions. He also scored a safety, the first of his career. Tennessee Titans Babineaux signed with the Tennessee Titans on August 4, 2011. On October 2, 2011, in a game against the Cleveland Browns, Babineaux picked off Colt McCoy and returned the interception 97 yards for a touchdown. He re-signed with the Titans in March 2012, this time for a two- year deal worth up to $5 million. Babineaux was released by the Titans on March 12, 2013. Babineaux retired from the NFL after the 2014 season. He does the Pregame and Postgame Seahawk show for 710 ESPN Seattle during the 2015 season. Personal life Jordan is the younger brother of former Atlanta Falcons defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux and has a daughter, Jaida Babineaux.

During the 1970s and 1980s the club was a major space for small-scale popular music performances. It opened on Feb 11, 1974. History For three decades the two club owners, Allan Pepper and Stanley Snadowsky, presented major musical acts and premiered new talent. Bruce Springsteen played showcase gigs at the club and Lou Reed recorded the album Live: Take No Prisoners there. Harry Chapin held his 2000th concert at the Bottom Line in January 1981. The Bottom Line hosted an extremely wide variety of music and musicians. Among the thousands who performed on its stage were Eric Clapton, Jo√£o Gilberto, Carl Perkins, Linda Ronstadt, The Manhattan Transfer, The Police, Adrian Belew, Prince, Pat Benatar, Daryl Hall & John Oates, Van Morrison, Laura Nyro, Cheap Trick, Rory Gallagher, Chuck Mangione, Carl Hancock Rux,Emmylou Harris, Neil Young, Leo Kottke, Doc Watson, Barry Manilow, Dire Straits, Grayson Hugh, Dolly Parton, George Jones, The Pointer Sisters, Ravi Shankar, Ramones, The Brecker Brothers, Gato Barbieri, Bryan Ferry, Van Morrison and Miles Davis. The live parts of Derek and Clive (Live), a spoken word and music comedy album recorded by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore in late 1973 under their guises of Derek and Clive were recorded at The Bottom Line. The Bottom Line seated 400 people and had a no smoking policy, long before that restriction became New York City law. In later years the club hosted In Their Own Words: A Bunch Of Songwriters Sittin' Around Singing, a series of performances with commentary organized and initially hosted by radio personality Vin Scelsa. Another staple was the annual Downtown Messiah, a reworking of Handel directed by Richard Barone. At Christmastime, musicians like Vernon Reid and David Johansen made The Messiah their own. The venue also held annual New Year's Eve shows by The Turtles (often performing as Flo & Eddie). Another recurring event was The Beat Goes On, a show in which performers covered pop songs around a theme, such as Christmas songs, or songs from a given time period. That show presented performers including Fountains of Wayne, Richard Lloyd and Hedwig and the Angry Inch's John Cameron Mitchell. The Bottom Line was also the site, in April 1995, of four concerts by Joan Baez in which she collaborated with a number of female performers, including Dar Williams, Janis Ian, Mary Chapin Carpenter, The Indigo Girls and Mary Black, the results of which were recorded and released as the album Ring Them Bells. The Bottom Line's cachet faded with time, and by 2003 the club owed $190,000 in back rent, plus several hundred thousand dollars in other expenses, and was no longer bringing in large crowds. Its landlord, New York University (NYU), increased the rent to market level, which was beyond the club's ability to pay, and threatened eviction. Fans started a petition on a \\"Save the Bottom\\" website in support of the club.USA Today, \\"N.Y.'s famous Bottom Line gets reprieve\\", Oct 23, 2003.The Villager, \\"The Bottom Line tries to avoid end of the line\\", Oct 29, 2003. Bruce Springsteen offered to pay the club's back rent if NYU and the owners could settle on a lease. Sirius Satellite Radio offered the same, but rather than risk a takeover, Pepper and Snadowsky closed the club before they could be kicked out.‚ÄúCRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; The Bottom Line, a Place Where the Music Always Came First‚Äù, JON PARELES Jan 26, 2004] The last Bottom Line show was on January 22, 2004, just shy of the club's 30th anniversary. The building now houses NYU classrooms. Pepper and Snadowsky attempted to find another venue to carry the Bottom Line name. The club's website still provides the club's official history. From 2005 through 2011, the site was updated annually on February 12 (anniversary of the club's opening), with a letter detailing their current progress. In February 2007 they announced plans to release a box set of archival recordings on Koch Records. In 2011 they announced the box set was in \\"limbo\\" pending settling of performance rights issues, and the search was continuing for a new location. Snadowsky died in February 2013 from complications of diabetes.Stanley Snadowsky, Nightclub Founder, Dies at 70 by Paul Vitiello, New York Times, March 2, 2013. The site has not been updated since then. Pepper holds recordings of more than 1,000 shows and is releasing some of them in the Bottom Line Archive Series of his own Bottom Line Record Company. In March 2015, Pepper released Kenny Rankin Plays The Beatles & More (1990); The Brecker Brothers (1976); and Willie Nile (1980 & 2000). In June 2015, The Bottom Line Archive released four more titles: Harry Chapin (1981), Janis Ian (1980) plus reissues of In Their Own Words, Vols. 1 & 2 (1990‚Äì93) with Ric Ocasek, Joey Ramone, Richard Thompson, Suzanne Vega, John Cale, Patty Smyth, and David Johansen.\\"Tenafly resident has recordings of Bottom Line shows\\".

These units are rated based on types and ranges of individual weaponry. The first tactical wargames were played as miniatures, extended to board games, and they are now also enjoyed as video games. The games are designed so that a knowledge of military tactics will facilitate good gameplay. Tactical wargames offer more of a challenge to the designer, as fewer variables or characteristics inherent in the units being simulated are directly quantifiable. Modern commercial board wargaming avoided tactical subjects for many years, but since initial attempts at the subject appeared, it has remained a favourite topic among wargamers. Perhaps the most successful board wargaming system ever designed, Advanced Squad Leader, is set at the tactical level. Miniatures-based wargames Tactical wargame rules have appeared for every period of human history and even into the future. The first true \\"miniatures\\" games may have developed in antiquity, though Kriegsspiel, a command study invented in 18th century Prussia, is generally accepted as the first true miniatures game. Commercially available miniatures, however, only became popular at the start of the 20th Century. Naval miniatures Jane's published several sets of rules for naval games in the early to mid-20th Century. Land-based miniatures The number of land-based tactical miniatures games produced for the commercial market increased exponentially following the Second World War as interest in that conflict and disposable income increased. Tactical board wargames=History The genesis of tactical board wargaming goes back to 1969. Up until that time, wargaming‚Äîwhich in the modern, recreational form only dated back to 1958‚Äîtended to concentrate on operational and strategic subjects. Charles S. Roberts of Avalon Hill had developed a wide range of strategic wargames based upon historical battles--the first of these being the 1961 releases of Gettysburg and Chancellorsville, issued to coincide with the beginning of the centennial celebration of the American Civil War. AH issued a wide range of similar games in the years that followed, and established itself as the market leader in board wargames. However, most of these games were at the army, brigade, battalion, or regiment level. Few were at the more tactical levels. Tactical Game 3 was introduced by Strategy & Tactics magazine as a platoon/company level game focusing on tactics on the Eastern Front. In 1970, that game's designer, the legendary James F. Dunnigan, sold the rights to the game to Avalon Hill, who quickly released PanzerBlitz. This was the start of the so-called \\"Second Generation\\" of wargaming. PanzerBlitz eventually sold 250,000 copies, though it was not without critics (including Dunnigan himself). In the early 1970s, several tactical games made their way onto the expanding wargaming market, including Grunt (1971) featuring platoon-level warfare in Vietnam and Combat Command: Platoon-Company Combat, France, 1944 (1972) billed as a western front sequel to PanzerBlitz, and Soldiers (1972) about World War I, all by Dunnigan/SPI. Dunnigan then crossed another boundary and became the first publisher to release a game on the then-ongoing Cold War, called Red Star/White Star: Tactical Combat in Western Europe in the 1970s. While the game was successful, Dunnigan was disappointed with it, citing difficulties in realistically portraying tactical combat in a tabletop board game. Dunnigan tried to take tactical games into a new direction in 1973 with KampfPanzer and Desert War, which featured simultaneous movement, expanding on an optional rule for PanzerBlitz. Unfortunately, the quest for greater realism was having a price in complexity and \\"bookkeeping\\", or recording of moves on paper. Nonetheless, other tactical games on a man to man level were released with simultaneous movement, with Sniper! being released by SPI in 1973, Patrol!: Man to Man Combat in the 20th Century and Tank!: Armored Combat in the 20th Century both in 1974. That same year, Avalon Hill released Panzer Leader: The Game of Tactical Warfare on the Western Front 1944-45. The problems with true tactical (company/battalion level) games were all too apparent. According to Lorrin Bird, writing in Special Issue #2 of Campaign Magazine: > The major disappointment with the three major Avalon Hill games (Panzer > Leader, PanzerBlitz and Arab-Israeli Wars) was the obvious sequential nature > of the whole situation. A shoots, A moves. B shoots, B moves. With a little > opportunity fire thrown in. In situations like the Battle of Kursk in Panzer > Blitz confronting the enemy meant possible extinction. The hardest part to > accept was the situation where three German tanks block a pass and cannot be > seen by the T-34s on their combat phase. On the Russian move they move up to > the Mark IVs and have to stop. The T-34 move might have taken only a two-hex > advance (500 metres) and then they idle their engines for the next 5 > minutes. On the next German move, the Mark IVs cleverly dart away, in and > out of cover and take position again. The T-34s...move a few hexes, stop and > idle, awaiting the German movement which frees up the next few hexes for > them. Another funny situation is where a Tiger unit sits in the open and a > Sherman comes out of nowhere and ends up adjacent to the Germans. With ideal > conditions, the Tiger can decimate the Shermans in no time flat without any > \\"defensive\\" fire by the M-4s at all, and then move off....While Panzer > Blitz, Panzer Leader and Arab-Israeli Wars are wonderful games, and demand a > high degree of tactical ability to play, victory can be obtained in a manner > very often that runs contrary to reason and a player's intelligence... This much anticipated sequel to PanzerBlitz was successful, and the next year SPI replaced their earlier titles with games featuring a new \\"Simultaneous- Sequential-Play-System\\", eliminating the bookkeeping involved in games like KampfPanzer and Tank and attempting to address the problems described by Bird, above. And so MechWar '77 replaced the earlier Red Star/White Star, Panzer '44 replaced Combat Command, and Search & Destroy replaced Grunt. The new Simultaneous-Sequential-Play-System (SSPS) allowed for much greater realism without sacrificing playability, and was considered the new \\"state of the art\\" for tactical wargames. The first era of tactical wargaming had come to an end. The new state of the art was extended to Avalon Hill's Tobruk in 1976, as well as SPI's Firefight. But neither game did well, with increased realism in the form of detailed penetration tables in Tobruk and rigid rules for modern Soviet doctrine forced on the players of Firefight making games once again less playable. Tobruk also suffered from an unattractive map surface which depicted basically flat terrain. Another point for players of tactical wargames to consider was the increasing amount of unit data that was being built into the games. Rather than pieces depicting generic \\"infantry\\" or \\"cavalry\\" units as in Civil War strategy games, for example, games like Tobruk were inundating players with tables of complex ballistics information. Firefight came with a separate booklet on \\"Reference Data\\" amounting to 20 pages of information, much of it not immediately necessary for gameplay but certainly useful to defend some of the design decisions which restricted game play. At this point, Avalon Hill approached developer John Hill to \\"do a game like Tank! (but) a squad level game....\\" Hill was well known, and had recently written an article in Moves entitled \\"Designing for Playability.\\" He had recently published BarLev and Battle for Hue. Squad Leader The result was Squad Leader, which went on to become the best selling tactical wargame ever, spawning three add-ons (called \\"gamettes\\" by Avalon Hill) and an Advanced version which produced twelve \\"official\\" core modules, several historically based modules, a solitaire version, and hundreds of third party add-ons and variants. Squad Leader, released in 1977, used a semi-simultaneous system as well, focusing on infantry combat. The physical components for the game were unmatched in terms of quality, using full color painted mapboards on rigid mountings that had the added advantage of being geomorphic. As the Squad Leader game system grew and more boards were added, they could be set up in a variety of configurations and used to represent a wide array of units, as the infantry counters were generic and did not portray specific units. Some innovative rules for such things as leadership and \\"penetrating fire\\" (to simulate the ability of automatic weapons on the battlefield to engage more than just one target) were introduced. Some observers felt Squad Leader was too romantic a view of infantry combat. Bird felt that the game \\"completely sidesteps the effect of widespread panic and morale breakdowns (contagious hysteria), and treats every soldier as if he were totally dedicated to the cause...\\" Others felt that games like Search & Destroy received short shrift. > Few tactical games during (the 1970s) are comparable to Squad Leader ... > which is quite popular and is of a similar scale (to S&D;), but has a > needlessly complex combat system, leadership rules that would be more > appropriate for 18th Century combat and ridiculously simplistic casualty > rules...The wargame industry has basically ignored the more accurate > portrayal of company level combat in S&D; for the more glamorous version > portrayed in Squad Leader. Even the developers of Squad Leader admitted that \\"our troops assault with a tenacity that would make Kelly's Heroes proud.\\" Squad Leader vs. Tobruk The Tobruk game released by Avalon Hill prior to Squad Leader got little support from gamers or AH. \\"With the exception of a few articles and scenarios in The General, there was never a follow-on game or expansion product for Tobruk enthusiasts. We now have the benefit of hindsight to point to the years between the release of Squad Leader and its progeny Cross of Iron through GI: Anvil of Victory represented AH's commitment to tactical-level World War II gaming. As most readers are aware, that series led to ASL, followed by its own progeny over the years. Thus, one should not be the least bit surprised that Tobruk appeared to be expendable circa 1987, a year that happened to be the height of the ASL craze.\\" In fact, Hal Hock (developer of Tobruk) and Don Greenwood and John Hill (developers of Squad Leader) compared the merits of the two games shortly after the release of the latter in the pages of The General. It was made clear that the two game systems were quite different, and as time passed it was clear which game Avalon Hill preferred to support. In July 1987, as alluded to above, Avalon Hill sold the rights to Tobruk back to Hal Hock. Some of the challenges facing designers of tactical wargames were also made clear in that article, which contrasted Hill's \\"design for effect\\" philosophy with the more data-driven philosophy of Hock: > Hill's is the artistic approach akin to the impressionistic school of > painting where subjects are abstracted until the overall effect on the > viewer is such that the artist can will his impressions upon the viewer. > Hence, an artistic designer studies history with concern for the overall > battlefield environment and how each specific weapon relates to it, as > opposed to proving ground statistics. Regardless of a weapon's value, if the > soldier wielding it has confidence in his handling of the weapon and its > overall effectiveness, his performance will be greatly enhanced. He > subscribes to the opinion in vogue these days in battlefield research that > technical differences of weapons is not nearly as important as the > psychological perception of the individual using the weapon... Hock is the > scientist and indeed has been employed in such a capacity by the government. > He believes that since a battle is primarily a clash of technology, it can > be measured. Proving ground data is his bible. Armor actions can be studied > by careful study of \\"projectile penetration\\" vs. armor....The artist > responds that this shell vs. armor test does not always hold true in the > battlefield environment...The artist concludes...that when shell hits armor, > anything (such as hits on vision ports, slung equipment, oblique angles, > variable metal quality of cast armor, etc.) can happen and that only a most > generalized statement of probability can be made. Other land-based wargames Nonetheless, while Squad Leader progressed into Advanced Squad Leader (\\"ASL\\") in 1985, other titles also appeared, none of whom managed to gain the popularity that Squad Leader/ASL had gained. Perhaps the downturn in the wargaming industry is also to blame for that, as videogame consoles and computer games became more sophisticated and offered greater appeal than previously to those who enjoyed board wargaming as an intellectual challenge. West End Games introduced Eastern Front Tank Leader (also designed by John Hill) in 1986, followed by Western Front Tank Leader in 1987 and Desert Steel in 1989. The same year, Avalon Hill offered up a modern tactical game in MBT, only superficially similar to Squad Leader as it simulated a different era of tactical combat. Another game, IDF, appeared in 1993 that used the same rules as MBT, changing the setting from a fictional World War Three in Germany to the Middle East and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflicts. Panzer Command by Victory Games in 1984 tried to address some of the problems Bird had mentioned in the Campaign article mentioned above. Robert Kern reported (in Fire & Movement Number 49 (Jul/Aug 1986)) that: \\"Experimentation is the main reason why our games have been so successful. Not only do we try to simplify game systems as much as possible, but we also tear systems apart to see if something new can be created from them. Panzer Command, for example, does not use a strict sequence of play; rather, portions of the game turn are on chits which are drawn at random.\\" Other significant product lines appeared by producers GDW and Clash of Arms Games (\\"CofA\\"). GDW focused on the Cold War or World War III period with Team Yankee, the first product of its First Battle Series line of games. Later offerings moved this system to cover several post-Cold war scenarios, such as Desert Storm, and also back to Second World War. CofA produced Landships! which covers the First World War, primarily focusing on the appearance of tanks during the later years on the Western Front. Subsequent expansions moved the system to cover the Russian Civil War and CofA intends to move the series up to 1939, covering the Chaco War, the Spanish Civil War and the German invasion of Poland in World War II. Other producers have also produced small unit tactical board wargames covering earlier eras such as the Roman Empire, the Napoleonic Wars and the American Civil War. However, with the exception of Avalon Hill's Siege of Jerusalem, none of these games have met with much success. Note however, grand tactical board war games have extraordinary followings, especially The Gamers series of games covering the American Civil War and CofA's La Bataille series covering the Napoleonic Wars and the Seven Years' War. GMT Games has also had considerable success with its Great Battles of History series. These series though use larger units, usually at the battalion or regimental level.

(Clash of Arms, 1993) Advanced Tobruk and Advanced Squad Leader In 2002, Advanced Tobruk was released by game manufacturer Critical Hit, Inc. This game was a makeover from the original, and Raymond J. Tapio, who had been designing third party ASL add-ons for sale by his company Critical Hit, conversed with original designer Hal Hock in 1998 and decided, with Kurt Martin, to re-release the game. Tobruk was expanded into a system covering the entire Second World War at the tactical level, with a game scale similar to Squad Leader, 50 metres per hex and counters depicting individual squads and vehicles. The Advanced Tobruk System (\\"ATS\\") proved to be very popular, with several expansion modules being produced. Graphic quality of the components was high. The system has gone on to cover battles from the Spanish Civil War through the Korean War, with rumors of a World War I expansion, and even a version of the American Civil War. In 2006, the final component for Advanced Squad Leader, Armies of Oblivion, went to press, completing the last of twelve essential \\"core modules\\" covering every major combatant army, vehicle and ordnance type of the Second World War. It is unclear which direction new projects will take ASL, although there are some indications are that a modern version may be in the offing, other sources suggest more Historical Advanced Squad Leader modules will be the future direction. The long rumoured World War I expansion module appears to have been cancelled, however it may eventually be produced by a third party manufacturer. Critical Hit has however recently produced several unofficial expansion modules, introducing the system to cover the Spanish Civil War, the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli wars of 1948 and 1956 and the French‚ÄìVietnamese war during the 1950s. Sea- based Several game manufacturers have produced tactical wargames covering naval warfare. Due to the scales of these battles, most games tend to be miniatures-based without boards, and several popular rules systems have appeared. However, several board versions have been produced over the past 40 years, with most games focusing either on the Napoleonic Era or the first half of the 20th Century.

The Vassal game engine designed by Rodney Kinney, as well as Aide-de-Camp, Cyberboard, ZunTzu, and Battlegrounds Gaming Engine are five examples of this. Using Java or similar technology, graphical versions of boards and counters can be manipulated in cyberspace as if a manual version of the game was being played. Dice rolling, chit drawing, and other game functions are all recreated in these \\"virtual tabletop\\" systems, which can be played solo, by email, or live multi-player over the Internet, including the option of spectators. A large proportion of published board games have been converted for play in this manner, extending the lives of old boardgames (to avoid copyright infringement, it is expected that players of these games provide their own rulebooks and other physical components only obtainable by purchasing the games.) Some companies are now releasing games meant solely for play via this medium, such as Dan Verssen's Special Forces, a traditional counter and hex- map board game played strictly in the medium of Vassal. Furthermore, some long-out-of-print games have been republished exclusively as digital games for use in such software.

The parish is on the county boundary with Suffolk, about west-northwest of Lowestoft. The parish includes the hamlet of Thorpe-next-Haddiscoe, about north of Haddiscoe village. The civil parish has an area of . The 2011 Census recorded its population as 487 people in 210 households. Toponym The Domesday Book of 1086 records the toponym as Hadescou. An entry for 1208 in the feet of fines and one for 1236 in the Book of Fees each record it as Hadesco. A Close Roll dated 1253 records it as Haddesco. The toponym is derived from Old Norse. \\"Hadd\\" was someone's name, and the second part of the word is derived from the Norse word sk≈çgr meaning \\"wood\\", so the place was \\"Hadd's wood\\". Churches The local church in the village is dedicated to St. Mary and was originally constructed in the 15th century. The oldest part of the Church of England parish church of St Mary is the 11th-century west tower. St Mary's is one of 124 round-tower churches in Norfolk. Inside the church are 14th-century murals including one of St Christopher carrying Jesus Christ. Jan Pier Pier, a 16th-century Dutch immigrant and creator of some of the dykes surrounding the village, is buried in the nave. St Mary's is a Grade I listed building. St Matthias' parish church, Thorpe-next-Haddiscoe In Thorpe-next-Haddiscoe is the Church of England parish church of St Matthias. It too has an 11th-century round tower. Its nave has a thatched roof, and its chancel was rebuilt in brick in 1838. St Matthias' is a Grade I listed building. Economic and social history Haddiscoe was in Clavering hundred. Haddiscoe was the site of Norfolk's only Knights Templar preceptory. It was dissolved in the 14th Century. The Haddiscoe Hoard, the largest hoard of English Civil War coins found in Norfolk to date, was found on 17 July 2003 by a workman on a flood defence scheme. Toft Monk's windpump Toft Monks mill is a disused windpump that used to drain the marshes into the River Waveney. The Haddiscoe Cut (New Cut), a canal linking the River Waveney and River Yare, was opened in 1833. It joins the River Waveney in the parish near Haddiscoe railway station. The cut now forms part of the parish boundary. Under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 Haddiscoe was in the Loddon and Clavering Union. A railway linking and was authorised in 1845 and opened by the Norfolk Railway in 1847. It passes through Haddiscoe parish, partly alongside the Haddiscoe Cut. The original Haddiscoe railway station was opened to serve it. In 1862 the Norfolk Railway became part of the Great Eastern Railway, which in 1904 replaced the original Haddiscoe railway station with the present one. It is about from the centre of the village and is served by Wherry Lines trains linking and Lowestoft.

Other popular sports in Uzbekistan are football, basketball, boxing, wrestling, and judo. Football Football is the most popular sport in Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan's premier football league is the Uzbek League, which features 14 teams since 2010, before 16. The current champions are Lokomotiv Tashkent, and the team with the most championships is FC Pakhtakor Tashkent with eight. The current Player of the Year (2017) is Marat Bikmaev. The most successful football clubs in Uzbekistan are FC Bunyodkor, FC Pakhtakor and FC Nasaf. In 2011 FC Nasaf won AFC Cup and became the first Uzbekistan team to win the international club cup. Uzbek clubs participate in the annual CIS Cup. Uzbekistan U-16 won AFC U-16 Championship in 2012. In 2018 Uzbekistan U-23 became the champions in AFC U-23 Championship hosted by China. Uzbekistan national team's best achievement at the Asian Cup was a fourth-place finish at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. Ravshan Irmatov was named The Best Referee in Asia in four consecutive years (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014). At Globe Soccer Awards in 2015 he was rewarded as Best Referee of The Year. The Bunyodkor Stadium has a capacity of 34,000, and is mostly used for football matches. Basketball Uzbekistan used to be part of the powerful Soviet Union national basketball team.

It was the last mine of its kind to remain in the South Wales Valleys. It was located near the villages of Hirwaun and Rhigos, north of the town of Aberdare in the Cynon Valley of South Wales. History With coal located so close to the surface, it was known by locals to be possible to drift mine coal from Hirwaun common. This activity increased from 1805, until in 1864 the first drift named Tower was started, named after the nearby Crawshay's Tower, a folly built in 1848 and named after Richard Crawshay.http://www1c.btwebworld.com/tower-coal/tmenu.html In 1941, a new shaft was sunk to a depth of 160 metres. From 1943 until closure, this shaft was used as the main \\"return\\" ventilation shaft and for the transport of men. In 1958 Tower No. 3 was driven to meet the No. 4 colliery workings, and was used as the main \\"intake\\" airway, conveying coal to the surface and transporting materials into the mine working areas. The Aberdare branch of the Merthyr line continued north from Aberdare railway station to the colliery. While passenger services terminate in Aberdare, freight services operated several times a day along this stretch of line, directly owned by the colliery. British Coal closure After the 1984/5 UK miners' strike, the Conservative government authorised British Coal to close the majority of the UK's deep mines on economic grounds, nominally including Tower. But from 30 June 1986, with new underground roads having been driven, all coal from Mardy Colliery was also raised at Tower, the two mines effectively working as one coalfield system. Mardy closed as an access shaft on 21 December 1990. In October 1993 the red flag was raised on Hirwaun common as a symbol of unity between workers of Tower Colliery during a march to commemorate the Merthyr Rising in 1831, and highlight the plight of their own pit. In 1994, the constituency MP, Ann Clwyd staged a sit-in in the mine to protest against its closure, accompanied by the late Glyndwr 'Glyn' Roberts (Senior) of Penywaun. British Coal closed Tower Colliery on 22 April 1994, on the grounds that it would be uneconomic in current market conditions to continue production. Colliery buy-out by workers Coal Dram stands outside the Tower Colliery's sales office Led by local NUM Branch Secretary Tyrone O'Sullivan, 239 miners joined TEBO (Tower Employees Buy-Out), with each pledging ¬£8,000 from their redundancy payouts to buy back Tower. Against stiff central government resistance to the possibility of reopening the mine as a coal production unit, a price of ¬£2 million was eventually agreed. With their bid accepted, the miners marched back to the pit on 2 January 1995, with a balloon inflated for each worker. On 3 January 1995 the Colliery re-opened under the ownership of the workforce buy out company Goitre Tower Anthracite. Philip Weekes, the renowned Welsh mining engineer, was a key advisor to the buy-out team and became (unpaid) Chairman. Times online In 2014, John Redwood, the Secretary of State for Wales in 1995, and also Director of Margaret Thatcher's Number 10 Policy Unit 1983‚Äì1985, wrote of the period of pit closures and Tower Colliery:http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2014/01/04/the-past-had-its-battles-too/ > At the end of the dispute I tried to get the government to offer the miners > the right to work a pit the Coal Board claimed was uneconomic for > themselves, as I was suspicious about some of the pits the Coal Board wished > to close.

It was not until I was in the Cabinet myself that I was able to help > one group of miners do just that, at Tower Colliery. They demonstrated that > free of Coal Board control it was possible, at least in their case, to run > the pit for longer. Operations EWS Class 66 moves coal from the Tower towards Aberdare, 2006 Up to 14 coal seams had been worked at Tower Colliery during its history, and the neighbouring mines within the lease area of Tower, which was 14.8 km in circumference to create an area of 221.3 hectares. The actual boundaries of the lease were defined either by faults or seam splits in the local geostructure, or excess water to the northwest in the Bute seam. The seams produced good quality coking coal, which was washed onsite at a coal washing plant built in the mid-1980s, after extraction through the hillside on a conveyor belt. Although the mine remained financially viable and continued to provide employment to the workers, by the time of the buyout the only seam worked at Tower was the Seven Feet/Five Feet, a combined seam of several leaves which offered 1.3m of anthracite in a mined section of 1.65m. Working directly under the shaft of the former Glyncorrwg Colliery's \\"nine feet\\" workings, the four faces worked in the western section of the lease were considered uneconomic by British Coal. As the worked seam reduced in capacity, the management team considered three possibilities to extend the length of mine production: *Work another nine faces in the existing workings, in coal classed only as mineral potential *Address the water problem in the Bute seam, to the northwest *Open new developments in the Nine Feet seam, 100 m above the existing seam; the Four Feet seam, a further 30 m above But none of these prospects seemed economic, so the board recommended that work be concentrated on coal to the north of the existing workings, which had been left to protect the safety of the existing shafts. Accepted by the workforce and shareholders in an open vote, this decision effectively accepted the end of Tower as a deep mine. Second closure Having mined out the northern coal extracts, the colliery was last worked on 18 January 2008 and the official closure of the colliery occurred on 25 January. The colliery was, until its closure, one of the largest employers in the Cynon Valley. Machinery from Tower was used to boost production at the nearby Aberpergwm Colliery, a smaller drift mine closed by the National Coal Board in 1985 but reopened by a private concern in the mid 1990s. Tower regeneration The management announced at closure that one of the possibilities of creating additional short term value was through open cast mining extraction of the residual 6 million tonnes of anthracite. In August 2010, the company filed a planning application for the extraction by open cast mining of coal to a depth of , on a section of the former coal washery site. Coal would then be transported to Aberthaw Power Station by train. In 2012 Tower Regeneration Ltd, a joint venture partnership between Tower Colliery Ltd and Hargreaves Services plc was formed. The partnership company received planning permission that year to allow opencast coal extraction on what were termed the surface workings of the former colliery site, on the pre-condition that the site would be subject to land remediation and reclamation, followed by land restoration of the entire Tower Colliery site. The land reclamation works includes: removal of structures; removal of residual contamination; re-profiling of colliery spoil tips; removal of coal workings and mine entries; and provision of surface drainage. The project will create a sloping landform to reproduce semi-natural habitats on the site, and hence prepare the area ground for future mixed-use development. Future plan The shareholders are still debating the future of the site, which they eventually wish to have developed to leave a legacy for the area which provides employment. Eventually there are plans to develop the site, with combinations of housing, industrial estate, industrial heritage museum or tourism resort being debated with several potential partners.

Some materials (e.g. metals) are harder than others (e.g. plastics, wood). Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong intermolecular bonds, but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore, there are different measurements of hardness: scratch hardness, indentation hardness, and rebound hardness. Hardness is dependent on ductility, elastic stiffness, plasticity, strain, strength, toughness, viscoelasticity, and viscosity. Common examples of hard matter are ceramics, concrete, certain metals, and superhard materials, which can be contrasted with soft matter. Measuring hardness A Vickers hardness tester There are three main types of hardness measurements: scratch, indentation, and rebound. Within each of these classes of measurement there are individual measurement scales. For practical reasons conversion tables are used to convert between one scale and another. Scratch hardness Scratch hardness is the measure of how resistant a sample is to fracture or permanent plastic deformation due to friction from a sharp object. The principle is that an object made of a harder material will scratch an object made of a softer material. When testing coatings, scratch hardness refers to the force necessary to cut through the film to the substrate. The most common test is Mohs scale, which is used in mineralogy. One tool to make this measurement is the sclerometer. Another tool used to make these tests is the pocket hardness tester. This tool consists of a scale arm with graduated markings attached to a four-wheeled carriage. A scratch tool with a sharp rim is mounted at a predetermined angle to the testing surface. In order to use it a weight of known mass is added to the scale arm at one of the graduated markings, the tool is then drawn across the test surface. The use of the weight and markings allows a known pressure to be applied without the need for complicated machinery.Hoffman Scratch Hardness Tester . byk.com Indentation hardness Indentation hardness measures the resistance of a sample to material deformation due to a constant compression load from a sharp object. Tests for indentation hardness are primarily used in engineering and metallurgy fields. The tests work on the basic premise of measuring the critical dimensions of an indentation left by a specifically dimensioned and loaded indenter. Common indentation hardness scales are Rockwell, Vickers, Shore, and Brinell, amongst others. Rebound hardness Rebound hardness, also known as dynamic hardness, measures the height of the \\"bounce\\" of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto a material. This type of hardness is related to elasticity. The device used to take this measurement is known as a scleroscope. Two scales that measures rebound hardness are the Leeb rebound hardness test and Bennett hardness scale. Ultrasonic Contact Impedance (UCI) method determines hardness by measuring the frequency of an oscillating rod. The rod consists of a metal shaft with vibrating element and a pyramid-shaped diamond mounted on one end. Hardening There are five hardening processes: Hall-Petch strengthening, work hardening, solid solution strengthening, precipitation hardening, and martensitic transformation. Physics Diagram of a stress-strain curve, showing the relationship between stress (force applied per unit area) and strain or deformation of a ductile metal. In solid mechanics, solids generally have three responses to force, depending on the amount of force and the type of material: * They exhibit elasticity‚Äîthe ability to temporarily change shape, but return to the original shape when the pressure is removed. \\"Hardness\\" in the elastic range‚Äîa small temporary change in shape for a given force‚Äîis known as stiffness in the case of a given object, or a high elastic modulus in the case of a material. * They exhibit plasticity‚Äîthe ability to permanently change shape in response to the force, but remain in one piece. The yield strength is the point at which elastic deformation gives way to plastic deformation. Deformation in the plastic range is non-linear, and is described by the stress-strain curve. This response produces the observed properties of scratch and indentation hardness, as described and measured in materials science. Some materials exhibit both elasticity and viscosity when undergoing plastic deformation; this is called viscoelasticity. * They fracture‚Äîsplit into two or more pieces. Strength is a measure of the extent of a material's elastic range, or elastic and plastic ranges together. This is quantified as compressive strength, shear strength, tensile strength depending on the direction of the forces involved. Ultimate strength is an engineering measure of the maximum load a part of a specific material and geometry can withstand. Brittleness, in technical usage, is the tendency of a material to fracture with very little or no detectable plastic deformation beforehand. Thus in technical terms, a material can be both brittle and strong. In everyday usage \\"brittleness\\" usually refers to the tendency to fracture under a small amount of force, which exhibits both brittleness and a lack of strength (in the technical sense). For perfectly brittle materials, yield strength and ultimate strength are the same, because they do not experience detectable plastic deformation. The opposite of brittleness is ductility. The toughness of a material is the maximum amount of energy it can absorb before fracturing, which is different from the amount of force that can be applied. Toughness tends to be small for brittle materials, because elastic and plastic deformations allow materials to absorb large amounts of energy. Hardness increases with decreasing particle size. This is known as the Hall-Petch relationship. However, below a critical grain-size, hardness decreases with decreasing grain size. This is known as the inverse Hall-Petch effect. Hardness of a material to deformation is dependent on its microdurability or small-scale shear modulus in any direction, not to any rigidity or stiffness properties such as its bulk modulus or Young's modulus. Stiffness is often confused for hardness. Some materials are stiffer than diamond (e.g. osmium) but are not harder, and are prone to spalling and flaking in squamose or acicular habits. Mechanisms and theory A representation of the crystal lattice showing the planes of atoms. The key to understanding the mechanism behind hardness is understanding the metallic microstructure, or the structure and arrangement of the atoms at the atomic level. In fact, most important metallic properties critical to the manufacturing of today‚Äôs goods are determined by the microstructure of a material.Haasen, P. (1978). Physical metallurgy. Cambridge [Eng.] ; New York: Cambridge University Press. At the atomic level, the atoms in a metal are arranged in an orderly three-dimensional array called a crystal lattice. In reality, however, a given specimen of a metal likely never contains a consistent single crystal lattice. A given sample of metal will contain many grains, with each grain having a fairly consistent array pattern. At an even smaller scale, each grain contains irregularities. There are two types of irregularities at the grain level of the microstructure that are responsible for the hardness of the material. These irregularities are point defects and line defects. A point defect is an irregularity located at a single lattice site inside of the overall three-dimensional lattice of the grain. There are three main point defects. If there is an atom missing from the array, a vacancy defect is formed. If there is a different type of atom at the lattice site that should normally be occupied by a metal atom, a substitutional defect is formed. If there exists an atom in a site where there should normally not be, an interstitial defect is formed. This is possible because space exists between atoms in a crystal lattice. While point defects are irregularities at a single site in the crystal lattice, line defects are irregularities on a plane of atoms. Dislocations are a type of line defect involving the misalignment of these planes. In the case of an edge dislocation, a half plane of atoms is wedged between two planes of atoms. In the case of a screw dislocation two planes of atoms are offset with a helical array running between them.Samuel, J. (2009). Introduction to materials science course manual. Madison, Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin-Madison. In glasses, hardness seems to depend linearly on the number of topological constraints acting between the atoms of the network. Hence, the rigidity theory has allowed predicting hardness values with respect to composition. Planes of atoms split by an edge dislocation. Dislocations provide a mechanism for planes of atoms to slip and thus a method for plastic or permanent deformation. Planes of atoms can flip from one side of the dislocation to the other effectively allowing the dislocation to traverse through the material and the material to deform permanently. The movement allowed by these dislocations causes a decrease in the material's hardness. The way to inhibit the movement of planes of atoms, and thus make them harder, involves the interaction of dislocations with each other and interstitial atoms. When a dislocation intersects with a second dislocation, it can no longer traverse through the crystal lattice. The intersection of dislocations creates an anchor point and does not allow the planes of atoms to continue to slip over one anotherLeslie, W. C. (1981). The physical metallurgy of steels. Washington: Hempisphere Pub. Corp., New York: McGraw-Hill, . A dislocation can also be anchored by the interaction with interstitial atoms. If a dislocation comes in contact with two or more interstitial atoms, the slip of the planes will again be disrupted. The interstitial atoms create anchor points, or pinning points, in the same manner as intersecting dislocations. By varying the presence of interstitial atoms and the density of dislocations, a particular metal's hardness can be controlled. Although seemingly counter- intuitive, as the density of dislocations increases, there are more intersections created and consequently more anchor points. Similarly, as more interstitial atoms are added, more pinning points that impede the movements of dislocations are formed. As a result, the more anchor points added, the harder the material will become.

At war's end, and the postwar flight to Bleiburg, he was in command of the Fifth Usta≈°e Corps. Herenƒçiƒá was one of the officials responsible for organizing the surrender of Croatian troops to the British as part of Operation Keelhaul. Herenƒçiƒá was one of the senior officers at the meeting with Brigadier Patrick Scott of the 38th (Irish) Infantry Brigade. The result of this meeting was considered unsuccessful by Herenƒçiƒá as it was decided that retreating Croat soldiers and civilians would not be allowed to pass further than the Austrian border. Herenƒçiƒá had a second meeting, in Bleiburg, where Scott decided that his troops would have to surrender their arms to the Yugoslav Partisans. Although he was not able to negotiate Croatian passage into Austria, he himself was able to break through the British occupiers, and made his way to Italy. From there he traveled to Argentina, where he died 8 December 1978 in Buenos Aires, aged 68.

Life  Born in Koblenz, Germany, Max Cetto studied at the Darmstadt University of Technology, Munich and Berlin. At the latter he studied with Hans Poelzig, graduating as an engineer‚Äìarchitect in 1926 and worked then for the New Frankfurt project. After 1929 he taught also some years at the Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung Offenbach. In 1932 he took part in the competition for the design of the headquarters of the League of Nations in Geneva. Founder-member Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne, 1928. He moved to San Francisco in 1938, where he worked for Los Angeles-based architect Richard Neutra on projects including the Kahn House (1939). Married Gertrud Catarina Kramis in 1940; children: Ver√≥nica, Ana Mar√≠a, and Bettina Cetto. He settled in Mexico and became a naturalized Mexican in 1947. As well as having a natural affinity with Mexico, he was able to incorporate his European experiences into what he built there. The respect for nature he had learned from Neutra is evident in his handling of the volcanic terrain of the Jardines del Pedregal, Mexico City, where he collaborated with Luis Barrag√°n, constructing various houses amid the impressive scenery of the place without disturbing the volcanic lava or the vegetation. He also showed skill and great sensitivity in using the materials and techniques of the region. Notable examples of his work there are the studio house of 1944 for the surrealist painter Wolfgang Paalen in San Angel, the Quintana Weekend House at the Tequesquitengo Lake (1947), his own house (1949) and that built in 1951 for the painter Roberto Berdecio (b 1910). These and other houses elsewhere, where he combined a Modernist approach with a respect for ecology, were highly influential in Mexican domestic architecture.

It is one of the most populous towns of the province where the greek dialect Griko is spoken and its territory includes a stretch of coast overlooking the Ionian Sea with the localities of La Reggia and Montagna Spaccata. History In the Middle Ages, Galatone was a Greek center: the Greek language was spoken and Byzantine rites were celebrated in churches up to the end of the 14th century. Greek scholar Antonio de Ferraris (\\"il Galateo\\") was born here during the Renaissance, and was author of an important historical and geographical study of the Salentine peninsula. Main sights The main attraction of the town is the Santuario del Crocifisso della Piet√†, a Baroque church built between 1696 and 1710. This has a three-level fa√ßade which is richly decorated, as is the interior, surmounted by a magnificent paneled ceiling and a large frescoed cupola. Facing the church stands a 14th- century castle, the seat of the family of Squarciafico, Marquesses of Galatone, ancestors of the Princes of Belmonte. Other churches in the town include the Chiesa Maggiore (1574‚Äì95), the Church of the Dominicans (1612‚Äì1712), and the small Chapel of San Pietro, also in the Baroque style. Near Galatone lies the hermitage of San Nicola dei Pergoleti, a small 13th century Dell'Itria Church. At Fulcignano can be found the remains of a Norman castle and the old bakery, the seat of the English Baker of Apulia and the alleged centre of the world.

It developed from a tropical wave on September 3 and moved west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean, steadily intensifying until it attained hurricane status on September 4, becoming the fifth named storm and third hurricane of the season. Erika passed a short distance to the north of the Lesser Antilles, and later turned to the north in response to an approaching trough. The hurricane quickly strengthened to become the only major hurricane of the season, reaching maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) on September 8; after maintaining its peak strength for 24 hours, Erika began to weaken as it passed over cooler waters. It turned to the east, weakened to a tropical storm, and became extratropical after passing near the Azores archipelago. The hurricane produced light rainfall and winds throughout the northern Lesser Antilles. The passage of Erika carried a cloud of volcanic ash to Antigua from the eruption of the Soufri√®re Hills Volcano on Montserrat, a rare occurrence. Strong waves from the hurricane produced beach erosion and coastal flooding in northern Puerto Rico, and caused the death of two surfers. Moderate wind gusts in the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico left thousands of residents without power, and resulted in $10 million (1997 USD, $12.6 million 2006 USD) in damage in the U.S. Caribbean territories. Erika also produced gusty winds and light rain in the Azores. Erika was the only tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean in the months of August and September, the first occurrence of such event in an Atlantic hurricane season since 1929. Meteorological history A large tropical wave, which eventually became Erika, moved off the coast of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150 miles (1850 km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20 mph (32 km/h) under the influence of a well-established subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika. Erika continued to the west-northwest, and in the early hours of September 4, an eye-like feature appeared to have developed in the center of the deep convection. The feature was not an eye, though, as visible satellite imagery revealed a center partially exposed from the convection. Despite unfavorable wind shear, Erika strengthened further and intensified into a hurricane late on September 4, while located 530 miles (850 km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe. Deep convection re-developed near the center, and the hurricane slowly strengthened as it continued west- northwestward. Hurricane Erika decelerated its forward motion as it approached the Lesser Antilles, and passed within 85 miles (135 km) of the islands as a Category 1 hurricane. An approaching trough weakened the subtropical ridge, resulting in Erika turning to the north and later to the northeast. On September 7, Erika began to quickly intensify, and the hurricane reached its peak strength of 125 mph (205 km/h) on September 8, while located about 350 miles (565 km) north of the Lesser Antilles. Erika maintained peak intensity for about 24 hours before weakening over cooler waters. After passing about 350 miles (565 km) east of Bermuda on September 10, Erika turned to the east- northeast in response to westerly steering currents. Increased upper-level wind shear weakened the hurricane to a tropical storm on September 12. Erika continued to weaken as it turned to the east-southeast, though it maintained deep convection near the center despite unfavorable atmospheric conditions. On September 14 the storm turned to the northeast again, and re-strengthened to reach winds of while located 510 miles (820 km) west-southwest of the Azores. On September 15 Erika passed near the western Azores islands, and quickly weakened as deep convection diminished. Erika became an extratropical cyclone on September 16 north of the Azores, and after executing a clockwise loop, the extratropical storm dissipated on September 19 about 230 miles (370 km) southwest of Ireland. Preparations Erika near the Lesser Antilles Early in the storm's development, forecasting Erika's motion was difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, the government of Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barth√©lemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path that would take it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions were likely to be experienced in the Azores. Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of Bermuda. The governments of the islands in the predicted path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses. In the wake of busy seasons in 1995 and 1996, which some islands were still recovering from, emergency preparations began. In Puerto Rico, fishermen secured their boats in preparation for the storm. Also on the island, citizens formed long lines at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies. Officials in Anguilla enacted a plan that would turn off the island's power supply if the winds exceeded 50 mph (80 km/h). As a precaution, authorities on Saint Martin enacted a curfew for all but those in service jobs. Impact Hurricane Erika produced strong waves and high low-level winds throughout the Lesser Antilles. Just weeks after the eruption of the Soufri√®re Hills Volcano on Montserrat, the storm blew a cloud of falling ash over Antigua. Tropical storm-force winds affected several of the islands in the Lesser Antilles. Winds from Hurricane Erika peaked at 37 mph (60 km/h) with a gust of 47 mph (76 km/h) in the Cyril E. King Airport on Saint Thomas. The outer rainbands produced light to moderate rainfall in the Virgin Islands, peaking at 3.28 inches (83 mm) at the University of the Virgin Islands in Saint Thomas and 1.32 inches (36 mm) in Saint John. The precipitation produced localized street flooding, while the combination of winds and rain caused power interruptions. Offshore, strong waves capsized one dinghy and broke a 50-foot (15 m) boat from its moorings. On Saint Croix, the hurricane produced sustained winds of 25 mph (40 km/h) and a peak wind gust of 29 mph (46 km/h) at the Henry E. Rohlsen Airport. Rainfall on the island was light, peaking at 0.83 inches (21 mm) at Christiansted. The wind gusts downed a few power lines, and damage was minor. The outer rainbands of Erika passed over Puerto Rico, producing maximum sustained winds of 23 mph (37 km/h) and a peak wind gust of 42 mph (68 km/h) at the Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport. The wind gusts snapped tree branches into power lines, leaving up to 12,000 people without power in San Juan, Guaynabo and Bayam√≥n. Rainfall was light on the island, with Caguas reporting a peak total of 0.77 inches (20 mm). The hurricane produced swells of 10 to 12 ft (3 to 3.7 m) on the northern coast of Puerto Rico, causing beach erosion or coastal flooding. One road was closed when sections of it were flooded or washed out. The strong waves forced the evacuation of eight families in the northern portion of the island. The strong waves killed two surfers in the northeastern waters of the island. Damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands totaled to $10 million (1997 USD, $12.6 million 2006 USD) in a preliminary estimate. Thirty-one ships encountered Erika from September 4, when it was a tropical storm, to September 18, when it was extratropical. Two recorded hurricane-force winds, with a peak wind report of . The lowest recorded pressure by a ship was 1000.4 mbar (29.542 inHg) while located 105 miles (170 km) from Erika as an extratropical storm. The lowest recorded pressure while Erika was a tropical cyclone was 1000.5 mbar (29.545 inHg) while located 190 miles (305 km) from the center. While passing near the Azores, Tropical Storm Erika produced maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (48 km/h) at Lajes Field. Gusts were much stronger, with a report of 87 mph (140 km/h) in Flores. In addition, a 200 ft (61 m) tower on Lajes recorded a gust of 105 mph (169 km/h). The storm dropped up to 2.35 inches (60 mm) of rain in Flores and produced rough seas throughout the archipelago. Damage, if any, is unknown in the Azores.

This reaction, introduced in 1961 by P. S. Wharton, is an extension of the Wolff‚ÄìKishner reduction. The general features of this synthesis are: 1) the epoxidation of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones is achieved usually in basic conditions using hydrogen peroxide solution in high yield; 2) the epoxy ketone is treated with 2‚Äì3 equivalents of a hydrazine hydrate in presence of substoichiometric amounts of acetic acid. This reaction occurs rapidly at room temperature with the evolution of nitrogen and the formation of an allylic alcohol. It can be used to synthesize carenol compounds. Wharton's initial procedure has been improved. The Wharton reaction  Mechanism and scope The mechanism of the Wharton reaction begins with reaction of the ketone (1) with hydrazine to form a hydrazone (2). Rearrangement of the hydrazone gives intermediate 3, which can decompose giving off nitrogen gas forming the desired product 4. The final decomposition can proceed by an ionic or a radical pathway, depending on reaction temperature, solvent used, and structure of intermediate 3. The mechanism of the Wharton reaction The Wharton olefin synthesis allows the transformation of an Œ±,Œ≤ unsaturated ketone into an allylic alcohol. The epoxide starting material can be generated by a number of methods, with the most common being reaction of the corresponding alkene with hydrogen peroxide or m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The Wharton reaction also commonly suffers from reduction of the allylic alcohol product down to the aliphatic alcohol. This is thought to be due to the oxidation of hydrazine to diimide under the conditions employed in the reaction. The classical Wharton olefin synthesis has two limitations: * The classical Wharton olefin synthesis conditions are not free from the presence of water, so reactants undergoing the Wharton olefin synthesis should not be sensitive to water. * For acyclic Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones, the Wharton olefin synthesis does not show any selectivity for a specific configuration of the newly synthesized double bond, in terms of (E) or (Z)-stereoisomers. Applications The methodology has been implemented in synthesis of complex molecules: * The total synthesis of the anticancer natural product OSW-1 provides a practical application of the Wharton olefin synthesis. An Œ±,Œ≤-epoxyketone reacts with hydrazine hydrate to yield an allylic alcohol. * In the synthesis of warburganal, a bioactive natural product, the Œ±,Œ≤-epoxyketone is formed from a cyclic Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketone and in a separate step reacts under the classical Wharton olefin synthesis conditions to yield an allylic diol. center ReferencesSee also *Eschenmoser fragmentation *Grob fragmentation *Wolff‚ÄìKishner reduction Category:Organic redox reactions Category:Name reactions ","title":"Wharton reaction"},{"id":"3588962","text":"Patrick \\"Pat\\" Phelan (born 1968) is a video game audio composer, manager, and producer.

Plot The film is set in the late 18th century, when Jane Austen wrote the novel although it was published after her death in 1817. Northanger Abbey is the story of a young woman, Catherine Morland, who is invited to Bath, Somerset, with family friends, the Allens; they hope that the waters at Bath will help Mr. Allen's gout. Catherine (called \\"Cathy\\" by her many younger siblings) is a 17-year-old young lady whom has been quite sheltered all her life, escaping only by reading Gothic novels, and so is delighted to go to Bath. Mrs. Allen introduces Catherine to the Thorpe family, including an older girl, Isabella, who befriends Catherine. The girls have bonded over their love of similar novels when their brothers arrive. James (Catherine's brother) falls in love with Isabella, who is a hardened flirt. Likewise, John (Isabella's brother and James's friend) pusues Catherine, who does not like John nearly as much as John likes himself. Catherine is falling in love with a quirky 26-year-old clergyman, Henry Tilney, whom she met at a dance. She befriends Henry's sister, Eleanor, and goes on many outings with the two of them, after their brother Frederick Tilney comes to Bath. Isabella, having learned that James (to whom she is now engaged) is poor, begins to flirt with Frederick and ultimately ends her engagement with James. Eleanor invites Catherine to stay with her at the Tilneys' home, Northanger Abbey. Catherine accepts the invitation with pleasure, although she imagines that the Abbey will be rather like one of the gloomy castles in her books. Catherine is at first welcomed by General Tilney (Henry's father), who has been bragged to by John Thorpe that Catherine (whom John thinks is in love with him) is an heiress. When the General realizes that Catherine is not rich, however, he sends her packing. Once back at home, Catherine is unhappy, missing Henry and disillusioned about her precious Gothic novels. Henry appears and proposes, however, and the story ends happily.

He was born and raised in Chen Family Village (Chenjiagou, Èô≥ÂÆ∂Ê∫ù) in Henan province. In 1928, Chen Fake moved to Beijing to teach his family's inheritance; Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan. After defeating all challengers, Chen attracted a group of students that included many already well known martial artists. Chen Fake was a martial artist and not a scholar and so he did not leave a written record of his achievements. His life story was recorded and told by his sons or students, notably Hong Junsheng. By the time of his death in 1957, Chen had established a martial arts tradition of Chen-style t'ai chi ch'uan that is practiced worldwide.  Background = Early life  Chen Fake (), courtesy name Fusheng (), was born in 1887, in the village known as Chen Jia Gou (), Wen County (), Henan Province (). This area was known for their martial arts expertise since the establishment of the village in 1374. Chen's great grandfather was Chen Changxing (1771‚Äì1853), who taught Yang Luchan (1799‚Äì1871), the founder of Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan. Chen Fake's father, Chen Yanxi (ÈôàÂª∂ÁÜô; 1820 ? ‚Äì ), was an armed escort by profession. This occupation required him to maintain a reputation in martial arts as he traveled around the country protecting his convoys. Chen Fake was born when his father was in his sixties and both of his older brothers had died. As a result, he lived a relatively pampered life. When Chen was young, he was often sick and sometimes bedridden. Due to his illness, he did not practice his family's martial art. This all changed when his father went to Shandong province to teach martial arts to the family of Yuan Shikai (1859‚Äì1916) around 1900 when Chen Fake was fourteen. Since this position required Chen Yanxi to be away for an extended period, Yanxi asked his relatives to look after his family. One evening, Chen Fake heard his relatives criticizing his weakness suggesting that he failed to live up to the expectations of his ancestors. („ÄåÂª∂ÁÜôËøô‰∏ÄÊîØÔºåËæàËæàÂá∫È´òÊâãÔºåÂèØÊÉúÂà∞ÂèëÁßëËøô‰∏ÄËæàÂ∞±ÂÆå‰∫ÜÔºå‰ªñÈÉΩÂçÅÂõõÂ≤Å‰∫ÜÔºåËøòËøô‰πàËôöÂº±Ôºå‰∏çËÉΩ‰∏ãÂ∑•Â§´ÔºåËøô‰∏çÁúºÁúãÂÆå‰∫ÜÂêóÔºü„Äç ) This disturbed Chen greatly. He wanted to prove his relatives wrong but feared it was too late. He was very poor in terms of martial arts ability, when he compared himself to others within Chen village. This question hounded him until he realized that if he dedicated himself to the practice of his family's art he could improve his skills. For the next three years, while others rested or relaxed after their daily chores, Chen would practice the various forms in Chen's family tai chi chuan. If he had any questions, he would ask every one around him for help. His single minded focus made him one of the best practitioner's in Chen village. His father was pleased with Fake's achievements when he returned for a visit.  Adulthood  For two generations, the Yang family of Yang Lu- ch'an and the Wu family of Wu Quanyou spread the fame of the martial art of t'ai chi ch'uan throughout the Qing Empire. The Qing government ended by a revolution and similar disruption were happening throughout Chinese society. It was during these turbulent times that Chen Zhaopei (ÈôàÁÖß‰∏ï; 1893‚Äì1972) went to Beijing to teach Chen's style Tai Chi Chuan in 1928. Chen Zhaopei's instructions attracted considerable interest and in 1930 he was invited to teach in Nanjing. Zhaopei did not want to leave his Beijing students so he suggested that they invite his uncle Chen Fake to take his place. At this time Chen Fake moved from a small village in Henan Province to the thriving metropolis of Beijing. Before the arrival of Chen Fake, the public perception of t'ai chi ch'uan was based on the views of the Yang style and Wu style. This meant that the t'ai chi ch'uan forms were practiced as slow and relaxed movements. Chen Fake showed a different type of training that at times can include fast vigorous actions and explosive moves. So in the beginning, many within the Beijing martial arts community doubt the authenticity of Chen Fake's quan. According to Chinese tradition, when Chen first arrived in the Chinese capital, he was openly challenged by other martial artists in order to establish his credibility. In those impromptu competitions, there were no rules and no preparations so they could be quite dangerous. For the next thirty years, Chen remained undefeated. Chen not only established an unparalleled martial arts reputation but earned the public's respect for his morality and integrity. According to his student, Hong Junsheng, Chen Fake never criticizes other martial artists either publicly or privately. Chen would also admonish his students for criticizing others. Master Chen was quoted as saying: ‚ÄúThe pillar of socialization is loyalty and the method of dealing with people should be based on modesty and cooperation. Loyalty fosters trust; modesty encourages progress; and cooperation befriends people. Modesty and cooperation should be based on loyalty not on hypocrisy.‚Äù  Students  There were many stories about the abilities of Chen Fake but what is unquestioned is his establishment of a Chen t'ai chi ch'uan tradition outside of Chen Village. During his teaching career in Beijing, he trained hundreds of students, some of which were already well known martial artists. By the time of Chen's death in 1957, his students became respected as Chen Stylists in their own right and later trained the next generation of Chen Tai Chi Chuan practitioners. Some of the more prominent and recognized students of Chen Fake are his two sons and daughter as many well known martial artists. His sons and daughter were: *Chen Zhaoxu (ÈôàÁÖßÊó≠ , 1912 ‚Äì 1959) was the second son of Chen Fake. His older brother, Chen Zh√†o GuƒÅn () died when he was young. He trained with his father at an early age and later helped his father by leading some of the training sessions. At his father's request, he went back to Chen village to teach. He suffered during the turbulent times of the Cultural revolution and as a result died quite young. His boxing legacy is continued by his two sons. The second son, Chen Xiaowang (b. 1945) is living in Australia and is recognized as one of the leading proponents of Chen style tai chi chuan. His third son, Chen Xiaoxing (ÈôàÂ∞èÊòü b. 1952) is now the head instructor at Chen Village (). Chen Xiaoxing's son, Chen Ziqiang () is teaching in Chen village. *Chen Yu Xia (ÈôàË±´‰æ†, 1924‚Äì1986) was the only daughter of Chen Fake. She started to train with her father when she was eight. She obtained a high level of proficiency in Chen t'ai chi ch'uan. In the 1980s, when the students of Hong Junsheng asked Hong about the Chen Sword Form. Hong identified Yu Xia as the expert who still understood the intricacy of the Chen Sword Form and the students of Hong all practiced the form that was taught by Yu Xia. Until her death, she was regarded as a well known authority on Chen t'ai chi ch'uan. *Chen Zhaokui (ÈôàÁÖßÂ•é, 1928 ‚Äì 1981) was the third son of Chen Fake. He trained many of the current Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan practitioners throughout China His son, Chen Yu (Èôà‰øû, 1962 ‚Äì ) is teaching Chen style around the world. His nephew was: *Chen Zhao Pi (ÈôàÁÖß‰∏ï, 1893‰∏Ä1972), courtesy name Ji Fu (), was a close relative of Chen Fake. Zhao Pi was born in a respected martial arts family. The son of Chen Dengke () who was also an established martial artist. Zhao Pi trained extensively with Chen Fake in the Chen village when he was young while his father was away on business. At the age of 21, he left to go to Gansu, Hebei () to teach boxing. In 1928, he was invited to teach in Beijing. By 1930, he was invited by the mayor of Nanjing and the Nanjing government to teach his skills. Not wanting to leave his Beijing students, he suggested that they invite Chen Fake to teach them instead. Zhao Pi continued to teach across China despite the chaos of the war. In 1958, at the age of sixty-five, he retired and headed back to teach in Chen Village. Zhao Pi faced considerable hardship during the turmoils of the Cultural Revolution. Persecuted and banned from teaching a bourgeois and decadent art, Zhao Pi nevertheless succeeded in preserving the legacy of Chen Family t'ai chi ch'uan. He authored four books: Cases of Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan (), Beginner's guide to t'ai chi ch'uan (), Illustrated guide to Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan () and Thirteen theory of Chen Style t'ai chi ch'uan (). The four leading proponents of Chen Style t'ai chi ch'uan from Chen village, Ch√©n Zh√®ng L√©i (), Ch√©n Xi«éo W√†ng (), Zh≈´ TiƒÅn C√°i () and W√°ng Xƒ´' An () are his students. Some of his students were: *Shen Jiazhen (Ê≤àÂÆ∂Ê°¢. 1891 ‚Äì 1972) was an engineer by profession. He was one of the first students of Chen Fake and studied with him for a decade. He wrote a book titled Chen Style Tai ji chuan () with fellow Chen stylists, Gu Liuxin (). He was a relentless promoter for the art, but unfortunately, like many other traditional martial artists, he was persecuted, punished and endured great hardship during the era of the Cultural Revolution. *Tang Hao (1897‚Äì1959) was one of the first modern martial arts historians. He visited Chen village to research the origin of Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan after meeting Chen Fake. His interest in the martial art of t'ai chi ch'uan continued for the rest of his life. *Yang Yichen (Êù®ÁõäËá£. 1904‚Äì1959), courtesy name DeFu (), was of Manchu descent. His family was part of the Yellow Banners in the Qing court. Yichen grew up in a martial arts family. Yichen and his five brothers were already proficient in the martial arts at an early age. He was training with Liu Musan () in Wu style before switching to Chen style under Chen Fake. He trained diligently with Fake until the civil unrest of 1937 where he moved his family to Xian for safety. In Xian, Yichen continued to teach according to the principles of Fake. Hong Junsheng considered Yichen to have learned the essences of Chen Fake. Many other Chen practitioners often sought Yichen for advice. Despite his early death, Yichen left behind many students who continue the Chen tradition. *Zhang Xuan, (Âº†ÁëÑ, 1905‚Äì1984), born in a martial arts family that worked with the Qing court. He was training in Xingyi, Badua and Tam Tui with Zhang Jianquan (). He was working at the Beijing telegrapth when Chen Fake started to teach his Chen Style. Zhang trained with Chen for three years before he relocated to Xi'an. He continued to teach martial arts with his friend and fellow Chen Fake student, Y√°ng Y√¨ch√©n (). He spend the rest of his life spreading the art of Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan. * Pan Yong-Zhou (ÊΩòË©†Âë®: 1906‚Äì1996, alias Zuo-Min. Taiwan) was a student at Beijing University. He started to study Yang style t'ai chi ch'uan, then Wu style t'ai chi ch'uan with Liu Musan. Just like his classmate, Hong Junsheng, Pan switched to studying Chen style when Chen Fake arrived in Beijing. He studied with Fake until circumstances forced Pan to emigrate to Taiwan. In Taiwan, together with Wang He-Lin (), Wang Meng-Bi (ÁéãÂ§¢Âºº, alias Mu-Zhao) and Guo Qing-Shan (ÈÉ≠ÈùíÂ±±, alias Yang-Zhi) established a strong Chen style tradition in Taiwan. He wrote a book titled \\" Chen Taijiquan encyclopedia\\" summarizing his understanding of the art. *Hong Junsheng (1907‚Äì1996) was one of the longest serving students of Chen Fake. Starting in 1930, Hong trained uninterrupted with Fake until 1945 when Hong moved to Jinan, Shandong province. Through a period of tremendous hardship, Hong toiled tirelessly to teach the traditional martial arts system of his teacher. Near the end of his life, Hong summarized his experience and understanding in one book, Chen Tai Chi Practical Method (Ch√©n sh√¨ t√†ij√≠ qu√°n sh√≠y√≤ng qu√°nf«é, ÈôàÂºèÂ§™ÊûÅÊã≥ÂÆûÁî®Êã≥Ê≥ï). Portion of this book was translated into English by Hong's student Joseph Chen Zhonghua in 2006. Hong used the words \\"Practical method\\" (\\"ÂÆûÁî®Êã≥Ê≥ï\\") to emphasize the martial aspects of the art which he felt was the key function of the t'ai chi ch'uan of his teacher. * Gu Liuxin (È°ßÁïôÈ¶®; 1908‚Äì1991) He was born in Shanghai and started to be trained in the martial arts since he was eleven. In 1927, he graduated with a business degree from Shanghai University (). He was active politically as a member of the Communist Party of China and was active during the revolutionary wars. Throughout his life, he maintained his interest in the martial art and continued to seek to learn from the leading martial artists of the era including Chen Fake. He was the co-author of the book titled Chen Style Tai ji chuan () with Jiazhen Shen (Ê≤àÂÆ∂Ê°¢. 1891 ‚Äì 1972). He also wrote a book on \\"Cannon fist\\". * Lei Muni (Èõ∑ÊÖïÂ∞º; 1911‚Äì1986) He was born in Wuchang District, Hubei, and was well versed in the martial arts even before becoming a student of Chen Fake in 1932. From 1961 onwards, he started to teach t'ai chi ch'uan in Beijing. Over his lifetime, he was the author of numerous books on the martial arts including: Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan 45 moves (Èõ∑ÊÖïÂ∞ºÈôàÂºèÂ§™ÊûÅÊã≥45Âºè) and Chen Style t'ai chi ch'uan 33 moves (). *Zh≈çng M√≠nggƒÅo (ÈíüÈ∏£È´ò, 1911‚Äì1998), courtesy name TiƒÅnshƒìng (), once enrolled in the Whampoa Military Academy and continued serving in the military and various political offices. He trained with Chen Fake when he was in Beijing. * Li Jingwu (ÊùéÁªèÊÇü; 1912‚Äì1997) He was born in Ye County, Shandong, and started to train in the martial arts in 1927. In 1941, he was in Beijing studying Wu Style tai chi () with Yang Yuting () and Chen Style with Chen Fake. After the founding of the People's Republic, he was an active promoter of t'ai chi ch'uan. He participated in the 1956 Beijing Wushu Competition and was awarded first place in t'ai chi ch'uan. He was part of the National Sports Commission committee that created the Standard Simplified t'ai chi ch'uan in 1958. In 1959, he was transferred to a nursing home in Beidaihe District to teach Qigong. He continued to research and promote the martial arts. *Chen Yunting (Èôà‰∫ë‰∫≠, 1912 ‚Äì ) was born and raised in Chen Village. Together with his brother, Chen Guiting () studied extensively with Chen Fake. In 1930, he started to teach t'ai chi ch'uan in different regions of China such as Xuzhou. He trained many Chen stylists over his lifetime. * Wang He-Lin (ÁéãÈ∂¥Êûó; 1915‚Äì?) He started his martial arts training when he was seventeen. He emigrated to Taiwan during the Chinese civil war and continued to teach Chen Style for the rest of his life. Together with fellow student, Pan Yong-Zhou, Wang was considered to be one of the six elders of Chen style tai chi ch'uan in Taiwan. * Tian Xiuchen (Áî∞ÁßÄËá£; 1917‚Äì1984) initially studied Shaolin Boxing when he was young. Later, he studied Xingyi quan with master Tangfeng Ting (). He switched to studying Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan after meeting Chen Fake in 1941. He began teaching Chen style in 1961, after the death of Chen Fake. His nephews Tian Qiumao (Áî∞ÁßãËåÇ, b.1945 ‚Äì ), Tian Qiuxin and Tian Qiutian, who also trained with Feng Zhiqiang, continues to teach Chen style in Beijing. * Feng Zhiqiang (ÂÜØÂøóÂº∫; 1928‚Äì2012 ) was already proficient in Xinyi Quan under the tutelage of Hu Yaozhen (1879‚Äì1973) before he started to train with Chen Fake in 1953. After Fake's death, Feng became one of the leading proponents of Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan first within China then internationally. He summarized his understanding of martial arts to create a new training program which he called Hunyuantaiji (). This new system is being practiced worldwide. *Xiao Qing Lin (ËÇñÂ∫ÜÊûó, 1929‚Äì2010) born in Yexian (), Shandong. He studied with Chen Fake and maintained his interest as well as actively promoting Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan in the Beijing area for the rest of his life.  What is a form?  Conventional history credits Chen Fake with the creation of the New Frame (Xin Jia, Êñ∞Êû∂) of Chen t'ai chi ch'uan that are currently practiced by some branches of Chen t'ai chi ch'uan practitioners. He is also given the credit of promoting the Old Frame () which is the form he taught when he first arrived in Beijing. Each instructor after Chen Fake also performs and teaches the form slightly differently. This proliferation of styles has led to the obvious argument about the authenticity of the forms. As an extension of this question, the t'ai chi ch'uan community also tried to debate the merits of the different t'ai chi ch'uan Styles or even the difference between Internal and External martial arts. This quest for authenticity and efficacy is one attempt to prove the legitimacy of the training within the traditional Chinese martial arts. For Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan, Chen Fake did not leave any written material to indicate his view on the matter of form. Hong Jung Shen noted that Chen Fake changed his teaching method over his thirty years career. Hong also noticed that his fellow students such as Chen Zhaoxu, Chen Zhaokui and Feng Zhiqiang all practiced their forms differently from him. Hong finally asked Chen Fake about this issue during his last meeting with his teacher in 1957. Chen told Hong to ignore the external appearance of the form but focused on the idea that any correct t'ai chi ch'uan form should be based on the same fundamental principle and that each element of a form should have a purpose. Accordingly, the external appearance is not important as long as those two requirements are met. In Chen Fake's words: ‚ÄúThis set of Taijiquan does not have one technique which is useless. Everything was carefully designed for a purpose.‚Äù (‚ÄúËøôÂ•óÊã≥Ê≤°Êúâ‰∏Ä‰∏™ Âä®‰ΩúÊòØÁ©∫ÁöÑ, ÈÉΩÊòØÊúâÁî®ÁöÑ‚Äù) . This principle, according to Hong, can be derived from ‚ÄúThe Taijiquan Treatise‚Äù () by Wang Zongyue (). This idea is expressed by the phrase ‚ÄúAlthough there are myriad variations, there is only one underlying principles.‚Äù (‚ÄúËôΩÂèòÂåñ‰∏áÁ´Ø, ËÄåÁêÜ‰∏∫‰∏ÄË¥Ø‚Äù). Enduring legacy Chen Fake and his generation were probably the last true traditional Chinese martial artists. It is only through a series of fortunate coincidences that he was able to teach his art in the capital of the Chinese nation. He attracted and cultivated a group of exceptional students and those students ensured that his knowledge and skills were passed down. Even through the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and the eventual international dissemination, this selected group and now their students continues to teach according to their master's instructions. This dedication provided the strong foundation needed to foster a thriving and sustainable Chen style t'ai chi ch'uan community. Chen t'ai chi ch'uan practitioners can now be found all over that world. This is the enduring legacy of Chen Fake. T'ai chi ch'uan lineage tree with Chen- style focus The lineage tree is a simplified representation of the student- master relationships for t'ai chi ch'uan. The real story is considerable more complex because some students studied under many teachers. What is the most important point from the lineage tree is the pivotal role of Chen Fake and his contribution to the dissemination of Chen t'ai chi ch'uan outside of Chen village. A minor error in the tree is the linkage between Chen Zhaopi (). Chen Zhaopi did not train with the father of Chen Fake (Chen Yanxi, ÈôàÂª∂ÁÜô) but rather Zhaopi's own father Chen Dengke (). Chen Dengke was of the same generation as Chen Fake. Chen Dengke's father is Chen Yannian () who was the brother of Chen Fake's father, Chen Yanxi (). The father of both Yannian and Yanxi was Chen Gengyun (). As the tree shows, Gengyun was of the same generation as the other t'ai chi ch'uan luminaries such as Yang Luchan and Chen Qingping (). Both Luchan and Gengyun were students of Chen Changxing ().

It has an estimated elevation of above sea level. The town was first settled as Turquoise in the 1870s in what was then the Arizona Territory, then later re-established as Gleeson in 1900. History The area was initially settled as a mining camp called Turquoise after the mineral which had been mined by Native Americans in the area. The Turquoise post office was established on October 22, 1890, and lasted only a few years until September 17, 1894. When local miner John Gleeson registered a copper claim and opened the Copper Belle Mine, the town of Gleeson was created just downhill from the old site of Turquoise. Silver Bill, Pejon and Defiance were some of the other mines that followed in the surrounding areas. The Gleeson post office, established on October 15, 1900, supported a town of about 500 people engaged primarily in copper mining, including veins of lead, silver and zinc. In 1912, 28 buildings burned to the ground and the town was rebuilt. Copper production boomed to supply demand during World War I. The mines played out by the 1930s and eventually the Gleeson post office closed on March 31, 1939. Remnants Though several families still live on the site, Gleeson is, by all measures, a ghost town, with the only commercial venture appearing to be a rattlesnake products store. Visitors can find the ruins of a hospital, a saloon, a cemetery, a jail, the foundation of the village school and evidence of the extensive mining in the surrounding hills near town. The Gleeson cemetery is west of the town on the road to Tombstone.

It was established in 1939. The AO is the central support entity for the federal judicial branch. It provides a wide range of administrative, legal, financial, management, program, and information technology services to the federal courts. The AO is directly supervised by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the body that sets the national and legislative policy of the federal judiciary, which is composed of the Chief Justice of the United States, the chief judge of each court of appeals, a district court judge from each regional judicial circuit, and the chief judge of the United States Court of International Trade. The AO implements and executes Judicial Conference policies, as well as applicable federal statutes and regulations. The AO facilitates communications within the judiciary and with Congress, the executive branch, and the public on behalf of the judiciary. Mission The Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building houses the offices of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the Federal Judicial Center, the United States Sentencing Commission, and the Office of the Clerk of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. The mission of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AO) is to provide a variety of support functions to the United States federal judiciary. The AO prepares and submits the budget for the courts to the Judicial Conference for approval by Congress. It analyzes legislation from Congress that will affect the courts' operations or personnel, and it interprets and applies the new laws. It also provides administrative help to members of the courts in the form of clerks, probation and pretrial services officers, court reporters, and public defenders. It also works together with the General Services Administration to develop and operate suitable accommodations for federal courts, either in federal buildings or in standalone federal courthouses. Structure The director of the AO serves as Secretary of the Judicial Conference and is appointed, along with the deputy director, by the Chief Justice of the United States. The AO includes an Office of the General Counsel, Office of Judicial Conference Executive Secretariat, Office of Public Affairs, Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Judges Programs, Office of Court Administration, Office of Human Resources, Office of Finance and Budget, Office of Facilities and Security, Office of Defender Services, Office of Probation and Pretrial Services, Office of Information Technology, and an Office of Internal Services. History The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts was established by an act of Congress on November 6, 1939.An Act to provide for the administration of the United States courts, and for other purposes, , codified at With the establishment of the Administrative Office and the circuit judicial councils, Congress for the first time provided the judiciary with budgetary and personnel management agencies that were independent of the executive branch of government. For 150 years, administrative responsibility for the federal courts shifted from the Treasury Department to the Interior Department in 1849 and to the Justice Department in 1870. (The Conference of Senior Circuit Judges, established in 1922, was an advisory body.) By the late 1930s, a coalition of judges, lawyers, academics, and Justice Department officials agreed that the efficient administration of justice, as well as the principle of judicial independence, required a separate agency with officers appointed by and responsible to a body of judges. By the early-twentieth century, some judges expressed concern that the Justice Department‚Äôs administrative oversight of the courts was ineffective and, more importantly, posed the threat of interference with the judicial process. Reform proposals ranged from separate appropriation bills for the courts to the authorization of senior circuit judges as administrators for all the courts within their respective circuits. Some circuits established conferences of judges to discuss problems of case management and court administration. The Roosevelt administration‚Äôs Judicial Reorganization Bill of 1937, best known for its provision to enlarge the Supreme Court, included provision for appointment of a proctor who would gather data on the business of the courts and make recommendations for reassignment of judges and improved case management. Many district court judges resisted this centralization of authority over individual courts that had operated with so much autonomy for a century and a half, but there was widespread support for some reform that would facilitate judicial business and eliminate the Justice Department‚Äôs role in the daily operations of the federal courts. After the defeat of Roosevelt‚Äôs \\"court-packing\\" plan, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes responded to suggestions for less sweeping administrative changes. He appointed members of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges to work with representatives of the American Bar Association and Justice Department officials to draft legislation that would improve the efficiency of the courts at the same time that it respected the decentralized character of the federal judicial system. The committee‚Äôs proposed Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts would collect information on the caseload of the courts, prepare the annual budget request for the courts and disburse funds appropriated to the judiciary, and offer administrative assistance to the courts. The act authorized the Supreme Court to select the director of the Administrative Office, but, at the insistence of Chief Justice Hughes, the office was to operate under the supervision of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges rather than the Court. The committee proposal found broad support in both the Senate and House of Representatives, which considered several versions before passage in August 1939. The act established circuit judicial councils through which the courts of appeals judges would review the caseload reports of the Administrative Office and instruct district judges on what was necessary to expedite the courts‚Äô business. It also mandated annual circuit conferences at which circuit and district judges would meet with members of the bar to discuss judicial administration. Directors of the Administrative Office James C. Duff is the current Director of the AO. On November 4, 2014 it was announced by Chief Justice John Roberts he would once again become Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, effective January 5, 2015.

Together, they have gained increasing public notice and critical acclaim for developing a unique sound of their own. Melding together blues, southern rock, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel, soul, funk with Hindustani classical music, afro-beat and world fusion, the band has released six studio albums, two live albums, and a live DVD. The bandmates have combined their talents to perform pieces from some of the most highly regarded musicians before them, while at the same time collaborating on writing the songs they have recorded. The band's eclectic sound is a way for Trucks to explore his own creativity alongside his role as a guest, and eventually a permanent member, in The Allman Brothers Band. History The Derek Trucks Band was founded by Trucks in 1994, with the introduction of Todd Smallie, an Atlanta jazz and blues-based musician playing bass guitar. As the first to join him, Trucks has said he feels that he's \\"kind of grown up with him.\\"Trucks, Derek Multimedia Interview, 2002 with Trucks about The Derek Trucks Band, their album, Joyful Noise Official Website bassist The next year, in 1995, Smallie was followed by drummer Yonrico Scott, who initially filled the role of percussionist, as well as drummer, completing the band's first cohesive rhythm section. Scott began learning to play the drums when still a very young child. Originating in Michigan, with a Motown influence, he graduated from the University of Kentucky with a B.A. Degree in percussion performance. His songwriting collaborations with other band members appear from their first eponymous debut album in 1997, followed with Out of the Madness in 1999, and have continued to date. Scott has been playing with Trucks for over 17 years as of 2009. According to Trucks: \\"We've developed a kind of 'musical ESP'.. it's nice to have somebody that you don't have to look at...he's just right there with you.\\" Yonrico Scott, on drums Trucks continued to gather a steady group of talented musicians together, although two early members did not last. The band's initial keyboardist/vocalist, Bill McKay, left his mark in songwriting credits on the band's earliest albums. Upon finding an opening for a keyboardist, the bandmates felt fortunate to find Kofi Burbridge, (brother of bass guitairist Oteil Burbridge, with whom Trucks plays in the Allman Brothers Band) to fill the role. Kofi Burbridge is a classically trained multi-instrumentalist, and contributed to his versatility with keyboards, organ, flute, and backing vocals, in addition to his songwriting. Burbridge joined the band in 1999. In an interview upon the release of their 2002 album, Joyful Noise, Trucks commented \\"Kofi Burbridge has been with us maybe 2-3 years, and he's one of the few musical geniuses that I've had the chance to work with...\\" continuing, \\"I'm really anxious to see in the next few years to see where he takes this, because he's definitely a huge part of what's going on right now.\\" Kofi Burbridge Flute and Keyboards In 2002 the band's producers, Craig Street and John Snyder recommended singer Mike Mattison to the band. Mattison, Lead Vocalist Mattison performed several shows with the band, and Trucks decided Mattison's soulful voice and calm stage presence completed the band's identity. Trucks said of Mattison, \\"He's got a huge range, so that helps us out a lot when we stretch into some of the different material we cover. It's like having three different vocalists onstage at times. It's a tough piece of the puzzle to find, you know -- a good singer who fits with what you're doing -- so we were very fortunate to hook up with Mike.\\" Count M‚ÄôButu, Percussionist Mattison has collaborated with Trucks writing songs, on each album since joining the band, including the title track to the band's 2008 album, Already Free. Mattison had a previous band as well‚Äîa vocal duo, called Scrapomatic, with guitarist/vocalist Paul Olsen, with whom he still performs at occasional gigs, including some opening sets for The Derek Trucks Band.Jambase Band Bio Jambase dTb biography The band's final member, Count M'Butu is the only band member that does not appear on every tour. M'Butu, the group's eldest member, plays a variety of drums and percussion. Trucks and Scott both have known him for decades, before he joined the Derek Trucks Band, as M'Butu was a regular musical fixture in Atlanta; one of the bastions of the Allman Brothers fan bases. Thus, as of early 2009, M'Butu is the eldest member of the band, which has members whose ages are in their 20s, 30s 40s 50s and 60s. M'Butu has a great deal of African influence in his work, but lived in Sandersville, Georgia most of his life, \\"so he's got that Southern thing, too\\", Derek finishes. His differing influences are compatible with the band's world music sound. Since the last members joined in 2002, the bandmates have adjusted to near-constant travelling on the road, and have become comfortable with one another. Each member's experiences, tastes, and differing approaches to each piece are a bonus, says Mattison. Since the band embraces improvisation and musical exploration, he has said, \\"You're just part of the ensemble -- you do your bit and step back and let everybody else do theirs. It's fun to not have to carry the weight of the entertainer.\\" The band's album, Already Free, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards. That summer they released their live album, Roadsongs. 2011 the band got the Blues Music Award as Band of the Year. The Derek Trucks Band would occasionally play together with the band of Trucks' wife, Susan Tedeschi, in a collective known as \\"Soul Stew Revival\\". This allowed the couple to spend more time with each other when they would otherwise both be out on the road separately. Trucks and Tedeschi formed a new group called the Tedeschi Trucks Band, with Mike Mattison and the Kofi Burbridge both joining from the Derek Trucks Band. As a result, the Derek Trucks Band has been on hiatus since 2010. Kofi Burbridge and Yonrico Scott both died in 2019.

He later managed Carlisle United. He was formerly chief scout at Leeds United.  Early life  He was educated at Kings Road Primary School, attended also by another famous West Ham player, Geoff Hurst, and King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford.  Playing career  He represented Essex Schools at all levels and was picked for the England Schools squad six times, though he did not play. At aged 15 Ipswich Town, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United sent scouts to watch Day. Ron Greenwood's West Ham United signed Day on a youth contract in July 1971. In February 1973 he signed a professional contract with West Ham and on 29 August 1973 he made his debut in a draw against Ipswich Town. Day became the first team goalkeeper soon after. In 1975, aged 19 he became the youngest goalkeeper ever to appear in an FA Cup Final, in their victory over Fulham. He received the PFA Young Player of the Year Award that same season, the only goalkeeper to have won the award. He was tipped as the next great England goalkeeper. In 1976, he appeared in the Cup Winners' Cup Final which West Ham lost 4‚Äì2 to Anderlecht at a sold out Heysel Stadium. However, a loss of form and injuries saw him drop out of the side, and Phil Parkes' performances were good enough to keep Day out when he regained fitness. In July 1979 he moved to Leyton Orient for ¬£100,000, where he replaced John Jackson. When Eddie Gray, then manager of Leeds United, signed him in 1985, he proved to be an excellent buy and was a key figure in Billy Bremner's side in the 1987 run to the FA Cup semi-final and League play- offs. He remained first choice keeper for Howard Wilkinson, and picked up a Division 2 winners medal as promotion was finally achieved in 1990. With the re-signing of John Lukic, Day was relegated to the reserves and bench, and only made five more appearances for the first team, although he remained loyal to the club for three more seasons until he finally left Elland Road in 1993 after eight years. His final club was Carlisle United.  Management and coaching career  After retiring, he was manager of Carlisle United and lead them to promotion into Division Two & a Football League Trophy win in 1997, but left shortly after due to a falling out with the chairman, Michael Knighton, who replaced Day as manager. He was first team coach to Alan Curbishley at Charlton Athletic for many years before he and Curbishley both left the club at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season. On 13 December 2006, he was again named as Curbishley's number two after the former was unveiled as the new West Ham manager but left the club at the same time as Curbishley in September 2008. On 20 July 2010 he rejoined Leeds United as chief scout to work alongside technical director Gwyn Williams. He left the position as chief scout at Leeds in March 2012 and worked as a co-commentator on ESPN's coverage of the Bundesliga.http://www.weallloveleeds.co.uk/latest/archives/07-2012 In November 2012 Day was appointed Scouting and Talent Identification Manager at Brighton and Hove Albion. On 2 July 2014 was appointed head of recruitment at West Bromwich Albion. On 30 June 2015 Day left his post as head of recruitment at West Bromwich Albion after a year in the job.

Clockwise from bottom: Yusuke Urameshi, Hiei, Kurama, and Kazuma Kuwabara. The Yu Yu Hakusho manga series features a diverse cast of fictional characters created by Yoshihiro Togashi. It follows fourteen-year-old junior high school delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who dies and is resurrected in order to become the Underworld's detective of paranormal events in the Human World. Yusuke begins his work in the Human World, but ends up traveling to the Underworld and then eventually to the Demon Plane. In each case he undertakes, Yusuke meets several new enemies and allies. Other predominant characters include Yusuke's rival delinquent Kazuma Kuwabara, the fox demon Kurama, and the sword-wielding fire demon Hiei. While several characters are humans, many are demons, and both have different supernatural abilities due to harnessing their Reiki, one's own aura or life energy. Creation and conception Yoshihiro Togashi did not give much thought to the names of the characters. He came up with them by skimming through a dictionary and combining kanji characters he found appealing. The author said the name Yusuke Urameshi is \\"practically a joke.\\" Viz Media explained that the \\"Yu\\" is written with the kanji for \\"ghost\\", and \\"Urameshiii...\\" is a phrase typically said by wailing ghosts. Togashi came up with Kazuma Kuwabara's name by combining the names of two professional baseball players (Masumi Kuwata and Kazuhiro Kiyohara). Viz Media said that it is also a pun on \\"Kuwabara kuwabara\\", a phrase uttered by superstitious people when they are scared. Mari Kitayama, a lead character designer for the anime adaptation of Yu Yu Hakusho, stated that she considers Kuwabara to be the most difficult character to design. Kurama and Hiei's names came to Togashi on the spur of the moment. When the two were introduced, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was uncertain about Hiei. Togashi based Hiei's design off of the character Skunky from the manga series Patalliro! by Mineo Maya. Kitayama finds Kurama to be the easiest of the main characters to design due to his well-proportioned features and considers Hiei to be her favorite. The names of Yusuke's school Sarayashiki and the rival Kasanegafuchi Junior High are both named after haunted mansions in famous ghost stories; Banch≈ç Sarayashiki and Kaidan Kasanegafuchi. The names of the characters Roto and Rinku are taken from video game characters of the same names, the former from Dragon Quest and the latter from The Legend of Zelda.Ê§çËçâ‰ø°ÂíåÁ∑®„ÄåÁâπÈõÜ ÂÜ®Ê®´Áæ©Âçö„ÄéÂπΩ‚òÜÈÅä‚òÜÁôΩÊõ∏„ÄèÂÜ®Ê®´Áæ©Âçö„ÇíË™≠„ÅøËß£„Åè53„ÅÆ„Ç≠„Éº„ÉØ„Éº„Éâ„Äç„Äé„Éû„É≥„Ç¨Â§úË©±VOL.6„ÄèKinema JunpoÔºà„Ç≠„ÉçÊó¨„É†„ÉÉ„ÇØÔºâ„ÄÅ1999Âπ¥11Êúà30Êó•„ÄÅ„ÄÅ178È†Å Togashi's inspiration for the character Mukuro was Kushana of Torumekia from Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind. After receiving a lot of letters both praising and criticizing the voice actors, Togashi clarified that he had no involvement in the anime adaptation. Protagonists=Yusuke Urameshi Voiced by: Nozomu Sasaki (Japanese); Justin Cook (English, TV series and first film; Funimation dubs), Darren Pleavin (English, TV series; Animax Asia dub), Rik Nagel (English, second film; Central Park Media dub), Jonathan Fahn (English, first film; Anime Works dub; as \\"Jonathan Charles\\") Played by: Tsubasa Sakiyama is a fourteen-year-old delinquent who attends Sarayashiki Junior High School. His poor school attendance, constant fighting and bad habits have earned him the fear of his classmates and the disdain of his teachers and neighbors. This all changes rather abruptly when Yusuke is struck and killed by a car while saving a small child who has wandered into the road. Such an altruistic deed catches even the Underworld by surprise, and because they do not have a place for him yet in heaven or hell, he is permitted to return to his body and resume his life. However, while doing so it is revealed that Yusuke has a particularly strong aura, or spirit energy, and Koenma recruits him as Underworld Detective. Yusuke is charged with investigating supernatural phenomena in the Human World that have connections to the Underworld. Yusuke bears affection for his childhood friend Keiko Yukimura, who initially takes a role as Yusuke's conscience, making sure he comes to class and behaves, and later becomes his romantic interest. Yusuke's alcoholic mother, Atsuko, raised him as a single parent after conceiving him as a young teen. Yusuke's most common attack is the , an aura energy blast fired as a projectile out of his right index finger as though his hand were a gun and his finger the barrel. At first he is only able to muster a single shot per day, but after training under Genkai he is able to fire multiple shots per day, as well as developing minor variations on the technique such as the \\"shotgun\\" variant wherein Yusuke fires a spray of miniature spirit guns at once using his fist instead of his finger. After he is killed by Shinobu Sensui, it is revealed that Yusuke is a \\"demon throwback\\"; a demon mated with a human ancestor of his 44 generations ago but the gene remained quiescent for generations. Yusuke is resurrected by his demonic powers, which when fully awakened sees his hair grow to his knees and tattoo-like marks appear on his body. Yusuke is a descendant of the demon king Raizen, whom he goes to see in the Demon Plane. Upon Raizen's death, Yusuke becomes king of his domain but proposes the Demon Plane Unification Tournament, winner taking control of the whole Demon Plane. At the end of the series, Yusuke opens up a ramen stand and also spends time helping humans and demons cooperate. Yusuke is a popular character with fans, coming in second and third place in the series' first two popularity polls. He came in third in the American Shonen Jump poll. In the Japanese magazine Animages Anime Grand Prix popularity poll, Yusuke was ranked as the thirteenth most popular anime character in 1993, the tenth in 1994, and the eighth in 1995. In March 2010, Yusuke was ranked sixteenth best male anime character of the 1990s by the Japanese magazine Newtype. Kazuma Kuwabara Voiced by: Shigeru Chiba (Japanese); Christopher Sabat (English, TV series and first film, Funimation dubs), Russel Wait (English, TV Series, Animax Asia dub), Cliff Lazenby (English, second film; Central Park Media dub), Lex Lang (English, first film; Anime Works dub) Played by: Naoya Gomoto is a classmate of Yusuke's at Sarayashiki Junior High School. Despite his unusual affinity for kittens, he is the second toughest delinquent at the school, constantly picking fights with Yusuke to prove himself stronger, but never succeeding. Eventually Kuwabara's feelings of anger toward Yusuke become feelings of respect. Although he loves fighting, Kuwabara would never steal or extort money. Kuwabara has a very advanced sixth sense, though not as acute as his older sister Shizuru's. Kuwabara ends up assisting in most of Yusuke's cases, having gained the ability to form a sword out of his own aura called the during the competition to become Genkai's pupil. He learns to develop this power rather quickly; being able to wield two at once after training with Kurama for the Dark Tournament, and create a more powerful sword that boosts his recuperative abilities, acting as both a weapon and shield, by using the Sword of Trials he gets from Suzuki. Kuwabara later obtains the during his fight against Kiyoshi Mitarai, a sleeker and cleaner aura sword that possesses the ability to slice and cut through and between dimensions. This causes him to become the target of Sensui as it will aid in completing the portal to the Demon Plane and he is captured, and later cuts the force field to chase after Sensui fully opening the portal. Kuwabara falls in love at first sight of the Ice Maiden Yukina, and helps Yusuke rescue her from Gonzo Tarukane. Yukina is very appreciative to Kuwabara for saving her from captivity, but is oblivious to his affection. Towards the end of the series, Kuwabara becomes more engrossed in his studies, choosing to cram for his high school exams rather than follow Yusuke and the others into the Demon Plane. At the end, Yukina is living with his family as a homestay. Kuwabara is a popular character with fans, coming in fourth place in the series' first two popularity polls. He came in fifth in the American Shonen Jump poll. Kurama Voiced by: Megumi Ogata (Japanese, normal form); Shigeru Nakahara (Japanese, demon form); John Burgmeier (English, TV series and first film; Funimation dubs), Candice Moore (English, TV Series; Animax Asia dub), Chris Orbach (English, second film; Central Park Media dub, as \\"Hideo Seaver\\"), David Hayter (English, first film; Anime Works dub) Played by: Hiroki Suzuki is a and former thief, who specialized in undoing seals and stealing ancient treasures. Fifteen years before the series began, he was badly injured and escaped to the Human World in soul form, where he entered an embryo in a pregnant human woman, becoming at birth. Within ten or so years his powers would return and his body would become inhuman, at which point he planned to leave. However, Kurama comes to love his now-single human mother, and when she becomes gravely ill he cannot bear to leave her all alone, and remains as Shuichi in the Human World. Having teamed up with Hiei and Goki to steal three Underworld treasures, Kurama becomes a target of Yusuke Urameshi. However, he betrays his partners and takes the , a mirror capable of granting the user's desire at the cost of the user's life, to cure his mother of her deadly illness. Yusuke saves Kurama's life with both of them giving some of their lifeforce, therefore they both survive (in the anime, the mirror cancels the sacrifice due to Yusuke's kindness). This act bonds Yusuke and Kurama as friends and allies. He begins assisting Yusuke in defeating The Four Beasts in exchange for a reduced sentence. For associating with humans, Kurama and Hiei are invited to take part in the Dark Tournament on Yusuke and Kuwabara's team. Kurama uses his demonic powers to control plants, including his signature weapon the , a rose he turns into a whip of thorns capable of cutting through steel. He also possesses a talent for analytical thinking, which allows him to gauge his opponents' strengths and weaknesses and formulate effective strategies. During the Dark Tournament, Kurama is able to temporarily revert to his original form; Fox Demon Kurama (\\"Yoko Kurama\\" in the English anime), a tall, silver-haired character with sharp nails, fox ears and tail. As Demon Kurama, his powers are far greater and he is capable of creating demonic plants which possess various attributes and highly formidable powers. After watching Yusuke's death by Sensui, Kurama's old demon powers awaken. He is invited to the Demon Plane to join his old partner Yomi, and becomes his second in command. He takes part in the Demon Plane Unification Tournament, losing in the third round. At the end of the series, he is shown working at his stepfather's company. Kurama was Megumi Ogata's first voice acting role. She stated that while auditioning it was a requirement by the anime's production company that the character's voice sound like a 17-year old male but also like that of a member of Takarazuka Revue, an all-female musical theatre group that portrays both men and women. Kurama is a popular character with fans, coming in third and second place in the series' first two popularity polls. He came in second in the American Shonen Jump poll. In Animages Anime Grand Prix, he was ranked as the third most popular male anime character of 1993 and the most popular male character in both 1994 and 1995. His alternate demon form was ranked sixteenth in 1994. Demon Kurama additionally won About.com's \\"Best Supporting Character\\" in its 2005 Anime Award Show. Kurama was also ranked the third best male anime character of the 1990s by Newtype. Hiei Voiced by: Nobuyuki Hiyama (Japanese); Chuck Huber (English, TV series and first film; Funimation dubs), Dave Bridges (English, TV Series; Animax Asia dub), James Stanley (English, second film; Central Park Media dub), Kirk Thornton (English, first film; Anime Works dub) Played by: Shohei Hashimoto is introduced as one of three wanted demons, alongside Kurama and Goki, who stole three treasures from the Underworld. With the , a sword that turns anyone cut by it into a demon, he plans to create an army. As the last of his partners on the run, Hiei kidnaps Keiko in an exchange with Yusuke for the other two treasures. However, he also cuts her with the Conjuring Blade, forcing Yusuke to defeat him to save her, which he does with help from Kurama and Botan. Hiei possess the implanted in his forehead, which gives him clairvoyance and allows him to control lesser demons and humans with only a glance. He can transform into a form with Evil Eyes all over his body, boosting his powers. While assisting Yusuke in defeating The Four Beasts in exchange for a reduced sentence, Hiei changes and no longer acts solely for his own interest. For associating with humans, Hiei and Kurama are invited to take part in the Dark Tournament on Yusuke and Kuwabara's team. During the Dark Tournament he debuts the technique known as the , which allows him to summon and control black flames from the Demon Plane. He eventually masters the technique by consuming the flames, which greatly enhances the user's abilities. Although he initially refrains from helping Yusuke and company stop Sensui from opening the portal to the Demon Plane because he wants to return himself, Hiei later joins them when Yusuke offers to let him have The Black Chapter videotape. After watching Yusuke's death by Sensui, Hiei's old demon powers awaken. He is invited to the Demon Plane to join Mukuro. He takes part in the Demon Plane Unification Tournament, losing to Mukuro in the third round. At the end of the series, he is assigned to the special squad in charge of safely returning humans who wander into the Demon Plane. Hiei is Yukina's twin brother. It is later revealed that he is a fire demon born to a race of female Ice Maidens, who reproduce by parthenogenesis every 100 years, always giving birth to a female. However, a male child is born only if the Maiden has had sexual contact with a male, which is forbidden in their society. As her children were born, their mother wept two Tears of Ice before dying, tears that crystallize into jewels and are given to the babies.

At full power he needs to feed on aura to maintain such immense power, leading him to absorb the aura of weaker creatures. Once a great martial arts master and Genkai's lover, Toguro was psychologically scarred when a demon named Kairen killed all of his students while inviting him to participate in the Dark Tournament. Toguro defeated Kairen in the final round to win the tournament and decided he did not want to age and lose his power, therefore he asked to be turned into a demon. 50 years later he invites Yusuke to the tournament in hopes of finally finding a fighter worthy of his full 100% power. Although he stops Yusuke's final attack in the final round, Toguro's body is destroyed and he dies. In the afterlife, he is offered a lighter sentence by Koenma due to his time as a martial artist, but Toguro refuses and requests the harshest sentence there is: 10,000 years of torture in hell for 10,000 cycles, with his soul ceasing to exist afterward.

In the second to last match of the Dark Tournament, Kuwabara works around his regeneration by squashing him with the Aura Sword (whose shape had been manipulated into that of a flyswatter), and Elder Toguro is declared the loser. But Elder Toguro reveals he is still alive as his brother is about to begin his fight against Yusuke and offers to be his weapon. However, Younger Toguro punches him to pieces and off the island, saying that the fight will be one-on-one only. After being nearly destroyed by his brother, Elder Toguro slowly regenerated until he was a head found by Sensui. Seeking revenge he informed Sensui about Yusuke, who decided it was time to begin his plan to destroy humanity.

When he was younger, Bui fought Younger Toguro and lost. With the prospect of a rematch, he trained and improved, but so did Toguro.

He has an affinity and knack for gambling, occasionally putting his own life on the line just for the thrill of it. With his expected monetary winnings from the tournament, Sakyo plans to create a large hole or portal linking the Demon Plane with the Human World, for no reason other than to see what happens. After Younger Toguro's death and having staked his own life on the victory, Sakyo self-destructs the tournament arena and is crushed to death.

After Sensui saw the cruelty of humans, in antithesis of what he believed, he went mad and murdered everyone in the room. He began to question humanity itself and soon disappeared taking The Black Chapter with him. Sensui waited ten years for a new Underworld Detective to emerge before coming out of hiding and enacting his plan to judge the human race.

After Sensui's death, Itsuki informs Koenma that he can not have Sensui's soul as he did not want to go to the Underworld and takes the body into another dimension. Itsuki is one of Togashi's favorite characters, the author saying after the series ended that he wishes he had been able to expand on the character's twisted psyche.

Raizen immediately falls in love with her, they mate that night and he vows to himself to never eat human flesh until they meet again. However, they never did as she died giving birth. Raizen summons Yusuke to the Demon Plane as he is on the brink of death from starvation and requires someone to take his throne.

He is the one who gave Hiei his Evil Eye, so that he could find the Ice Maiden's country and his Tear of Ice jewel, and taught him basic swordsmanship. Shigure only operates on patients that interest him and takes part of their \\"life existence\\" as payment, which in Hiei's case was that he could never reveal his relation to Yukina. Shigure fights Hiei as part of Mukuro's testing of whether Hiei can qualify to be the right-hand man. He wields the large that looks like a large hula hoop. In the quick battle, they both lose an arm, but Shigure also loses the top half of his head. However, Shigure then appears fully healed in the Demon Plane Unification Tournament as an opponent of Kurama, whom he loses to, and is later seen doing patrol work with Hiei at the end of the series.

The filter places the content of any html, jsp, or other web framework page into a pre-defined template called a decorator.  History SiteMesh was originally developed in 1999 by Joe Walnes. At the time it used Servlet Chains, a feature not part of the standard Servlet specification but supported by some Servlet containers such as Orion Application Server. In 2000, the first public review of version 2.3 of the Servlet Specification was released, which contained the addition of Servlet Filters. These provided a standardized alternatives to Servlet Chains and SiteMesh was adapted to make use of these instead. Shortly after this, the decision was made to release SiteMesh as open source software. Joe Walnes and Mike Cannon-Brookes formed the OpenSymphony project to provide a source of Java EE components - the first two consisting of SiteMesh and OSCache. At this time, SiteMesh had a very small set of users, many of whom got involved in the development of the project.

Edouard remained a major hurricane for eight days, an unusually long amount of time. A Cape Verde hurricane, the storm formed near the coast of Africa in the middle of August. It moved westward then curved northward, and persisted until early September when it became extratropical to the southeast of New England. Edouard was originally forecast to strike the northeast United States, but it produced hurricane-force gusts to portions of southeastern Massachusetts while remaining offshore. The winds caused minor damage totaling $20 million. In addition, the hurricane generated strong waves and rip currents to coastlines, killing two people in Ocean City, MD and causing numerous injuries. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 19, accompanied with spiral bands of convection around an area of low pressure. A large circulation quickly developed once it reached the Atlantic Ocean, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Four late on August 19 while located 345 mi (555 km) southeast of Cape Verde. Initial forecasts predicted for great intensification, including one forecast for the depression to strengthen to a hurricane within three days. However, the depression remained disorganized, and slowly intensified to attain tropical storm status on August 22. After becoming a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened due to the establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145 mph (230 km/h) Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir- Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250 mi (400 km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category 4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear. Hurricane Edouard to the south- southeast of Massachusetts on September 1 Late on August 29, Hurricane Edouard developed three concentric eyewalls, an unusual occurrence coinciding with an increase in strength to 140 mph (220 km/h). A mid-tropospheric trough turned the hurricane to the north to an area of unfavorable conditions, and Edouard weakened to a Category 3 hurricanes on August 31. On September 1, the hurricane passed about midway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, and turned to the north-northeast. Edouard continued to weaken as it turned to the northeast, and on September 2 passed about 95 mi (150 km) to the southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts as an 80 mph (130 km/h) hurricane, its closest point of approach to the United States. Edouard weakened to tropical storm status on September 3, and became extratropical shortly thereafter while located to the south of Nova Scotia. As an extratropical storm, Edouard turned to the east, then moved around the periphery of a larger extratropical storm until becoming absorbed by the storm early on September 7. Preparations A high pressure system over New England resulted in the possibility that Edouard would track to the west and strike the United States. One computer model predicted the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of over 111 mph (178 km/h) on Labor Day. This caused Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist weekend of the year, though an evacuation never occurred. Due to the possibility for a landfall on the East Coast of the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center issued Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches and Warnings from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine at various times. Tropical storm warnings existed from North Carolina to Watch Hill, Rhode Island and from the mouth of the Merrimack River to the United States/Canada border, while hurricane warnings existed from Watch Hill, Rhode Island to Merrimack River, Massachusetts. Hurricane watches were also issued for the tropical storm warning area. In North Carolina, Cape Lookout was closed and evacuated prior to the storm's passage. Because a Hurricane Watch existed for the New York City metropolitan area, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani urged citizens to take preparations. In addition, city officials set up a hurricane helpline, activated the city's Emergency Command Center at the Police Headquarters, and distributed leaflets to flood-prone areas. Near New Bedford, Massachusetts, where landfall was predicted to occur, schools were prepared as shelters in case of a direct hit. New Bedford Mayor issued a state of emergency for the city. However, few people stayed in shelters during the storm's passage. On Cape Cod, thousands of tourists and summer residents evacuated in preparation for the storm, resulting in an 18-mile (29 km) traffic backup. As a result, many beach resorts lost millions in potential revenue. Of those who remained on Cape Cod, 900 stayed in emergency shelters when the storm passed the area. In Boston's Logan International Airport, numerous flights were cancelled or delayed to move planes to safety. Many sailors removed their boats from the water prior to the storm. At one time in Mattapoisett Harbor, workers removed boats at a rate of one every eight minutes. In Maine, the Red Cross opened several emergency shelters, though they were never used. Like in Massachusetts, sailors removed their boats, and due to media coverage, residents were well-prepared for the hurricane. Impact Despite initial predictions, Edouard's effects were much less than expected. Strong waves struck much of the East Coast of the United States, killing 2 and injuring numerous others. In 2011 the National Hurricane Center reported that Edouard had caused a total of US$20 million with the greatest damage occurring on Cape Cod, where moderate wind gusts resulted in $4.6 million (2007 USD). Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic In South Carolina, minor beach erosion was reported in Charleston and Colleton Counties. Swells of up to 15 ft (4.5 m), in combination with strong waves, caused overwash on Route 12 on Hatteras Island. Minor beach erosion occurred. Moderate winds of up to 50 mph (80 km/h) blew down a few trees and caused shingle damage to buildings. In Delaware, rough surf closed numerous coastal beaches, while storm tides and waves flooded a campground near the Indian River in Sussex County. Strong waves in New Jersey killed two people and seriously injured another. Lifeguards made numerous rescues along the coast, while other beaches were closed or had restrictions on bathing. Winds were minor along the Jersey coastline, peaking at less than 30 mph (48 km/h). In New York, Edouard produced strong waves and storm tides of one to two ft (0.3 to 0.6 m), causing overwash along southern Long Island due to high tide. Coastal flooding occurred, including in Hampton Bays where the waves flooded one road and covered another with sand. The flooding trapped six cars, while the strong waves forced several beaches to close. Because the hurricane moved through the New York Shipping Channel, numerous ships reported winds of over hurricane status, though winds remained below tropical storm force on land. A boat capsized off the coast of Jones Beach Island, though its passengers were not injured. A Celebrity Cruises cruise ship, the MV Zenith suffered damage from 30 to 50 ft (nine to 15 m) waves, injuring several passengers and crew members. Rainfall was minimal, peaking at less than a half of an inch in eastern Long Island. New England and Canada Hurricane Edouard passed about 95 miles (150 km/h) southeast of Nantucket while moving at only 12 mph (19 km/h), much slower than previous New England hurricanes. This resulted in several hours of strong waves, winds, and rain. The hurricane produced wave heights of up to 31 feet (9.4 m), which washed twelve boats ashore and damaged numerous others. The strong waves and a storm surge of up to 2.1 feet (.6 m) in Nantucket flooded a few coastal roads. Edouard also produced tropical storm force winds across much of Massachusetts, as well as one hurricane-force gust on Nantucket. In addition, there were unofficial reports of stronger gusts, including 77 mph (124 km/h) on Cape Cod, 80 mph (129 km/h) on Martha's Vineyard, and 90 mph (145 km/h) on Nantucket. The strong winds caused power outages to 2/3 of Nantucket, all of Martha's Vineyard for six hours, and most of Cape Cod for several hours. Power outages, effecting 35,000 to 40,000 were reported throughout Massachusetts, though far from the power outages caused by Hurricane Bob five years prior. The winds also downed numerous trees, and blew off the roof of the fire station in Hyannis. Rainfall was moderate from the slow-moving hurricane, peaking at 6.37 inches (162 mm) in West Dennis with many other locations reporting over 3 inches (76 mm). The rainfall produced minor street flooding. Damage on Cape Cod totaled to $3.5 million (1996 USD, $4.6 million 2007 USD). In New Hampshire, the hurricane produced winds gusts of up to 38 mph (61 km/h) and around 1 inch (25 mm) of rain along the coast. In Maine, heavy surf closed several beaches and injured two people. Waves also damaged several boats. Winds were moderate near the coast, peaking at 47 mph (76 km/h) with gusts to 54 mph (87 km/h) at Mount Desert Island. The winds knocked over several trees and caused sporadic power outages throughout the state, including loss of power for 1,900 Portland residents. In Kittery, water fell through an office building, damaging computer equipment. Rainfall was minor, peaking at 1.23 inches (31.24 mm) in Eastport. In southern Nova Scotia, Edouard produced heavy rainfall from 3.7 to 5.5 inches (95 to 140 mm). Winds were moderate, peaking at 75 mph (120 km/h) in Cape Breton Highlands. The hurricane also caused beach erosion on southeastern Nova Scotia.

The first of her class of landing ship tanks (LST), she was capable of a sustained speed of . Her ability to adjust her draft, accompanied by her unique bow-ramp design, helped bring a new degree of responsiveness to the amphibious fleet. The ship was launched in 1968 entered service with the USN in 1969. Assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet for the entirety of her career, Newport made deployments to the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas. The vessel was taken out of service in 1992 and laid up until 2001 In 2001, the ship was sold to the Mexican Navy and initially renamed ARM Sonora before becoming ARM Rio Papaloapan (or just ARM Papaloapan for short). In Mexican service, the LST has participated in humanitarian missions in the aftermath of the hurricanes Katrina and Sandy and taken part in multi-national naval exercises. Description Newport was the first of her class which were designed to meet the goal put forward by the United States amphibious forces to have a tank landing ship (LST) capable of over . However, the traditional bow door form for LSTs would not be capable. Therefore, the designers of the Newport class came up with a design of a traditional ship hull with a aluminum ramp slung over the bow supported by two derrick arms. The ramp was capable of sustaining loads up to . This made the Newport class the first to depart from the standard LST design that had been developed in early World War II. Newport had a displacement of when light and at full load. The LST was long overall and over the derrick arms which protruded past the bow. The vessel had a beam of , a draft forward of and at the stern at full load. Newport was fitted with six General Motors 16-645-ES diesel engines turning two shafts, three to each shaft. The system was rated at and gave the ship a maximum speed of for short periods and could only sustain for an extended length of time. The LST carried of diesel fuel for a range of at the cruising speed of . The ship was also equipped with a bow thruster to allow for better maneuvering near causeways and to hold position while offshore during the unloading of amphibious vehicles. The Newport class were larger and faster than previous LSTs and were able to transport tanks, heavy vehicles and engineer groups and supplies that were too large for helicopters or smaller landing craft to carry. The LSTs have a ramp forward of the superstructure that connects the lower tank deck with the main deck and a passage large enough to allow access to the parking area amidships. The vessels are also equipped with a stern gate to allow the unloading of amphibious vehicles directly into the water or to unload onto a utility landing craft (LCU) or pier. At either end of the tank deck there is a turntable that permits vehicles to turn around without having to reverse. The Newport class has the capacity for of vehicles, of cargo area and could carry up to 431 troops. The vessels also have davits for four vehicle and personnel landing craft (LCVPs) and could carry four pontoon causeway sections along the sides of the hull. Newport was initially armed with four Mark 33 /50 caliber guns in two twin turrets. The vessel was equipped with two Mk 63 gun control fire systems (GCFS) for the 3-inch guns, but these were removed in 1977‚Äì1978. The ship also had SPS-10 surface search radar. Atop the stern gate, the vessels mounted a helicopter deck. They had a maximum complement of 213 including 11 officers. Construction and career=United States Navy service Newports ship patch The vessel was ordered as part of Fiscal Year 1965 from the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The ship's keel was laid down on 1 November 1966 and the vessel was launched on 3 February 1968, sponsored by Nuella Pell, wife of Rhode Island Senator Claiborne Pell. Newport, named for the city in Rhode Island, was commissioned into the United States Navy on 7 June 1969. Upon entering service, Newport was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet as part of the amphibious force. The vessel was deployed in the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas along with training operations along the United States East Coast. The development of the landing craft air cushion, which allowed the United States Navy to launch over-the- horizon amphibious landings, made the Newport class obsolete. USS Newport was decommissioned on 1 October 1992. Mexican Navy service ARM Papaloapan off the coast of Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina After several years laid up Newport was sold to the Mexican Navy on 18 January 2001 as part of the Security Assistance Program in a cash sale and renamed Sonora (A-04).Naval Vessel Register On 23 May 2001, the vessel joined the Mexican Navy and was renamed ARM Rio Papaloapan or Papaloapan (A 411). The vessel was stricken from the United States Naval Vessel Register on 13 July 2001. In late 2005, ARM Papaloapan brought aid and supplies to Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina hit the state, with her crew taking part in cleanup efforts near Biloxi. In January 2010, she was deployed with 5,000 tons of cargo in a humanitarian mission to Haiti. In November 2012, she was sent to Cuba with supplies to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy after the hurricane caused severe damage to the island. In 2015, Papaloapan participated in the multi-national naval exercise UNITAS. In 2017, the ship took part in the multi-national naval exercise Bold Alligator on the US East Coast. In 2018, the ship took part in another multi- national naval exercise, Panamax 2018, off the coast of the United States.

The broad mission of the Ordnance Corps is to supply Army combat units with weapons and ammunition, including at times their procurement and maintenance. Along with the Quartermaster Corps and Transportation Corps, it forms a critical component of the U.S. Army logistics system. The U.S. Army Ordnance Corps mission is to support the development, production, acquisition, and sustainment of weapon systems, ammunition, missiles, electronics, and ground mobility materiel during peace and war to provide combat power to the U.S. Army. The officer in charge of the branch for doctrine, training, and professional development purposes is the Chief of Ordnance. The current Chief of Ordnance is Brigadier General Michelle M.T. Letcher History=Colonial period to War of Independence During the colonial era in America, each colony was responsible for its own supply of ordnance materiel and its own personnel to supervise it. The first written record of an ordnance officer in British colonial America was Samuel Sharpe in the Massachusetts Bay Colony appointed in 1629 as Master Gunner of Ordnance. By 1645, the Massachusetts Bay Colony had a permanent Surveyor of Ordnance officer. By the time of the American Revolution, every colony had their own ordnance organization responsible for the procurement, distribution, supply, storage, and maintenance of munitions for the colony. In July 1775, Ezekiel Cheever was appointed by General George Washington as Commissary of Artillery Stores, soon to be called Commissary of Military Stores with Major General Henry Knox, the Chief of Artillery. He was the civilian in charge of ordnance support for Washington's army in the field. By the end of the American Revolution, every brigade had ordnance personnel, usually civilian, providing munitions support to the soldiers in the field. In 1776, the Board of War and Ordnance was established to oversee the conduct of the war. This board selected Benjamin Flower to be the Commissary General of Military Stores. Benjamin Flower was given the rank of Colonel and served in that capacity throughout the American Revolution. The Commissary General of Military Stores was an echelon above the Commissary of Military Stores in the field. His responsibility was to recruit and train artificers, establish ordnance facilities, and to distribute arms and ammunition to the army in the field. In 1777, a powder magazine was established at Carlisle, Pennsylvania and a foundry at Springfield, Massachusetts. Ordnance in the early republic In the early years of the 19th century, the ordnance profession played a key role in the burgeoning industrial revolution in America. In 1794, President Washington established the two federal armories; the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts and the Harpers Ferry Armory in Virginia. At these locations, early developments and innovations striving towards interchangeable parts were achieved. Inventors such as Thomas Blanchard, Simeon North, John Hall, and Eli Whitney would perfect the methods and means for mass production. Growing out of the technical innovations of the arms industry, these methods would be widely adopted by American industry by the middle of the 19th century, establishing what has become known as the American system of manufacturing. On 14 May 1812, as part of the preparation for the War of 1812, Congress established the Ordnance Department. It was responsible for arms and ammunition production, acquisition, distribution, and storage or ordnance materiel for the U.S. Army. The act also created a new position, the Commissary General of Ordnance. Colonel Decius Wadsworth, former Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, was chosen as the Commissary General of Ordnance. The act also directed the new Commissary General of Ordnance, soon renamed to Chief of Ordnance, to \\"enlist artisans and laborers to direct the inspection and proof of all cannon and small arms to direct the construction of gun carriages equipments implements and ammunition to make estimates and contracts for and purchases of ordnance supplies and stores and to issue them to the army to exact from armories and arsenals quarterly returns of property and to receive from all responsible officers reports of damages to ordnance materiel to establish ordnance depots to prepare regulations for the government of the Ordnance Department and forms of returns and reports\\". Wadsworth also took great care in establishing and supervising the training of officers who would join the Ordnance Department. Coming from West Point, these officers, such as Alfred Mordecai and George Bomford, were highly trained in mechanical and chemical engineering and were among the highest ranking of graduating cadets from West Point. These new ordnance officers were usually detailed to the Springfield or Harpers Ferry Armory, or to one of the various arsenals across the growing country, to conduct scientific and industrial experiments in metallurgy, chemistry, or one of the allied engineering fields. In 1832, the Ordnance Department established the non-commissioned officer rank of Ordnance Sergeant to be in charge of the ordnance stores at any of the growing number of Army forts and establishments across the country. This rank will remain until the reorganization of the Army under the National Defense Act of 1920. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the Ordnance Department established the Ordnance Rocket and Howitzer Battery to service the then new M1841 12-pound howitzers and Hale war rockets, which had not yet entered Army service and were still being tested. This was the only Ordnance unit established primarily for a combat role. This unit included junior Army officers who would serve as senior leaders in the Civil War; including Jesse Reno and Benjamin Huger.  Civil War and post Civil War  During the war, the Ordnance Department furnished 90 million pounds of lead, 13 million pounds of artillery projectiles, and 26 million pounds of powder for a Union Army of over 1 million soldiers. However, despite the growth of the Army, the Ordnance Department did not grow in a corresponding manner. By the end of the war, it numbered only 64 officers and approximately 600 soldiers, officially. Yet, to support the ordnance needs of the Army, officers and soldiers who had civilian experience in ordnance responsibilities (i.e. blacksmiths, etc ...) were assigned additional duty in their units, so that every unit, company-echelon and above, had someone assigned in ordnance responsibilities. For those few ordnance officers who had been part of the pre-war Army, several of them accepted line positions, such as Major Generals Oliver O. Howard and Jesse Reno. Most, however, remained in the Ordnance Department and rose in rank to serve as ordnance officers at one of the various arsenals or senior ordnance command for the Union Army, i.e. in the Army of the Potomac. About half of the ordnance officers left to join the Confederacy, including its sole Chief of Ordnance during the war, Josiah Gorgas. By 1872, the Ordnance Department reflected the Army's return to a small peacetime status with 50 officers, 475 enlisted soldiers, and 1,738 civilian workers. Despite this constriction, the Ordnance Department continued its tradition of technological innovation and increased professionalism. Ordnance officers, including the Chiefs of Ordnance ‚Äì Stephen Vincent Benet, Daniel Flagler, Adelbert Rinaldo Buffington ‚Äì refined, improved, and even invented new ordnance materiel. Steel breech-loading artillery, machine gun development, smokeless powder, improved gun carriages, officer promotion via examination, and training through apprenticeship at government arsenals and shops characterized the Ordnance Department during the latter 19th century. In 1874, the first dedicated proving ground was established at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Watervliet Arsenal was chosen as the location for the first federal cannon foundry in 1887 and a seacoast cannon shop was added in 1889. World War I Even though World War I had been raging in Europe for nearly three years, the Ordnance Department had to play catch-up when the United States entered the war. With only 97 officers and 1,241 enlisted soldiers, the department had a myriad of problems to overcome. However, by the end of the war, it had solved all these problems, matured as an organization, and adapted to modern, mechanized warfare. It established an embryonic process for echelon-based maintenance for field units, a tradition of ordnance education at one of the officer or enlisted ordnance schools, a new proving ground at Aberdeen, Maryland, and a plan to coordinate production and mobilize industry. By the end of the war, the Ordnance Department numbered 5,954 officers and 62,047 enlisted soldiers, with 22,700 of those officers and soldiers serving in the American Expeditionary Force in France. A safety campaign around ordnance by U.S. Army published during the height of World War II (c. 1942‚Äì1943) by the War Production Board World War II During World War II, the Ordnance Department was responsible for roughly half of all Army procurement, $34 billion. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 'Arsenal of Democracy' depended on the Ordnance Department to become a reality. Ordnance Department strength increased from 334 officers to 24,000 officers, 4,000 enlisted to 325,000 enlisted, and 27,088 civilians to 262,000 civilians. Ordnance soldiers and civilians worked across the globe, in places as diverse as Iceland, Iran, the Pacific Islands, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. Aberdeen Proving Ground expanded exponentially and headquartered The Ordnance School, the Ordnance Replacement Training Center, the new Bomb Disposal School, and the Ordnance Unit Training Center. The ordnance mission in the field operated on a scale never experienced previously by the Ordnance Department. During World War II, the Ordnance Branch gained its third core competency, Bomb Disposal (renamed Explosive Ordnance Disposal after WWII) added to its previous missions of ammunition handling and maintenance. By war's end, there were more than 2,200 ordnance units of approximately 40 types, ranging in size from squads to regiments. Beginning in 1942, with the authorization of the Chief of Ordnance, a computing branch at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering was established as a substation of Aberdeen Proving Ground under the code name \\"Project PX\\". On 15 February 1946, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), the world's first general-purpose electronic computer, was formally dedicated. ENIAC was designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army Ballistic Research Laboratory. The ENIAC's first use was in calculations for the hydrogen bomb. Operation Paperclip scientists of the Ordnance Rocket Center In August 1945, Colonel Holger Toftoy, head of the Rocket Branch of the Research and Development Division of the US Army's Ordnance Department, offered initial one-year contracts to German rocket scientists as part of Operation Paperclip, a program used to recruit the scientists from Nazi Germany for employment by the United States; 127 of them accepted. In September 1945, the first group of seven rocket scientists arrived at Fort Strong, New York and then moving to Fort Bliss, Texas, in January 1946. In 1949, the German scientists were transferred from the White Sands Missile Range Fort Bliss Range Complex to the Redstone Arsenal Ordnance Rocket Center. Post-war era Per the Army Reorganization Act of 1950, the Ordnance Department was renamed the Ordnance Corps.History of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps With the outbreak of the Korean War, the Ordnance Corps largely re- established its successful procedures from World War II. It reactivated the various schools and units at Aberdeen Proving Ground, which had been dis- established following the end of World War II, to serve the Korea effort. It continued its tradition of echeloned-based maintenance and increased the rapidity of maintenance and ammunition supply and repair. Explosive Ordnance Disposal, formerly Bomb Disposal Squads, improved their procedures with a focus on Russian and Chinese ordnance. In Vietnam, the capabilities of Explosive Ordnance Disposal became increasingly important due to the nature of a war with no front lines. EOD and other ordnance units work under the auspices of the 1st Logistical Command, which divided the country into four support zones. Despite the difficult circumstances, the operational readiness rates increased and by 1969 exceeded those of previous wars. From 1962 to 2008 In 1962 the Ordnance Corps and the office of the Chief of Ordnance were disestablished. The Ordnance Branch (along with the Transportation and Quartermaster Branches) was placed under the supervision of the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics. Army Materiel Command assumed responsibility for Ordnance's historical tasks of research and development; procurement, production, and storage; and technical intelligence. Combat Development Command assumed responsibility for developing the Army's organization and doctrine. The Ordnance Center and School trained personnel in ammunition handling, maintenance, and Explosive Ordnance Disposal and was under the direction of Continental Army Command (CONARC). The Ordnance Corps was reestablished on 28 October 1985.U.S. Army Ordnance Corps Crest ‚Äì goordnance.army.mil Post cold war In 2008, the Ordnance Corps consolidated the Ordnance Mechanical Maintenance School from Aberdeen Proving Ground and the United States Army Ordnance Munitions and Electronic Maintenance School from Redstone Arsenal into a single training facility based at Fort Lee, Virginia as a part of the 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) decision. With an entirely new campus dedicated to the training of all ranks of ordnance soldiers and civilians, the Ordnance Corps maintains its commitment to the life-cycle sustainment of the Army's materiel from cradle to grave, providing ammunition, and protecting the Army's forces through EOD operations. Heraldic items and traditions U.S. Ordnance Corps wall plaque U.S. Ordnance Corps insignia badge Branch insignia The Ordnance Corps branch insignia is represented by the \\"shell and flame\\". It is considered to be the oldest branch insignia in the U.S. Army. This symbol has been used since the 17th century by various armies of Western Europe, including British and French forces, and was considered a common symbol used by the military. Ordnance officers began wearing the symbol in 1832 and have been wearing it ever since. There have been a multiplicity of designs throughout the years, but the current design was adopted in 1936. Branch plaque The plaque design has the branch insignia, letters, and rim in gold. The background is crimson. Regimental insignia The regimental insignia for the Ordnance Corps is a gold color metal and enamel device 1 1/8 inches in height overall consisting of two gray antique cannons in saltire on a white disc behind an encircling scroll in the form of a buckle red belt with, between the intersecting cannons and the belt, a black antique bomb, its scarlet flames issuing at the top of the device from behind the belt, which bears the inscription \\"ORDNANCE CORPS U.S.A.\\" in gold letters. It is worn on the right side of the uniform, above any unit citations. The crossed cannons are representative of the Ordnance Corps's early relationship to the Artillery. The flaming bomb, also known as the shell and flame, represents the armament of days gone by, while the energy it connotes is applicable to the weapons of our own day. The cannoneer's belt, which encircles the flaming bomb and crossed cannons, is embossed with the words \\"ORDNANCE CORPS U.S.A.\\" and represents the traditional association between munitions and armament. The white background symbolizes the Ordnance Corps's motto, \\"ARMAMENT FOR PEACE\\". Ordnance soldier's creed > As an Ordnance Soldier of the United States Army, I will utilize every > available talent and means to ensure that superior mobility, firepower, and > communications are advantages enjoyed by the United States Army over its > enemies. As an Ordnance Soldier, I fully understand my duty to perform under > adverse conditions and I will continually strive to perfect my craft. I will > remain flexible so that I can meet any emergency.

Army ordnance song The words and music to Arms for the Love of America were originally composed by Irving Berlin and published by the Army Ordnance Association in 1941. It was dedicated to Major General C.M. Wesson, the Chief of Ordnance from 1938 to 1942. The Ordnance Order of Samuel Sharpe On 26 February 1628 the Court of Assistants in London, England directed that \\"five pieces of ordnance and a great quantity of other arms and great shot\\" belonging to a settlement near modern-day Salem, Massachusetts be placed under the control of Mr. Samuel Sharpe, making him the first European \\"Master Gunner of our Ordnance\\" on the American continent.

It is contrasted with Eastern Yugur, the Mongolic language spoken within the same community. Traditionally, both languages are indicated by the term \\"Yellow Uygur\\", from the endonym of the Yugur. There are approximately 4,600 Turkic-speaking Yugurs. Classification Besides similarities with Uyghuric languages, Western Yugur also shares a number of features, mainly archaisms, with several of the Northeastern Turkic languages, but it is not closer to any one of them in particular. Neither Western nor Eastern Yugur are mutually intelligible with Uyghur. Western Yugur also contains archaisms which are attested in neither modern Uyghuric nor Siberian, such as its anticipating counting system coinciding with Old Uyghur, and its copula dro, which originated from Old Uyghur but substitutes the Uyghur copulative personal suffixes.Chen et al, 1985 Geographic distribution Speakers of Western Yugur reside primarily in the western part of Gansu province's Sunan Yugur Autonomous County. Phonology A special feature in Western Yugur is the occurrence of preaspiration, corresponding to the so-called pharyngealised or low vowels in Tuva and Tofa, and short vowels in Yakut and Turkmen. Examples of this phenomenon include \\"thirty\\", \\"good\\", and \\"meat\\". The vowel harmonical system, typical of Turkic languages, has largely collapsed. Voice as a distinguishing feature in plosives and affricates was replaced by aspiration, as in Chinese. Consonants West Yugur has 28 native consonants and two more (indicated in paretheses) found only in loan words. { class=wikitable style=text- align:center +Consonant phonemes - ! colspan=2 ! Labial !

Diachronical processes Several sound changes affected Western Yugur phonology while evolving from its original Common Turkic form, the most prolific being: =Vowels= * High vowels were delabialized in non-initial syllables: CT *t√ºt√ºn > *t√ºtin > WYu tu ∞t√Øn \\"to smoke\\", CT *altun > *alt√Øn > WYu a ∞lt√Øm \\"gold\\" * CT *u was lowered to WYu o in some words, most commonly around velars and r: CT *burun > WYu p ∞orn \\"before, front\\" * All high vowels were merged - as front vowels in palatal contexts, and as back otherwise: CT *√ºƒç√ºn > WYu ut…ïin \\"with, using\\", CT *y√Ølan > WYu yilan \\"snake\\" ** This had several consequences: **# It made the Common Turkic allophonic difference between *k and *q phonemic. **# Vowel harmonic class of resulting words was thus determined lexically in Western Yugur. **# Former vowel harmonic suffixes with high vowels became invariable: CT: *-Ki/*-K√Ø > WYu -K√Ø \\"attributive noun suffix\\" * Front vowels *√§, *e, *√∂ were raised to *i, *√º except before *r, *l, *≈ã and (excluding *√∂) *g: CT *√§r√§n > WYu erin \\"man\\", CT *k»´k > WYu k√ºk, CT *-lar/*-l√§r > WYu -lar/-lir \\"plural suffix\\" * CT *ay is reflected as WYu ey~e in the initial syllable and as i otherwise. * In the initial syllable exclusively, short vowels acquire pre-aspiration of the following consonant, length distinction is otherwise lost. =Consonants= * As in most Turkic language, initial *b was assimilated to *m in words containing nasals. * Initial plosives and affricates, CT *b, *t, *k, *g, *ƒç, are all reflected as voiceless with unpredictable aspiration: CT *temir > WYu tem√Ør, CT *bog- > WYu p ∞o…£- \\"to tie with a rope\\" * Labials are merged into *w intervocally and after liquids which later in some cases forms diphthongs or get elided: CT *yuba≈° > WYu y√ºwa Ç \\"calm\\", CT *harpa > WYu harwa \\"barley\\" * Finally and in most consonant clusters *p is preserved and *b elided. * Dental and velar voiceless plosives are preserved in most positions, with aspiration occurring almost exclusively in the initial position. * CT *g is spirantized into …£ and CT *d into z. * With some exceptions, CT *≈° develops into s: CT *tƒÅ≈° > WYu tas \\"stone\\" * CT *z is preserved, except for devoicing when final in polysyllabic words: CT *otuz > WYu o ∞t√Øs \\"thirty\\" * CT *ƒç generally becomes WYu ≈° in syllable codas. * CT *√± develops into WYu y; initial CT *y- is mostly preserved; CT *h- is seemingly preserved in some words but the extent to which WYu h- corresponds to it is unclear. Vocabulary Western Yugur is the only Turkic language that preserved the anticipating counting system, known from Old Turkic. For centuries, the Western Yugur language has been in contact with Mongolic languages, Tibetan, and Chinese, and as a result has adopted a large amount of loanwords from these languages, as well as grammatical features. Chinese dialects neighboring the areas where Yugur is spoken have influenced the Yugur language, giving it loanwords. Grammar Personal markers in nouns as well as in verbs were largely lost. In the verbal system, the notion of evidentiality has been grammaticalised, seemingly under the influence of Tibetan. Writing system Grigory Potanin recorded a glossary of Salar language, Western Yugur language, and Eastern Yugur language in his 1893 Russian language book The Tangut-Tibetan Borderlands of China and Central Mongolia.https://web.archive.org/web/20120316172207/http://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/POPPE/poppe_salar.pdfhttp://members.home.nl/marcmarti/yugur/biblio/ROOS_WesternYugurLanguage.pdf History Modern Uyghur and Western Yugur belong to entirely different branches of the Turkic language family, respectively the Karluk languages spoken in the Kara-Khanid KhanateArik 2008, p. 145 (such as the XƒÅkƒÅnƒ´ language described in Mahmud al-Kashgari's Dƒ´wƒÅnu l-Luƒ°at al-Turk) and the Siberian Turkic languages, which include Old Uyghur.Coene 2009, p. 75Coene 2009, p. 75 The Yugur people are descended from the Gansu Uyghur Kingdom.

The winery was sold to a joint venture by Chateau Ste. Michelle of Woodinville, Washington, and Marchesi Antinori Srl of Italy for $185 million in August 2007. It is 50% owned by the tobacco/food conglomerate Altria. History Stainless steel fermenting containers that are part of the Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Warren Winiarski was introduced to wine while on a year-long trip to Italy studying the work of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli. After returning to Chicago, he found an interest in wine and in the early 1960s began to experiment with making his own wine at home. He moved to the Napa Valley with his wife and children in 1968, and took up a job with Chateau Souverain. Following this, he moved to work at the newly started Robert Mondavi Winery. Stag's Leap Wine Cellars was founded in 1970 after Winiarski purchased a block of land for under $200,000 that was situated next to the vineyard owned by modern Napa Valley Cabernet winegrowing pioneer Nathan Fay. Winiarski decided on purchasing land in the region after tasting a homemade wine from Nathan Fay's vineyard, after tasting the wine Winarski stated \\"I said to myself, Eureka! That‚Äôs it. This wine satisfied what I hoped was possible in the Napa Valley. It had not only regional character but also elements of classic or universal character.\\" The purchased plot was planted to prune trees, cherries and walnuts as well as a small amount of Petite Sirah and Alicante Bouschet, these were replaced with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot vines and the vineyard was renamed to \\"Stag's Leap Vineyard\\" or \\"S.L.V\\". The first vintage produced from the new vineyard was in 1972 and was produced in a rented facility. Winiarski was in charge of making the wine, with assistance from Andre Tchelistcheff. The second vintage‚Äîthe first that was produced at the estate and in commercial quantities‚Äî was from 1973. This '73 vintage was entered into and subsequently rated the top red wine at the now historic Judgment of Paris in 1976, launching the winery into the international spotlight. Following this achievement, the winery began to expand its land holdings, purchasing the neighboring \\"Fay\\" Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard in 1986, which nearly doubled the vineyard size owned by the estate, and a Chardonnay vineyard named \\"Arcadia\\" from Mike Grgich in 1996. Grgich was the winemaker at Chateau Montelena in the early 1970s and he produced the counterpart winning Californian Chardonnay at the 1976 Judgment of Paris. A lawsuit initiated by Winiarski and a counter-suit filed by Carl Doumani, owner of Stags' Leap Winery, was decided in 1986 by the California Supreme Court. The two wineries were founded in the same year, and both claimed first use of the name \\"Stag's Leap\\". The court decided that the wineries were named after the area, so both were allowed to use the name. The judgment included a provision that Winiarski would keep the apostrophe before the s in his winery name, where Doumani would use the apostrophe after the s. Winiarski and Doumani became friendly after the lawsuit was concluded, releasing a 1985 vintage Cabernet Sauvignon with an equal percentage of grapes from each estate and named \\"Accord\\". They also worked together in an attempt to stop the Stags Leap American Viticultural Area from being created, but they were unsuccessful and the AVA was ratified as a sub-region of the Napa Valley AVA in 1989. In August 2007, Winiarski sold the winery to Chateau Ste. Michelle and Marchesi Antinori Srl for a reported value of 185 million US dollars. The sale included the winery facilities, as well as the SLV and Fay vineyards. The Arcadia vineyard was kept by the Winiarski family and will continue to provide fruit to the winery on a contract basis. Winiarski, 79 at the time of the sale, was looking to retire and his family members were not in a position to continue running the business. Winiarski agreed to continue as a part-time advisor for three years following the sale. Judgment of Paris and subsequent competitions The winery achieved significant international recognition in 1976, four years after its establishment, at the Judgment of Paris where its 1973 vintage Cabernet Sauvignon won first place among ten top French and California red wines in a blind taste test by leading French wine experts. The French wines tasted were prestigious first and second growths wines from the 1970 and 1971 vintage from Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion, Ch√¢teau Mouton-Rothschild, Ch√¢teau Leoville Las Cases and Ch√¢teau Montrose. The result of the tasting has been described by Decanter as \\"a victory that put California on the winemaking map, and established Stag‚Äôs Leap Wine Cellars as a global superstar\\", and by Paul Lukacs as \\"most important, it enabled not only the United States but also Australia, South America, and the rest of the New World to emerge as legitimate sources of increasingly superior wines.\\" A bottle of 1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon was placed into the Smithsonian National Museum of American History collection in 1996 as a result of placing first in this competition and to reflect the impact that the achievement had on the United States wine industry. The bottle was also included in the book, The Smithsonian‚Äôs History of America in 101 Objects, by Richard Kurin, the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs Under Secretary for History, Art, and Culture. Other items chosen from among the collections for this historic list included Neil Armstrong‚Äôs space suit, Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs top hat, Charles Lindbergh‚Äôs Spirit of St. Louis, and Lewis & Clark‚Äôs compass.‚Äù The San Francisco Wine Tasting of 1978 was a re-tasting of the same wines 20 months after the Paris event. Stag's Leap again won first place with a different set of judges.http://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/shawg/courses/196B/readings/jop_the_buzz.pdf At the French Culinary Institute Wine Tasting of 1986, held ten years after Paris, Stag's Leap received sixth place, and in the Wine Spectator Wine Tasting of 1986 it won fourth place. In 'The Judgment of Paris' 30th Anniversary tasting with the same wines and vintages tasted at the original Judgment of Paris competition, Stag's Leap achieved second place. Vineyards Vineyards at Stag's Leap in 1990 The \\"S.L.V\\" (Stag's Leap Vineyard) was the initial vineyard owned by the estate. It consists of of Cabernet Sauvignon and of Merlot. This vineyard was the source of the grapes that produced the wine that won the 1976 Judgment of Paris. The \\"Fay\\" vineyard was purchased in 1986. This was the vineyard that originally inspired Winiarski to make wine in this area. It is the oldest Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard in the area and consists of of Cabernet Sauvignon and of Petit Verdot. Arcadia is a vineyard near Mount George in the Napa Valley. The vineyard was purchased in 1996 from Mike Grgich. It was retained by the Winiarski family after the sale of the estate in 2007. It still provides grapes for the estate on a contract basis. Wines Bottles of Stag's Leap Cask 23 Cabernet Sauvignon The flagship red wine is named \\"Cask 23\\" and this is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon fruit from the SLV and Fay vineyards. The first vintage of this wine was produced in 1974, after Winiarski noticed that a specific cask, numbered 23, stood out from the other casks produced that year. It is not produced every vintage, but only in years that are viewed by the winemaking team as producing excellent quality fruit. Other wines in the top level \\"Estate & Single-Vineyard Collection\\" include two Cabernet Sauvignon single vineyard wines, from the \\"S.L.V\\" and \\"Fay\\" vineyards, as well as a Chardonnay from the \\"Arcadia\\" vineyard. Stag's Leap Wine Cellars produces a mid-level range under the designation \\"Napa Valley Collection\\". These wines are made from estate owned vineyards as well as purchased grapes from other vineyards in the Napa Valley. Wines in this range include a \\"Artemis\\" Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, \\"Karia\\" Chardonnay and a Sauvignon blanc. A range of second wines are produced at a lower price point, under the brand name \\"Hawk Crest\\". This label was started in 1974.

Francisco de Salinas (1513, Burgos ‚Äì 1590, Salamanca) was a Spanish music theorist and organist, noted as among the first to describe meantone temperament in mathematically precise terms, and one of the first (along with Guillaume Costeley) to describe, in effect, 19 equal temperament. In his De musica libri septem of 1577 he discusses 1/3-, 1/4- and 2/7-comma meantone tunings. Of 1/3-comma meantone, which is essentially identical to the meantone of 19-et, he remarks that it is \\"languid\\" but not \\"offensive to the ear\\", and he notes that a keyboard of 19 tones to the octave suffices to give a circulating version of meantone. The 19th-century musicologist Alexander John Ellis maintained that Salinas really meant to characterize 1/6-comma meantone, and made a mistake due to his blindness. Others point out that Salinas's descriptions of his tuning as \\"languid\\" but not \\"offensive to the ear\\" seem to apply to 1/3-comma meantone, not to 1/6-comma meantone, which in any case has a much sharper fifth than musicians of Salinas's own time preferred. Salinas was also interested in just intonation, and advocated a 5-limit just intonation scale of 24 notes he called instrumentum perfectum. Blind from the age of eleven, Salinas served as organist to the celebrated Duke of Alba, and afterwards (starting in 1567) as professor of music at the University of Salamanca. His own compositions for organ have been lost. The poet Fray Luis de Leon admired Salinas greatly, knew him personally, and wrote an ode in homage to the musician.

He is best known as the former drummer for Soundgarden during the mid-1980s. Soundgarden In 1985, Soundgarden was a recently formed three-piece band with Chris Cornell on vocals and drums, Kim Thayil on guitar, and Hiro Yamamoto on bass guitar. The band enlisted Sundquist as their drummer so Cornell could focus on the vocals. They traveled around playing various gigs with this lineup for about a year. They then recorded three songs for a C/Z Records compilation album of grunge music by Soundgarden and five other bands, which was called Deep Six and was released in March 1986. This album contains the only recorded Soundgarden material with Sundquist. In 1986, Sundquist, who by that point had a wife and a child, backed out of the band and pursued a normal family life. They were briefly left without a drummer until they were able to lure Skin Yard drummer Matt Cameron away from his band. Cameron stayed with Soundgarden until the entire band broke up in 1997 and rejoined the band in 2010 when they reunited.

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 2001 NFL Draft. He played college football at Mississippi. Burgess also played for the Oakland Raiders and New England Patriots. During his years in Oakland, he was selected to the Pro Bowl twice, and in 2005 led the NFL in sacks with 16. Early years Burgess attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, Maryland, where he played football and basketball. As a senior, Burgess recorded 102 tackles and four sacks and was an all-state selection at outside linebacker. College career After graduating from high school, Burgess attended the University of Mississippi, where he led his team as a senior in 2000 with 9.5 sacks. He was also named to the first-team All-SEC that season. Professional career=First stint with Eagles Burgess was drafted in the third round (63rd overall) by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2001 NFL Draft. He appeared in all 16 games as a rookie and had six sacks. In 2002, however, he broke his foot in the first game of the season and missed the rest of the year. He then missed all of 2003 due to a torn Achilles tendon. He returned healthy in 2004 and started 12 regular season games for the Eagles, recording 2.5 sacks. He had more success in the postseason, where he recorded three quarterback sacks, including the Eagles' only sack in Super Bowl XXXIX against the New England Patriots. Oakland Raiders Burgess was signed by the Oakland Raiders prior to the 2005 season, and was originally slated to be a backup. By the middle of the season, he worked his way into the lineup thanks to his success as a pass rusher; most notably, he had six quarterback sacks over a three-game span. He became particularly successful at the end of the season and recorded nine over the final seven games of the year; the last sack would break Sean Jones' team record for sacks in a single season. His 16 sacks overall led the NFL and earned him his first Pro Bowl bid. Burgess finished the 2006 season with 11 sacks and earned a second Pro Bowl bid. Even though Burgess dealt with a nagging calf injury all year, he finished 2007 with eight sacks and 40 tackles. On December 23, 2007, Burgess and teammate Warren Sapp were involved in an altercation with NFL referees near the end of the second quarter of the Raiders' game at Jacksonville. The incident began when linesman Jerry Bergman mistakenly assumed that the Raiders wished to decline a Jacksonville ten-yard penalty. Sapp, the defensive captain, began speaking with referee Jerome Boger, indicating that the Raiders instead wished to accept the penalty. The conversation became heated, with Sapp gesturing and swearing. This resulted in an unsportsmanlike conduct call by Boger against Sapp. Sapp and his defensive teammates continued interacting with the officials after the penalty was called, resulting in a second unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against Sapp and another unsportsmanlike conduct penalty assessed against Burgess. Finally, the coaches and officiating staff entered the field and began physically separating and removing the arguing players. Boger claimed that during this time Sapp \\"bumped\\" him; Sapp denies making physical contact. Regardless, at this point Boger levied a third unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against Sapp and ejected him from the game. Sapp did not play in the second half and was eventually fined $75,000 by the NFL; Burgess received a $25,000 fine. Burgess played in and started 10 games for the Raiders in 2008, recording 3.5 sacks. Entering the final year of his contract, Burgess failed to report to the team's training camp in August 2009 and was placed on the \\"did not report\\" list. He was traded to the New England Patriots on August 6. New England Patriots On August 6, 2009, the Patriots traded their original third- and fourth-round selections in the 2010 NFL Draft to the Raiders in exchange for Burgess. The trade was made on the condition that, because the Patriots had already traded their fifth-round selection, the fourth-round selection sent to Oakland would become a fifth- round selection once the Patriots re-acquired one. Later that month, the Patriots traded defensive lineman Le Kevin Smith to the Denver Broncos along with a seventh-round pick (acquired from the Philadelphia Eagles) to the Denver Broncos in exchange for the Broncos' fifth-round pick, which was sent to Oakland for the Patriots' original fourth-round pick. Burgess played in all 16 games for the Patriots in 2009, starting six. He finished the season with 35 tackles and five sacks. He became an unrestricted free agent following the season and was re-signed by the Patriots on May 14, 2010. However, Burgess did not report to Patriots training camp, and was placed on the Reserve/Did Not Report list on July 29, 2010. He was reinstated to the active roster on August 13, the day after the Patriots' first preseason game. He was released during final cuts on September 4, 2010. Second stint with Eagles Burgess was re-signed to a two-year contract by the Philadelphia Eagles on December 14, 2010. He played in a week 16 game against the Minnesota Vikings on December 28. He was released on December 30.

Mihintale is a mountain peak near Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka. It is believed by Sri Lankans to be the site of a meeting between the Buddhist monk Mahinda and King Devanampiyatissa which inaugurated the presence of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. It is now a pilgrimage site, and the site of several religious monuments and abandoned structures.  History  Approximately east of Anuradhapura, close to the Anuradhapura - Trincomalee Road is situated the \\"Missaka Pabbata\\" which is in height and is one of the peaks of a mountainous range. According to Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa, Thera Mahinda came to Sri Lanka from India on the full moon day of the month of Poson (June) and met King Devanampiyatissa and preached the Buddhist doctrine. The traditional spot where this meeting took place is revered by the Buddhists of Sri Lanka. Therefore, in the month of Poson, Buddhists make their pilgrimage to Anuradhapura and Mihintale. Mahinda was the son of Emperor Ashoka of India. King Ashoka embraced Buddhism after he was inspired by a monk named ‚ÄúNigrodha.‚Äù The King was in great misery after witnessing the devastation caused by expansionist wars. Meeting this peaceful young monk was a turning point in his life, thereafter, he renounced war. He was determined to spread the message of peace. As a result, both his son and daughter were ordained as Buddhist monastics, and became enlightened Arahats. In his quest to spread the message of peace instead of war, Ashoka sent his son Mahinda, to the island of Lanka, which was also known as ‚ÄúSinhal√©‚Äù. This island was ruled by his friend King Devanampiyatissa. Thus, ‚ÄúMahinda‚Äù was the Indian name, which in Sinhal√©, became ‚ÄúMihindu.‚Äù In Sinhala Mihin-Thal√© literally means the ‚Äúplateau of Mihindu‚Äù. This plateau is on top of a hill from where Arahat Mihindu was supposed to have called King Devanampiyatissa, by the King's name to stop him shooting a deer. Hence, ‚ÄúMihin Thal√©‚Äù is a specifically Sinhala term. From ancient times, large steps were constructed to climb Mihintale. It is stated that King Devanampiyatissa constructed a vihara and 68 caves for the bhikkhus to reside in. At Mihintale there gradually grew a number of Buddhist monasteries or viharas with all the dependent buildings characteristic of the monasteries of that period.  Description = The Hospital  A view toward entrance from top. At the foot of the mountain are the ruins of a hospital, medical bath (or stone canoe in which patients were immersed in medicinal oil) a stone inscription and urns belonging to the ancient period have been unearthed. Between the hospital and the steps leading to the rock are the ruins of a large monastery. On the floors of the square building which is on one side, are beautiful carvings and also are stone balustrades and guard stones. As this side is precipitous, the steps are on the eastern side of the slope, spacious and in 4 sections. The stairway has 1840 steps made of granite, leading to the summit. At the end of the first set of steps on the right side of the plain, is a small mountain peak. On this is situated the most famous Kantaka Cetiya. Heinz E M√ºller-Dietz (Historia Hospitalium 1975) describes Mihintale Hospital as being perhaps the oldest in the world.  Kantaka Cetiya  Kantaka Cetiya Vaahalkada. Kantaka Cetiya is a circular stupa having a base circumference of about 425 feet. It has three stepped rims. It has four frontispieces in the four cardinal directions. The frontispiece is called Vaahalkada. All the Vaahalkadas are decorated with sculptures of dwarfs, animals, human, divine figures and floral motifs. One of the most important of the sculptures on the Kantaka Cethiya Vaahalkada is the elephant headed God with two arms. The Saivites call it Ganapati or Ganeesaa. The Ganapati sculptures in the Vaahalkadas of the Kantaka Cetiya have created confusion among the archaeologists and historians. No one could not explain the connection between Ganapati God and Buddhism. Thus, the Sinhalese historians and archaeologists have tried to give some imaginary interpretation. The four vahaalkadas facing the four cardinal points have different animals on the top of the square pillars - the elephant on the east, the lion on the north, the horse on the west and the bull on the south. Most of the Indian and Sri Lankan archaeologists believe that there is a symbolic relationship between these animals and the four cardinal directions. But, they differ in associating a particular animal with a particular direction. However, in a moonstone of Sri Lanka and the Lion Capital of Saranath, we find these four animals sculptured in the moving position. At the same time, in the coins collected in the Northern mainland of Sri Lanka, Jaffna peninsula and Akurugoda of Rununa, we find the following symbols marked on them: 1\\\\. the Lion on one side, and a group of four dots placed in the form of a square at the centre of a circle on the other side; 2. the Horse on one side and a group of four dots placed in the form of a square at the centre of a circle on the other side; 3. the Bull on one side and a group of four dots placed in the form of a square at the centre of a circle on the other side. Also in the Northern and southern Sri Lanka, coins having a bull on one side and an elephant on the other side have been discovered. In India coins with a bull on one side and a lion on the other side have been discovered. Therefore, the animals lion, horse and bull are associated with the very same group of four things. Therefore, the animals lion, horse and bull must symbolize a human who is associated with a group of four things. Thus, one could come to the conclusion that the four animals lion, horse, elephant and bull symbolize Lord Buddha who is associated with the Four Noble Truths. Further study on coins, sculptures etc. will confirm this conclusion. The Sinhalese archaeologists and historians say that King Suratissa have built this Stupa. The Pesavalalu and the frontispiece have been preserved to a great extent. There are ruins of the stupa which are in height. The monks would have resided in the caves close to the stupa. As this stupa was renovated by King Lajjitissa. There is no doubt that this belongs to the 1st century B.C.  The Refectory  The Refectory. The Courtyard is situated at the end of the third flight of steps. To the left of the courtyard is the refectory. The quadrangle is in length and in breadth and is surrounded by the storeroom. Since a part of a pipe line has been discovered here, it can be concluded that a systematic and well planned pipe borne scheme was provided. Two stone troughs can be seen here, which would have been used to store food close to the refectory. Mihintale Slab Inscriptions. On either side of the entrance to a building, are 2 inscriptions engraved on 2 large slabs of granite known as the Mihintale stone inscriptions. The rules and regulations pertaining to the administrative purposes of the monastery are engraved on these 2 stone slabs. This inscription installed by King Mihindu (956 - 976 AD) contains records of payments made to the service staff. In the vicinity on another plain is the meeting hall of the monks. Here the monks met, to discuss the Dhamma and the Vinaya. This is an open building which is square and was constructed on 48 stone pillars. In the middle of the hall is a platform with 4 entrances. To the East of the refectory is a stupa, in circumference. It has not been identified so far.  Ambasthala Dagaba  Ambasthala Dagaba, a small stupa surrounded with stone pillars. Is situated on the plain close to the peak of the mountain, and is said to have been built by King Makalantissa. The ruins show that there has been a house built encircling the stupa. The Dagaba itself is said to enshrine the relics of the great Apostle Mahinda. It is here that King Devanampiyatissa first met Arahant Mahinda. The traditional spot where this meeting took place is marked by the Ambasthala Dagaba.  The Cave of Arahat Mahinda  When proceeding from Ambastala dagaba along the narrow road, on the slope is the cave known as Mihindu Guhawa or the cave of Arahant Mahinda, where he resided. Out of the caves the most famous and incidentally the most sacred to Buddhists is this cave with its flattened slab on which Thera Mahinda was accustomed to rest.  Maha Stupa  Maha Stupa. Buddha Statue at Mihintale, Sri Lanka This large stupa known as the Maha Seya is on the summit of the Mihintale hill, built by King Mahadathika Mahanaga (7-19 AD) the base of which is in diameter. The stupa which was in a dilapidated condition was completely restored.  Aradhana Gala  Aradhana Gala, where the Arahath Mahinda landed. Which faces Maha Seya is on a summit of a hill. Even during very windy weather pilgrims do not fail to visit this rock, which has iron railings to help them to climb. In the ancient books such as the Mahavamsa it is written that Mahinda came to Sri Lanka by travelling through the air. He came down and landed on the top of the Aradhana Gala where he met King Devanampiyatissa for the first time.  Kaludiya Pokuna  Kaludiya pokuna. Is one of the famous ponds at Mihintale. The word \\"Kalu\\" means black. The word \\"diya\\" means water, and the word \\"pokuna\\" means pond. The name is derived from the fact that the water in the pond appears to be black in colour. It is believed that on new moon day Kalu Buddha Rakkhita Thera sat under the Thimbiriya tree, close to the Kaludiya Pokuna, and preached a sermon based on the Kalakarama Sutta. Naga Pokuna Naga Pokuna, means \\"Serpent Pond.\\" Its name is derived from the figures of snakes with their hoods spread out in the background; it is one of the most famous ponds at the site. Passing Ambasthalaya on the western side is a flight of steps. When descending the steps the Naga Pokuna is visible. Mahavansa mentions a pond named Nagacatuska connected with the information regarding the arrival of Thera Mahinda in Sri Lanka. Also the chronicle records much later that king Aggabodhi I (575-608 AD) built a pond named Nagasondi. From this information it may be assumed that the natural pond, known as Nagacatusca, was converted to a man made pond by King Aggabodhi. Filled by rain water, this pond supplies water to the Lion Pond, Alms Hall and for the daily needs of the Mihintala monks. Singha Pokuna Singha Pokuna, means \\"Lion Pond,\\" the name was derived from the image of the rampant lion. Water was collected here for the use of bikkhus (monks). Water is supplied from the Naga Pokuna through a tunnel. Buddha Statue To the side of the Ambasthala Dagoba is a flight of rock-carved steps leading to a large white Buddha statue.https://www.lonelyplanet.com/sri- lanka/attractions/buddha-statue/a/poi-sig/1460366/357442  See also  * Buddhism * Mahawamsa * Anuradhapura References External links  * This page incorporates content from Dr. Rohan Hettiarachchi's Lanka Library. * Mihintale: The cradle of Buddhism in Sri Lanka * Lesser known sacred sites of Mihintale * Photos of Mihintale Category:Buddhism in Sri Lanka Category:Landforms of Anuradhapura District Category:Mountains of Sri Lanka Category:Tourist attractions in North Central Province, Sri Lanka Category:Archaeological protected monuments in Anuradhapura District ","title":"Mihintale"},{"id":"3589178","text":"Drogo (17 June 801 ‚Äì 8 December 855), also known as Dreux or Drogon, was an illegitimate son of Frankish emperor Charlemagne by the concubine Regina. Early life and family Drogo was born on 17 June 801 at Aachen, Gaul (Aix- La-Chappelle). The Annales Weissemburgenses record Drogo‚Äôs birth as \\"802 aut 803 15 Kal Iul\\". Aachen was the winter palace of the Carolingian empire located in the north-east section of Gaul, close to the Saxon lands. This area is now in Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany. Einhard names \\"Drogonem et Hugum\\" as sons of Charlemagne by his concubine \\"Reginam\\". Drogo‚Äôs mother, Regina, was one of four concubines taken by Charlemagne in 800 after the death of his Alemannian wife who had borne him no children. Drogo had many half-brothers and sisters (through his father, Charlemagne) but only one full brother, Hugh (802‚Äì844), who was the younger. He and his brother Hugh, and their half- brother Thierry, were brought up in the palace of their half-brother Louis the Pious (Emperor Louis I) after their father died. In the collection of Einhard‚Äôs Charters, there is one written in 815 by Louis the Pious in which he grants a village (Mulinheim, later Seligenstadt) situated on the banks of the Main River to Einhard and his wife. This property was once owned by a Count Drogo. This person could possibly be identified as Charlemagne's son Drogo, although he was only 14 years old in 815. Drogo's brother, Hugh, was ordained and served as the abbot of Charroux, St-Quentin, Lobbes, St-Bertin and Noaille. He later served as archchancellor to Louis the Pious from 834 to 840 and became archchaplain to Charles the Bald (son of Louis the Pious) in 841 after the battle of Fontenoy. Hugh was killed in battle at Angoul√™me in June 844. The Annales Fuldenses record that \\"Hugo abbas, patruus Karoli et Rihboto abbas, Rhaban quoque signifer\\" was killed \\"844 VII Id Jun\\" in the battle in which \\"Pippini duces\\" (Pippin's generals) defeated the army of Charles the Bald, King of the Franks. As one of the few children to outlive his father, Drogo's prospects for political power were very favourable. Only one older son of Charlemagne remained, and was eager to ensure his few opponents were placated. Career Drogo sacramentary Forced out of the royal court when Louis the Pious became Emperor in 814, Drogo and Hugh were forcibly tonsured and \\"put under free custody into monasteries\\". Drogo became a cleric in 818 and abbot of Luxeuil in 820. In 822, as a deeply religious man, Louis performed penance (for causing the death of Bernard of Italy and other issues), at his palace of Attigny near Vouziers in the Ardennes, before Pope Paschal I, and a council of ecclesiastics and nobles of the realm that had been convened for the reconciliation of Louis with his three sons. Also in attendance were his three younger half-brothers, Drogo, whom he soon installed as Bishop of Metz in 823 (the previous bishop was Gondulphus of Metz, 819 to 822), Hugo, who he soon made Abbot of St-Quentin, and Theodoric. Drogo became less significant at court and as a court figure by 829 ‚Äì he had no formal position and did not become a player again until the 830s. Throughout the 830s Louis the Pious was busy with the rebellions of his sons and assorted counts, dukes, abbots, bishops and archbishops. This was a period when loyalty and oaths were of paramount importance so it is probable that Drogo‚Äôs loyalty to Louis the Pious would have been greatly appreciated. Louis was re-installed as Emperor at Metz in 835 after his temporary deposition in 833‚Äì834. Drogo wielded much influence in the last years of Louis the Pious‚Äô reign. According to the Astronomer, Drogo was Louis the Pious‚Äô daily confessor. It was Drogo who finally persuaded Louis to forgive his rebellious sons. Drogo became Archbishop of Metz in 844 and remained in this position for the duration of his life. Drogo was also the most prominent figure at Louis the Pious‚Äô deathbed. On his deathbed, Louis asked Drogo to send the royal regalia (crown and sword) to his son Lothar thus indicating the transfer of power. Drogo took charge of his remains and had them transported from the island in the Rhine where he died. The Annales Fuldenses record that \\"Druogonem archicapellum et Adalbertum comitem\\" (Arch-chaplain Drogo and Count Adalbert) were sent to the east bank of the Rhine in 840 to take the body to Metz where Drogo presided over the funeral rites. The Sepulchre of Louis the Pious in St. Arnulf in Metz has often been considered as representative of the family tradition. Arnulf of Metz, mayor of the palace in Austrasia, is supposed to be the progenitor of the Carolingians (Arnulflings). But in fact, Saint-Arnulf of Metz was primarily a burial place for the women of the Carolingian family. Before or after Louis the Pious, no Carolingian king was buried there. One could instead see this sepulchre as a sign of archbishop Drogo's ambition of elevating his city of Metz by making it the cradle of the Carolingian family. In all probability he wished to establish Saint- Arnoul, whose patron saint was a family ancestor, as the royal mausoleum of the Carolingians (see K.U. Jaschke, Die Karolingergenealogien aus Metz, in list of sources). In 844, when Sergius was elected Pope Sergius II, Emperor Lothar sent his son Louis to Rome accompanied by Drogo who had recently been raised from bishop to archbishop of Metz. Sergius appointed Drogo his Vicar apostolic for the Frankish lands of France and Germany. Drogo also served as Vicar to Pope Leo IV and Benedict III in France. In October 844, the three sons of Louis the Pious (brothers Lothar, Louis the German and Charles the Bald) met at Thionville to attempt to unite the three portions of the kingdom in peace. Drogo presided over the assembly and offered his support to Lothar. His control over the assembly came to nothing as the attempt was referred for future action and eventually Drogo ceased to preside. Drogo supported Louis the Pious in 839-40 during the Third Civil War between Louis and his sons. Once Louis died, he supported Lothar then changed sides to support Charles in 841, then changed back to support Lothar. Drogo remained extremely loyal to his half-brother Louis the Pious and amassed great power under him. Drogo was also one of the greatest patrons of the arts in the 9th century. His influence began to wane after Louis' death, and his influence fell even more after the death of his only full brother, Hugh, in 844. Still, he managed to ensure the production of the Drogo Sacramentary, which is named for him. The Drogo Sacramentary was written and painted around 845‚Äì855 for his personal use, as Bishop of Metz. The manuscript, which is on vellum, is the work of several artists employed by the imperial court. The sacramentary would have been used in Metz‚Äôs Carolingian cathedral and constitutes a precious record of the liturgical practices of the time and the accoutrements used in the liturgy. This manuscript is one of the monuments of Carolingian book illumination and contains all the prayers which would have been spoken by Drogo, as the officiating priest, during the course of the year. It has become a monument to his name and one of the treasures of the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France. Metz was an important bishopric: Charles the Bald was crowned in the Basilica, and both Drogo and Louis the Pious are buried there. In 843 Metz became the capital of the kingdom of Lotharingia, and several diets and councils were held there. Drogo's position enabled him to be one of the great patrons of 9th-century arts. He embellished his cathedral in Metz with works which rank among the highlights of Carolingian art in beauty and preciousness. In 852 he translated the relics of St. Celeste of Metz (see Clement of Metz) at Marmoutier, together with those of Saint Author (see Abb√© Petin, Dictionnaire hagiographique in list of sources). There is a particularly interesting entry in the Annales Bertiniani: anno 839 \\"Dominicae nativitatis festum hilariter, a Drogone fratre suo et Metensis urbis episcopo decentissime susceptus, in eadem civitate caelebravit\\". [\\"He (Louis the Pious) joyfully celebrated Christmas at Metz, where he had been received handsomely by his brother Drogo, the bishop of that city.\\"] Death Drogo died on 8 December 855 after falling into the River Oignon, at Himeriacum, Bourgogne, while fishing. He is interred at the Abbey Church of St. Arnulf in Metz. A list of bishops of Metz records \\"domnus Drogo archiepiscopus et sacri palate summus capellanus, filius Karoli imperatoris\\" (Drogo lord archbishop and sacred palace chief chaplain, son of Emperor Charles) as 40th bishop, holding the position for 32 years, 5 months and 7 days. After his death, he was succeeded as bishop of Metz by Adventius (858 to 875).

Discovery and naming Between 1946 and 1949, Soviet-Mongolian expeditions uncovered fossils at Shiregin Gashun. In 1952, Soviet palaeontologist Evgenii Aleksandrovich Maleev named some ankylosaurian bone fragments as a new species of Syrmosaurus: Syrmosaurus disparoserratus. The specific name refers to the unequal serrations on the teeth.Maleev E.A., 1952, \\"–ù–æ–≤—ã–π –∞–Ω“õ–∏–ª–æ—Å–∞–≤—Ä –∏–∑ –≤–µ—Ä–Ω–µ–≥–æ –º–µ–ª–∞ –ú–æ–Ω–≥–æ–ª–∏–∏\\", Doklady Akademii Nauk, SSSR 87: 273-276 The holotype, PIN 554/I, was found in a layer of the Bayan Shireh Formation dating from the Cenomanian-Santonian.

Referred was specimen PIN 554/2-1, the rear of the skull of another individual. In 1977, Teresa Marya≈Ñska noted a similarity with another Mongolian ankylosaur, Talarurus, in that both taxa have separate openings for the ninth to twelfth cerebral nerve; she therefore renamed the species as Talarurus disparoserratus.T.

She concluded that Maleevus was a nomen dubium.Arbour, Victoria Megan, 2014, Systematics, evolution, and biogeography of the ankylosaurid dinosaurs.

History Veilside Fortune Mazda RX-7 Based in Japan near the Tsukuba Circuit race course, the company first started its business in 1990. It initially focused on performance tuning, and at the 1991 Tokyo Auto Salon VeilSide took the Grand Prize in the Tuned Car category. Hirano was influenced by the 1960s Batmobile and made his designs along those lines. In 1994, the Supra Combat design was released which earned the Grand prize at the Tokyo Auto Salon in the Complete Car category. Honda NSX with a Veilside body kit In July 1995, VeilSide received the Ministry of Transportation's authorization for the production, distribution, and selling of a range of aero parts. Following this acceptance, VeilSide began to produce a full range of products. Their aerodynamic parts catalogue was originally intended for Japanese models, such as the Toyota Supra, Mazda RX-7, Subaru Impreza, and Mitsubishi FTO although they have since extended their portfolio to include American and European models. VeilSide produces a bodykit called \\"Fortune\\" which replaces all body panels except the roof. It is currently available for the Mazda RX-7 FD3S, Toyota Supra Mark IV, Acura NSX, Toyota MR-S, and the Nissan Skyline V35/V36. The Fortune kit ranges from $4,500 USD for the MRS to $15,000 for the RX-7. The Fortune kit also turns Nissan Skylines into Infiniti G models. VeilSide manufactures aerodynamic wing mirrors and GT-style wing spoilers and also its own line of clothing.

Arai (March 29, 1915 ‚Äì May 25, 1959) was a Mexican architect, theorist and writer, of Japanese descent. Born in Mexico City, the fourth son of a Japanese ambassador in Mexico, Kinta Arai, Alberto T. Arai studied also philosophy, espousing neo-Kantianism and becoming politically a socialist artist. He became a supporter of Functionalism, with its emphasis on the social applications of architecture, and was also a founder, with Enrique Ya√±ez, of the Uni√≥n de Arquitectos Socialistas (1938), helping to draw up a socialist theory of architecture. He was one of the most active participants and attempted to put his socialist theory into practice on two unexecuted projects in the same year: the building for the Confederation of Mexican Workers and the Ciudad Obrera de M√©xico, both with Enrique Guerrero and Ra√∫l Cacho (1937), and his social worries on the unexecuted General Hospital project (to be built in the city of Leon, Gto). He was one of the commissioners to take topographical records from the recent discovered Mayan ruins of Bonampak, in an expedition organized by the National Institute of Fine Arts (1949).Arai, Alberto T., La Arquitectura de Bonampak, INBA, M√©xico, 1960. His urbanistic knowledge give him the opportunity to make urban planning to several cities along the country. Also he developed the theory of architectural regionalism, which attempt the use of material resources and take care of the human needs of each particular area.Arai, Alberto T., Caminos para una Arquitectura Mexicana, Conaculta-INBA, M√©xico, 2001.Arai, Alberto T., \\"Regionalismo Arquitect√≥nico\\" en Regionalismo, Conaculta.INBA, M√©xico, 2003. Later, when Mexico opted for a developmental policy, Arai became a standard- bearer for nationalism in architecture. He re-evaluated traditional building materials, such as tree trunks, bamboo, palm leaves and lianas, using them in a plan for a country house that was adapted to the warm, damp climate of the Papaloapan region, and various essays to improve the country and popular houses. The building of the Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City, gave him his greatest architectural opportunity when he designed the \\"Frontones\\" de Ciudad Universitaria (1952). In these he used the volcanic stone of the area to great effect in truncated pyramid shapes inspired by Pre-Columbian pyramids. This was his contribution to the early landscaping-architecture, by using the volcanoes surrounding the view as a theme for his design. His numerous books and articles addressed conceptual problems in Mexican architecture and art. His last building was the clubhouse (Kaikan) of the Japanese Association, see Japanese community of Mexico City, who was inspired on ancient Japanese and ancient Mexican architectural design, but with modern techniques and materials, successfully a modern looking piece.

The film is based on 2001 horror novel Pact of the Fathers by English horror writer Ramsey Campbell. Plot After the suicide of her father, Daniella (Erica Prior) investigates her family's past. The plot involves a sect called the Abrahamites, who (according to the movie) sacrifice their first borns following an alternative interpretation of God's Will in the near-sacrifice of Isaac. Caravaggio's Ufizzi version of the biblical scene is shown in the movie to illustrate this alternative belief. The movie version of the Abrahamites traditionally give their first borns the father's middle name, hence the title of the movie.

Chateau Montelena's Chardonnay was in competition with nine other wines from France and California under blind tasting. All 11 judges awarded their top scores to either the Chardonnays from Chateau Montelena or Chalone Winery, another California wine producer. A fictionalized version of Chateau Montelena's historic victory was featured in the 2008 film Bottle Shock. History=Tubbs In 1882, entrepreneur Alfred L. Tubbs bought of land just north of Calistoga at the foot of Mount Saint Helena. Tubbs had made a fortune from the rope business during the Gold Rush, and knew the area from visits to the White Sulphur Springs Resort nearby. He planted vines, and by 1896 Chateau Montelena was the seventh largest winery in the Napa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon vines at Chateau Montelena. With the onset of Prohibition in the United States, winemaking ceased at the Chateau and in the period that followed Tubbs sold grapes but did not make wine. In 1958 the Tubbs family sold the Chateau to Yort Wing Frank, a Chinese electrical engineer, and his wife Jeanie, who were looking for a retirement home. The Franks created a garden in the style of their homeland, and excavated Jade Lake. The Chinese garden is a popular spot for picnics, although access is now limited to members of the Chateau wine club. Chateau Montelena Estate Cabernet Sauvignon label from the 1999 vintage Paschich In 1968, Lee and Helen Paschich bought the property, and brought in as partners lawyer James L. Barrett and property developer Earnest Hahn. Barrett replanted the vineyard and installed winemaking equipment in the historic buildings and it began producing wines again in 1972, with Mike Grgich employed as winemaker. Four years later, the Chateau Montelena 1973 Chardonnay won first place among the chardonnays and white Burgundies entered in the \\"Judgment of Paris\\" wine competition. A bottle of that vintage is in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Chateau Montelena In 2004 Chateau Montelena was subject to claims by James Laube of Wine Spectator that its wines were tainted by TCA. Following an independent laboratory test confirmation, Jim Barrett announced the measures taken to eliminate the presence of 2,4,6-trichloroanisole in the Montelena winery.

It was founded in 1938 by Stella Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading, as a British women's organisation to recruit women into the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) services to help in the event of War. Objectives On 16 May 1938, the British government set out the objectives of the Women's Voluntary Service for Civil Defence: It was seen ‚Äúas the enrolment of women for Air Raid Precaution Services of Local Authorities, to help to bring home to every household what air attack may mean, and to make known to every household [in the country] what it can do to protect itself and the community.‚Äù In the words of Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, \\"as regards their civil defence functions, the Minister regards the Women's Voluntary Service as occupying ... much the same relationship as that of the women's auxiliary services for the armed forces of the Crown.\\" Organisation and structure The WVS/WRVS was a voluntary organisation, and it was Lady Reading's vision that there would be no ranks. It was perhaps the only organisation where you could find a Duchess and a charlady working side by side. While many members of the WVS mucked in on pretty much all tasks, an organisation without any hierarchy would not have worked so, while there were no ranks, there were titles. Women were recruited for specific tasks, whether that was to drive ambulances, join in a knitting work party, or to collect National Savings. Inevitably those women who signed up for one thing often ended up being co-opted for other work, especially if they showed aptitude. The WVS was split into 12 Regions (using the same boundaries as the Civil Defence Corps) which started with 1 in the NE of England and moved clockwise down the country and back up. Scotland was Region 11 and London Region 12. Each Region had a Regional Administrator who was paid for by the Home Office. Under this each county had a County Organiser and 'staff' and below that were the Centres. During and after the Second World War there were almost 2,000 WVS centres around Great BritainLists of WVS centres up to 1965 can be found on the Royal Voluntary Service website: EnglandScotland Wales (and in Northern Ireland during the war), each at the sharp end of providing help to their communities. Each was prominently positioned within a town or village and was run by a Centre Organiser appointed by Headquarters in London. Each Centre Organiser had a team of members who were responsible for different aspect of WVS work e.g. evacuation, Training, Food or Clothing. Under their direction were the 'ordinary' members. While Centre Organisers had ultimate control over the work they did in their areas, they were tightly scrutinised by the County and Regional offices and Headquarters. Each Centre had to file a monthly Narrative Report in quadruplicate which allowed both the sharing of good practice and ideas, but also allowed those in charge to keep tabs on their members. These Narrative reports which were produced from 1938-1992 are inscribed on the UK Memory of the World Register, part of UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme and are considered one of the most important documents for social and women's history produced in the 20th century. In addition headquarters issued substantial numbers of circular notices each year informing Organisers of new projects and re-enforcing the rules and regulations. This structure stayed in place almost unchanged until the Local Government reorganisations in the 1970s which changed boundaries and led to changes in regional organisation and the amalgamation and closure of some centres as District Councils were introduced. Through the 1990s cost-cutting and the professionalisation of the organisation meant that Centre Organisers and County and Regional Offices were phased out and the centres were closed. Headquarters which had been in London since 1938 was moved out to Milton Hill House in Oxfordshire in 1997 and by 2004 there were no local or regional centres remaining. The organisation of large areas (usually comprising several counties) and the services within them were taken on by members of staff and local services (such as Meals on Wheels, Darby and Joan clubs or Hospital Shops) were managed independently. In 2013 Royal Voluntary Service resurrected the centre model, which are now called 'Hubs' and there are 67 spread across Great Britain. World War II=Evacuation, clothing distribution and returning soldiers The WVS played a key part in the evacuation of civilians from urban areas. The WVS had been asked to pinpoint areas of safety and billeting for evacuated children. Moving children out of the cities proved reasonably easy. Getting them to a known area of safety proved a lot more difficult as trains did not always arrive at an expected destination or would turn up at a reception point unexpectedly. The WVS is credited with helping to move 1.5 million people (the majority were children) out of cities in the early days of September 1939. The WVS also played a major role in the collection of clothing required for the needy. In October 1939, Lady Reading broadcast to the United States about the need for clothing in the UK. The broadcast led to large quantities of clothing (known as \\"Bundles for Britain\\") being sent by the American Red Cross and distributed from WVS Emergency Clothing Stores. When troops returned to ports after the evacuation at Dunkirk, members of the WVS were there to greet them and hand out food, drink and warm clothing. The WVS base at the railway station in Headcorn, Kent was an especially busy place for feeding returning soldiers before they dispersed‚Äîa spit was installed so that meat could be roasted on the spot. The WVS also played a vital part during the Blitz bombings of British cities. The WVS during the Blitz Women of the Women's Voluntary Service run a Mobile Canteen in London, 1941 By the time of the Blitz, women in the WVS were adept at providing food and drink around the clock. While ARP wardens and firemen fought the fires, women in the WVS set up mobile canteens to keep them refreshed, thus placing themselves in serious physical danger with collapsing buildings a constant threat. When a raid ended, the WVS also played a part in looking after the injured and those who had lost their homes. Records indicate that the WVS dealt with and helped over 10,000 people every night of the Blitz. The Blitz lasted for 57 nights, and the WVS helped a great many people who went to their rest centres. Some people stayed for a night; many stayed for much longer and stretched the resources of the WVS to the limit. In Barnes, one WVS member fed 1,200 bomb victims in just one day, cooking in her own kitchen. It would be difficult to overstate the importance of the work done by the WVS during the Blitz: the rest centres provided shelter, food, and importantly, sanitation. But working so near to the centre of the bombing inevitably led to casualties. 241 members of the WVS were killed during the Blitz and many more were wounded. 25 WVS offices were destroyed. Other activities The WVS began running IIPs (Incident Inquiry Points), places where people came to find out about their loved ones who were in an area that had been bombed in order to free the ARP to work with the fire brigade. The WVS also helped with the Queen's Messenger Food Convoys which took food to areas in need after a bombing raid. The people who survived the bombing of Coventry received help from one of the convoys with 14,000 meals being served. By 1941, one million women belonged to the WVS. Their work did not slacken after the end of the Luftwaffe's bombing raids. The Battle of the Atlantic and the devastating toll of merchant ships sunk by U-boats led to shortages in Great Britain. The WVS did all that it could to assist in the collection of required material for the war effort and also to educate people not to waste what they had. Each WVS centre had its own Salvage Officer and Food Leader. The Food Leader did whatever was required at a local level to assist the authorities in the complicated task of food rationing. Educational pamphlets were produced and lectures held. The WVS organised campaigns such as 'Salute the Soldier', 'Wings for Victory', 'Spitfire Funds' and Warship Week. D-Day In the buildup to D-Day, the expertise the WVS had in catering was put to use again. The skills learned during the Blitz were again put to good use when the V-1 and V-2 rockets fell on London. Once again, the WVS played a key role in evacuation. With the success of D-Day, the WVS moved into Europe to support troops there. The first WVS abroad had landed in Italy with the success of the invasion there. Overseas WVS organisations The WVS model proved to be so successful that other countries around the world set up their own versions during the war, with the assistance of the British WVS. The most successful of these was formed in 1942 in India, especially in Bengal, which had during the war a membership of over 10,000 and continued into the 1950s. In the US the American Women's Voluntary Services was started soon after the start of the war by an American woman who had been working with the WVS in Northampton, England. WVS organisations were also set up in Canada and Australia. Defence Medal To reflect their role during the war, WVS members were eligible for the Defence Medal ‚Äì the campaign medal awarded for home defence ‚Äì on the same basis as members of the emergency services. Post World War II In the immediate post war era, the WVS continued to operate as food rationing remained in place. Such was their work, that the new Labour government funded the WVS from central government funds. In 1952,Elizabeth II agreed to become patron of the WVS and in 1966, she awarded the service the honour of adding 'Royal' to its title, it becoming the Women's Royal Voluntary Service. The organisation evolved to helping isolated and lonely people, particularly the elderly. They are particularly well known as providers of the Meals on Wheels service which delivers hot meals to the housebound. Their mission is \\"to help people to maintain independence and dignity in their homes and communities, particularly in later life.\\" In 1968, the government dismantled the Civil Defence Corps, to which WRVS had been affiliated, and WRVS was registered as a charity from 16 January 1968. Present day The services they now provide are practical services delivered with warmth and care to thousands of older and housebound people every day such as Meals on Wheels, Good Neighbours and community transport. They also run hospital shops and caf√©s where any profits are returned to the hospital to improve services for patients, staff and visitors. Royal Voluntary Service emergency teams provide back-up to the professional services and members of the public in times for major incidents such as the Lockerbie disaster, Hillsborough disaster, Buncefield fuel depot blast and flooding crises in July 2007 by running rest centres and providing emergency feeding to members of the public, fire crews and police. In 2004, the organisation's name was changed from the Women's Royal Voluntary Service to simply WRVS in an attempt to modernise its image and in recognition of the fact that 11% of its 60,000 volunteers were men. In 2013, it changed its name to Royal Voluntary Service, to further dispel the myth that it is an organisation for women only; currently about 5% of its volunteers are men. On Tuesday 24 March 2020, in response to COVID-19, the National Health Service called for 250,000 new volunteers from the general public in England and Wales to be directed by a call-centre run by the RVS to help self-isolating vulnerable and elderly people requiring assistance. The following day, it was announced that more than 400,000 had volunteered. By the end of the week, recruitment to the \\"NHS Volunteer Responders\\" was halted to enable the more than 750,000 applications to be processed by the RVS.  Uniform  The WVS got its first uniform in June 1939 when an overcoat and hat was launched. They and the suit uniform which followed shortly after were designed by Digby Morton, the famous London couturier, and the thick green/grey Harris tweed from which they were produced was supplied by Harrods.McMurray, M. 2009. WRVS Uniform 1939-1945 The uniform was not free however, and a full suit uniform, coat, hat and scarf cost ¬£9 4s 7d in 1940, about two weeks of the average man's wages.McMurray, M. 2009. WVS Uniform 1939-1945, page 13 The first free WVS uniform would not be introduced until 1953 when those WVS members who were part of the Civil Defence Corps were issued with a free dress, beret and overcoat. The uniform was not compulsory, except for those carrying out certain roles (such as manning a mobile canteen) and many members wore WVS overalls or just their membership badge. The WVS uniform changed very little over the years, the first change was in 1966, when the cut of the suits was altered to make them more fashionable, and then in the 1970s polyesters were introduced. WRVS ceased to be a uniformed organisation in 1998 and today volunteers can wear their own clothes (and the organisation badge) or branded work-wear, such as polo shirts and fleeces. Women's Royal Voluntary Service Medal thumb The Women's Voluntary Service Medal was instituted on 23 March 1961, when the Home Secretary Richard Butler announced in the Commons that the Queen had approved the medal. The WVS Long Service medal is presented by Royal Voluntary Service on behalf of the Queen and is awarded to a volunteer after they complete forty duties each year over a period of fifteen years. Holders of the medal qualify for the award of a clasp after each subsequent period of twelve years service.McMurray, M. 2012. The Women‚Äôs Voluntary Service medal, Royal Voluntary Service When the WVS was awarded the prefix ‚ÄòRoyal‚Äô in 1966, it was initially decided not to re-name the medal to reflect the new title of the organisation, as it was considered unfair to differentiate between those who had received the medal before 1966 and those after. Some thirty years later, the medal's name was changed to the Women's Royal Voluntary Service Medal, this name remaining even after the organisation became the Royal Voluntary Service in 2013. By 2015, approximately 35,000 medals had been awarded. In popular culture Mass- Observation diarist Nella Last joined the Women's Voluntary Service in her hometown of Barrow-in-Furness at the outbreak of World War Two. Her wartime diary contains frequent references to her WVS work. Her association with the WVS and its members are a central feature of the 2006 made-for-TV film dramatisation of her wartime diaries.

History The dressing is named for its tint. The most accepted theory regarding its origins points to the Palace Hotel in San Francisco in 1923, when the hotel's executive chef Philip Roemer wanted something to pay tribute to actor George Arliss and his hit play, The Green Goddess. He then concocted this dressing, which, like the play, became a hit. This dressing, which contained anchovies, scallions, parsley, tarragon, mayonnaise, tarragon vinegar, and chives, is a variation of a dressing originated in France by a chef to Louis XIII who made a sauce au vert (green sauce) which was traditionally served with \\"green eel\\".Larousse Gastronomique Page 1272 In 1948, the New York Times published a recipe for the dressing that included Worcestershire sauce. Later recipes have included variations such as the addition of avocado or basil. In the early 1970s, salad dressing maker Seven Seas produced a bottled version of this dressing. It is still made in limited quantities, although the company has since been purchased by Kraft Foods.

This is among the earliest complete Sufi Tafsirs (exegesis) of the Quran and has been published several times in 10 volumes. He used to avoid the company of the rich, powerful and the influential. His yearly majlis-e wa'az was attended by people from far and wide. Whatever his disciples and followers used to present to him was handed over to the poor and the needy. He is said to have had a very impressive personality, and used to dress gracefully.

He took office on January 1, 2004, the first elected government office he has held. He is a member of the Democratic Party. After winning the general election in November 2015 for an unprecedented fourth term, McDermott became the longest-serving mayor in Hammond's history. He was elected to a fifth term in 2019. Early life and education McDermott's father, Thomas McDermott Sr., was a Republican who served as the 18th mayor of Hammond from 1984 through 1992. McDermott raised by his mother in Northern California's Napa Valley and spent summers with his father in Indiana. After graduating from Napa High School in Napa, California, McDermott joined the United States Navy. After the six years in the navy, McDermott moved to Northwest Indiana, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Finance from Purdue University Northwest and a Juris Doctor from the Notre Dame Law School. Career McDermott won the 2003 mayoral election for Hammond by defeating incumbent Republican mayor Duane Dedelow 52.1% ‚Äì 47.9%, a margin of just 700 votes. During McDermott's first term in office, the dilapidated River Park Apartment complex was razed under the guidance of the Hammond Redevelopment Commission. Mayor McDermott's father, Tom McDermott Sr., helped attract Cabela's outdoor recreation retail store to the former Woodmar Country Club site in south Hammond in 2005. Critics at the time referred to the generous tax abatement awarded Cabela's as \\"corporate welfare\\" while supporters, including the mayor, cited a \\"public-private partnership.\\" McDermott advocated for the elimination of the Hammond Health Department in 2004, in 2005, and finally succeeding in September 2007. According to McDermott, this department was an example of duplicate government better left to the county to operate, while mayoral detractors claimed it was a valuable and much-needed service to the city, especially its poorest citizens. McDermott was re-elected in the 2007 mayoral race 52.4% ‚Äì 47.6%, a margin of just 400 votes over Republican nominee George Janiec. On March 28, 2008, McDermott endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton for President and hosted a rally for the senator at the Hammond Civic center. McDermott later joined her campaign at a restaurant in Crown Point. Clinton's arrival in Hammond was the first visit of any presidential political candidate since Ronald Reagan visited Hammond (Hessville Park) in 1976, and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. During the Democratic Presidential primaries in Indiana, McDermott was seen on CNN questioning Gary, Indiana mayor, Rudy Clay about votes that had not yet been posted many hours after the polls had closed. This \\"mayor fight\\" was satirized the following day on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. He also criticized the busing of high school students to voting booths saying \\"These kids come from the worst performing schools in the state of Indiana and we are giving them a day off to go vote for Obama. They can vote on election day like everybody else.\\"Bill Dolan Hammond mayor: School field trip 'unethical' politicking; Busing Gary students to vote early becomes a controversy April 24, 2008 NWI In 2011, McDermott won election for the third time, winning the Democratic primary with 68% of the vote and the general election in November with 80.2% of the vote in a rematch of his 2007 opponent George Janiec, a margin of 7,200 votes. On May 16, 2014, McDermott announced that he would step down as the chairman of the Lake County Democratic Party. It was speculated that McDermott planned on running for governor of Indiana in the 2016 election. On May 5, 2015, McDermott became the first mayor in Hammond's history to win four consecutive democratic primaries when he handily beat 6th District Councilman Homero \\"Chico\\" Hinojosa with 78% of the vote. On November 3, 2015, McDermott won the general election by a landslide margin of 87% to 13% over Republican Humberto Prado, a margin of 5,100 votes, becoming the longest-serving mayor in Hammond's history.

Charges of \\"possession of marijuana and maintaining a common nuisance\\" were later dropped and McDermott accused his political rival, Lake County Sheriff Rogelio \\"Roy\\" Dominguez, of \\"playing politics by targeting Woerpel.\\" McDermott was mentioned as a potential candidate in the 2010 United States Senate election in Indiana to succeed the retiring Evan Bayh, but dropped out, and endorsed fellow candidate Brad Ellsworth. In February 2014, McDermott agreed to the $200,000 settlement of a discrimination complaint filed by Hammond Housing Authority Director Maria Becerra. An editorial in The Times of Northwest Indiana later called for McDermott to make a public apology in the wake of Becerra's ouster from the Hammond Housing Authority. In 2015, complaints were dismissed by the Lake County, Indiana election board that McDermott allegedly violated finance laws for not properly itemizing over $200,000 in reimbursements for food, lodging, and rental cars. In November 2019, McDermott publicly admitted that he had been fined $50,000 for improper campaign loans from his wife Lake Circuit Judge Marissa McDermott. Personal life McDermott has four children and is married to Marissa McDermott. Marissa is a Lake County Judge, attorney, and Hammond precinct committeewoman.

She was best known for her starring role in the London premiere of Franz Leh√°r's operetta The Merry Widow. Beginning as a child star in the 1890s, Elsie built her reputation in several successful Edwardian musical comedies before her great success in The Merry Widow, opening in 1907. Afterwards, she starred in several more successful operettas and musicals, including The Dollar Princess (1909), A Waltz Dream (1911) and The Count of Luxembourg (1911). Admired for her beauty and charm on stage, Elsie became one of the most photographed women of Edwardian times. Life and career Elsie was born in Armley, West Yorkshire. Her mother, Charlotte Elizabeth Hodder (1864‚Äì1922), was a dressmaker who operated a lodging-house. She married William Thomas Cotton, a theatre worker, in 1891, and Elsie became Elsie Cotton. The family lived in Manchester.Lily Elsie biography page at Miss Lily Elsie website Elsie was also the niece of Wilfred Cotton, who married actress Ada Reeve.\\"Lily Elsie\\", StageBeauty.net, accessed 4 December 2019 Child star A precocious child star, Elsie appeared in music hall and variety entertainments as a child impersonator known as Little Elsie. Nevertheless, she was reportedly painfully shy, even as an adult. By 1895‚Äì96, she appeared in concerts and pantomimes in theatres in Salford. In 1896, she played the role of Princess Mirza in The Arabian Nights at the Queen's Theatre in Manchester. Then, at Christmas 1896‚Äì97, at the age of ten, she appeared in the title role of Little Red Riding Hood at the same theatre for six weeks and then on tour for six additional weeks. Her first London appearance was at Christmas 1898 in King Klondike at Sara Lane's Britannia Theatre as Aerielle, the Spirit of the Air. Elsie then toured the provinces, travelling as far as Bristol and Hull for a full year in McKenna's Flirtation, a farce by American E. Selden, in 1900.Edwards, G. Spencer. Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, 28 May 1904, pp. 474‚Äì75 She then played in Christmas pantomimes, including Dick Whittington (1901), The Forty Thieves (1902), and Blue Beard (1903) and toured in Edwardian musical comedies, including The Silver Slipper by Owen Hall, with music by Leslie Stuart (1901‚Äì02), and Three Little Maids (1903). From about 1900, she adopted the stage name Lily Elsie.G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"Elsie, Lily (1886?‚Äì1962)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 September 2008, Elsie then joined George Edwardes' company at Daly's Theatre in London as a chorus girl. In 1903, she took over the role of Princess Soo-Soo in the hit musical A Chinese Honeymoon and then starred in the flop, Madame Sherry, by Hugo Felix, at the Apollo Theatre. She next played the roles of Gwenny Holden in Lady Madcap, Lady Patricia Vereker in The Cingalee in 1904, Madame du Tertre in The Little Michus in 1905, and Lady Agnes Congress in The Little Cherub (during which, she was fired by Edwardes for giggling, but soon rehired), Humming Bird in See See and Lally in The New Aladdin at the Gaiety Theatre, all in 1906. From 1900 to 1906, she appeared in 14 shows. Merry Widow and peak years Elsie in The Count of Luxembourg Elsie's biggest success came in creating the title role in the English-language version of The Merry Widow in the London production. Edwardes took Elsie to see the original German version (Die Lustige Witwe) in Berlin. Elsie was at first reluctant to take on the demanding part, thinking her voice too light for the role, but Edwardes persuaded her to accept.The Times obituary, 18 December 1962, p. 13 Edwardes brought her to see the famous designer, Lucile, for a style coaching. Lucile later wrote, \\"I realised that here was a girl who had both beauty and intelligence but who had never learnt how to make the best of herself. So shy and diffident was she in those days that a less astute producer than George Edwardes would in all probability have passed her over and left her in the chorus.\\"Excerpts from Discretions and Indiscretions, by Lucy Duff-Gordon, Jarrolds (1932) at Lily-Elsie.com The production, with English lyrics by Adrian Ross, opened in June 1907 and ran for 778 performances at Daly's Theatre. Elsie created the role at Daly's and toured with it beginning in August 1908. The show was an enormous success for its creators and made Elsie a major star. One critic at the opening night praised \\"the youthfulness, the dainty charm and grace, the prettiness and the exquisite dancing with which Miss Elsie invests the part.... I share the opinion of most of the first- nighters, who considered it could not have been in better hands, and could not have been better handled.... The night was a genuine triumph for Miss Elsie, and she well deserved all the calls she received.\\"The Pelican, 12 June 1907, p. 6a, reprinted in Culme, John. \\"Press Clippings for the week ending Saturday, 29 June 2002\\", FootlightNotes Lucile designed the costumes for Elsie in The Merry Widow (including the plumed hats that became an extraordinary fad) and thereafter used Elsie to promote her fashions, designing her personal clothes and costumes for several of her other shows. Lucile wrote, \\"That season was a very brilliant one, perhaps the most brilliant of the series which brought the social life of pre-war London to its peak. And just when it was at its zenith a new play was launched with a new actress, who set the whole town raving over her beauty....\\" Elsie's image was in great demand by advertisersAdvertisements featuring Elsie and on postcards, and she received unsolicited gifts of great value from many male admirers (and even bequests). Lucile commented, \\"She was absolutely indifferent to most [men] for she once told me she disliked the male character and considered that men only behaved tolerably to a woman who treated them coldly\\". Nevertheless, Elsie became one of the most frequently photographed beauties of the Edwardian era. According to the Atlanta Constitution newspaper in America, writing in 1915: The Merry Widow, Act 3, London, 1907 After The Merry Widow, Elsie appeared in another 16 shows, including in the very successful English-language versions of The Dollar Princess in 1909; as Franzi in the British premiere of A Waltz Dream in 1911; and as Ang√®le in The Count of Luxembourg, also in 1911, garnering continuous praise. One critic wrote that \\"it gave great pleasure merely to see her walk across the stage.\\" Elsie left the cast of The Count of Luxembourg to marry 6' 3\\" Major John Ian Bullough (1885‚Äì1936), the son of a wealthy textile manufacturer, but the marriage was reported to be mostly unhappy. In addition, Elsie often suffered from ill health, including anaemia, among other ailments, and had several operations during her years onstage. The gossip column in The Pelican called her \\"the occasional actress\\". Bullough wanted his wife to retire from the stage. The publicity shy and exhausted Elsie was happy to leave the stage for the next several years, except for charity performances to benefit the war effort. She returned in the title role of Louis Parker's comedy play Malvourneen with Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre, as Lady Catherine Lazenby in The Admirable Crichton in 1916 and in the title role in Pamela written by Arthur Wimperis, with songs by Frederic Norton (1917; with Owen Nares). The Tatler wrote of her performance in Malvourneen, \\"Everyone should see Miss Lily Elsie in this play, for it shows us that her comedy is as good as her musical comedy, which is saying a great deal.\\"The Tatler, 3 November 1915 Wedding photo, 1911 Amy Evans and Elsie in A Waltz Dream Later years In 1920, Elsie moved with her husband to the Gloucestershire village of Redmarley D'Abitot. She spent ten years away from the stage this time, enjoying social events and fox hunting. She returned to performing, first touring and then appearing at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in London in 1927 as Eileen Mayne in The Blue Train, the English language adaptation of Robert Stolz's German musical comedy M√§di. Her last show before retiring was Ivor Novello's successful The Truth Game back at Daly's Theatre in 1928‚Äì1929. Finally, in 1930, Elsie's unhappy marriage ended in divorce as her health deteriorated further and she became subject to fits of ill temper. She became a hypochondriac and spent much time in nursing homes and Swiss sanatoria. She was diagnosed as having serious psychological ailments and underwent brain surgery that reportedly resulted in an improvement in her health. Her last years were spent at St. Andrew's Hospital in London. Elsie died at St. Andrew's Hospital (demolished in 1973), Cricklewood, London, aged 76, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.

Ahmad's father, Mirza Abdollah, is arguably the most influential figure in Persian traditional music, and his paternal uncle, Mirza Hossein Gholi, is also well known for his mastery in playing the tar. Ahmad's paternal grandfather, Ali Akbar Farahani, was also a talented musician. Ahmad started learning music at an early age. At the age of seven, he was able to play tombak to accompany his father. Unfortunately he lost his father soon thereafter, but continued his education with his sisters, especially Moloud Khanom. He became one of the best setar players of all time. For years he played on Iranian radio especially in a program called Golha, produced by Davood Pirnia. Ebadi had a unique style in playing the setar. He also invented a variety of different tunings for setar. He died in 1993 and is buried in Emamzadeh Taher Cemetery in Karaj.Photograph of the gravestone of Ahmad Ebadi: .

The name Prats-de-Mollo comes from Catalan \\"meadows of Moll√≥\\". Moll√≥ is a town just across the border and the Col d'Ares. La Preste is a spa resort town that was a separate village but is now included as part of the municipality. Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste was the capital of the eponymous former canton. It forms part of the historical comarca of Vallespir and is part of Northern Catalonia. Geography Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste is located in the Pyrenees, from the Spanish border and the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, on the banks of the river Tech, and on the south face of the Canigou at an elevation of 735 meters. Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste is located in the canton of Le Canigou and in the arrondissement of C√©ret. Map of Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste and its surrounding communes Panoramic view of the town. History The town, along with other Vallespir municipalities of Roussillon was separated from the rest of Catalonia, and therefore from Spain, by the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), which France got from Spain part of Catalonia. During the Spanish Civil War it was the location of a refuge financed by the pacifist organisation War Resisters' International and run by Professor Jos√© Brocca.  Population and society = Population  Population 1962-2008  Festivals and traditions  Built on the banks of the river Tech, surrounded by mountains, Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste was one of the most important border towns in the area, and today still boasts much evidence of its rich past, both architectural and traditional. In February, two events traditionally take place at Prats: the F√™te de l'ours (in Catalan : Festa de l'√ìs, i.e. bear festival) and Carnaval. Both are full of fascinating traditions handed down over the years. During the Bear Festival, celebrated annually at the beginning of spring, the locals dress up as bears, covering themselves with soot or coal and oil, and \\"attacking\\" the onlookers, attempting to get everyone dirty. Others dress up as hunters, playing the role of \\"protectors\\". The festival ends with the \\"ball de l'os (bear dance). There is a reference to this tradition in the Catalan author Joan-Llu√≠s Llu√≠s' novel El dia de l'√≥s (The Day of the Bear). One of the events during carnival week is the Ball de la Posta. The ‚Äôposta‚Äô is a plank 1.5 m long and 30 cm wide, with a picture of a pretty girl at one end, representing the Virgin, and a devil on the other side. Dancers range themselves in couples opposite the carrier of la posta and his colleague who carries a wooden sword. The dancers advance three times, in couples, towards the armed pair. The first time they bow, the second time the lady must kiss the face on the posta, choosing devil or virgin, and the third time she gets a smack on the bottom with the plank. In olden days, this dance was a judgement on vice and virtue.  Sites of interest  This walled town is a maze of narrow cobbled streets and mediaeval architecture. With only 1,100 inhabitants, it boasts numerous hotels, restaurants and caf√©s, the narrow streets forming terraces linked together by stairways and passages. A covered walkway leads directly from the town to Fort Lagarde, an impressive fort built by Marshal Vauban in 1683 to strengthen the town's defences and keep the population under control after the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) divided Catalonia between Spain and France and after the revolts of the Angelets de la Terra (1667‚Äì75). Its position also makes it ideal as a starting point for walking and climbing itineraries. Only a few kilometres away lies La Preste, a spa town known for its waters and treatment of urinary infections and related diseases. In the 14th century, people with leprosy used to bathe in the ‚ÄôLeper‚Äôs pool‚Äô to help to relieve their symptoms. *Arboretum de Saint Guillem  Notable people  * Chantal Gorostegui (1965-) : racing cyclist born in Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste.

Museo Nacional de Arte Roberto Montenegro Nervo (February 19, 1885 in Guadalajara ‚Äì October 13, 1968 in Mexico City) was a painter, muralist and illustrator, who was one of the first to be involved in the Mexican muralism movement after the Mexican Revolution. His most important mural work was done at the former San Pedro and San Pablo monastery but as his work did not have the same drama as other muralists, such as Diego Rivera, he lost prominence in this endeavor. Most of his career is dedicated to illustration and publishing, portrait painting and the promotion of Mexican handcrafts and folk art. Life Roberto Montenegro watercolour and sanguine on paper 218 x 99 cm 1915 Roberto Montenegro Nervo was born on February 19, 1885 in Guadalajara.Balderas, p. 11 His parents were Colonel Ignacio L Montenegro and Mar√≠a Nervo, aunt of poet Amado Nervo. Montenegro had four sisters: Rosaura, Ana, Eva and Mar√≠a Eugenia and one brother, Arturo. The family was one of the beneficiaries of the Porfirio D√≠az regime, leaving for the United States when the Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910. They returned in the mid 1920s.Balderas, p. 25 Little is known of Montenegro's childhood. One photo exists of him as a teenager in a park with Jorge Enciso and Luis Castillo Led√≥n. In interviews he only talked about ordinary things from this time such as going to buy pastry and admiring the colors and forms of ordinary things around him. His education began at a school for boys where he had his first experience with drawing. This led to clashes with Italian Felix Bernardelli, who had a painting and music school in Guadalajara and introduced Montenegro to Art Nouveau. He arrived to Mexico City in 1903, sent by his father to study architecture. Through his cousin Amado Nervo, he was able to meet many of the social elite of Mexico City including Jos√© Juan Tablada, Manuel de la Parra and Justo Sierra.Balderas, p. 27 From 1904 to 1906 he studied drawing and history at the Academy of San Carlos. His teachers included Leandro Izaguirre, Germ√°n Gedovius and Alberto Fuster and his classmates were Diego Rivera, √Ångel Z√°rraga, Francisco Goitia and Saturnino Herr√°n. He became familiar with Japanese art whose influence can be seen some of his illustrations for Revista Moderna. In 1906, he and Diego Rivera were finalists for a chance to go to Europe. The decision was made by coin toss with Montenegro winning. But Rivera would go months later. Montenegro was first in Madrid, studying at the Academy of San Fernando under engraver Ricardo Baroja. He became a fanatic of the Prado Museum studying the works of El Greco, Goya and Ignacio Zuloaga y Zabaleta.Balderas, p. 12 From 1907 to 1910 he was in Paris where he had his first contact with Cubism, meeting Picasso, Georges Braque and Juan Gris . Despite this, he did not have a Cubist period in his work. For two years he studied in Paris as the student of Colin Cowrstuos and exhibited his work in the city. He also traveled to London and Italy. He returned briefly to Mexico in 1910 but by 1913 he was back in Paris, for another six years, studying at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts and collaborating with Rub√©n Dar√≠o for a magazine called Revista Mundial. When World War I broke out in 1914, he moved to Barcelona then to Mallorca accompanied by a painter named Gandara, where he painted and also made a living fishing. He also met painter Hermen Anglada Camarasa there. Montenegro moved back to Mexico permanently in 1921. He kept a wide circle of friends that included writers, journalists, artists and politicians. He died in P√°tzcuaro on October 13, 1968. Career=Illustration and publishing During his lifetime, Montenegro had good relationships with various writers including Jos√© Juan Tablada and Luis G. Urbina working with Revista Moderna. In France he collaborated with Le Temoin and in Madrid with Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n. In Mexico, he associated with a number of writers for a publication called Los Contempor√°neos from 1928 to 1931 which included Carlos Pellicer, Jos√© Gorostiza and Salvador Novo.Balderas, p. 15 The first publication he worked with was Revista Moderna de M√©xico, directed by Jes√∫s E. Valenzuela. He began while still living in Guadalajara at age sixteen sending vignettes and drawings for illustrations. He would continue to work with them after he arrived in Mexico City until 1911. He had a number of publications in Europe. In 1910, he published twenty drawing in an album called Vingt Dessins with a prologue by Henri de R√©gnier.Balderas, p. 13 In 1917, his illustrations were in a children's version of Aladdin published in Barcelona. In 1919, he published a book of drawings called Vaslav Nijinsky: and interpretation of his work in Black-white and gold by Robert Montenegro.Balderas, p. 14 In 1933 he published Pintura mexicana (1800‚Äì1860) dedicated to the painters of Jalisco. In 1950, he published research on altarpieces called Retablos de M√©xico.Balderas, p. 17 In 1952 he published an album of twenty drawings with a prologue by Alfonso Reyes. Murals Stained glass work entitled La Vendedora de Pericos (The Parrot Seller) designed by Roberto Montenegro and Xavier Guerrero in the 1920s. Montenegro's first mural was done while he was living in Mallorca, for the Casino de la Palma. He was an early participant in the budding Mexican muralism movement, recruited by Secretary of Education Jos√© Vasconcelos and returning to Mexico in 1921. His most important mural work is in the former monastery and school of San Pedro y San Pablo, the church portion of which is now the Museo de la Luz. The first mural was done in 1922 called the Arbol de la Vida (Tree of Life) which alludes to the origin and destiny of man. The next was the Fiesta de la Santa Cruz (Festival of the Holy Cross) which depicts a traditional festival related to construction workers on May 3 done between 1923 and 1924. This is considered to be the most important of the murals in this building. Resurrecci√≥n (Resurrection) was painted between 1931 and 1933. It is a geometric composition with some Cubist influence. In the stairwell of San Pedro y San Pablo, Montenegro painted El Zod√≠aco (The Zodiac), which was left unfinished in 1923. He came back to it in 1931, finishing it in 1933. In addition to the murals, Montenegro created two stained glass windows influenced by Mexican folk culture called the Jarabe Tapat√≠o (Guadalajara dance) and the La Vendedora de Pericos (The parakeet seller). The work on the building ran into political problems resulting in changed to the original plans. First, Vasconcelos insisted that Montenegro change a depiction of Saint Sebastian, who was partially nude, androgynous and pointing a bow and arrow at the other central figure, a woman, stating it did not represent revolutionary values. In Fiesta de la Cruz, a figure of Vasconcelos was originally included, surrounded by women and holding the flag of the Universidad Nacional de M√©xico. When Vasconcelos fell out of favor, this image was painted over and replaced by that of a woman. Other early murals included Am√©rica Latina done in 1924 at the library of the Universidad Iberoamericana, which is an allegory of Latin America in the form of a map. La historia was done in 1926 at the Escuela Benito Ju√°rez. It is a formally designed painting with Oriental figures. Montenegro also painted Vasconcelos' private offices at the Secretar√≠a de la Educaci√≥n P√∫blica and the Hermeroteca (magazine library) of the Universidad Nacional. Despite his early entrance into the Mexican muralism scene, he quickly lost prominence. His work did not have the dramatic flair of Diego Rivera, Jos√© Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros, who would become the main three figures in the movement.Balderas, p. 16 Montenegro moved onto other projects but returned to doing some mural and building decoration work in the late career. In 1958, he painted a frieze called Apolo y las musas (Apollo and the muses) for the Teatro Degollado in Guadalajara; however, because of poor installation, it collapsed in 1963. In 1964 he designed a mosaic for the Casa de las Artesan√≠a in Guadalajara called La muerte de la artesan√≠as (The death of handcrafts) He also painted a mural at the Banco de Comercio with an allegory titled Industria, comercio y trabajo (Industry, commerce and work). Canvas Some of Montenegro's early exhibitions of his canvas work were in Mexico just before the start of the Mexican Revolution. In Guadalajara, he became part of the C√≠rculo Art√≠stico founded by Dr. Atl which had two exhibitions in 1911 and 1912. When the war broke out, he returned to Europe, living in Mallorca from 1914 to 1919. Here he worked on fishing and other scenes inspired by the customs of the area mostly done in Art Nouveau style. He exhibited his work several times in Mallorca and in Madrid in 1918 and 1919. When he returned to Mexico again, his first exhibition was at the Hotel Iturbide in the historic center of Mexico City. In 1948, he painted works for the Hotel del Prado which were placed in the bar named after him. From 1950, he began doing portraits as a way to secure income; something he had done in the 1920s. These work would include portraits of painter Jes√∫s Reyes Ferreira, Dolores del R√≠o, Gustavo Baz Prada, Frida Kahlo, Enrique As√∫nsolo, El√≠as Nandino, Genaro Estrada, Jos√© Rub√©n Romero, Carlos Ch√°vez, Rufino Tamayo, Jes√∫s Federico Reyes Heroles and V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre. He also did four self-portraits, one of which shows himself in a convex mirror. His late non portrait work included male nudes, often homoerotic. These include El ba√±o, Violinista and Y as√≠ sucedi√≥.Balderas, p. 18 Other important canvas pieces include Oaxaque√±a y alfareros, La curandera, La mujer con el pescado, Celista,Vida y muerte and La familia. Mexican handcrafts and folk art One of the projects that Montenegro did after his initial work with murals was the promotion of Mexican handcrafts and folk art, which he gained appreciation of while traveling Mexico. For the centennial of the end of the Mexican War of Independence in 1921, he organized an exhibition of this work, along with Dr. Atl and Jorge Enciso, the first of its kind organized with a critical sense.Balderas, p. 14-16 In 1934, he organized and was the first director of a folk art museum located in the Palacio de Bellas Artes, to which he donated a number of still life paintings. His promotion work included the discovery and promotion of 19th century folk painter Jos√© Mar√≠a Estrada, as well as exhibitions in Mexico and abroad. In 1940, he was the folk art curator for a very large exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York called Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art. Other work Montenegro also held a number of government posts. In 1921, he was in charge of the Departamento de Artes Pl√°sticas, the director of the Departamenteo de Bellas Artes in 1934, and the director of the Departamento de Ense√±anza Art√≠stica for the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica in 1936. In 1946, he organized the Regional Museum of Toluca. He became the head of the Departamento de Arte Popular of Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1947. However, after clashing with INBA director Carlos Ch√°vez, he left government service. Other work included state sets and design. He did scenery work for the Teatro de Ulises and participating in the shooting of the film Qu√© viva M√©xico!, by Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein . In 1948, he decorated the cocktail lounge of the Hotel del Prado. Gateway. 1911, ink on paper, 287 √ó 222 mm. Museo Nacional de Arte Artistry Montenegro was a painter, a printmaker, illustrator and included some work in theater and decoration. His time in Europe gave him exposure to various influences from Symbolism, Art Nouveau and Cubism especially from Aubrey Beardsley, William Blake and Rub√©n Dar√≠o . However, much of is aesthetic is also drawn from Mexican handcrafts and folk art, such as traditional clothing from the south of Mexico and religious objects. During his career, he felt torn between the classics and the modern in painting and tended to oscillate between the two, which prompted a certain amount of criticism of his art. Montenegro claimed to be a \\"subrealist\\" rather than a Surrealist, and his paintings often mixed two fundaments elements, folklore and fantasy. In his later work Montenegro evolved an abstract style, although he never lost his interest in popular, pre-Hispanic and colonial art. Recognition In 1967, he received the Premio Nacional de las Artes . In the 2000s TV UNAM produced a documentary about his work called Los murales perdidos de Roberto Montenegro (The lost murals of Roberto Montenegro) .

The group's speciality was parody songs, as with their first and best-known single, \\"Leader of the Laundromat\\". A spoof of the then-current hit song \\"Leader of the Pack\\", \\"Leader of the Laundromat\\" became a hit in its own right, reaching the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early 1965. \\"Leader of the Laundromat\\" In 1965, the group released \\"Leader of the Laundromat,\\" a parody of the Shangri-Las' \\"Leader of the Pack.\\" It was written and produced by Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss. The song became a top 20 hit in the US, peaking at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 1965. The lead vocal on \\"Leader of the Laundromat\\" was by Danny Jordan, who was Paul Vance's nephew. Jordan had had a 1960 single release on Kapp Records' Leader label: \\"Just Couldn't Resist Her With Her Pocket Transistor\\" (writers: Jack Keller/ Larry Kolber), a disc highly reminiscent of the then-recent \\"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\\" by Leader artist Brian Hyland and like that number 1 hit produced by Vance. Vance also produced a 1962 collaboration between Jordan and Artie Wayne: \\"Find a Little Happiness\\", a Diamond Records release credited to Jordan and Wayne. By 1964 Dante, Jordan and Wynn were all staff writers and session singers for Aldon Music, the music publishing company that had been founded by Don Kirshner and Al Nevins: that year the three eighteen-year-olds had collaborated in writing the Ronnie Dante single \\"Little Lollypop\\" and as the Cabin Kids the trio were recording surf music style songs for planned release on the Screen Gems label when Vance approached them to record \\"Leader of the Laundromat\\" as the Detergents. The success of \\"Leader of the Laudromat\\" predicated the abandonment of the Cabin Kids in favor of the Detergents and as such Dante, Jordan and Wynn appeared on several music-oriented television shows of the day, such as Shindig! and Hullabaloo also touring with Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars. The group was active from 1964 until 1966. After \\"Leader of the Laundromat\\" was released, the composers of \\"Leader of the Pack\\", Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich and George \\"Shadow\\" Morton, filed a lawsuit against the group. The suit was ultimately settled out of court. Coincidentally just three years later, in 1968, Dante began working alongside songwriter-producer Jeff Barry as the lead vocalist for the briefly, hugely successful cartoon group, The Archies. Thus in 1969, Dante was the lead (though publicly unacknowledged) vocalist of two Billboard Top 10 singles in the same week, as lead vocalist for two different but equally non-existent studio groups: the aforementioned Archies with the number 1 hit \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" and The Cuff Links, with the number 9 hit \\"Tracy,\\" which was written and produced by Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss, who also penned and produced \\"Leader of the Laundromat\\" by The Detergents. Later singles The Detergents made a second and final appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Double-O-Seven\\"; a lament by a teenager whose girlfriend is neglecting him to see James Bond movies; the track reached number 89 in the spring of 1965. The Detergents again spoofed the Shangri-Las by recording \\"I Can Never Eat Home Any More,\\" a parody of the Shangri-La's hit \\"I Can Never Go Home Any More.\\" Dante went on to produce many of Barry Manilow's hit recordings in the 1970s.

Biography His first enterprise was a cigarette paper factory which commenced production in 1922. Starting from the late 1920s, Demiraƒü began to invest his capital in the development of the Turkish railway network. Because of this investment, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk gave him the surname Demiraƒü (meaning \\"Iron web\\") when the Surname Law was put into effect in 1934. In 1936 he established an aircraft factory employing 500 people in Be≈üikta≈ü, Istanbul (later nationalized by the government and now occupied by the Istanbul Naval Museum). The production of the Nu D.36 two-seat trainer biplane, and Nu D.38 twin-engine high-wing light transport plane took place in this factory. In 1945 he founded the first opposition party, which was named Milli Kalkƒ±nma Partisi (National Development Party), but his party failed to receive the required number of votes for entering the Turkish parliament in the 1946 and 1950 general elections, and was eventually dissolved in 1958, a year after his death. In 1954, he was elected as a member of parliament for Sivas on behalf of the Democratic Party, which won the general elections. Demiraƒü donated his airplanes to his flying school (G√∂k Okulu) in Ye≈üilk√∂y, which he established for attracting the interest of young Turks in aviation. The land upon which the school was built was later nationalized by the Turkish government in order to enlarge the neighbouring Ye≈üilk√∂y Airport (Atat√ºrk International Airport) which was originally established as a military air base of the Ottoman Air Force in 1911.

In India, this MUV's main competition includes such vehicles like the Toyota Innova, Mahindra Bolero, Tata Sumo, and similar vehicles. The Indian Tavera was built with knock-down kit sourced from Isuzu Indonesia. In India, there are 2 versions of the Tavera, the original Tavera, the base model which includes the B1 and B2 trims, and the Tavera neo 2 (this version was called simply Tavera neo before the Indian Tavera facelift, and before that Tavera Elite), the normal version which includes the LS-B3, the LS-B4, the LT-L and the high-end SS-D1. In 2006, because of Chevrolet's marketing of their Indian lineup as \\"an Indian revolution\\" (similar to their US marketing campaign), the Tavera is now sold as two models. The original Tavera is still being sold; however more upmarket models in India are now sold as the \\"Tavera Neo 2\\". In September of the same year, the Indian Tavera got a facelift. The facelift included the front grille and revised interiors. Later again in 2012, it received a facelift which includes revised front lights and bumpers and introduced as Tavera Neo 3. It featured a new engine option, a cleaner 2.0 L G-series diesel engine sourced from Sonalika to comply with Bharat Stage 4 emissions standard imposed in several metro cities in India. The new engine was marketed as TCDi engine and delivers more power, and is equipped with a variable-geometry turbocharger. In Indonesia, Tavera served as a petrol version of Isuzu Panther, while the latter has only diesel engine. It is powered by a 2.2 L gasoline, & 180 N‚ãÖm (133 lb‚ãÖft) Australian-sourced Holden engine, which also used by Indonesian version of Opel/Chevrolet Blazer. It was discontinued in 2005 due to low demand. = 2013 recall in India = In July 2013, General Motors recalled 114,000 Chevrolet Taveras in India, as the vehicle failed to meet local emission standards.

He played a large role in the Russian Revolution of 1917 and wrote many articles for the Soviet newspaper Krasnaya Gazeta. He also wrote a history of the Bolshevik Revolution, which describes the progress of the Russian Revolution.  Early Life  Nikolai Podvoisky was born in Kunochevsk village in the Chernihiv (formerly Chernigov) province, in Ukraine, one of seven children of a former teacher who had become a priest. In 1901, he was expelled from Chernigov Seminary for political activities. In that same year, he enrolled in the Law Faculty in Yaroslavl, and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), using the alias 'Mironovich'. After the RSDLP split in 1903, he became a leading figure in the Bolshevik organisation in Yaroslavl. He was arrested in 1904 and again in 1905, for helping organise a strike by the city's railway workers, but soon released on both occasions. Injured during a demonstration, he sought treatment in Germany and Switzerland. He returned to Russia in 1906, and worked illegally as Bolshevik organiser in St-Petersburg, Kostroma, and Baku. In 1913, he settled near St Petersburg to organise the smuggling of Bolshevik literature into Russia. He was arrested in November 1916, but released during the February Revolution  Revolution and civil war  In March 1917, Podvoisky was co-opted onto the Petrograd (St Petersburg) Bolshevik committee, and was appointed head of the Bolshevik military organisation. This organisation played a critical role during the disturbances that threatened to bring down Russia's Provisional Government in July 1917. Leon Trotsky acknowledged that \\"under Podvoisky, who easily mastered the functions of command, an impromptu general staff was formed...In order to protect the demonstration from attack, armoured cars were placed at the bridges leading to the capital and at the central crossings of the main streets.\\" After the demonstrations were suppressed, Podvoisky - according to Trotsky - veered from being \\"too impetuous\\" to becoming \\"far more cautious\\", but despite his scepticism played a leading part in the military operation that overthrew the Provisional Government in November 1917, including planning the final act that brought down the government, the assault on the Winter Palace.  Later career  Immediately following the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917, Podvoisky was one of a troika , with Nikolai Krylenko and Pavel Dybenko appointed People's Commissar for Defence, before they were replaced by Trotsky, in March 1918. He was a founder of the Red Army, but was not an important military commander. He rapidly lost influence during the civil war, part of which he spent in Ukraine. AT the tenth party congress of the Russian Communist Party, in March 1920, he proposed that the army should be demobilised and replaced by a localised militia system, a proposal that received no notable support. In 1920, Podvoisky was appointed Chairman of the Supreme Council of Physical Culture, which was ran the system of compulsory physical training of youths prior to their being called up for military service. In July 1921, during the third Comintern congress, in Moscow, he founded the Red Sport International (Sportintern), whose task, he described as to \\"convert sport and gymnastics into a weapon of the class revolutionary struggle, concentrate the attention of workers and peasants on sport and gymnastics as one of the best instruments, method and weapons for their class organisation and struggle.\\" He lost the chairmanship of the Supreme Council of Physical Culture when he was replaced by Nikolai Semashko in 1923, and by 1926 he had lost effective control of Sportintern to the head of the Communist Youth International, Vissarion Lominadze. In 1924-30, Podvoisky was a member of the Central Control Commission, and a reliable supporter of Josif Stalin against Trotsky and other oppositionists.  Advising Eisenstein  In 1927, Podvoisky was the leading consultant on the film October, directed by Sergei Eisenstein, to mark the tenth anniversary of the October revolution. He helped Eisenstein to find suitable locations in Leningrad, and told him: \\"You know how stubborn I am, you'd better not argue with me! Better listen to me, and then later don't do it. But make a not of everything I say so that I have the impression I'm being listened to.\\"  On Nudity  Podvoisky was also the foremost soviet exponent of nudity. He wrote: He continued writing on sport and as a party historian until he retired on health grounds in 1934.  Personality  By the time Trotsky wrote his history of the Bolshevik revolution, Podvoisky had joined his enemies, yet Trotsky wrote about him more respectfully than about many of the others who went on to join Stalin's faction.  Family  Podvoisky married Nina Didrikil (1882-1953), an Old Bolshevik, who worked at the Lenin Institute, preparing Lenin's manuscript for publication. They had five daughters, one of whom, Nina, married the son of the high ranking Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov and a son, Lev, who married the daughter of the Bolshevik Solomon Lozovsky. One of Nina's sisters married the Chekist, Mikhail Kedrov (politician); the other was mother of another chekist, Artur Artuzov.

He was one of the founders of the Red Army, an associate of Leon Trotsky, and a major contributor to the communist victory in the Russian Civil War. His death by drowning during a visit to the USA caused enduring speculation that he may have been murdered.  Early Life  Ephraim Sklyansky was born into a lower middle class Jewish family in a village called Fastov, in Kyiv (Kiev) province, in Ukraine. In 1899, his family moved to Zhitomir. In 1911-16, he studied medicine at Kiev University, and joined the Bolsheviks as a student. After graduation, he was drafted, and served first in the infantry, and later as an army doctor, and became prominent in the clandestine military organizations of the Bolsheviks. At the time of the October Revolution, Sklyansky was a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, and was spotted by Trotsky when he took over as People's Commissar for War early in 1918. In his memoirs, Trotsky wrote: Sklyansky was removed from his post in April 1924, and replaced by Mikhail Frunze, and made chairman of the Mossukno state textile trust. He was written out of almost every history of the civil war during the Stalin years although there is \\"no doubt about Sklyansky's crucial role in the conduct of military affairs.\\"  Death by Drowning  In May 1925, Sklyansky left on a tour of Germany, France, and the United States to acquire technical information. He arrived in the USA in August, and four days later, on 27 August, went on a boat trip in Long Lake, in the Adirondack Mountains in Hamilton County, New York) along with , the first head of Amtorg Trading Corporation. Both men were drowned. The high- ranking Soviet defector Boris Bazhanov was convinced that Sklyansky had been drowned on Stalin's orders, and the alleged accident had been organized by and Genrikh Yagoda.David W. Doyle, ed. Bazhanov and the Damnation of Stalin. Ohio University Press (1990), p. 66. Sklyansky's and Khurgin's funeral, on Broadway on 31 August, which drew a crowd of about 500, was said to be New York city's \\"first Soviet funeral\\". A large wreath sent by Trotsky was prominently displayed. The speakers included the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, who had been staying with Khurgin in New York, and was thrown into gloom by his death. According to Mayakovsky's biographer: \\"He never wrote a line about Khurgin's death.

Nassau was laid down on 22 July 1907 at the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven, and launched less than a year later on 7 March 1908, approximately 25 months after Dreadnought. She was the lead ship of her class of four battleships, which included , , and . Nassau saw service in the North Sea at the beginning of World War I, in II Division of I Battle Squadron of the German High Seas Fleet. In August 1915, she entered the Baltic Sea and participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga, where she engaged the Russian battleship . Following her return to the North Sea, Nassau and her sister ships took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1916. During the battle, Nassau collided with the British destroyer . Nassau suffered a total of 11 killed and 16 injured during the engagement. After World War I, the bulk of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. As they were the oldest German dreadnoughts, the Nassau-class ships were for the time permitted to remain in German ports. After the German fleet was scuttled, Nassau and her three sisters were surrendered to the victorious Allied powers as replacements for the sunken ships. Nassau was ceded to Japan in April 1920. With no use for the ship, Japan sold her to a British wrecking firm which then scrapped her in Dordrecht, Netherlands.  Description  Line drawing of a Nassau-class battleship showing the disposition of the main battery Design work on the Nassau class began in late 1903 in the context of the Anglo-German naval arms race; at the time, battleships of foreign navies had begun to carry increasingly heavy secondary batteries, including Italian and American ships with guns and British ships with guns, outclassing the previous German battleships of the with their secondaries. German designers initially considered ships equipped with secondary guns, but erroneous reports in early 1904 that the British s would be equipped with a secondary battery of guns prompted them to consider an even more powerful ship armed with an all-big-gun armament consisting of eight guns. Over the next two years, the design was refined into a larger vessel with twelve of the guns, by which time Britain had launched the all-big-gun battleship . Nassau was long, wide, and had a draft of . She displaced with a normal load, and fully laden. The ship had a crew of 40 officers and 968 enlisted men. Nassau retained three-shafted triple expansion engines with twelve coal-fired water-tube boilers instead of more advanced turbine engines. Her propulsion system was rated at and provided a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . This type of machinery was chosen at the request of both Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz and the Navy's construction department; the latter stated in 1905 that the \\"use of turbines in heavy warships does not recommend itself.\\" This decision was based solely on cost: at the time, Parsons held a monopoly on steam turbines and required a 1 million gold mark royalty fee for every turbine engine made. German firms were not ready to begin production of turbines on a large scale until 1910. Nassau carried twelve SK L/45 guns in an unusual hexagonal configuration. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve SK L/45 guns and sixteen SK L/45 guns, all of which were mounted in casemates. The ship was also armed with six submerged torpedo tubes. One tube was mounted in the bow, another in the stern, and two on each broadside, on either ends of the torpedo bulkhead. The ship's belt armor was thick in the central portion of the hull, and the armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick sides, and the conning tower was protected with of armor plating.  Service history  Nassau early in her career, Nassau was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Bayern, as a replacement for the old . She was laid down on 22 July 1907 at the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven, under construction number 30. Construction work proceeded under absolute secrecy; detachments of soldiers were tasked with guarding the shipyard itself, as well as contractors that supplied building materials, such as Krupp. The ship was launched on 7 March 1908; she was christened by Princess Hilda of Nassau, and the ceremony was attended by Kaiser Wilhelm II and Prince Henry of the Netherlands, representing his wife's House of Orange-Nassau. Fitting-out work was delayed significantly when a dockyard worker accidentally removed a blanking plate from a large pipe, which allowed a significant amount of water to flood the ship. The ship did not have its watertight bulkheads installed, so the water spread throughout the ship and caused it to list to port and sink to the bottom of the dock. The ship had to be pumped dry and cleaned out, which proved to be a laborious task. The ship was completed by the end of September 1909. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 October 1909, and trials commenced immediately. , the ship that spurred Nassaus construction, had been launched 25 months before Nassau, on 2 February 1906. Nassau and the rest of I Battle Squadron in Kiel before the war On 16 October 1909, Nassau and her sister participated in a ceremony for the opening of the new third entrance in the Wilhelmshaven Naval Dockyard. They took part in the annual maneuvers of the High Seas Fleet in February 1910 while still on trials. Nassau finished her trials on 3 May and joined the newly created I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. Over the next four years, the ship participated in the regular series of squadron and fleet maneuvers and training cruises. The one exception was the summer training cruise for 1912 when, due to the Agadir Crisis, the cruise only went into the Baltic. On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began. The threat of war caused Kaiser Wilhelm II to cancel the cruise after two weeks, and by the end of July the fleet was back in port. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out on the 28th, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict. World War I Nassau participated in most of the fleet advances into the North Sea throughout the war. The first operation was conducted primarily by Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers; the ships bombarded the English coastal towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby on 15‚Äì16 December 1914. A German battlefleet of 12 dreadnoughts‚Äîincluding Nassau‚Äîand eight pre-dreadnoughts sailed in support of the battlecruisers. On the evening of 15 December, they came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes in the darkness between the rival destroyer screens convinced the German fleet commander, Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, that the entire Grand Fleet was deployed before him. Under orders from the Kaiser to not risk the fleet, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back towards Germany. = Battle of the Gulf of Riga = Nassau underway In August 1915, the German fleet attempted to clear the Gulf of Riga to facilitate the capture of Riga by the German Army. To do so, the German planners intended to drive off or destroy the Russian naval forces in the area, which included the pre- dreadnought battleship and a number of gunboats and destroyers. The German naval force would also lay a series of minefields in the northern entrance to the gulf to prevent Russian naval reinforcements from being able to enter the area. The fleet that assembled for the assault included Nassau and her three sister ships, the four s, and the battlecruisers , , and . The force would operate under the command of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper. The eight battleships were to provide cover for the forces engaging the Russian flotilla. The first attempt on 8 August was unsuccessful, as it had taken too long to clear the Russian minefields to allow the minelayer to lay a minefield of her own. On 16 August 1915, a second attempt was made to enter the gulf: Nassau and Posen, four light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats managed to breach the Russian defenses. On the first day of the assault, the German minesweeper T 46 was sunk, as was the destroyer V 99. The following day, Nassau and Posen engaged in an artillery duel with Slava, resulting in three hits on the Russian ship that forced her to retreat. By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the gulf. Reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the Germans to call off of the operation the following day. Nassau and Posen remained in the Gulf until 21 August, and while there assisted in the destruction of the gunboats and . Admiral Hipper later remarked that, > \\"To keep valuable ships for a considerable time in a limited area in which > enemy submarines were increasingly active, with the corresponding risk of > damage and loss, was to indulge in a gamble out of all proportion to the > advantage to be derived from the occupation of the Gulf before the capture > of Riga from the land side.\\" = Battle of Jutland = Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1916 Nassau took part in the inconclusive Battle of Jutland on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1916, in II Division of I Battle Squadron. For the majority of the battle, I Battle Squadron formed the center of the line of battle, behind Rear Admiral Behncke's III Battle Squadron, and followed by Rear Admiral Mauve's elderly pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron. Nassau was the third ship in the group of four, behind Rheinland and ahead of Westfalen; Posen was the squadron's flagship. When the German fleet reorganized into a nighttime cruising formation, the order of the ships was inadvertently reversed, and so Nassau was the second ship in the line, astern of Westfalen. Between 17:48 and 17:52, eleven German dreadnoughts, including Nassau, engaged and opened fire on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; Nassaus target was the cruiser . Nassau is believed to have scored one hit on Southampton, at approximately 17:50 at a range of , shortly after she began firing. The shell struck Southampton obliquely on her port side, and did not cause significant damage. Nassau then shifted her guns to the cruiser ; firing ceased by 18:10. At 19:33, Nassau came into range of the British battleship ; her main guns fired briefly, but after the 180-degree turn by the German fleet, the British ship was no longer within reach. Nassau and the rest of I Squadron were again engaged by British light forces shortly after 22:00, including the light cruisers , , and . Nassau followed her sister Westfalen in a 68¬∞ turn to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might have been fired. The two ships fired on Caroline and Royalist at a range of around . The British ships turned away briefly, before turning about to launch torpedoes. Caroline fired two at Nassau; the first passed close to her bows and the second passed under the ship without exploding. Damage to HMS Spitfire after being rammed by Nassau At around midnight on 1 June, the German fleet was attempting to pass behind the British Grand Fleet when it encountered a line of British destroyers. Nassau came upon the destroyer , and in the confusion, attempted to ram her. Spitfire tried to evade, but could not maneuver away fast enough, and the two ships collided. Nassau fired her forward 11-inch guns at the destroyer. They could not depress low enough for Nassau to be able to score a hit; nonetheless, the blast from the guns destroyed Spitfires bridge. At that point, Spitfire was able to disengage from Nassau, and took with her a 6 m (20 ft) portion of Nassaus side plating. The collision disabled one of Nassaus 15 cm (5.9 in) guns, and left a 3.5 m (11.5 ft) gash above the waterline; this slowed the ship to until it could be repaired. During the confused action, Nassau was hit by two shells from the British destroyers, which damaged her searchlights and inflicted minor casualties. Shortly after 01:00, Nassau and encountered the British armored cruiser . Th√ºringen opened fire first, and pummeled Black Prince with a total of 27 heavy-caliber shells and 24 shells from her secondary battery. Nassau and joined in, followed by . The heavy fire quickly disabled the British cruiser and set her alight; following a tremendous explosion, she sank, taking her entire crew with her. The sinking Black Prince was directly in the path of Nassau; to avoid the wreck, the ship had to steer sharply towards III Battle Squadron. It was necessary for Nassau to reverse her engines to full speed astern to avoid a collision with . Nassau then fell back into a position between the pre-dreadnoughts and . At around 03:00, several British destroyers attempted another torpedo attack on the German line. At approximately 03:10, three or four destroyers appeared in the darkness to port of Nassau; at a range of between to , Nassau briefly fired on the ships before turning away 90¬∞ to avoid torpedoes. Following her return to German waters, Nassau, her sisters Posen and Westfalen, and the Helgoland-class battleships and Th√ºringen, took up defensive positions in the Jade roadstead for the night. In the course of the battle, Nassau was hit twice by secondary shells, though these hits caused no significant damage. Her casualties amounted to 11 men killed and 16 men wounded. During the course of the battle, she fired 106 main battery shells and 75 rounds from her secondary guns. Repairs were completed quickly, and Nassau was back with the fleet by 10 July 1916. = Later operations = A recognition drawing prepared by the Royal Navy, with Nassaus main battery turned to starboard Another fleet advance followed on 18‚Äì22 August, during which the I Scouting Group battlecruisers were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. As only two of the four German battlecruisers were still in fighting condition, three dreadnoughts were assigned to the Scouting Group for the operation: , , and the newly commissioned . The High Seas Fleet, including Nassau, would trail behind and provide cover. At 06:00 on 19 August, Westfalen was torpedoed by the British submarine north of Terschelling; the ship remained afloat and was detached to return to port. The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Admiral Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. Another sortie into the North Sea followed on 19‚Äì20 October. On 21 December, Nassau ran aground in the mouth of the Elbe. She was able to free herself, and repairs were effected in Hamburg at the Reihersteig Dockyard until 1 February 1917. The ship was part of the force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23‚Äì25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage and had to be towed back to port. Nassau, Ostfriesland, and Th√ºringen were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlu√üstein, a planned occupation of Saint Petersburg. On 8 August, Nassau took on 250 soldiers in Wilhelmshaven and then departed for the Baltic. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August, and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd. Nassau and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the Grand Admiral (Gro√üadmiral) of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to improve Germany's bargaining position, despite the expected casualties. Many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on Th√ºringen and then on several other battleships mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. = Fate = Following the German collapse in November 1918, a significant portion of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. Nassau and her three sisters were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained at German ports. During this period, from November to December, Hermann Bauer served as the ship's commander. On 21 June 1919, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, under the mistaken impression that the Armistice would expire at noon that day, ordered his ships be scuttled to prevent their seizure by the British. As a result, the four Nassau-class ships were ceded to the various Allied powers as replacements for the ships that had been sunk. Nassau was awarded to Japan on 7 April 1920, though the Japanese had no need for the ship. They, therefore, sold her in June 1920 to British shipbreakers, who scrapped the ship in Dordrecht.

Though Akilam the scripture of Ayyavazhi does not point out any symbol directly, there are a few symbols which are used for representing Ayyavazhi which came into practice gradually. Amongst these, the Lotus with Namam, which is the symbolic summary of Akilam, is the commonly used and most accepted symbol.  Lotus and namam  Thangal near Thiruvattar, Tamil Nadu. The symbol of the Ayyavazhi is a lotus carrying a flame-shaped white 'Namam'.Tha. Krushnanathan's Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, Thinai veliyeetagam, p. 108. The lotus represents the 1,008-petalled Sahasrara (in Tamil, Ladam) and the Namam represents the Aanma Jyothi or atman, sometimes translated as \\"soul\\" or \\"self\\". There are references for Thirunamam in both primary and secondary scriptures, Akilattirattu AmmanaiAkilam15:39 \\"Petti ceelai Uduthu Periya Thirunama Pottumittu\\" and Arul Nool.Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram, First Act. (source: N. Vivekanandan's Arul Nool - Moolamum Uraiyum, page 62 Though the overall consideration of the whole contents of Akilam focuses on the concept derived from the symbol 'Lotus carrying Namam', it seems that there is no direct reference for it in the scriptures. But according to some legends this symbol was in use in Ayyavazhi from the early forties of the twentieth century.There is no written reference to this but there is a painting at the residence of Bala Prajapathi Adikalar which was considered not less than 50 years old. There are also oral traditions which suggests the same age for this symbolism. Since the Sahasrara is symbolised as Lotus, no stem is drawn while designing art of the symbol. Seven(up) + seven(down) petals are used commonly. Also a new way of architecture is being developed in constructing Nizhal Thangals in which the inverted Lotus petals (as in sahasrara) are used as a design over the roof.See this Image :Image:Nelli Nintra Vilai Thangal.png, a Nizhal Thangal constructed in such a way of architecture near Marthandam, Tamil Nadu. The Sahasrara, symbolised in Ayyavazhi as 'Lotus carrying Namam' The mythical narration of akilam about the eight yugas is often viewed philosophically as eight chakras.A. Arisundara Mani's Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai (Additional), pages XII-XIII, \\"Athara thana vilakka attavanai\\". The first Neetiya Yukam as Bindu and the final state of absolute bliss, Sahasrara is said to be the Dharma Yukam. In this series the energy of consciousness of oneself is to be raised from Bindu (Neetiya Yukam) to the final Sahasrara (Dharma Yukam) to experience the absolute 'bliss'.A. Arisundara Mani (2002), Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, Ayya Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam, page 374. The reigning power in the final Dharma Yukam(Sahasrara) is Ekam or the supreme absolute, and thus the Ayyavazhi's symbol seems to be derived from Akilam. And the symbol of Ayyavazhi, 'Lotus with Namam' shows it; Vaikundar is being experienced in Sahasrara. As per Hindu legends this Sahasrara chakra has '1000 petals' . But in Ayyavazhi symbolism it was considered as 1008. In Akilam or Arul Nool there are no verses to treat this term '1000' but quite commonly the number '1008' is mentioned. Also the year of incarnation of Vaikundar is 1008 M.E. On backing these scriptural backgrounds, 1008 petal arrangement is followed in Ayyavazhi symbolism.  Other phenomenological symbols  Akilam clearly points to the 'Flame shaped' single white Namam and its ideology clearly focuses on the importance of the '1008 petaled' Lotus. But there are traces that the Vaishnavite triple Namam is being used though rarely in Ayyavazhi. The northern entrance of the Swamithope pathi carries such a form of Namam with the Holy Conch and the Chakra(of Vishnu) on its two sides. Secondly, the Palaramachandran version of Akilathirattu also carries similar Namam until the ninth impression, while it has been replaced by the Single white Namam from the tenth impression onwards. This is one of the phenomenological variations that is seen in the late 19th and the early 20th century Ayyavazhi. It is evident that this symbol, ' Lotus and Namam ' has been used in Ayyavazhi from the mid-twentieth century. There is also a practice of using 'Garuda' as the symbol of Ayyavazhi. The previous flag mast of Swamithope pathi which was replaced by the new one in the 1980s, mounts a brass image (idol) of Garuda at the top. In Ambala Pathi still the flag mast carries an idol of Garuda. The practice of using Conch and Chakra (of Vishnu) also seems to be current. A stone carving at Vadava mugam (possibly of late 19th century C.E), the northern entrance of Swamithope pathi includes this ' Conch & Chakra '. As per Akilam the Chakra of Vishnu is bought as boon by Kaliyan and now it is with him. So the basic logic of Akilam is against these practices. Again, using idols and personifications is heavily countered by Akilam, but is still in practice among a minority section of the followers. Also there is a practice of using only the 'Thirunamam' without the 1008 Petaled Lotus. This too is occasionally in practice.

Design and development The need for monitors for shelling enemy positions from the English Channel had become apparent only at the start of the war and they were designed with some haste. The design of monitors had been given by the Director of Naval Construction, Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, to an Assistant Constructor, Charles S. Lillicrap (later himself to become Director). By the time the Marshal Neys came about some 33 monitors of various sorts had already been ordered. The redesign of the battlecruisers and meant that there were now two modern 15-inch turrets available. The First Sea Lord Lord Fisher and Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty decided these should be used for two more monitors, initially M 13 and M 14, but then renamed after the French Napoleonic War marshals Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult and Michel Ney. For machinery the two monitors received diesel engines, which were then a novelty ‚Äì the majority of ships being steam powered. The use of diesels meant that they had no need of boiler rooms which went well with a low draught, nor of large funnels which reduced the amount of superstructure. These engines were originally designed for much smaller freighters and therefore they proved particularly slow and unreliable. The turret was on multi-sided barbette made of individual flat plates, cutting down on the build time. The guns were disposed along her sides for protection from smaller vessels, the guns being for anti-aircraft use.

History By the late 1870s there was a distinct need for a powerful type of locomotive to operate the steep section of the Main South Line between Dunedin and Oamaru. As the success of the K class demonstrated the suitability of American locomotives to New Zealand's railways, an order was placed with the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1879 for six 2-8-0 tender locomotives. Based on a design already used for the Denver and Rio Grande, it was much less decorative than the K class, but this did not detract from its performance capabilities. The largest and most powerful locomotives in the country upon their introduction, the backhead of the boiler protruded a very long way into the cab leaving very little room for the driver or fireman. The Baldwin and Rogers locomotives reflected the styling adopted in the 1870s by American builders with elements from the Renaissance Revival and Neo-Baroque architectural styles, and with Islamic e.g. Moorish (from Alhambra) influences. Bold colours and painted decorations were used. Many Baldwin locomotives were in Olive Green ground colour, although the Baldwin N and O classes of the 1880s had Tuscan Red ground colour. New Zealand's Early American Locomotives: The Design, Art and Architecture of the K, T and O Class Locomotives Part 2 by David Fletcher: \\"New Zealand Railfan\\", March 2015 pages 33-49: Volume 21 No 2 In service Because of its small diameter driving wheels, the T class was typically limited to a speed of . Accordingly, it was usually assigned to freight trains. In their heyday, the T class generally hauled services on the Otago Central Railway and the Main South Line between Dunedin and Oamaru. Around the beginning of the 20th century, the class received new boilers of a Belpaire design, fitted with Westinghouse air brakes and two were moved north to Auckland to assist on the newly opened North Island Main Trunk Railway. Most were also fitted with steel cabs in place of the original wooden ones, although the design fitted varied from one locomotive to another. As time progressed, more powerful, newer locomotives progressively displaced the T class, with the four South Island-based members of the class (103-106) known to have been relegated to the quiet, lowly trafficked Tokarahi Branch. A number of the class were modified for use as yard shunters. This involved the fitting of a tender cab and moving the tender body back on the frame to provide more room for the fireman. Withdrawal and disposal The first T class locomotive was withdrawn in 1922, with the last example withdrawn in 1924. Some managed to survive long enough to be dumped or have components dumped when the NZR started dumping locomotives for embankment protection in 1926.

It was built in 1707 for Septimus Cyprian Thornton and was acquired by the Duchess of Rutland, from whom it descended to General Lord Robert Manners (1721‚Äì1782). It was enlarged in 1772 by the addition of a north wing by architect Lewis Vulliamy. It passed to his son George Manners (1763‚Äì1828), High Sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1826, who further enlarged and renovated the hall to the designs of Vulliamy, adding a stable block (now also Grade II listed). He died unmarried, leaving the estate to his great-niece Mary, who married Robert Dundas, later Robert Nisbet-Hamilton, MP and Privy Counsellor. He died in 1887 leaving an only daughter Mary Georgiana, who predeceased him, having married Henry Olgilvy. The Olgilvys had lived at one of their several Scottish homes and Bloxholm was sold.

Summary  Hitodama are mentioned in literature from ancient times. In the Man'y≈çsh≈´, there is the following poem: They are frequently confused with onibi and kitsunebi, but since hitodama are considered to be the \\"appearance of souls that have left the body and fly through the air,\\" they are strictly speaking a different general idea. Concerning their shape and nature, there are common features throughout Japan, but some differences could also be seen depending on the area. They fly crawling along at an elevation that is not very high. They have a color that is blue, orange, or red, and also have a tail, but it can either be short or long. There are also a few that have been seen during daytime. In the Okinawa Prefecture, hitodama are called , and in Nakijin, they are said to appear before a child is born and in some areas are also said to be mysterious flames that drive off humans to death. In Kawakami, Inba District, Chiba Prefecture, (now Yachimata), hitodama are called and are said to come out of the body 2 or 3 days after a human dies, and go toward temples or people they have a deep relation with and are said to make a great sound in storm shutters and gardens, but it is said that this sound can only be heard by those who have a deep relation with the spirit. Also, for those who have not seen a by the time they are 28 years of age, a would come towards them saying \\"let's meet, let's meet (aimashou, aimashou)\\" so even those who have not seen one when they are 28 years old will pretend to have seen one.  Theories  According to one theory, \\"since funerals before the war were burials, so it would be common for the phosphorus that come from the body to react to the rain water on rainy nights and produce light, and the meager knowledge about science from the masses produced the idea of hitodama.\\" Another possibility is that they come from fireflies, of which three species are common in Japan: Luciola cruciata (, Genji hotaru; meaning ‚ÄûGenji¬¥s firefly‚Äú), Luciola lateralis (, Heike hotaru; meaning \\"firefly from Heike\\"), and Colophotia praeusta. All these snail-eating beetles and their larvae are famous for their ability to make special body parts glow (bioluminescence) and make them blink rhythmically. Every year at the Fusa-park in Tokyo the legendary feast Hotarugari (; meaning \\"firefly catching\\") is celebrated. They have also been thought to possibly be misrecognitions of shooting stars, animals that have luminous bryophytes attached to them, gasses that come from swamps, light bulbs, or visual hallucinations. There have also been some \\"artificial hitodama\\" created using combustible gases (an experiment in 1976 by the Meiji University professor, Masao Yamana using methane gas). In the 1980s, the Yoshiko Ootsuki posited the idea that they are \\"plasma from the air.\\" However, there are some hitodama that cannot be explained by the above theories, so they are thought to come from various phenomena.

The southern Russian city of Taganrog began as one of Russia's first planned cities under Peter the Great. To protect the newly conquered Sea of Azov region, the Russians opened a naval base there in 1698 and a city and seaport were built. However, after the Turkish victory in the war of 1710‚Äì1711, Taganrog city and port were demolished prior to handover to the Turks. After further conflicts the place finally became part of Russia under Catherine the Great following the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì74. The re-founded city was populated by Greek colonists. The oldest extant church in the city, St. Nicholas Church, was built in 1778 and the Bell of Chersonesos was originally cast for it. Much further development took place under the city governor Balthasar von Campenhausen in the early 19th century. Tsar Alexander I had a palace in the city and died there in 1825. During the Crimean War Taganrog came under siege by the English and French in 1855, but was not captured. The playwright Nestor Kukolnik, a resident of Taganrog, had a part in the city's further development; it grew to be one of the leading industrial and commercial centres of Southern Russia, while the Taganrog Theatre contributed to its cultural life. Taganrog was General Denikin's headquarters during the Russian Civil War. After the Soviet victory it joined Ukrainian SSR, transferring to Russian SFSR in 1924. Under German occupation in World War II between 1941 and 1943, thousands of residents, particularly Jews, were murdered by the SS. Through the Soviet and post-Soviet periods Taganrog has retained its importance as an industrial and technological centre. Ancient history The excavations conducted by the German Archaeological Institute () led by Ortwin Dally and Don Archaeological Society, led to the conclusion that there was a Greek settlement in the place of the modern-day Taganrog, founded in the late 7th century BC.Summary of the Taganrog project on DAI web site It played an important role in the course of the early Greek colonization of the Black Sea region, and was founded probably soon after Berezan and Histria, it is anyway much older than the first settlements and colonies in the Cimmerian Bosporus (Strait of Kerch) or Tanais that were founded between 580 and 60 BC. Name of settlement According to scientists, this may be the location of the ancient town of ŒöœÅŒ∑ŒºŒΩŒøŒØ (Greek: Kremnoi) as mentioned by Herodotus (also spelled Cremna, Cremnoi, or ). According to Herodotus, the settlement was on the coast of Palus Maeotis.Results of the German-Russian excavations in Taganrog in 2007German-Russian archaeological excavations in 2006German- Russian excavations in 2005Revealing the Mysteries of MeotideDeutsches Arch√§ologisches Institut Jahresbericht 2008.

The name Crimea may also have derived from this ancient town. Foundation of Taganrog Saint Trinity fortress and seaport of Taganrog, established by the Austrian engineer Baron . (Collection of Taganrog City Architectural Development Museum.) Tsar Peter I of Russia tried to conquer the Turkish fortress of Azov (near the mouth of the River Don) to get access to the Sea of Azov and thus to the Black Sea. His first Azov campaign in 1695 failed, but his second attempt the next year led to victory. To keep Azov in his possession and to hold off the Ottoman Turkish navy, the tsar gave orders to expand his small war fleet, built during the winter of 1695‚Äì1696. Peter put the Azov Flotilla under the command of Admiral Fyodor Golovin, a Russian nobleman who succeeded the Swiss Fran√ßois Lefort (died 1699) as Peter's military supremo, Golovin was assisted by Vice-Admiral Cornelis Cruys and by Rear-Admiral Jan van Rees. Tsar Peter I officially founded the first Russian naval base, Taganrog (Turkish form: Taygan in Ottoman sources) on September 12, 1698. Taganrog became one of the first Russian cities built according to a detailed plan. Vice-Admiral Cornelis Cruys, who is regarded as the architect of the Russian navy, became the first mayor of Taganrog city in 1698‚Äì1702; in 1711 he produced the first maps of the Sea of Azov and of the Don River. The project for planning and building works in the city was established in 1698, based on the instructions provided by the tsar. City development in the 18th century In 1704 the ploughing of virgin lands started. Next year were planted the imperial vineyard and orchards. The building and construction of the seaport, fortress and town were generally completed by the end of the first decade of the 18th century. The seaport of Taganrog represented an irregular water surface of some 774,000 square meters; it was the first artificial seaport in Russia. Boyar Aleksei Shein was in charge for construction of the haven. The pentagonal fortress was erected on the Cape. Inside the fortress were built stone living-quarters for soldiers and civil population. By the middle of 1711, according to the information of Mandating Chamber of Taganrog, there were over 8000 inhabitants in Taganrog. As the development of the social life in the region progressed, Taganrog retained its military and administrative significance and gradually became the handicraft and commerce center. In 1700‚Äì1711, the Azov Sea Navy was the guardian of Russia's Southern frontiers. But in 1710 Turkey unleashed a new war against Russia. Russian troops commanded by Boris Sheremetev were surrounded by superior Turkish forces near Prut River. The Russian tsar had to sign Treaty of the Pruth returning Azov to Turkey and destroying Taganrog. On September 19, 1711 by the order of Peter the Great, Taganrog was demolished and in February 1712 Russian troops left the town. For fifty years the seaport, fortress and town laid in ruins. Taganrog begins again The Turks recaptured it twice (1712 and 1739), but it was taken by the Russians in 1769 and definitively ceded by Turkey in the Treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji (1774). On April 2, 1769 Russian troops entered Taganrog. The city was refounded by Catherine the Great, who issued a decree addressed to the Vice-Admiral Aleksey Senyavin. Taganrog was populated by Greek colonists who, like the Greeks of classical times, took refuge from poverty or tyranny in townships around the northern Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Some Greeks had been Mediterranean pirates and were now tycoons; many lived by cheating Russian farmers and bribing Russian customs officials. They spread wealth, not only by conspicuous consumption, but by generous civic arts, founding orchestras, clubs, schools and churches, bringing in French chefs and importing Italian sculptors. Ioannis Varvakis and Achilles Alferaki are the most famous Greeks of Taganrog. The bell of Chersonesos The bell of Chersonesos or \\"the fog bell of Chersonesos\\" is considered by many as \\"one of Taganrog's sights located abroad\\", which even became a symbol of another city ‚Äì Sevastopol or to be more exact, the symbol of Chersonesos Taurica. The bell of Chersonesos. The fog bell was cast in 1778 from the trophy Turkish cannons seized by the Russian Imperial Army during Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774). The bell features depictions of patron saints of sailors: Saint Nicholas and Saint Phocas and the following phrase can still be read today in , which literary means \\"This bell was cast in the Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker Church in Taganrog from the trophy Turkish artillery...weight...pounds. Year 1778, month of August, on the date of ....\\". The bell was cast before the foundation of Sevastopol for the Saint Nicholas church in Taganrog, which was the Russian Navy's military base at that time. Until 1803 the St.Nicholas Church was subordinated to the Navy ministry. After Sevastopol became main Russian navy base in the South of Russia, the Emperor Alexander I ordered the bell to be transported to Sevastopol to be fitted in the Church of St. Nicholas which was being constructed there, with other bells and church plates also given over to the city of Sevastopol. 19th century Taganrog's Harbor in the late 18th/early 19th century. In 1802 H.M. Alexander I of Russia signed a decree establishing the city of Taganrog as a governorate (incorporated municipality with privileges given by royal charter). In 1805, Baron Balthasar von Campenhausen was appointed by Alexander I of Russia Governor of Taganrog and for his achievements he is still considered the best Head of Taganrog of all times. Campenhausen achievements include: * The Taganrog Customs district; * The new slope to the haven; * New stone storehouses for goods; * The start of construction of coasting vessels for transportation of goods to other Russian ports on Black and Azov Seas; * Inauguration of the navigation school, the commercial gymnasium and the commercial court; * The Construction and Building Committee that planned the future city architectural development; * Introducing oil lighting in the streets; * Starting the paving and greening of the streets; * In April 1806, founding the Gorky Park (Taganrog). Two streets in Taganrog were later named after Campenhausen: Bolshoy Kampenkhauzensky (now: Komsomolsky) and Malo-Kampenkhauzensky (now: Spartakovsky). Tsar Alexander I also left his mark on the city. He came to Taganrog for spiritual solace at the end of his reign, and settled in a modest single-storeyed palace. Soon after moving to Taganrog he died ‚Äì at least, it was announced that he did. Rumors arose that he ran off to Siberia and became a holy man, and that the body of a soldier who resembled him was used in the funeral. Taganrog was briefly a shadow capital of the empire. Carpet on which Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) stood to pray after death of Alexander I of Russia from Alexander I Palace in Taganrog. \\"Blessed Be the Place where You Prayed. 1826!\\" in April 1833, there happened in Taganrog an important event in Italian history ‚Äì though the city's inhabitants were not aware of it at the time: Giuseppe Garibaldi, who came to Taganrog as a young merchant marine captain in charge of the schooner Clorinda carrying a shipment of oranges, met fellow-Italian Giovanni Battista Cuneo in a seaport inn and was convinced to join the revolutionary movement which was to take up the rest of his life (see Garibaldi Monument in Taganrog.) Russian playwright and poet Nestor Kukolnik who settled in Taganrog in 1857 influenced a lot the way the city and the neighboring area developed. Kukolnik was the first to prove the need of university education in the Don River region and on Azov Sea. His offer to open a university in Taganrog was not successful, but later it proved to be an important foundation for opening the Novorossiysk University in 1865. Kukolnik also proved necessity of a newspaper in Taganrog. It was one of the reasons to open newspaper-publishing houses not only in Taganrog, but also in Odessa and Rostov-on-Don. Since 1865 Nestor Kukolnik led the workgroup that proved necessity of a railroad line from Kharkiv to Taganrog. This work was success and Russian tsar Alexander II of Russia approved the project in 1868. He also was the first to raise the issue of environmental protection of the Gulf of Taganrog. But the related project encountered strong resistance from regional leadership and was not realized. Nestor Kukolnik assisted in opening the county court in Taganrog, open after his death in 1869. In 1887, the Taganrog's status as a borough (Taganrog Governorate) was annulled, and Taganrog was annexed to the Don Voisko Province. According to the \\"City Statute\\" of 1870, the City Council (Duma) was established in Taganrog for managing local development, trade, healthcare and public education. The siege of Taganrog in Crimean War In spring 1855, the allied English-French commandment decided to send an expedition corps into the Azov Sea to undermine Russian communications and supplies to besieged Sevastopol. On May 12, 1855 English-French war ships entered the Kerch Strait and destroyed the coast battery of the Kamishevaya Bay. On May 21, 1855 the gunboats and armed steamers attacked the seaport of Taganrog, the most important hub in terms of its proximity to Rostov on Don and due to vast resources of food, especially bread, wheat, barley and rye that were amassed in the city after the outbreak of Crimean War that put an end to its exportation. The governor-general of Taganrog, Yegor Tolstoy and Lieutenant-General Ivan Krasnov refused the ultimatum, responding that Russians never surrender their cities. The English- French squadron began a bombardment of Taganrog during 6.5 hours and landed 300 troops near the Old Stone Steps in the downtown Taganrog, who were thrown back by Don Cossacks and volunteer corps. In July 1855, the allied squadron tried to go past Taganrog to Rostov on Don, entering the Don River through the Mius River. On July 12, 1855 the H.M.S. Jasper grounded near Taganrog thanks to a fisherman, who repositioned the buoys into shallow waters. The cossacks captured the gunboat with all of its guns and blew it up. The third siege attempt was made August 19‚Äì31, 1855, but the city was already fortified and the squadron could not approach too close for landing operations. The allied fleet left the Gulf of Taganrog on September 2, 1855, with minor military operations along Azov Sea coast continuing until late fall 1855. Bombardment of the city and landing of the troops during Siege of Taganrog on May 22, 1855. Trade and economy development in the 19th century The market played a key role in the city life and influenced also its appearance. From the beginning of the 19th century the city had rich private residences and social buildings. The commercial Taganrog became one of the largest industrial cities of the Russian South. By the end of the 19th century grew the number of educational institutions. During the second half of the 19th century the foreign trade turnover of Taganrog increased distinctly. Already at the beginning of the 20th century Taganrog held the second place in Russia in the importation and the sixth in the quantity of exported products. Due to dramatic developments in domestic commerce, the fairs lost their dominant role, and the stores, these 'eternal trade points' started to appear in the city. Petrovskaya Street and Gogolevski Street turned into main commercial highways of Taganrog. The foreign investments into Russian economy influenced the development of a large-scale industry in Taganrog. In 1896 with Belgian investments, started the construction of the iron-and-steel factory. The factory began to function a year later. The plant produced iron beams, railings, pipes, railway bands, iron sheets, rolled steel. In 1896 the Belgian company Albert Neuve, Wilde & Co started the building of the boiler plant. Besides the boilers, the works produced metallurgical constructions, iron and coppery castings, although it was inferior to the steel plant in the production volume and workers quantity. The tannery, founded in 1853, passed into the hands of the Belgian experts and was distinctly enlarged then. Since the 1870 the roadwork was expanded. By the end of the century the main part of the city streets was already paved. At the same time the greenery was planted in the city center. (View of the Taganrog's Harbor (late 19th century postcard). In 1866, the new city theatre building was erected by the Italian architect Londeron. Thanks to the excellent acoustics of its hall, the Taganrog Theatre gained a nationwide glory. The plays of Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, A.N. Ostrovsky, William Shakespeare were performed here. The special pride of the citizens was the Italian opera, financed by the local merchants, patrons of art. Taganrog theater had its own Italian opera from 1866 to 1875. In 1876, the first City Library was opened by the governor Johan Hampus Furuhjelm. In 1898 the regional museum was founded. In 1907 the first Mirage cinema was built, a few years later the wooden building of the circus was erected. In 1871 the first private newspaper Azovski Vestnik (Azov Bulletin) was established, later renamed Taganrogski Verstnik (Taganrog Bulletin). Among the city intellectuals were artists, musicians and columnists. Civil war and establishment of Soviets Soviet power was established in Taganrog on January 22, 1918. Anton Glushko headed the first local soviet. From March to May 1918, the Ukrainian Soviet government stayed in Taganrog during Ukraine's occupation by German troops. Taganrog itself was under German occupation May ‚Äì August 1918. In August 1918, Don Cossacks took the control of the city. In 1919 General Anton Denikin kept his headquarters at the Avgerino mansion. Red Army troops under command of Nikolay Kuybishev entered the city on December 24, 1919. The remainder of Denikin's troops and the British Consulate were evacuated by . On February 26, 1920 the Military Revolutionary Commission issued the order number 46, closing five foreign consulates that were open in Taganrog at that time (Spanish, Greek, Belgian, Danish and Swedish Consulates). The full power was given to the executive committee of The City Soviet Workers' council on December 17, 1920 and the city joined Ukrainian SSR. However, it was transferred to Russian SFSR in 1924 along with Shakhty Okrug. Taganrog during WWII In World War II, 1941‚Äì1943, Taganrog was occupied by German troops and suffered extensive damage. Two SS divisions entered the city in October 1941 with other military and back divisions to follow. The local government system was replaced by B√ºrgermeisteramt or \\"New Russian local government\\". The SS Einsatzgruppe Sonderkommando 10a performed systematic genocide of Taganrog citizens‚Äîparticularly Jews‚Äîfrom the first days of occupation. According to the information of the State Archive, some 7,000 Taganrogers (1,500 of them children of various age) were shot to death in the Gully of Petrushino.–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–æ–≤–µ–π—à–µ–π –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –†–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏, —Ñ.3. –æ–ø.3, –¥.23 In Taganrog at least 2 Soviet partisans groups were active, organized by NKVD before the Soviet troops left the city; and in November 1941, Semion Morozov organized an underground resistance group, which consisted mainly of young Komsomol members.

Modern period The post-revolution and postwar periods gave a new life to the city. The power machinery engineering, metallurgical production, instrument-making and other industry branches began to develop. The development of science was closely connected with the inauguration of the Taganrog State University of Radio Engineering. In the seventies and eighties, Taganrog was known as an important scientific and industrial center of Southern Russia. Taganrog companies produced: steam-boilers, self-propelled combine harvesters, drill-, casing-, oil-, gas-, and water-pipes, gears for searching fish and other installations. Taganrog products were exported to over 50 countries of the world. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the first economic reforms in the early nineties were very unfavorable for the citizens of Taganrog. The local government of the city and the managers of industrial enterprises made efforts to adapt to the new market economy. They managed to preserve the experienced workforce and improve technological processes. By the end of the twentieth century the production output growth rate reached nearly 400%. Beriev's A-50. The multipurpose amphibian BE-200 has been designed and put into production by Beriev Aircraft Company. This amphibian aircraft has no analogues in the whole world. The TAGMET Iron & Steel Factory applies the most progressive steel casting technology and grafts on its growth rate. Doninvest Finance & Industry Group launched the production of passenger cars under licence of Citro√´n, France and Hyundai, South Korea. The citizens of Taganrog witnessed the inauguration of a new maternity center; a new ophthalmology department for veterans was opened in the Hospital 7. Several new trolley bus and shuttle bus routes have been introduced throughout the city. Digital phone lines have been installed in the city, and videophone communication and high- speed internet access are now widely available. On January 29, 2010 Russian President Dmitri Medvedev visited the city of Taganrog within the framework of the commemorative events for the 150th anniversary of the great Russian writer Anton Chekhov.The President of Russian Federation Dmitri Medvedev participated in celebrating the 150th anniversary of the great Russian writer Anton Chekhov in the writer's home city of Taganrog See also * Azov campaigns * List of governors of Taganrog in 1802‚Äì1888 NotesReferences * Official website of Taganrog * Official website of Taganrog * –°–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ '–¢–∞–≥–∞–Ω—Ä–æ–≥' \\\\–ü—Ä–æ–Ω—à—Ç–µ–π–Ω –ê. –ü. ‚Äì –†–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤-–Ω–∞-–î–æ–Ω—É: –†–æ—Å—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–µ –∫–Ω–∏–∂–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ, 1977 ‚Äì —Å.208 * History of Taganrog by Pavel Filevsky, Moscow, 1898 * Encyclopedia of Taganrog, 2nd edition, Taganrog, 2003 * Eurasia Antiqua, Zeitschrift f√ºr Arch√§ologie Eurasiens, Deutsches Archaeologische Institut, Band 11/2005, Taganrog ","title":"History of Taganrog"},{"id":"3589686","text":"Movement of Animals (or On the Motion of Animals; Greek Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œ∂·ø¥œâŒΩ Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒÆœÉŒµœâœÇ; Latin De Motu Animalium) is one of Aristotle's major texts on biology.

In the early 1840s he began negotiations with China which opened that country to U.S. trade and pointed the way toward the American Open Door Policy a half century later. He was Mayor of Perth Amboy, New Jersey in 1848. Early life Born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, Kearny was appointed Midshipman in the Navy 24 July 1807. Commodore Kearny was known for his tenacity in capturing slave traders in West-Indian waters and his efforts in fighting Greek pirates in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1818, he commanded USS Enterprise of the New Orleans Squadron when he sailed to Galveston, Texas and forced Jean Lafitte to abandon his base without a fight. Pacific Diplomacy=China Some Americans in China suffered during the first Opium War of 1839 as Chinese indignant about British opium traders failed to distinguish between English-speaking people of European ancestry. Commodore Kearny was given command of a squadron consisting of the 42-year-old frigate Constellation and the sloop Boston. Kearny's March 1842 arrival in China reflects the speed of early 19th century communications. Kearny's orders‚Äîto 1) protect the interests of the United States and her citizens along the coast of China, 2) to respect the foreign and domestic policies of the Chinese, and 3) prevent and punish opium smuggling into China by Americans or under the cover of the American flag‚Äîsimilarly reflect the broad discretion given to naval officers who would have to wait months for official response from higher authority.Hanks, Robert J., CAPT USN \\"Commodore Lawrence Kearny, the Diplomatic Seaman\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings November 1970 pp.70-72 The Opium War had ended, but letters from American merchants began arriving aboard as soon as Constellation anchored in Macau. The letters requested protection from the Chinese and demanded reparations for damages. Kearny first issued a ban against American smuggling and then reviewed the reparations claims. Kearny considered some claims valid and others gross overstatements. Viceroy Ke in Guangzhou wrote to the United States Vice Consul: \\"...I have heard that the newly arrived Commodore manages affairs with clear understanding, profound wisdom, and great justice.\\" Ke committed China to abide by Kearny's decisions regarding adjudication of claims, and several hundred thousand dollars were paid to American merchants. Kearny first learned of the Treaty of Nanking when he arrived in Hong Kong. Kearny observed the treaty's provisions opening five Chinese ports to British trade, and sought equal trading opportunity for Americans. Ke offered Kearny a treaty giving Americans fair treatment. Kearny did not have authority to sign such a treaty, but tactfully informed Ke agreement would be forthcoming as soon as authorized negotiators arrived. Caleb Cushing reached China in 1844, and the Treaty of Wanghia was signed on 2 July. Hawaii Hawaiian feather cloak presented to Kearny by King Kamehameha III during his visit. Kearny visited the Hawaiian Islands on his return voyage in July 1843. He discovered King Kamehameha III had ceded the islands to Great Britain under threat of naval bombardment by Lord George Paulet. He received letters of protests from American residents of Honolulu. Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones arrived a short time later on the . Kearny's orders were 3 years old at that point, and English disavowal of Paulet's actions was unknown to either side in Hawaii. Kearny issued a stiff, formal protest against the seizure and refused to recognize its validity until Hawaiian and English representatives settled the matter with United States representatives. England's senior officer in the Pacific, Rear Admiral Thomas, arrived two weeks later with the news Hawaiian sovereignty had been restored. Later career Commodore Kearny later served as Commandant at the Norfolk and New York Naval Shipyards. He retired November 14, 1861. He died in Perth Amboy, New Jersey on November 29, 1868. Namesake USS Kearny (DD-432) was named for him. Kearny Cottage was Kearny's lifelong residence.

He was Master of Balliol College, Oxford in the years 1547‚Äì1555. He was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University during 1552‚Äì3. Widely known as an eloquent preacher, with the deprivation of John Hooper on the accession of Queen Mary, Brooks succeeded him as Bishop of Gloucester by papal provision in 1554 and was consecrated on 1 April. In 1555, Brooks was one of the papal sub-delegates in the Royal Commission for the trial of the Oxford Martyrs, Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley. Brooks was a man not only of learning but also of integrity. He refused to degrade Ridley, probably on the ground that Ridley's consecration in 1547 had been according to the invalid form which was established by law very soon after that date. If, as the Protestant polemicist John Foxe asserts, Brooks refused to degrade Latimer as well, his position may have been based upon the fact that Latimer had lived for several years as a simple clergyman. Brooks died in July or August 1558. He was buried in Gloucester Cathedral, but without a monument.

Studio 2B was a level of Girl Scouting in the Girl Scouts of the USA and consisted of girls between the ages of 11 through 17. GSUSA created the program to attract older girls into the scouting program and replace Cadette and Senior Girl Scouting. History Studio 2B was created as a response to a lack of interest in Girl Scouting in the United States of America. A study named Ten Emerging Truths: New Directions for Girls 11-17 was conducted by the Girl Scout Research Institute (GSRI) and targeted teenaged girls both in and outside of the GSUSA program, volunteers in the program, and the families of the girls. The study found that girls in the 11 through 17 age group wanted to discuss topics that were of interest to them, chose their own activities to participate in, create and be a part of their own program, and be advised by adults they can relate to. Similar studies by the GSRI concluded that nearly a quarter of the girls surveyed had less than three adults they could go to for help. The Girls Scouts of the United States of America developed Studio 2B in October 2002 as a solution to the lack of adult mentors for the young women. The Studio 2B system was totally phased out in 2011. Organization Studio 2B is the largest structural change to GSUSA since the early 1960s. It is based on a concept called the Four B's standing for Become, Belong, Believe, and Build. Activities are organized using a By Girls, For Girls approach. This encourages girls to take charge of the program of activities and make as many of the decisions and arrangements themselves as possible. In supplementing the book of Interest Project Patches, which are similar to Boy Scout merit badges, Studio 2B has Focus Books full of activities that the girls can choose from to earn a charm for their bracelet, or a small slide for their uniform. Like all other Girl Scouts, Studio 2B Scouts pay membership dues and live by the Girl Scout Law and Promise. Studio 2B is designed to cater to individual needs and give girls a positive place to express themselves with help from \\"mentors\\" or \\"advisers\\", who are generally 18 to 29 years of age. Meetings are optional, and girls can scout independently if they do not join a troop. Studio 2B differs from many other Scouting programs because of the absence of the patrol system of organization. Instead, girls are encouraged to form small temporary groups around a common interest, within their Studio 2B troop. Focus Books Focus Books were the Studio 2B equivalent to the Girl Scout Senior and Cadette Interest Project Book. They contained similar activities needed to complete an Interest Project. The Scout could earn a charm for the Studio 2B charm bracelet or slide for the uniform in lieu of a badge. Girls earned awards by meeting goals tailored to their own interests and abilities. Silver Award The Silver Award is the second highest award of the Girl Scouts of the USA. Studio 2B participants between sixth and ninth grades, or aged 11 through 14, could work on the award, but it could only be completed by girls in the seventh through ninth grades, or aged 12 through 14. After earning a series of awards to build her skills, a girl could embark on a project to benefit her community. The prerequisites were changed when the Studio 2B system was phased out in 2011. Gold Award The Gold Award is the highest award of the Girl Scouts of the USA. Studio 2B participants could work on the Gold Award once they were 15 years old or joined tenth grade. The prerequisites were changed when the Studio 2B system was phased out in 2011.

The Scottish State Coach is an enclosed, four- horse-drawn carriage used by the British Royal Family. The coach was built in 1830 for Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, and his family used it for many years until they sold it to William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle, who converted it into a semi-State landau. In 1920, the Keppel family returned the coach to the Royal Family by presenting it as a gift to Queen Mary. Between 1968 and 1969, the coach was extensively remodelled and restored to its original enclosed state. Large glass windows and transparent panels in the roof were added, the Royal Arms and the insignia of the Order of the Thistle were emblazoned onto it and a model of the Crown of Scotland was added on top of the roof. The coach was used for the first time by Queen Elizabeth II during the opening of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1969. It was used by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1977 during the thanksgiving service for her daughter's Silver Jubilee, and also in 1979 during her installation as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports at Dover. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh also used it at Windsor during the Queen's sixtieth birthday celebrations in 1986. The carriage was used for the Order of the Thistle service on at Edinburgh in 1994 and then as a reserve carriage for the State Visit of Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja of Norway at Holyrood the following day. The carriage has been used at least three times for royal weddings: in 1963 to transport the bride and groom during the wedding of Princess Alexandra and Angus Ogilvy, in 2011 to chauffeur the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, and in 2018 to transport the bride and groom during the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank. The coach is usually stored at the Royal Mews, London, where it can be seen by the public.

The arena's attendance record is for the SDSU- Augustana men's game on February 11, 1989, which attracted 9,456 fans./pdf8/796346.pdf?ATCLID=921547&SPSID;=88453&SPID;=7143&DB;_LANG=C&DB;_OEM_ID=15000 Renovations in 1992 and 2004 eliminated some of the bench seating and installed individual seats in parts of the arena. In 2005, an updated scoreboard, sound system, and a new arena floor were installed. In addition to SDSU athletic and school events, Frost Arena has hosted the 2003 NCAA North Central Regional women's basketball tournament, six NCAA North Central Regional men's basketball tournaments, four NCAA Division II Wrestling National Championships, women's WNIT Tournament action in 2007 and 2008, along with numerous concerts and state basketball tournaments. The first nationally televised game from Frost Arena was February 18, 2012, as the Jackrabbits men's basketball team took on the Buffalo Bulls on ESPNU. Designs for a remodel of Frost Arena are in progress. The remodeled arena is proposed to include suites, premium seating, increased concession areas and more restrooms. Plans have not yet been finalized, and have not yet been approved by the South Dakota Board of Regents.

In the Middle Ages Lower Silesia was part of Piast-ruled Poland. It was one of the leading regions of Poland, and its capital Wroc≈Çaw was one of the main cities of the Polish Kingdom. Lower Silesia emerged as a distinctive region during the fragmentation of Poland, in 1172, when the Duchies of Opole and Racib√≥rz, considered Upper Silesia since, were formed of the eastern part of the Duchy of Silesia, and the remaining, western part was since considered Lower Silesia. During the Ostsiedlung, German settlers were invited to settle in the sparsely populated region, which until then had a Polish majority. As a result, the region became largely Germanised in the following centuries. In the late Middle Ages the region fell under the overlordship of the Kingdom of Bohemia, however large parts remained under the rule of local Polish dukes of the Piast dynasty, some up to the 16th and 17th century. Briefly under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Hungary, it fell to the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy in 1526. In 1742, Austria ceded nearly all of Lower Silesia to the Kingdom of Prussia in the Treaty of Berlin, except for the southern part of the Duchy of Nysa. Within the Prussian kingdom, the region became part of the Province of Silesia. In 1871, Lower Silesia was integrated into the German Empire. After World War I, the region became a separate province within the Weimar Republic. After 1945, the main part of the former Prussian province fell to the Republic of Poland, while a smaller part west of the Oder-Neisse line remained within East Germany and historical parts of Austrian Lower Silesia (Jesenicko, Opavsko regions) remained as a part of Czechoslovakia. By 1949, almost the entire indigenous German population was expelled. The region is known for an abundance of historic architecture of various styles, including many castles and palaces, well preserved or reconstructed old towns, numerous spa towns, and historic burial sites of Polish monarchs and consorts (in Wroc≈Çaw, Legnica and Trzebnica).  Geography  Historic Silesia, superimposed on modern international borders: cyan outline = medieval Bohemian crown land (after the loss of Krosno) yellow outline = Prussian Silesia as of 1815 (with Upper Lusatian gains and K≈Çodzko, but without Austrian Silesia) Lower Silesia is located mostly in the basin of the middle Oder River with its historic capital in Wroc≈Çaw. The southern border of Lower Silesia is mapped by the mountain ridge of the Western and Central Sudetes, which since the High Middle Ages formed the border between Polish Silesia and the historic Bohemian region of the present- day Czech Republic. The B√≥br and Kwisa rivers are considered being the original western border with the Lusatias, however, the Silesian Duchy of ≈ªaga≈Ñ reached up to the Neisse river, including two villages (Pechern and Neudorf) on the western shore, which became Silesian in 1413. The later Silesian Province of Prussia further comprised the adjacent lands of historic Upper Lusatia ceded by the Kingdom of Saxony after the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, its westernmost point could be found as far west as the small village of Lindenau (now belonging to the German state of Brandenburg). To the north, Lower Silesia originally stretched up to ≈öwiebodzin and Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie, which was acquired by the Margraves of Brandenburg in 1482. The Barycz river forms the border with historic Greater Poland in the northeast, the Upper Silesian lands lie to the southeast. Administratively Polish Lower Silesia is shared between Lower Silesian Voivodeship (except for the Upper Lusatian counties of Luba≈Ñ and Zgorzelec, and former Bohemian K≈Çodzko), the southern part of Lubusz Voivodeship (i.e. the counties of Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie, Nowa S√≥l, ≈öwiebodzin, ≈ªaga≈Ñ and Zielona G√≥ra with the city of Zielona G√≥ra, as well as western Opole Voivodeship (the counties of Brzeg, Namys≈Ç√≥w and Nysa). The tiny part of the former Duchy of ≈ªaga≈Ñ on the western shore of the Neisse is today part of the Krauschwitz municipality in the G√∂rlitz district of Saxony, the larger Upper Lusatian parts of Prussian Silesia (\\"Silesian Upper Lusatia\\") west of the Neisse comprised the town of G√∂rlitz and the former district of Hoyerswerda, which today forms the northern part of the Saxon G√∂rlitz and Bautzen districts as well as the southern part of the Oberspreewald-Lausitz district in Brandenburg. The southern part of the former Duchy of Nysa, which fell to Austrian Silesia in 1742, namely the Jesen√≠k District and He≈ômanovice, Mnichov and ≈Ωelezn√°, as well as parts of Vrbno pod Pradƒõdem in the Brunt√°l District, today belongs to the Czech Republic.  Sudetes  ≈önie≈ºka The Sudetes are a geologically diverse mountain range that stretches for from the Lusatian Highlands in the west and to the Moravian Gate in the east. They are topographically divided into Western, Central and Eastern Sudetes. The Lower Silesian section of the Sudetes comprises the Jizera Mountains (highest peak: Wysoka Kopa, ), where the tripoint with Upper Lusatia and Bohemia is located near the Smrk summit, along with the adjacent Karkonosze Krkono≈°e (, also known as in ) (highest: border peak of Snƒõ≈æka ≈önie≈ºka ‚Äì highest mountain of Czech Republic, ); Rudawy Janowickie (Skalnik, ); Owl Mountains (Wielka Sowa, ); Stone Mountains (Walig√≥ra ); Wa≈Çbrzych Mountains (Borowa ) and the Kaczawskie Mountains (Skopiec, ) with Ostrzyca, - they surround the Jelenia G√≥ra valley, ; ≈ölƒô≈ºa Massif (Mount ≈ölƒô≈ºa ), massive of Orlick√© hory, Kr√°lick√Ω Snƒõ≈æn√≠k south of historical Kladsko ), Rychlebsk√© hory and Jesen√≠ky ( (Pradƒõd, ) .  Silesian Lowland  The adjacent Silesian Lowland includes the Silesian Lowlands and the Silesian-Lusatian Lowlands. These two lowlands are separated with each other by Dolina Kaczawy, and from the Sudetes by a steep morphological edge located along the Sudeten Marginal Fault, extended from Boles≈Çawiec (the Northwest) to Z≈Çoty Stok (the Southeast). The southern part of the Lowland includes The Sudeten Foreland, consisting of quite low Wzg√≥rze Strzegomskie, , Grupa ≈ölƒô≈ºy (Mount ≈ölƒô≈ºa, ), and Wzg√≥rza Niemcza≈Ñsko- Strzeli≈Ñskie (Gromnik Mountain, ). Lower hills occur also in areas of Obni≈ºenie Sudeckie, ≈öwidnik, and Kotlina Dzier≈ºoniowska. The eastern part of Silesian Lowland consists of the wide Silesian Lowlands, located along banks of the Oder River. The eastern part includes also R√≥wnina Wroc≈Çawska with its surrounding lands: R√≥wnina Ole≈õnicka, Wysoczyzna ≈öredzka, R√≥wnina Grodkowska and Niemodli≈Ñska. Dolina Dolnej Kaczawy (Kotlina Legnicka) separates the Silesian Lowlands from the Silesian-Lusatian Lowlands, which includes Wysoczyzna Lubi≈Ñsko-Chocianowska, Dolina Szprotawy, and wide areas of Bory Dolno≈õlƒÖskie, located to the north from the Boles≈Çawiec-Zgorzelec road. From the North, the lowlands are delimited by Wa≈Ç Trzebnicki, consisting of hills that are long and over high, in comparison to neighboring lowlands, Kobyla Mountain, . The range of hills includes Wzg√≥rza Dalkowskie, Wzg√≥rza Trzebnickie, Wzg√≥rza Twardog√≥rskie, and Wzg√≥rza Ostrzeszowskie. Obni≈ºenie Milicko-G≈Çogowskie, with Kotlina ≈ªmigrodzka and Milicka, is located in the northern part, within the hills. The region of the lowlands is coated with a thick layer of glacial elements (sand, gravel, clay) that covers more diverse relief of the older ground. Generally flat and wide bottoms of the valleys are padded with river settlements. Slopes of the hills over are coated with fertile clays and therefore, to begin with the Paleozoic era, they became the lands for people to settle and cultivate intensively. Later form of economy caused almost complete deforestation of the slopes. Not only fertile grounds, but also the mild climate is conductive to development of agriculture and market gardening. The annual average temperature of the Wroc≈Çaw area is . Average temperature of the hottest month (July) is , and of the coldest month (January). The average amount of rainfall is , with its maximum in July and minimum in February. The snow layer disappears after 45 days. The winds, similar to those appearing in the West side of Poland, are West and Southwest. Sudeten rivers are characterized by changeable water rates, and high pollution resulting from large industrialization of the area. The greatest rivers are Nysa K≈Çodzka, which is the source of drinking water for Wroc≈Çaw (the water is drawn by special channel); Stobrawa, O≈Çawa, ≈ölƒôza, Bystrzyca with its tributaries‚ÄîStrzegomka and Pi≈Çawa; Widawa, ≈öredzka Woda, Kaczawa with Nysa Szalona and Czarna Woda. There is also the largest right-bank tributary of the area, Barycz. The other quite large rivers, B√≥br, Kwisa, and Lusatian Neisse, flow into Oder River beyond Lower Silesian borders. The majority of the rivers is regulated and their basins are improved, which is conductive to the proper water economy. The characteristic feature of the landscape of the lowland is the lack of lakes. The region of Legnica is the only place where a dozen or so of small lakes survived, but the majority of them is already disappearing. The largest one is Jezioro Kunickie (), Jezioro Koskowickie (), Jezioro Ja≈õkowickie () and Tatarak (). In contrast to the number of lakes, there are large groups of artificial ponds founded in Barycz basin, in the Middle Ages. Their total area amounts around , and the largest ponds (Stary Staw, ≈Åosiowy Staw, Staw Niezgoda, Staw Mewi Du≈ºy, and Grabownica) come to . The primeval flora has been transformed significantly as a result of deforestation and cultivation. The largest forest complexes are Bory Dolno≈õlƒÖskie (), Bory Stobrawskie in Stobrawa and Widawa areas, and smaller fragments of forests in Barycz and Oder River valleys. These forests are kind of multi-species deciduous forests, occurring in fertile grounds. The Oder River valley is reach in groups of mixed forests (beech, oak, hornbeam, sycamore maple, and pine). These forests, with protected status, are: Zwierzyniec, Kanig√≥ra near O≈Çawa, Dublany, Kƒôpa Opatowicka near Wroc≈Çaw, Zab√≥r near Przedmo≈õcie, and LubiƒÖ≈º. The other forest areas are The Natural Park in Orsk, the areas of Jod≈Çowice, Wzg√≥rze Joanny near Milicz, and Gola near Twardog√≥ra. Such types of forest like those which are the mainstay for wild game or nurseries, are inaccessible because of permanent fire hazard. Territories partly accessible (marked specially) are located in areas of G√≥ra ≈ölƒÖska, Oborniki ≈ölƒÖskie, Wo≈Çowa, in the Oder River valley, and in Wzg√≥rza Niemcza≈Ñsko-Strzeli≈Ñskie.  Flora  The flora of Lower Silesia is specific and different for each zone. From the bottoms to the top, plants form groups that are arranged in wide or narrow belts, called floral zones. Subsequently, these zones are divided into narrower belts, called vegetation belts. The zone of mountain forest is divided into two belts: subalpine and lower subalpine forest. Above, there is a forestless zone divided into the subalpine belt with dwarf pine, and the alpine belt without shrubs. This vegetation is glacial; the former vegetation‚Äîfrom the Tertiary‚Äîwas destroyed by the climate of the Ice Age. Along with glaciation from the North, some tundra plants appeared, for example downy willow (Salix lapponum) and cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus). The flora of Lower Silesia is strongly influenced by geological and climatic history. The vegetation is formed by species deriving from various geographic regions. Particular regions are represented by: * Central European species: fir (Abies alba), beech (Fagus silvatica), oak (Quercus petraea), maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) * European Syberian species: European spindle-tree (Evonymus europaea), alder (Alnus glutinosa), wicker (Salix purpurea) * Boreal-Sub arctic species: cress (Cardamine pratensis), yellow marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), liverleaf (Hepatica nobilis) * Boreal-Arctic species: bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), dwarf willow (Salix herbacea), black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), Sudetic Lousewort (Pedicularis sudetica), alpine saxifrage (Micranthes nivalis), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), lake quillwort (Iso√´tes lacustris) * Alpine species: Alpine bastard toadflax (Thesium alpinium), Alpine coltsfoot (Homogyne alpina), mountain avens (Geum montanum), mountain pine (Pinus mugo) * Sudetic and Sudetic-Carpathian species: mossy saxifrage (Saxifraga moschata ssp. Basaltica), Sudetic lousewort (Pedicularis sudetica)  Lower subalpine forest  Lower subalpine forest (), , is characterized by deciduous or mixed forest. The fragments of forests similar to natural complexes of pine-fir-beech with admixture of larch, sycamore maple and lime occur near the Szklarski waterfall, in the JagniƒÖtkowski complex, and Chojnik Mountain. Particular species of trees have different climatic requirements. The lowest parts are covered with oak and ash, up to . On the level of 500‚Äì occurs pine; in the higher parts, up to , there occurs European larch; and above 800 m, fir and beech. Despite of transformation of the basic tree vegetation, the same form of undergrowth survived. There occurs: daphne mezereum, red elderberry, hazel, platanthera bifolia, sweet woodruff, Herb Paris, cranberry, wood sorrel, chickweed wintergreen, Common Cow-wheat and lily of the valley. The parts over 800 m are mainly covered with grasses, purple small-reeds, cranberries, and willow gentian. In highlighted places, on meadows, and along roads, there occurs: spotted orchid, bugleweed, yellow archangel, arnica montana, sword-leaved helleborine, rosebay willowherb, groundsel, and foxglove. Along riversides, there occurs white butterbur. Pine forests are rich in spruces, which are permanently weakened by atmospheric factors. Frayed roots are easily infected by harmful fungus and insects. The most damaging is honey mushroom, with edible specimen, which grows in pulp, between the bark and timber, causing the death of tree. The other damaging fungus is bracket fungus, which destroys roots and trunks from the inside. The honey mushroom devastates the tree within a few months, and the bracket fungus, within a few years, as a result of mechanic changes in wood-structure.  History = Ancient history  At the close of the Ice Age, the first man appeared at the Silesian Lowland. In the Mesolithic (7,000 years ago), the first nomadic people settled in Lower Silesia, living in caves and primitive chalets. They were collectors, hunters, and fishers, and used weapons and other tools made of stone and wood. In the Upper Paleolithic, the oldest human remains of the nomadic people, which were 40,000 years old, were found in a tomb in Tyniec on the river ≈ölƒô≈ºa. In the Neolithic (4000‚Äì1700 BC), began the process of transformation into a settled way of life. The first rural settlements were made, as people began to farm and breed animals. Mining, pottery, and weaving are dated to this period. Serpentinite quarries came into existence, of which Silesian hatchets were made, and near Jordan√≥w ≈ölƒÖski, people extracted nephrite that was transformed into diverse tools. In the Bronze Age (1700‚Äì1500 BC), the evolution of different cultures developed to the existence of Unetice culture that affected the existence of Trzciniec culture. In the next periods since , it encompasses all of Europe.  Early history  In the La T√®ne culture period, Lower Silesia was inhabited by the Celts, who had their main place of cult on the Mount ≈ölƒô≈ºa. Their stony statues situated on and around this hill were later worshipped by the Slavic tribes that came here around the sixth century BC. Magna Germania (second century) records that between the Celtic and the Slavic period, Lower Silesia was inhabited by a number of Germanic tribes. Among them, are the Vandals, the Lugii, and the Silingi, who might have given the Silesia region its name, though it is unclear and thus disputed. With the Germanic tribes leaving westward during the Migration Period, a number of new peoples arrived in Silesia from Sarmatia, Asia Minor, and the Asian steppes from the beginning of the sixth century. The Bavarian Geographer () referred to the West Slavic ≈ölƒô≈ºanie (the other possible source of the region's ≈ölƒÖsk and later Silesia name), centered on Niemcza, and Dziadoszanie tribes, while a 1086 document issued by Bishop Jaromir of Prague listed the Zlasane, Trebovane, Poborane, and Dedositze. At the same time, Upper Silesia was inhabited by the Opolanie, Lupiglaa, and Golenshitse tribes. In the late 9th century, the territory was subject to the Great Moravian realm of Prince Svatopluk I and from about 906 came under the rule of the P≈ôemyslid duke Spytihnev I of Bohemia and his successors Vratislaus I, the alleged founder of Wroc≈Çaw (), and Boleslaus the Cruel.  Piast Kingdom of Poland  Kingdom of Poland with Lower Silesia under first king Boles≈Çaw I the Brave Meanwhile, the West Slavic Polans had established the first duchy under the Piast dynasty in the adjacent Greater Polish lands in the north. About 990 Silesia was conquered and incorporated into the first Polish state by the Piast duke Mieszko I, who had gained the support of Emperor Otto II against the Bohemian duke Boleslaus II. In 1000 his son and successor Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry founded the Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw, which, together with the Bishoprics of Krak√≥w and Ko≈Çobrzeg, was placed under the Archbishopric of Gniezno in Greater Poland, founded by Emperor Otto III at the Congress of Gniezno in the same year. The ecclesial suzerainty of Gniezno over Wroc≈Çaw lasted until 1821. After a temporary shift to Bohemia in the first half of the 11th century, Lower Silesia continued to be an integral part of the Polish state until the end of its fragmentation period when all Polish claims on this land were finally renounced in favour of the Bohemian kingdom in 1348. Various Polish defensive battles against the invading Germans took place in the region in the Middle Ages, including the victorious battles of Niemcza in 1017 and G≈Çog√≥w and Psie Pole in 1109. In the early 12th century, Wroc≈Çaw was named one of the three major cities of the Polish Kingdom alongside Krak√≥w and Sandomierz in the oldest Polish chronicle, Gesta principum Polonorum. One of the largest battles of medieval Poland, the Battle of Legnica, during the first Mongol invasion of Poland was fought in the region 1241. The oldest known Polish written sentence in the Book of Henryk√≥w Also a leading region of medieval Poland. The first ever granting of town privileges in Polish history, happened there, when Z≈Çotoryja was granted such rights in 1211 by Henry the Bearded, and in the 13th century the Book of Henryk√≥w, a chronicle containing the oldest known text in Polish, was created in the region. The Duchy of Silesia was first split into lower and upper parts in 1172 during the period of Poland's feudal fragmentation, when the land was divided between two sons of former High Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw II. The elder Boles≈Çaw the Tall ruled over Lower Silesia with his capital in Wroc≈Çaw (then known as Vratislav, Wrotizla, or Prezla), and younger Mieszko Tanglefoot ruled over Upper Silesia with his capital at first in Racib√≥rz, from 1202 in Opole. Later Silesia was divided into as many as 17 duchies. Main duchies of Lower Silesia: * Silesia‚ÄìWroc≈Çaw ** Legnica, split off in 1248 *** Brzeg, split off from Legnica in 1311 *** ≈öwidnica-Jawor, split off from Legnica in 1274 **** Ziƒôbice, split off from ≈öwidnica in 1321 ** G≈Çog√≥w, split off from Legnica in 1251 *** ≈ªaga≈Ñ, split off from G≈Çog√≥w in 1274/1278 *** Ole≈õnica, split off from G≈Çog√≥w in 1313 **** Bierut√≥w, split off from Ole≈õnica in 1412 *** Krosno- ≈öcinawa ** Nysa, established in 1290  Polish duchies, Bohemian Crown, Hungary, Austria and Prussia  Renaissance facade of the Brzeg Castle, depicting members of the Piast dynasty, from the semi-legendary founder Piast the Wheelwright to Duke Frederick II of Legnica With the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin (Trenƒç√≠n) and the 1348 Treaty of Namys≈Ç√≥w, most of the Silesian duchies were ruled by the Silesian Piast dukes under the feudal overlordship of the Bohemian kings, and thus became part of the Crown of Bohemia within the Holy Roman Empire. Many duchies remained Polish-ruled under the houses of Piast, Jagiellon and Sobieski, some up to the 17th and 18th century. In 1469, Lower Silesia passed to Hungary, and in 1490 it fell back to Bohemia, then ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty. In 1476, the Crossen district became part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, when the widow of the Piast ruler, Barbara von Brandenburg, daughter of Elector Albert Achilles, inherited Crossen. It remained an important center of Polish culture. In 1475 G≈Çog√≥w-born Polish printer founded the (Holy Cross Printing House) in Wroc≈Çaw, which published the ', the first incunable in Lower Silesia, which also contains the first ever text printed in the Polish language.Hieronim Szczeg√≥≈Ça, Kasper Elyan z G≈Çogowa, pierwszy polski drukarz, Muzeum Ziemi Lubuskiej, Zielona G√≥ra, 1968, p. 4, 6 (in Polish) In 1526 Silesia was acquired by Austria's Habsburg Monarchy after the death of King Louis II of Bohemia. Brandenburg contested the inheritance, citing a treaty made with Frederick II of Legnica, but Silesia largely remained under Habsburg control until 1742. In 1675 Duke George William of Legnica died at the Brzeg Castle, as the last male member of the Piast dynasty, which founded the Polish state in the 10th century. He was buried in Legnica. Map of the Prussian Province of Silesia, with Lower Silesian administrative regions (Regencies) of Liegnitz and Breslau (\\"Middle Silesia\\") Most of Lower Silesia, except for the southern part of the Duchy of Nysa, became part of the Kingdom of Prussia after the First Silesian War by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau. In 1815, it became part of the Prussian Silesia Province, which was divided into the two Lower Silesian administrative regions (Regierungsbezirke) of Liegnitz and Breslau (sometimes also referred to as Middle Silesia), and Upper Silesian Oppeln (including the Lower Silesian districts of Neisse and Grottkau). The western Liegnitz region had been enlarged by the incorporation of the Upper Lusatian districts of Lauban, G√∂rlitz, Rothenburg and Hoyerswerda, all seized from the Kingdom of Saxony after the Napoleonic Wars. From 1871, Lower Silesia was part of the German Empire. As a result of long lasting German colonisation and Germanisation, by the beginning of the 20th century Lower Silesia had a majority German-speaking population, with the exception of a small Polish-speaking area in the northeastern part of the district of Namslau (Namys≈Ç√≥w), Gro√ü Wartenberg (Syc√≥w) and Militsch (Milicz) and a Czech-speaking minority in the rural area around Strehlen (Strzelin). There were also Polish communities in large cities such as Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) and Gr√ºnberg (Zielona G√≥ra). After the First World War, the bulk of Lower Silesia remained within Germany, the Bohemian part was included within Czechoslovakia, and a small part was reintegrated with Poland, which just regained independence. The German part was re-organized into the Province of Lower Silesia of the Free State of Prussia consisting of the Breslau and Liegnitz regions. In the interwar period, there were multiple instances of anti-Polish violence in the German part, and already in 1920 a Polish consulate in Wroc≈Çaw was attacked and demolished by German nationalists. In the 1930s Poles and Jews were increasingly persecuted in the German-controlled part of the region. =World War II= Gross-Rosen concentration camp, now a museum During World War II the Germans established the Gross-Rosen concentration camp with around 100 subcamps in the region, in which around 125,000 people of various nationalities, among them mostly Jews, Poles and citizens of the Soviet Union, were imprisoned, and around 40,000 died. In view of Polish claims to the area, a memorandum prepared by the United States Department of State in May 1945 recommended that the area stay with Germany because there was no historic or ethnic justification for granting this land to Poland. However, according to Soviet insistence at the Potsdam Agreement, in which the Soviet Union annexed most of the eastern Poland, Lower Silesia to the Republic of Poland. These border shifts were agreed on pending a final peace conference with Germany which eventually never took place.; ; Germany retained the small portion of the former Prussian Province of Lower Silesia to the west of the Oder-Neisse line.  Modern Poland  The remaining German population was expelled from the bulk of Lower Silesia east of the Neisse in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Poles from Central Poland and the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union came to the region. From 1945 to 1975 Lower Silesia was administered within the Wroc≈Çaw Voivodeship. As a result of the Local Government Reorganisation Act (1975), Poland's administration was reorganized into 49 voivodeships, four of them in Lower Silesia: Jelenia G√≥ra, Legnica, Wa≈Çbrzych, and Wroc≈Çaw Voivodeships (1975‚Äì1998). As a result of the Local Government Reorganisation Act of 1998, these four provinces were joined into the Lower Silesian Voivodeship (effective 1 January 1999), whose capital is Wroc≈Çaw.  Population  In the Early Middle Ages the region was inhabited by Lechitic tribes. German settlers came to Lower Silesia during the Late Middle Ages, attracted by newly founded towns to develop the region. Over time, the autochthonous Polish population became partly Germanised and took up the German language as well, however notable Polish communities survived, especially in northern Lower Silesia, and in larger cities. In year 1819, the Breslau Regency had 838,253 inhabitants, the majority of whom - 755,553 (90%) - were German-speakers; with a Polish-speaking minority numbering 66,500 (8%); as well as 8,900 Czechs (1%) and 7,300 Jews (1%). U.S. Immigration Commission in 1911 classified Polish-speaking Silesians as ethnic Poles. After World War II, German inhabitants that had not fled the area due to the war, were expelled, and the region was re-settled by Poles from various regions, making Polish minority majority again.

Heinze & Comp., G√∂rlitz, 1846, p. 11 and again from 1815 to 1945, when the area was annexed from Saxony by Prussia and included within the Province of Silesia and later of Lower Silesia. During this time Silesian culture and the Silesian German dialect spread into this region with its centre G√∂rlitz. The expulsion of the Germans from the east of Oder-Neisse line led to an additional settlement of German Silesians in this region. Due to these facts, some of the inhabitants of this region still consider themselves Silesian and cultivate Silesian customs. One of their special privileges is the right to use the Lower Silesian flag and coat of arms which is guaranteed to them by the Saxon Constitution of 1992. The Evangelical Church of Silesia in Upper Lusatia, meanwhile, merged with the one of Berlin and Brandenburg to form the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia.

Although Kadamjay is the largest settlement of the eponymous district, it is not the capital of the district; instead, the district's administrative center is the village of Pulgon (formerly, Frunzenskoe), located just to the north of the town.

PF Flyers is an American brand of lifestyle shoes that are currently manufactured by New Balance. Founded in 1937, it is one of the original American sneaker brands.  History In 1933, inventor Hyman L. Witman and canvas footwear pioneer B.F. Goodrich patented the \\"Posture Foundation\\" arch support insole, and began adding the new technology to its shoes. B.F. Goodrich shoes with Posture Foundation became known simply as \\"PF\\" in 1937. In 1935, Canadian badminton player Jack Purcell designed a low, white-bleached badminton shoe made of canvas-and-rubber for B.F. Goodrich. Named after Purcell, it featured a signature \\"smile\\" across the toe of the shoe and provided more protection for the court, (This line of shoes later became part of Converse in the 1970s). By 1944, PF Flyers released their first kids collection of shoes, creating the slogan, \\"Run Faster, Jump Higher\\". Fashion trends in the 1940s and 1950s saw PF Flyers expand from gyms and ball fields to become fashionable active footwear; its main competitors being Converse and Keds. \\"Everything you do is more fun with PF\\" read one 1947 magazine ad. PF styles ranged from high- and low-top sport shoes to oxfords and moccasins \\"for work, relaxation and play.\\" PF Flyers' women's line of shoes was released in 1948. In 1950, PF Flyers became standard issue for certain military outfits. 1958 saw the first athlete to be endorsed by a shoe brand. All-star basketball player Bob Cousy of the Boston Celtics was chosen to market PF Flyers. By the 1960s, PF was one of the most popular shoes in America, with a 20% hold on all canvas sneakers sold, but struggled with industry changes in the early 70s.  In media  PF Flyers appeared in films such as the 1993 film The Sandlot. For the 20th anniversary of the movie, a limited edition sneaker was made. In 2018, PF Flyers created another limited run reissue of the sneaker shown in the film, to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary.  Acquisition  In 1972, Eltra Corporation, the former parent of Converse, purchased the PF Flyers brand from B.F. Goodrich, due to B.F. Goodrich leaving the shoe industry. However, this created a monopoly in the shoe market and the two brands were split due to an anti-trust lawsuit. Both companies were eventually sold in 1975. PF Flyers then fell into obscurity after this, being dormant from 1975-2000. Despite the split and selling of both companies, Converse kept the rights of the Jack Purcell line of shoes from the PF Flyers acquisition. Rebranded with the Converse name, Jack Purcell sneakers are still produced today. In 2001, New Balance purchased PF Flyers and re-launched the brand in 2003. Current models= Center  Introduced in the 1960s, the \\"Center\\" line is one of PF Flyer's most popular and well known models. The \\"Center Hi\\" was also the same model featured in the 1993 Sandlot film. In 2018, a baseball cleat model was introduced in collaboration with New Balance.  Windjammer  In 1968, PF Flyers released the \\"Windjammer\\". A CVO-styled sneaker, but with the classic PF Flyer design. In 2018, New Balance re-released the \\"Windjammer\\" for its \\"Made in USA\\" line of footwear.  Grounder  In the 1940s, PF Flyers created a consumer version of their US military boot with the release of the \\"Grounder\\". The \\"Grounder\\" is similar in design to the \\"All American\\" model, but with a more durable out-sole and thicker tread.  All American  In 1958, PF Flyers created the first athletic endorsement, of which was Bob Cousy of the Boston Celtics, to market PF Flyers with the \\"All American\\" model, which was a basketball shoe similar in design to the Converse Chuck Taylor basketball shoe. In 2017, New Balance re-released the \\"All American\\" model, featuring Fresh Foam used in New Balance's active line of shoes.  Made in USA  In 2015, PF Flyers launched their \\"Made in USA\\" line, which is handmade in Boston, Massachusetts, to commemorate the American-Made PF Flyers of the 20th century. Made in USA models include the \\"Center\\", \\"Ball and Buck\\", and \\"Windjammer\\".

The lake is fed by the Fox River in the southwest and the Wolf River draining from Lake Winneconne in the northwest, and drains via the Fox River southeast into Lake Winnebago. The lake is also part of the Butte des Morts region in Winnebago County, Wisconsin. Much of the lake is flooded marshland, which was created by the damming of the Fox River downstream in Menasha in the 19th century. This has resulted in the lake's flat and shallow character (maximum depth is 15 ft [4.5 m]). U.S. Highway 41 (US 41) / Interstate 41 (I41) spans the east end of the lake via a bridge and causeway combination. The bridge includes the Tribal Heritage Crossing, a designated national trail, which is a portion of the Wiouwash State Trail. The city of Oshkosh lies between Lake Butte des Morts and Lake Winnebago. Big Lake Butte des Morts is popular among both fishermen and recreational boaters during the warm months, and with ice fishermen in the winter. A marked navigation channel guides passage across the lake from the inflow of the Wolf River in the west (connecting to Lake Poygan), to the outflow of the Fox River east to Lake Winnebago. This lake is not connected to Little Lake Butte des Morts. The smaller lake is located to the north downstream of the Winnebago Pool. Big Lake Butte des Morts served as part of the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway. Fish species found in the lake include walleye, drum, white bass, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, carp, flathead and channel catfish, northern pike, crappie, yellow perch, bluegill and sturgeon. Sunset Point, located near the Interstate 41 bridge, is one of the most popular walleye fishing spots on the Winnebago System. The name \\"Butte des Morts\\" was given by French colonial settlers from the period when France controlled this area. It means \\"Mound of the Dead\\", in reference to a nearby prehistoric Native American burial mound. In the Menominee language this place is known as Paehkuahkƒ´hsaeh which means \\"small mound\\".

Approximately 340 students attend the school and English is the language of instruction. LAS is located in the alpine resort village of Leysin, Vaud, Switzerland, two hours east of Geneva. The international school is home to students from sixty countries. Approximately 12% of students are American. Students pursue either the American high school diploma or the International Baccalaureate, with additional options of individual IB classes to suit particular interests. LAS also offers an extensive summer school, a pre-high school program for grade 7, and an ESL program. In October 2010, the school celebrated its fiftieth anniversary and officially inaugurated the opening of the newly renovated Grand Hotel, which was originally built in 1892 and houses IB students. LAS facilities include various classroom layouts (including open-plan classrooms in the IB facility), a media center, libraries, blackbox theater, performance hall, computer lab, a new art center, and access to horseback riding, ice skating, tennis, hockey, and swimming. The faculty to student ratio at LAS is 1:8 and the average class size is 12. LAS employs 72 full-time faculty, of which almost all live on campus; 95% are native English speakers, and 70% hold advanced degrees. Accreditation LAS's (upper) secondary education (Middle and High School) is not approved as a Mittelschule/Coll√®ge/Liceo by the Swiss Federal State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI). Trips Throughout the year students and faculty take educational trips to destinations around the globe. Students often take weekend trips to other countries in Europe and other parts of the world. There are mandatory trips referred to as Cultural Trips, which take students to numerous countries, including Romania, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, and many more. Leysin is a two-hour train ride away from Geneva, and an hour from Montreux. In 2020 the Cultural Trips were cancelled as a COVID-19 safety precaution. Dormitories There are eight dormitories for the students, divided by class and by gender. Savoy is the 10th and 11th grade boys' dorm. It is home to one of the school's dining halls, classrooms for grades 9-10, administration offices, and one of the school's libraries. Vermont is the 7th, 8th and 9th grade girls' dorm, and houses the Travel Office and IT department. Esplanade is the 7th, 8th, and 9th grade boys‚Äô dorm.

Purchase of Grand Hotel On June 13, 2008, the Leysin American School purchased the Grand H√¥tel at the upper edge of the Leysin village. The 10,000 square meter building and 4.3 hectare grounds were developed in 1890, during the Belle √âpoque period as a lavish hotel and sanatorium clinic for the world's elite families. In the early 1980s, after decades of transition in Leysin from health clinics to education centers, the complex became the home of the American College of Switzerland. Major renovations to the building have been completed and it is now home to the new LAS IB campus. This campus has a dining hall, the Grand Salle ballroom, new Art Center, The Cave lounge for students, a library, computer lab, and the boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô dormitories.

Its meaning is variable, though it may derive from the Norman French adjective, large (meaning \\"generous\\" or \\"big\\" [as in, \\"that's big of you\\", meaning generous, as well as large in size]), as it is found in the surname \\"le Large\\" in English records dating back as far as the 13th century. Harrison's work on English surnames gives the following: \\"Large (adjectival: French, Latin) Big; Generous [Middle English Old French large; Latin larg-us, -a, [meaning] abundant, liberal]\\" He gives an early citation for the name: Austin Belz from the Hundred Rolls, a reference dating to 1273. He also provides a quotation showing the word in its older sense of generous, full, liberal or ample in its literary context: So large of [gift] and free was she (from Chaucer's Romance of the Rose I168) Another variant surname, \\"de Large\\", appears to be continental European rather than English in origin. Henry Brougham Guppy's survey circa 1881, based on local British directories, places Large as a surname local to North Wiltshire, and considers it to have particular prevalence among yeoman farmers.(Guppy, 1890) According to the International Genealogical Index, the surname is also found in many other English counties; in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and other English language countries; in France and Germany, and, more rarely, in the Scandinavian countries.

The poems in the book were given as translations of Indian poets by a man, as she thought the book would receive much more attention than it would likely have done if she had published it under her own name. The poetry in this volume was characteristic of all of Nicolson's poems, making liberal use of the imagery and symbols from the poets of the North-West Frontier of India and the Sufi poets of Persia. The poems are typically about unrequited love and loss. The book was initially praised upon its release by many prominent poets, Thomas Hardy among them, although some reviewers were uncertain about the authenticity of the translations. James Darmesteter, Professor of Persian at the prestigious College de France, Paris, embarrassingly documented that the images used by the supposed frontier bards were in reality symbols of the latent Sufi nature of their songs. They were later exposed as being original works from the West, although partly inspired by the Sufi. The book was published in America in 1927 as India's Love Lyrics.

It permits arbitrary code to be executed on affected computers without the permission of their users. It was discovered on December 27, 2005, and the first reports of affected computers were announced within 24 hours. Microsoft released a high-priority update to eliminate this vulnerability via Windows Update on January 5, 2006. Attacks using this vulnerability are known as WMF exploits. The vulnerability was located in gdi32.dll and existed in all versions of Microsoft Windows from Windows 3.0 to Windows Server 2003 R2. However, attack vectors only exist in NT-based versions of Windows (Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003). Exploits taking advantage of the vulnerability on Windows NT-based systems facilitated the propagation of various types of malware, typically through drive-by downloads. Due to extreme impact, this bug won the 2007 Pwnie Award for \\"Mass 0wnage\\" and \\"Breaking the Internet\\". Affected systems All versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system support the Windows Metafile graphics standard. All versions from Windows 3.0 to Windows Server 2003 R2 contain this security flaw. However, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows XP, unless patched, are more vulnerable than earlier versions because their default installation enables Windows Metafile code execution, the source of the vulnerability. Later versions of Windows do not have this vulnerability. According to computer security expert Steve Gibson, Windows NT 4 is vulnerable to known exploits if image preview is enabled. Windows operating systems that do not have image preview enabled or that have hardware-based Data Execution Prevention (DEP) active for all applications should not be susceptible to this exploit. Operating systems other than Windows (e.g., macOS, Unix, Linux, etc.) are not directly affected. However, a non-Windows system could become vulnerable if it runs software to view Windows WMF files. This could include software that incorporates or clones Windows' native Graphics Device Interface (GDI) Dynamic-link library (DLL) or that run Windows or Windows programs through an emulator or compatibility layer. A Unix-like system that uses Wine to emulate Windows, for example, could be exploited. Gibson wrote the program MouseTrap, which his company distributes as freeware, to detect Windows Metafile vulnerability in systems running Windows and Windows emulators. The vulnerability According to assessments by F-Secure, the vulnerability is an inherent defect in the design of WMF files, because the underlying architecture of such files is from a previous era, and includes features which allow actual code to be executed whenever a WMF file opens. The original purpose of this was mainly to handle the cancellation of print jobs during spooling. According to Secunia, \\"The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the handling of Windows Metafile files ('.wmf') containing specially crafted \`SETABORTPROC\` 'Escape' records. Such records allow arbitrary user- defined function to be executed when the rendering of a WMF file fails.\\" According to the Windows 3.1 SDK documentation, the \`SETABORTPROC\` escape was obsoleted and replaced by the function of the same name in Windows 3.1, long before the WMF vulnerability was discovered. However the obsoleted escape code was retained for compatibility with 16 bit programs written for (or at least backwards compatible with) Windows 3.0. This change happened at approximately the same time as Microsoft was creating the 32 bit reimplementation of GDI for Windows NT, and it is likely that the vulnerability occurred during this effort. The 'Escape' mechanism in question allows applications (not metafiles) to access output device features not yet abstracted by GDI, such as hardware accelerated B√©zier curves, encapsulated postscript support, etc. This is done by passing an opcode, a size and a pointer to some data to the call, which will usually just pass it on to the driver. Because most Escape calls produce actual graphics, the general escape mechanism is allowed in metafiles with little thought originally given to the possibility of using it for things like SETABORTPROC, modern non-vulnerable metafile interpreters now checks the opcode against a blacklist or whitelist, while keeping the full set of opcodes available to regular code that calls the GDI escape functions directly (because such code is already running in the same way as the code it could make GDI call, there is no security risk in that case). It is worth noting that 16 bit Windows (except the rarely used Real mode of Windows 3.0) was immune to the vulnerability because the pointer specified in the metafile can only point to data within the metafile, and 16 bit Windows always had a full no-execute-data enforcement mandated by the segmented architecture of 16 bit protected mode. Windows NT for CPU architectures other than 32 bit x86 (such as MIPS, PowerPC, Alpha, Itanium and x86_64) required return-oriented programming to exploit because those architectures had the no-execute functionality missing from older x86 processors. The vulnerability is in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database, US-CERT reference VU#181038 and Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912840. It was first observed in the wild by researchers at Sunbelt Software on December 28, 2005 and announced publicly by the company's president Alex Eckelberry.http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/honors/december-storm- wmf-preparation-identification-containment-exploits_1666 Propagation and infection Computers can be affected via the spread of infected e-mails which carry the hacked WMF file as an attachment. Infection may also result from: * Viewing a website in a web browser that automatically opens WMF files, in which case any potential malicious code may be automatically downloaded and opened. Internet Explorer, the default Web browser for all versions of Microsoft Windows since 1996 through Windows 10, does this. *Previewing an infected file in Windows Explorer. * Viewing an infected image file using some vulnerable image-viewing programs. *Previewing or opening infected emails in older versions of Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express. *Indexing a hard disk containing an infected file with Google Desktop. *Clicking on a link through an instant messaging program such as Windows Live Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) or Yahoo! Messenger. Other methods may also be used to propagate infection. Because the problem is within the operating system, using non-Microsoft browsers such as Firefox or Opera does not provide complete protection. Users are typically prompted to download and view a malicious file, infecting the computer. Infected files may be downloaded automatically, which opens the possibility for infection by disk indexing or accidental previewing. According to assessments from the McAfee antivirus company, the vulnerability has been used to propagate the Bifrost backdoor trojan horse. Other forms of malware have also exploited the vulnerability to deliver various malicious payloads. McAfee claims that the first generation of such exploits had been encountered by more than 6% of their customer base by 31 December 2005. Official patch Microsoft released an official patch to address the problem on 5 January 2006. This patch may be applied in lieu of other corrective measures. The official patch is available for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Microsoft Windows Server 2003. Windows NT 4 and other older operating systems did not receive a patch as they were no longer supported by Microsoft by then. Steve Gibson stated in his Security Now! podcast #20, that his company Gibson Research Corporation would make a patch available for Windows 9x systems if Microsoft did not. After further research, Steve Gibson stated, in a later Security Now! podcast #23, that Windows 9x and ME are not vulnerable and do not need patching. Windows 9x/ME users can run his Mouse Trap utility to see this for themselves. A free downloadable patch for Windows NT Downloadable patch for Windows NT by Paolo Monti has been provided by Paolo Monti from Future Time, the Italian distributor of Eset's NOD32 anti-virus system. The patch works on older operating systems, but it is supplied without warranty. There have been reports of the official patch being automatically installed even when Windows Automatic Update is configured to ask before installing automatically downloaded updates. This causes an automatic reboot, which can cause loss of data if the user has a program open with unsaved changes. Other corrective measures These measures are of historical interest only on systems updated on or after 5 January 2006. Workaround As a workaround before a patch was available, on 28 December 2005 Microsoft advised Windows users to unregister the dynamic-link library file shimgvw.dll (which can be done by executing the command \`regsvr32.exe /u shimgvw.dll\` from the Run menu or the command prompt) which invokes previewing of image files and is exploited by most of these attacks. The DLL can be re-registered after patching by running \`regsvr32.exe shimgvw.dll\`. This workaround blocks a common attack vector but does not eliminate the vulnerability. Third-party patch A third party patch was released by Ilfak Guilfanov on 31 December 2005 to temporarily disable the vulnerable function call in gdi32.dll. This unofficial patch received much publicity due to the unavailability of an official one from Microsoft, receiving the recommendation of SANS Institute Internet Storm Center and F-Secure. Because of the large amount of publicity, including being indirectly slashdotted, Guilfanov's website received more visitors than it could cope with, and was suspended on 3 January 2006; the patch was still available for download from a number of mirrors including the Internet Storm Center website. Guilfanov's website went back online on 4 January in a much-reduced state. No longer providing the patch on-site due to bandwidth issues, the homepage provided a list of mirrors where a user could download the patch and the associated vulnerability-checker, and the MD5 checksum for the file, so that it could be checked that a downloaded file was probably genuine. After Microsoft released its patch, Guilfanov withdrew his. Risk reduction techniques Microsoft says its patch removes the flawed functionality in GDI32 that allowed the WMF vulnerability. For computers running an unpatched version of Windows, a defence in depth approach was recommended, to mitigate the risk of infection. Various sources have recommended mitigation efforts that include: *Making use of hardware-enforced Data Execution Prevention effective for all applications. *Set the default WMF application to be one not susceptible to infection, such as Notepad. *Do not use Internet Explorer, or at least turn off downloads by setting the default security settings to high. *Keep all anti-virus software up-to-date. Consider frequent manual updates. *Block all WMF files on the network perimeter by file-header filtering. *Making use of users accounts that are configured with only the user rights that are required. *Disable image loading in Internet Explorer and all other browsers. *Disable image loading in Outlook Express. *Disable hyperlinks in MSN Messenger. *Disable the Indexing Service on Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. *Disable Desktop Search applications such as Google Desktop or Windows Desktop Search until the problem is corrected. According to SANS Institute Internet Storm Center article, using a web browser other than Internet Explorer may offer additional protection against this vulnerability. Depending on settings, these browsers may ask the user before opening an image with the .wmf extension, but this only reduces the chance of opening the maliciously crafted Windows Metafile, and does not protect against the vulnerability being exploited as these browsers still open the metafile if it is masquerading as another format. It is better to entirely disable image loading in any browser used. Accusations In 2006 Steve Gibson suggested that the peculiar nature of the 'bug' was an indication that the vulnerability was actually a backdoor intentionally engineered into the system. The accusation became an assertion and spread through the internet as a rumor after the technology news website Slashdot picked up Gibson's speculation. The rumor was widely debunkedStephen Toulouse for Microsoft Security Response Center. 13 Jan 2006 Looking at the WMF issue, how did it get there?Otto Helweg for Mark Russinovich's Blog. 18 Jan 2006 Inside the WMF Backdoor and Thomas Greene, writing in The Register, attributed Gibson's mistake to \\"his lack of security experience\\" and called him a \\"popinjay expert\\".

The game was released in Russia by Buka Entertainment in June 2005, followed by a localised English release from G2 Games in 2006. An updated version, Pathologic Classic HD, was developed by General Arcade, published by Gambitious Digital Entertainment, and released in October 2015. A remake was developed by Ice-Pick Lodge using the Unity game engine and released as Pathologic 2 in May 2019 by tinyBuild.  Gameplay  A screenshot of one of the districts within the town The game is about three characters who are mostly known by their nicknames: two men, Bachelor and Haruspex, and a girl nicknamed Devotress (later re-translated as \\"Changeling\\"). Each of them tries to uncover the source of a strange lethal sickness known as the \\"sand plague\\" that has befallen a small town. Although players can play as each of them, there is only one storyline, which is seen from different points of view depending upon the chosen character. The ability to uncover some secrets depends on which character is being played and the characters also interact with the other two unchosen characters and discuss their progress throughout the game. The game takes place in a perpetual world over a time frame of 12 in-game days. Throughout each day, the player receives quests from non-player characters (NPCs); however, the game continues regardless of whether they are completed or not. At exactly midnight of each day, the incomplete quests are erased from the player's notebook. Quests are divided into main missions (one per day), which decide if a major character will die, and side quests, which earn money and items. Completing main quests is essential to discovering the secrets of the town, as characters who would otherwise reveal information later in the game can fall ill from the plague early. The player's other goal is simply to survive to the end of the 12 days by maintaining various resources. The game's fluctuating economy represents the harsh forces of supply and demand in an isolated, disease-ridden town. On the edge of town, there is a great building named Polyhedron, a physically impossible structure used as a fortress by children. On the opposite side lies an ominous cattle- slaughtering Abattoir, with the Apiary (later re-translated as \\"Termitary\\") next to it. All districts and major buildings of the town are named after body parts and biology.  Development and release  Pathologic was the first game developed by Russian studio Ice-Pick Lodge. The game was announced by Russian publisher Buka Entertainment on 30 March 2004, intending to release in the last quarter of the year. The native Russian version of the game was released to manufacturing on 31 May 2005, for release on 9 June. The English-localised version was completed on 20 November 2005 and released by G2 Games in 2006. A German version was published by Frogster Interactive Pictures on 20 April 2006 after being released to manufacturing earlier that month.  Remake and remaster  Ice-Pick Lodge stated in November 2013 that it was looking to remake Pathologic and using crowdfunding to finance such a remake's development. The developer confirmed the remake's development in July 2014 and launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign that September. This campaign sought to raise , which it reached by the end of the month, and ended in a total of backed by 7,139 people. In October 2015, Ice-Pick Lodge announced Pathologic Classic HD, a remaster of the original Pathologic developed by General Arcade and published by Gambitious Digital Entertainment. This remaster introduced upgraded visuals, fixed bugs, re-recorded dialog, and a re-translated English script. Pathologic Classic HD was released on 29 October 2015. The remaster received generally favourable reviews, according to Metacritic. Under publisher tinyBuild, the Pathologic remake was retitled Pathologic 2 to distinguish it from Pathologic Classic HD. Pathologic 2 was released on 23 May 2019.  Reception  In Russia, Pathologic was critically well received, winning year-end accolades from five Russian outlets. However, its reception in English-speaking countries has been varied, being both praised for its atmosphere and concept while equally panned for its poor translation, outdated graphics and slow-paced gameplay.

Casting and characterization On February 19, 2013, it was believed that actress Jordan Lane Price was to be cast as a SORASed Miranda on the Prospect Park's continuation of All My Children, but on February 25, 2013, it was revealed that Denyse Tontz would play Miranda, while Lane plays a brand new character. As an infant, she was portrayed by twin boys, Joseph and Raymond Cartigiano and as a toddler by Haley Evans and as a child by Mackenzie Aladjem. She has been portrayed by Denyse Tontz as a teenaged Miranda in 2013. The character became the center of one of the most prominent and publicized storylines in soap opera history, detailing the struggle of a mother's fight to come to terms with the loss of her child and the joy of having that child returned to her. Character history Character Miranda Montgomery is written into the show All My Children as the daughter of Bianca Montgomery, conceived after a brutal rape by Michael Cambias. The storyline begins when Michael Cambias wants revenge on Bianca's mother, Erica Kane. He soon rapes her youngest daughter. The situation torments Erica, since she too had been raped and impregnated at a young age. At first, Erica, fearful of what can happen with Bianca's psyche, urges her to have the child aborted. Bianca agrees to this suggestion at first, but when her older half-sister, Kendall Hart, comes to the clinic, and Bianca tells her what has happened, Kendall is so touched that the sister she always scorned now understands what she went through in being a product of rape, that she throws her full support to Bianca. This solidifies a still unbreakable bond between the two sisters. Erica finds out about the followed-through pregnancy and is furious that everyone kept her in the dark about it. She and Bianca have a vicious argument concerning this issue, and Bianca storms out of the house. This angers Kendall who unleashes her rage at Erica over her treatment of Bianca. Miranda is born during a storm where her mother is stranded in a cabin with Babe Carey, one of her mother's best friends. With Babe's help, Miranda is born. Her name is chosen because her mother loves the first name (taken from the Shakespearean play The Tempest), and her middle name comes from her late great-grandmother, Mona Kane Tyler. Although her father is a Cambias, her mother uses her surname, Montgomery, for her daughter's last name. Switched at birth Miranda's first few months are hectic. Far more hectic than they should be. This begins with her mother believing her to be dead due to news from a man named Paul Cramer, but she is not. She has been switched by Paul as he has taken then- wife Babe's son, Adam Chandler III, and passed him off to his sister, Kelly Cramer, back in Llanview, Pennsylvania (home of soap opera One Life to Live). He then presents Miranda to Babe and her husband at the time, JR Chandler, as their own daughter. JR promptly names her Bess, short for Elizabeth Charlotte Chandler. For months, Bianca is led to believe that her baby has died. In fact, it is Miranda's half-aunt, Kendall, who has to tell Bianca that Miranda is dead. All this time, she is being raised by JR and Babe. Bianca is so shaken by this, that she almost kidnaps her own daughter, not even knowing that the little girl is her child. JR wants Bianca in jail, but Babe intercedes on her behalf, having discovered that Bess is actually Bianca's biological daughter, though she does not tell this to Bianca due to her own personal reasons. She goes so far as to ask Bianca to be Bess' godmother, a situation JR resents. Babe also changes Bess' middle name to Miranda to honor Bianca. JR, on the other hand, is not so pleased about this, and even hires a nanny to watch Bianca when she makes a visit. JR is just as unaware of the truth regarding Bess as Bianca is. Revealed as a Kane and Cambias heir In 2004, Ethan Cambias comes to town. He is Miranda's biological cousin by virtue that Michael is Miranda's father. Ethan's father is Zach Slater, who is really Alexander Cambias, Jr. Ethan befriends Miranda's mother and half-aunt, and later on a DNA test sampled from both Miranda and Ethan shows that they are indeed Cambias blood. After the death of Paul Cramer, things go awry. It is becoming increasingly evident that people see that Bess Chandler is really Miranda. JR and Babe have split up romantically at this time, and Babe is growing closer to his stepbrother, Jamie Martin. It is during a benefit in Florida that the truth about the baby switch comes out. Babe asks Bianca to come to Florida and she spills everything. Bianca is clearly livid and slaps and denounces Babe as her friend for her actions. JR, however, is more hell- bent on keeping Miranda away from Bianca than Babe is. He kidnaps Miranda, and while he and Bianca are arguing about the turn of events, she falls off of a second story balcony and is injured severely. Because of these events and the injuries that she suffered, both physical and emotional, JR and the normally compassionate Bianca, who were once close in childhood and adolescence, are now mortal enemies to this day. JR, hoping against hope that he is Bess's father, has Bianca taken back to Pine Valley, where she is admitted to the hospital. She remains in a coma for several days. Meanwhile, Erica promptly storms over to JR's father, Adam Chandler, who, incidentally, is one of her ex-husbands, and demands that he set up a DNA test to prove who Bess/Miranda is once and for all. She punctuates this demand by pointedly telling Adam, \\"Because you will not raise any Kane children in this house!\\" Adam, to JR's ire, does exactly what Erica has announced must be done. The results are conclusive and there is no shadow of a doubt. Bess is Miranda and has been very much alive all this time. JR is not going to let a DNA test result stand in his way of being with his daughter. In his mind, Miranda is Bess and DNA or no DNA, he is the father, and nothing or nobody is going to stop that. One person, however, does eventually stop that -- JR's stepfather, Tad Martin. Tad, along with Adam, Jackson Montgomery (Bianca's uncle), Aidan Devane, and Erica, take Miranda out of JR's arms and return her to the hospital. A truly depressed and furious JR denounces everyone for what has happened. He takes to drinking and mourns the loss of both his son and his daughter. A very relieved Erica takes her granddaughter and brings her into Bianca's ICU room. Erica, along with Kendall, her uncle (and later stepfather), Jackson, her best friend (and later girlfriend), Maggie Stone, and many people who love her, plead for her to come out of her coma. Erica tries to awaken Bianca from her coma by having Miranda around her. When Erica puts Miranda into Bianca's arms, it is a Christmas miracle indeed. Bianca wakes up and holds her beautiful baby girl close to her heart. Ethan, who is there when she is brought in, meets his cousin as Bianca is already forming a bond with her. Many weeks later, Miranda, along with her mother and Maggie, move to Paris, where Bianca works at Cambias Industries' European Division. While there, Maggie becomes like a mother to Miranda and Miranda thinks of Maggie as another mother. It is inferred by Bianca to Julia Santos that adoption papers have been drawn up, never signed, but that Miranda does not need the adoption papers to love Maggie as a mother. Since she and her cousin, Ethan, are Cambias by blood, they stand to be heirs to the Cambias fortune at that time. Because of Miranda's age, however, Bianca votes Miranda's shares in Cambias Industries by proxy. Now that her cousin, Ethan, is dead, she will be the sole heir to the Cambias fortune. When she is of age, she will take her rightful place in the Cambias Empire. Though her double cousin Ian Slater and her maternal half- sister/paternal cousin Gabrielle Montgomery are also heirs both through her uncle Zach Slater. As well as possibility of Spike Lavery maybe an heir because he is the stepson, but raised by Zach Slater; and his father was the owner of Cambias Industries for a few years and still has part of the shares for Cambias Industries. In 2006, Miranda returns alongside her mother to Pine Valley, where she meets her new half-uncle, Josh Madden (it is revealed that Maggie has cheated on Bianca while in Paris). At present, Miranda is a happy and healthy little girl, who has thrived, in spite of the drama that surrounded her when she was a baby. While back, she gains friends in Kathy Mershon and Emma Lavery, and she gets along wonderfully with her half-cousin, Spike Lavery. She also makes friends with Zoe, who happens to be her half- uncle Josh's roommate. She gets along well with her great-uncle and surrogate grandfather, Jackson Montgomery, as well. On April 26, 2007, Miranda moves back to Paris with her mother. Bianca cites the fact that Miranda has friends in Paris and that they had a life there that she wants them to get back to. This may bring about a reconciliation between Bianca and Maggie, who returned to Paris in February, both of whom considered themselves a family with Miranda prior to fall of 2006. While away from Pine Valley, it is also discovered that Miranda's cousin once removed, Greenlee Smythe, stole her Fusion Stock that she inherited from Simone Torres (there is debate now concerning this, as Simone possibly willed only the actual Trust Fund left to her by her fianc√©, Ethan Cambias, to Miranda and possibly held out the Fusion shares to give to Greenlee. There is no proof that the shares were stolen from Miranda or if Miranda actually ever had control of the Fusion stock to begin with). Return In October 2008, Miranda returns to town with a pregnant Bianca and her fianc√©e. As Bianca once again gives birth to a baby girl during a storm, it is revealed that Zach is baby Gabrielle's father, making her Miranda's cousin and half-sister. Miranda was part of her mother's wedding to Reese Williams. She also danced with them during their first dance. When the marriage fell apart, Miranda went back to Paris with her mother and sister. Second return to Pine Valley When her mother returned to Pine Valley, Bianca said that she did not bring her daughters back with her because of Erica being missing. Jackson Montgomery has Miranda and Gabby flown to Pine Valley after Erica is back. Miranda, Gabby, and Bianca are living at Wildwind along with Caleb Cooney, their late friend, Palmer Cortlandt's. Teenage years On April 29, 2013, Miranda is shown to be aged up, along with AJ, due to the five year jump. She has not learned that she was result of rape from Bianca, but was rather told that she was a test tube baby with an unknown father. She and AJ are best friends, but she is clueless that he has feelings for her. Miranda and AJ share a kiss, but she pulls away and leaves.

On a pre-deployment exercise USS Currituck operated with VP-42, attached to NAS North Island, for two days at a seadrome established at White Cove, Santa Catalina Island, California. VP-42 was operating nine P5M‚Äôs. USS Currituck deployed to the Western Pacific on 27 June 1961 on her first tour where she served as Flagship for Commander, Taiwan Patrol Force, Rear Admiral Bernard M. Strean, USN. This force, comprising both air and surface patrol, provided surveillance patrols along the coast lines of Soviet Siberia, North Korea, North Vietnam and the Communist held China Mainland. Captain Robert Wilks Windsor, Jr., USN. In a warm-up cruise, prior to her next West-Pac deployment, USS Currituck made an Alaskan voyage that spanned the Aleutian Islands, operating with VP-47 equipped with P5M Marlin seaplanes. USS Currituck, on this operation, provided the rare opportunity to visit the port of Anchorage, Alaska, and became the largest ship ever to visit that port. Fifty hours at a buoy were logged by VP-47 Commanding Officer Commander Dow and his crew. They and a storm arrived at Cold Bay at the same time. Transfer to Currituck by small boat was impossible. Prior to deployment the crew of USS Currituck said good bye to Chief Aviation Machinist Mate Otto Keller. Chief Keller was at the time the senior chief in the US Navy, having joined the navy in 1908. The Secretary of the Navy participated in Chief Keller's retirement ceremony. Captain O. B. Gray, USN, reported on board as executive officer in August 1962.

USS Currituck arrived in Cebu, Philippines on 6 December 1962 where, after intensive day and night seaplane operations with VP-40 from Sangley Point (Naval Air Station), Cavite City, Philippines, she departed on 10 December 1962 for Manila Bay. USS Currituck dropped anchor off Sangley Point on 12 December 1962 and remained until 15 December 1962. On 18 December 1962 USS Currituck arrived back in Buckner Bay, Okinawa where she tied up to pier \\"Bravo\\" at White Beach. The Surrey Singers from Oklahoma City University entertained on board. A few members of the crew were lucky enough to see Bob Hope and his Troupe entertain at the US Army's Stillwell Field House on 23 December 1962. The crew had a Christmas party for Okinawan children, but it appeared that the sailors may have had the most fun. Both Protestant and Catholic Christmas services were held on Board.

Arriving in Manila Bay, Philippines on 10 January 1963, for a seven-day stay. One of the highlights of this visit was the tour of the Isle of Corregidor, with the Barracks as a grim reminder of the event that occurred here during World War II. USS Currituck departed Manila Bay on 16 January 1963 bound for Buckner Bay. USS Currituck arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa on 19 January 1963, where she remained until 11 February 1963. This stay saw two change of commands. Captain Windsor was replaced by Captain Gray, and then Captain Gray was replaced by Captain Paul J. Knapp, USN, with Captain Gray returning to his previously held position as executive officer. En route to Hong Kong, USS Currituck stopped off at Koshsiung, Taiwan on 13 February 1963 where the visit was highlighted by the Seven Seas from Tsoying Naval Base who entertained the crew with a variety show. Than at sea again on 15 February 1963 and arriving in Hong Kong on 16 February 1963. Mary Soo‚Äôs girls took on the job of painting some of the ship while the crew set about seeing the Tiger Balm Gardens, Sanpan Village at Aberdeen, and a seven-course Chinese dinner at the Tai Pak. On 22 February 1963 USS Currituck sailed, once again, for White Beach. 25 February 1963 saw USS Currituck back at Pier \\"Bravo\\", White Beach, Okinawa. On the morning of 9 March 1963 the crew awoke to see one of the seaplanes with its starboard wing and engine completely under water. The V-Divisions set about the rescue work, loaded the plane on board, and on 10 March 1963 steamed for Kobe, Japan. USS Currituck arrived in Kobe, Japan on 12 March 1963, offloaded the damaged plane and got under way the same day, to pick up another downed plane of VP-50 in Ominato, Japan. USS Currituck arrived in snow-covered Ominato, Japan on 16 March 1963, found the plane and some cold aviators, and another hoisting. With the plane and crew safely on board USS Currituck departed the same day. After a transit of the Shimonoseki Straits USS Currituck arrived in Iwakuni, Japan on 19 March 1963. While in Iwakuni the crew visited neighboring Hiroshima where they visited the Castle and Ground zero, the spot where the first Atomic Bomb hit Japan. Underway on 23 March 1963 USS Currituck arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 25 March 1963. On 1 April 1963 the USS PINE ISLAND (AV-12) arrived, and the flag was transferred. On 2 April 1963 USS Currituck departed West-Pac for her home port of San Diego, California, arriving on 19 April 1963. June 1963 saw USS Currituck operating from a seadrone at White Cove, Santa Catalina Island, California for one week of day and night seaplane operations with VP-48. In July 1963 Commander Brown, USN, assumed duties of executive officer. On 20 January 1964 Captain John W. Crowe, USN, assumed command of USS Currituck. USS Currituck began her third West-Pac tour departing San Diego on 26 January 1964. After 23 days of steaming she arrived in Naha, Okinawa on 18 February 1964. Operating in Lingayen Gulf in exercise \\"Minute Hand\\", the location of her seadrone in January 1945, some twenty year‚Äôs prior, this time servicing VP-48. Returning to Manila she participated in exercise \\"LIGTAS\\", a seven nation, seventy-five ship Task Force with massive amphibious/airborne exercises, during which USS Currituck served as Command Information Center. Next was a visit to Saigon, South Vietnam, wherein she had to navigate up the Saigon River through hostile territory. Arriving off Saigon, she negotiated a 180 degree turn by making a planned maneuver of running her bow aground on the river bank and swinging her stern upstream until she had reversed herself. Following her assigned duties in West-Pac USS Currituck returned to her home port of San Diego, California. 1965-1971 and fate USS Currituck (AV-7) at the end of her 62-day deployment to Con San Island, 1965 USS Currituck deployed for a subsequent West-Pac cruise on 23 April 1965 to become Flagship Patrol Force Seventh Fleet. After visits to Koh Samui and Bangkok, Thailand she established a seadrome off of Con Son, Poulo Condores Islands, Republic of Viet Nam on 29 May 1965 and began servicing aircraft of VP-40. During this period USS Currituck established a number of firsts. On 22 June 1965, USS Currituck became the first ship of her class to deliver shore bombardment against enemy positions in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. She also established a record sixty-seven days on continuous seaplane operations in Cam Rahn Bay, South Viet-Nam, an advanced-base area. Upon leaving Vietnam, she visited Hong Kong, British Crown Colony; Keelung and Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Yokosuka, Sasebo and Kobe, Japan; Subic Bay, Zambales, Philippines. When not at Buckner Bay operating with VP-50. The ship commanded by Captain Martin G. O‚ÄôNeill, USN, and Commander Keith E. Bailey, USN, served as executive officer. USS Currituck returned to San Diego on 1 December 1965 and on 13 January 1966 departed for a two-week training cruise with stops at Magdelina Bay and La Paz, Mexico, returning to San Diego on 27 January. Captain Wayne G. Hammett took command of the USS Currituck on 11 February 1966. Commander William W. McCue had reported as executive officer in December 1965. She also flew the flag at the Maritime Festival, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Seadrome operations were also conducted in the vicinity of Santa Catalina Island, California on several occasions. USS Currituck‚Äôs final deployment to West-Pac reduced her six-month homeport stay four months, and she left for operations from a seadrome at her anchorage in Cam Rahn Bay, South Vietnam, where she serviced the P5M‚Äôs (SP5's) of VP-40 during Operation Market Time. Operating from USS Currituck, VP-40 participated in the last seaplane tender operations conducted by the U.S. Navy and closed this phase of U.S. Naval Aviation History after operating there from 19 March to 12 April 1967. VP-40 logged a total of 860 flight hours, utilizing but seven aircraft from USS Currituck, which maintained an availability of 94.38%. While operating with the Mobil Riverine Force in Vietnam USS Currituck‚Äôs call sign was \\"Flying Goose\\" On 23 May 1967, USS Currituck returned to her home port of San Diego, California and in so doing brought down the curtain on one of the more colorful facets of Naval Aviation operations. She was the last active seaplane tender in the U. S. Navy. After twenty-one days back in her home port in late June 1967, USS Currituck steamed to Seal Beach, California for weapons offload, then to Mare Island at Vallejo, California for decommissioning. She was later towed to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington. There she joined her remaining class members, and West-Pac sisters; USS Pine Island (AV-12) and USS Salisbury Sound (AV-13) already in the same status. She was decommissioned for the last time on 31 October 1967 and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet in Vallejo, CA. She was struck from the Naval Register on 1 April 1971 for disposal, and from the Naval Records on 1 January 1972. She was sold to Union Minerals, and dismantled at Learner Shipyard, Oakland, California in June 1972. Today one of USS Currituck‚Äôs propellers can be seen as the basis of the 'Passing on the Tradition' memorial located on the Louis Memorial Boardwalk in Bremerton WA.

He played college football at Louisiana State University and was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first round of the 1999 NFL Draft. McFarland also played for the Indianapolis Colts, and won two Super Bowl rings in his career: one with the Buccaneers (Super Bowl XXXVII) and another with the Colts (Super Bowl XLI). He was an analyst for Monday Night Football in 2018 and 2019, before joining as a pregame analyst on Monday Night Countdown in 2020. Early years McFarland received the nickname \\"Booger\\" as a child, saying \\"I was a bad kid, getting into a lot of wild stuff. I used to get called a lot of different things. But that was just the one that stuck.\\"  College career  McFarland played for the LSU Tigers football team from 1995 to 1998. In his freshman year, he started every game at defensive tackle, finishing the season with 73 tackles (including 12 tackles for loss and 2 quarterback sacks) and quickly became a crowd favorite for pulling double-duty at the fullback position for short-yardage plays. He also recorded a tackle in LSU's victory over Michigan State at the 1995 Independence Bowl. For the rest of his collegiate career from his sophomore year onward, he focused on defensive tackle, and helped bring the Tigers to two further bowl wins in the 1996 Peach Bowl and the 1997 Independence Bowl, also earning 1996 Peach Bowl SEC Defensive MVP honors. Despite a spectacular collapse by the Tigers in the 1998 season, McFarland was named defensive co- captain his senior year, earned first-team All-SEC and All-America honors, and played in the 1999 Senior Bowl. He graduated in 1999 with a degree in business management.  Professional career  McFarland was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 15th overall pick in the 1999 NFL Draft. In eight seasons with the team, he totaled 305 tackles and 20 sacks over 84 games, and won Super Bowl XXXVII in 2002. On October 17, 2006, McFarland was traded to the Indianapolis Colts for a second-round pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. The trade reunited him with Tony Dungy, his head coach in Tampa Bay during his first three seasons. At the time of the trade, the Colts ranked last in the league in run defense, allowing over 116 yards per-game, and had lost defensive tackle Corey Simon to a season-ending injury the week before. McFarland made his first sack as a member of the Colts against the Buffalo Bills on November 10. He finished the regular season with 33 tackles and 2.5 sacks, although the Colts finished last in rush defense. In the playoffs, the Colts defense became stifling, limiting the Kansas City Chiefs to 44 rushing yards, the Baltimore Ravens to 83 and the New England Patriots to 93. In Super Bowl XLI, in which McFarland had a sack, the Colts defeated the Chicago Bears, 29‚Äì17, resulting in the second Super Bowl ring of McFarland's career. He suffered a career- ending knee injury the following training camp.  Broadcasting career  McFarland co-hosted a radio show with Marc Ryan on Tampa sports radio station WHFS until an ownership change in December 2014 resulted in the station's entire airstaff being released for a music format. He joined the SEC Network in 2014 as a football analyst. McFarland was also a part-time guest analyst on ESPN's Mike & Mike morning program. McFarland was a color analyst for ESPN's Monday Night Football telecasts, after arriving with Jason Witten in 2018. Prior to his promotion to color analyst, McFarland was a sideline reporter and consultant during the Monday Night Football broadcasts where he announced from atop a crane-like contraption nicknamed the \\"Booger Mobile.\\" After receiving criticism for blocking the view of fans seated near the field, the contraption was modified to be less obstructive. McFarland was promoted to color analyst in May 2019 after Witten left to return to the Dallas Cowboys. In May 2020, he and play-by-play announcer Joe Tessitore were reassigned by ESPN amid criticism from viewers.

It is recognized as one of the oldest Christian monasteries in existence and is famous for its magnificent library and considerable collection of Syriac Christian manuscripts.Michael Goldfarb, Ahmad's War, Ahmad's Peace (New York: Carroll & Graf, 2005). It is also the center of an Archbishopric, with Bishop Mor Timothius Mousa A. Shamani serving. History Mor Timothy Mosa Alshamany (2015), Archbishop of the monastery The monastery was founded in 363 by the hermit Mar Mattai who had fled persecution in Amid under the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate. According to Syriac tradition, he was involved in healing the sister of Mor Behnam and converting the brother and sister to Christianity. Their father, King Sinharib of Assyria initially killed his son and daughter but later recanted and awarded Mattai a place atop Mount Alfaf to establish his monastery. Mattai was quickly joined by a small group of Syriac followers, and under his leadership that community developed a true monastic ethos. In the 12th century, after storming a nunnery in Khudida, Kurds attacked the monastery for four months with 1,000 horsemen and foot soldiers. The monks burnt the ladders to prevent entry. Then, two large boulders were rolled against the walls from above and caused a hole which the kurds tried to force their way in. The monks successfully fought back with stones and darts. Then, they repaired the walls. Abbot Abunser lost an eye in this battle. Eventually, the kurds were bribed with the gold and silver from the churches, and afraid of a mongol attack, they retreated. In 1171, neighbouring Kurds led several attacks on the monastery and were repelled by a coalition of monks and local Christians. The Kurds promised the monks they would cease their attacks and paid them 30 dinars and the monks sent the local Christians back to their villages in the belief that the monastery would be safe. Later, a force of 1500 Kurds succeeded in pillaging the monastery and killing 15 monks who did not find refuge in the upper citadel. The monks who survived the attack abandoned the monastery and relocated to Mosul. Upon hearing of the attack, the governor of Mosul attacked the Kurds, killing many; in retaliation the Kurds destroyed nine Assyrian villages, killing their inhabitants and attacked the Monastery of Mar Sergius. In 1369, another Kurdish attack on the monastery damaged many manuscripts. During the 19th century, Kurds looted the monastery numerous times. The monastery is currently maintained by the Syriac Orthodox Church, and serves the small farming village below. Every year, Christians of various church denominations gather in the monastery on September 18 to commemorate the day of Mar Matti's death.

He was the brother of the well known journalist Jacobo Zabludovsky. Abraham Zabludovsky was born in Bia≈Çystok, Poland. He studied at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, graduating in 1949. In his early years he produced a large number of outstanding residential buildings and offices in Mexico City, making rigorous use of the International style and demonstrating an impeccable handling of contemporary design, techniques and materials. Also notable from this period was the Centro C√≠vico Cinco de Mayo (1962), Puebla, on which he collaborated with Guillermo Rossell. In 1968 Zabludovsky began working in collaboration with Teodoro Gonz√°lez de Le√≥n, although the two architects continued to work on some projects individually and retained their separate stylistic identities. Their collaborative work was remarkable for its quality and maturity, establishing functional and formal solutions that were later widely imitated. Clear examples of their characteristic proposals for constructions of massive, linear volume are the Delegaci√≥n Cuauht√©moc (1972‚Äì3; with Jaime Ortiz Monasterio (b 1928) and Luis Antonio Zapiain (b 1942)), the headquarters of INFONAVIT (Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores, completed 1975) and the new building for the Colegio de M√©xico (1974‚Äì5; see MEXICO, fig. 7), all in Mexico City. Zabludovsky also carried out a number of works individually in the same style. Outstanding among these was the Centro Cultural Emilio O. Rabasa (1983), Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, Chiapas, a construction with sculptural aspects that manages faithfully to fulfil the need for both theatricality and diffusion. He also designed two multipurpose auditoriums in Celaya and Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato (1990), two theatres in Guanajuato, Guanajuato, and Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes (1991), and a convention centre in Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, Chiapas (1994).Fallece Abraham Zabludovsky (1924‚Äì2003), arquiRED, Reservados Todos los Derechos (Spanish)Abraham Zabludovsky (1924‚Äì2003), epdlp.com (Spanish) He died of a heart attack in Mexico City on April 10, 2003, aged 78.

The case resulted from negotiations for the Charlottetown Accord, in which various groups representing Aboriginal peoples in Canada were financially supported by the government, but the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) was not. Since NWAC claimed the other Aboriginal groups primarily represented Aboriginal men, it argued that section 28 (sexual equality under the Charter) could be used so that section 2 (freedom of expression) required the government to provide an equal benefit to Aboriginal women, supposedly represented by NWAC. The case could be seen as unusual, because as the Court noted, \\"This case does not involve the typical situation of government action restricting or interfering with freedom of expression in the negative sense\\" and that \\"the respondents are requesting the Court to consider whether there may be a positive duty on governments to facilitate expression in certain circumstances.\\" Background During negotiations for the Charlottetown Accord, there was discussion of enhancing Aboriginal self- government in Canada, and entrenching this new order of government in the Constitution of Canada. Four Aboriginal interest groups participated in the discussions with financial support from the government, namely the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), the Native Council of Canada (NCC), the M√©tis National Council (MNC) and the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada (ITC). NWAC was not an equal partner among these participants, but some of the money trickled down to this group because it was decided that some of the government money should be spent on discussing women's rights in the Aboriginal community. In some cases, NWAC was left out of certain meetings altogether. They claimed that their aim was to make sure the new Aboriginal self-governments would respect women's Charter rights, and that the other Aboriginal groups primarily represented Aboriginal men. Upon reviewing the case, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the treatment of NWAC might indeed infringe section 2 of the Canadian Charter. Decision The Supreme Court majority, represented by John Sopinka, did not share the view of the Federal Court of Appeal and ruled against the rights claimants. The Court did, however, reject the government's argument that the Charter was not applicable at all. The government had said that if NWAC was excluded from the discussions, it was the fault of the AFN, NCC, ITC and MNC, since they did not share their funds more equally, and the Charter does not apply to these Aboriginal groups but only to the government itself. As the Court noted, it was to whom the government itself gave its money to that was the real issue. Nevertheless, in its discussion of sections 2 and 28, the Court found in favour of the government. The Court followed its precedent in Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General) to find that discussing constitutional issues with the government is \\"unquestionably\\" a form of expression, of the kind referred to in section 2. However, the government did not seem to be guilty of suppressing this expression, which Irwin Toy also requires for the section 2 claim to succeed. The question, then, was whether the consequence of the government's actions was to limit Aboriginal women's free speech, even though the government had seemed to want a discussion, and whether section 28 was infringed when the groups claimed to primarily represent Aboriginal men were given more opportunity to expression than NWAC. In making this claim, NWAC acknowledged that the government was not required by section 2 to provide this type of financial support in ordinary circumstances, but since the government had agreed to support the other groups, the support for interest groups should be fair and equal. The Court considered the case Haig v. Canada, which had also seen some positive claims under section 2 in relation to the Charlottetown Accord. NWAC believed Haig dictated that if expression were to be supported by the government, it should be fair and the Charter should apply, and that section 28 reinforced NWAC's claim. The Court, however, argued that firstly, funding for diverse groups could not be the rule with every governmental study, or \\"the ramifications on government spending would be far reaching indeed.\\" They also quoted a United States Supreme Court free speech case, in which it was noted that the government is engaged in many studies and does much, and if the Constitution was applied to make sure everyone is represented in the process, the process would be slow. If positive obligations under section 2 are rare, then, the Court noted that it was never actually proven that the AFN, NCC, ITC and MNC represent Aboriginal men over Aboriginal women, or that these groups were pushing for self-governments that would favour Aboriginal men. The ITC, for example, not only denied that the ITC represented Inuit men above women, but that NWAC itself did not represent Inuit women, as this was the role of the group Pauktuutit. The Court also believed that the AFN, NCC, ITC and MNC could carry NWAC's concerns to the discussions. The Court briefly dismissed challenges under section 15, as these were closely related to those under section 2. Indeed, the Court wrote that NWAC's \\"contentions regarding ss. 2(b) and 28 of the Charter are better characterized as a s. 15 Charter argument.\\" The Court also briefly dismissed claims under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which entrenches Aboriginal rights equally for men and women. As the Court noted, there is no Aboriginal right or treaty right to debate constitutional reform. Concurrences=Concurrence by L'Heureux-Dube A separate concurrence was written by Justice Claire L'Heureux-Dube, who disagreed on how the case Haig v. Canada was interpreted. As she specified, the Haig decision established there is no right to vote in a referendum under the Charter; this does not mean, however, that it will be unusual that the government be bound by the Charter when it supports expression in other circumstances. The reason why L'Heureux-Dube otherwise supported Sopinka's decision was that she agreed that in this case, NWAC's expression was not suppressed, although NWAC did not receive the treatment it would have preferred. Concurrence by McLachlin Justice Beverley McLachlin also gave a separate concurrence, in which she wrote that \\"the freedom of governments to choose and fund their advisors on matters of policy is not constrained by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\\" and that these \\"policy consultations\\" are different from voting, which Haig was concerned with.

The town lies in northwestern corner of Poddebice County, near the border with Wielkopolskie Voivodeship. Uniej√≥w is known for its Thermal Park and the 14th- century castle with a landscape park (), regarded as one of the best preserved parks of central Poland. History The history of the town dates back to the early years of Polish statehood. Mentioned as Uneievo in a bull of Pope Innocent II (1136), Uniej√≥w is one of the oldest towns of Poland. At that time it belonged to the Archbishops of Gniezno, and received its town charter most likely before 1290. In the late 13th century, Archbishop Jakub Swinka founded Church of the Holy Spirit, and in 1331, Uniej√≥w was burned by the Teutonic Knights. The town was rebuilt, and in the late 14th - early 15th century, it was a local center of commerce and crafts. For centuries, Uniej√≥w enjoyed several privileges, granted to it by the Archbishops of Gniezno. In 1360-1365, a defensive castle was built here. It became one of residences of the Archbishops, here several councils and meetings took place. Like many Polish cities, Uniej√≥w declined after Swedish invasion of Poland. The castle was ransacked, and the town itself was burned. There also were two dangerous fires, in 1736 and 1790, and after the Congress of Vienna (1815), the town became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, where it remained until World War One. In 1836, Uniej√≥w was granted to a Tsarist General Aleksander Toll, and in 1870, it lost its town charter, becoming a village. In 1919 Uniejow again became a town. In September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, Polish units of Poznan Army resisted here the advancing Wehrmacht. During the heavy fighting, Uniej√≥w was partially burned. The Jewish population of Uniej√≥w, numbering slightly over 1000 was immediately brutalized by the invaders, kidnapped for forced labor, beaten, and robbed. In 1940, they were moved into a ghetto in the more decrepit part of town and the following year, the entire Jewish population of around 500 was forced to live in four buildings. Some able bodied men were sent to work camps near Poznan. In October 1941, all the community's Jewish population was sent to a ghetto in Kowale Panskie where in July 1942 most were sent to the Chelmno killing camp where they were immediately gassed. A few were sent to the Lodz ghetto. There were few survivors among Uniej√≥w's Jewish population, perhaps around 20. Men of the nationalist Polish underground murdered one survivor in the Turek Forest in late 1945, months after the war ended. Currently, Uniej√≥w is a spa and tourist destination, due to its landscape park and geothermal waters. The town has several restaurants, hotel located in the castle, and other amenities. There also are walking and bicycle trails. Among sights are Gothic castle (built in 1360-1365 by Archbishop Jaroslaw of Bogoria and Skotnik, restored in 1956-67), collegiate with a 14th-century Gothic presbytery, neo- Baroque church tower (1901), Classicistic manor house (1845).

The mission of The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) is to restore the American chestnut tree to the forests of Eastern North America by breeding genetically diverse blight-resistant trees, evaluating various approaches to the management of chestnut pests and pathogens, and reintroducing the trees into the forest in an ecologically acceptable manner. The American chestnut tree once comprised a quarter of the eastern hardwood forest from Maine to Georgia and west to the Ohio River Valley, providing a valuable economic resource in both timber and nuts, as well as an abundant food source for wildlife. An accidentally imported Asiatic chestnut blight decimated approximately four billion trees, with devastating results to Appalachian communities and economies. TACF's work is accomplished by the combination of a small professional staff and a large group of volunteers associated with sixteen state chapters from Maine to Georgia/Alabama and west to the Ohio River Valley. Chapters leverage TACF's efforts by organizing volunteers to identify surviving American chestnuts, pollinate these survivors with pollen from TACF's Meadowview Research Farms station in Virginia, and establish and maintain local breeding nurseries. These nurseries expect to eventually produce blight-resistant trees adapted to local conditions throughout the original range. The requirements for both genetic diversity and regional adaptability were the key factors in the establishment of the state chapter breeding programs manned by volunteers. A strength of TACF has been its ability to develop effective partnerships with other organizations leading to the advancement of the science relative to developing a blight-resistant tree. TACF has many cooperators involved in chestnut study and restoration, among them university partnerships, the National Wild Turkey Federation, and the US Forest Service The American Chestnut Foundation differs from the American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation, which is attempting to re-establish the species using pure American chestnut genetic stock. TACF was founded in 1983 by a group of prominent plant scientists, including Nobel Prize-winning plant breeder Norman Borlaug; Peter Raven, Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden; independent chestnut researcher Philip Rutter;Author of Growing Hybrid Hazelnuts, https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/growing-hybrid-hazelnuts/ and the late Charles Burnham, a Minnesota corn geneticist. In 1989 TACF established the Wagner Research Farm, a breeding station in Meadowview, in southwestern Virginia, to execute the backcross breeding program. A second research farm in Meadowview was donated to TACF in 1995, and a third Meadowview farm was purchased in 2002. As of late 2005, TACF's Meadowview Research Farms have over 57,000 trees at various stages of breeding, planted on more than of land. In 2007, TACF began harvesting nuts that it expects will be suitable for planting back into the forest. However, these breeding lines are still in the testing phase, and their value needs to be proven on many forest sites until 2015 to 2020. One group of highly backcrossed blight-resistant chestnuts produced by the organization is 15/16 (ca. 94%) American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and 1/16 (ca. 6%) Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima), a source of blight resistance. A gradual increase in TACF seed production is expected over the next few years. These will be distributed to cooperators who are assisting in a formal, rigorous testing program. In addition, seeds that are not needed for this purpose will be distributed for informal testing, principally to members of TACF. At the same time, TACF is continuing its breeding program to make further gains in disease resistance and forest competitiveness.

For a couple of years in the late 1940s, Tremlett looked as though he might be the answer to some of England's post-war cricketing woes. A tall, curly-haired all-rounder, Tremlett had a whippy fast-medium bowling action that moved the ball off the pitch and was a pugnacious right-handed batsman, strong at driving. Life and career Tremlett was born in Stockport, Cheshire. His first-class debut was sensational. Having been on the Somerset staff since before World War II, he was finally picked for the first game of the 1947 season, at Lord's against Middlesex, the team that would dominate that season's County Championship. Tremlett took three wickets in the first innings, and then five in the space of five overs in the second, to finish with match figures of 8 for 86. He then followed that up by making an undefeated 19, and sharing in a last-wicket partnership that enabled Somerset to win the match by one wicket. By the end of that first season, Tremlett had 656 runs and 65 wickets and he was chosen, with several other young cricketers, for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour to the West Indies, where he opened the bowling in three of the four Test matches. He was not a success, taking only four wickets and scoring just 20 runs in the Tests, and on the tour as a whole, his wickets were expensive and he scored few runs. Yet after another successful county season in 1948 ‚Äì 1056 runs and 86 wickets, both at an improved average ‚Äì he was picked for a second MCC tour in 1948‚Äì49, this time to South Africa. Though he scored his maiden century in the match against a Natal side at Pietermaritzburg, Tremlett was never in contention for a Test place and Wisden 's report on the tour said that his \\"bowling lacked control\\". After playing in South Africa, he was later one of many signatories in a letter to The Times on 17 July 1958 opposing 'the policy of apartheid' in international sport and defending 'the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games'.Brown and Hogsbjerg, Apartheid is not a game, 16 Over the next few years, Tremlett's batting developed to the point where, in 1951, he scored more than 2,000 runs. In all, he scored 1,000 runs in a season ten times. But his bowling became more and more erratic until, by the mid 1950s, he was used only as an occasional change bowler. From 1956, he captained Somerset, their first professional skipper, charged with the job of restoring the fortunes of a county that had finished bottom of the Championship table for each of the preceding four seasons. As a captain, he was a great success, leading the side in 1958 to third position in the Championship, its highest placing ever. He stood down from the captaincy after the 1959 season and, after a few games in 1960, he retired to a job with Guinness.

Code-named Operation Rubicon and timed to coincide with the anniversary of Napoleon I's coronation and victory at Austerlitz, the coup ended in the successful dissolution of the French National Assembly and the subsequent re- establishment of the French Empire the next year. When he faced the prospect of having to leave office in 1852, Louis-Napol√©on (nephew of Napol√©on Bonaparte) staged the coup in order to stay in office and implement his reform programs; these included the restoration of universal male suffrage (previously abolished by the legislature). His political measures, and the extension of his mandate for 10 years, were popularly endorsed by constitutional referendum. A year later, the Prince-President reclaimed his uncle's throne as Emperor of the French under the regnal name Napoleon III.  Causes  In 1848, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte was elected President of France through universal male suffrage, taking 74% of the vote. He did this with the support of the Parti de l'Ordre after running against Louis Eug√®ne Cavaignac. Subsequently, he was in constant conflict with the members (d√©put√©s) of the Assembl√©e Nationale. Contrary to the Party's expectations that Louis-Napoleon would be easy to manipulate (Adolphe Thiers had called him a \\"cretin whom we will lead [by the nose]\\"), he proved himself an agile and cunning politician. He succeeded in imposing his choices and decisions on the Assembl√©e, which had once again become conservative in the aftermath of the June Days Uprising in 1848. He broke away from the control of the Parti de l'Ordre and created the Minist√®re des Commis, appointing General Hautpoul as its head, in 1849. On 3 January 1850, he dismissed Changarnier, a dissident in the Parti de l'Ordre, thereby provoking an open conflict within the party. He also actively encouraged the creation of numerous anti-parliament newspapers and acquired the support of 150 members of Parliament, the \\"Parti de l'Elys√©e\\". The provisions of the constitution that prohibited an incumbent president from seeking re-election appeared to force the end of Louis-Napoleon's rule in December 1852. Not one to admit defeat, Louis-Napoleon spent the first half of 1851 trying to force changes to the constitution through Parliament so he could be re-elected. Bonaparte travelled through the provinces and organised petitions to rally popular support. Two-thirds of the General Council supported Louis-Napoleon's cause, but in the Assembly, supporters of the Duke of Orl√©ans, led by Thiers, concluded an alliance with the far left to oppose Louis-Napoleon's plans. In January 1851, the Parliament voted no confidence in the Minist√®re des Commis. On 19 July, it refused the constitutional reform proposed by Louis-Napoleon, also scrapping universal male suffrage in an effort to break popular support for Bonaparte.  Preparations for the coup  The coup d'√©tat was meticulously planned from 20 August 1851. Preparations and planning for this coup took place at Saint-Cloud. Among the conspirators were Persigny, a loyal companion of Louis-Napoleon, the Duke of Morny, and General Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud. On 14 October, Louis-Napoleon asked the Parliament to restore universal male suffrage but the request was turned down. His request for a reconsideration of the constitutional reform proposal was also turned down on 13 November. Prepared to strike, Louis-Napoleon appointed General Saint-Arnaud as the Minister of War and a circular was issued reminding soldiers of their pledge of \\"passive obedience\\". Followers of the President were appointed to various important positions: General Magnan as the Commander of the Troops of Paris, and Maupas, Prefect of Haute-Garonne as Prefect of Police of Paris. Convinced that the coup was now inevitable after the latest refusal, Louis-Napoleon fixed the anniversary of the coronation of Napoleon in 1804, and the victory of Austerlitz in 1805, as the day for the coup. The operation was christened Rubicon, alluding to Julius Caesar.  The coup of 2 December 1851  D'Allonville's cavalry in the street of Paris during Napoleon III's coup. On the morning of 2 December, troops led by Saint-Arnaud occupied strategic points in Paris, from the Champs-√âlys√©es to the Tuileries. Top opposition leaders were arrested and six edicts promulgated to establish the rule of Louis-Napoleon. The Assembl√©e Nationale was dissolved, and universal male suffrage restored. Louis-Napoleon declared that a new constitution was being framed and said he intended to restore the \\"system established by the First Consul\\". Reacting to this coup, parliamentarians took refuge in the mayor's office of the 20th arrondissement of Paris and 220 of them voted to oust Louis-Napoleon from power. Most prominent among these were liberals like Remusat and moderates like Pascal Duprat, who were arrested soon after. A Parisian insurrection led by the likes of Victor Hugo and Victor Schoelcher erupted despite tight control by the Army. The insurgents were soon defeated. On 3 December, parliamentarian Alphonse Baudin was killed and on 4 December, 200 more people fell victim to the revolt. The Italian journalist Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina was among the rebels and was expelled from France. By evening, the revolt of Paris was suppressed and the city returned to normal.  Revolt in other places  The coup triggered revolts in other places across France. On 5 December, rebellions were reported in big cities, small towns and rural areas in the south-west of France. The department of Basses-Alpes even declared itself administered by a \\"Committee of Resistance\\" but the army, still loyal to the President, succeeded in quelling the rebellion. A total of 32 departments were put under a state of alert from 8 December and the rebellious areas were controlled in a few days. Opponents were arrested and some were forced to flee. Victor Hugo fled to Brussels, then Jersey, and finally settled with his family on the Channel Island of Guernsey at Hauteville House, where he would live in exile until 1870 when Louis-Napoleon fled after his defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. By the end of the rebellion, 26,000 people were arrested, 9,530 were sent to Algeria and 250 to the prison of Cayenne.  Peace returns  The Bonapartists were finally assured of a victory. Generals Vaillant and Harispe became Marshals of France on 11 December. A new constitution was being drafted. A referendum was organised to ratify the new order and the coup was portrayed as a security operation. On 20 and 21 December, the French population were recorded as having voted for acceptance of the new regime by an overwhelming majority of 7,145,000 to 600,000, although the official tally and free nature of the vote were questioned by dissidents like Victor Hugo. Louis-Napol√©on now had the power to draft a new constitution.  Consequences  Following a referendum in December 1851, a new constitution was adopted in January 1852. It dramatically expanded the powers of the president, who was elected for a period of 10 years with no term limits. He not only possessed executive power, but was vested with the power of legislative initiative, thereby reducing the scope of the Parliament. Louis-Napoleon was automatically reelected to a fresh term as president. For all intents and purposes, he now held all governing power in the nation. The authoritarian republic proved to be only a stopgap, as Louis-Napoleon immediately set about restoring the empire. In less than a year, following another referendum on 7 November 1852, the Second French Empire was proclaimed. On the symbolic and historic date of 2 December 1852 (the anniversary of the Coronation of Napoleon I in 1804), President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte became Napoleon III, Emperor of the French.

He accompanied his elder brother, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, to take the part of their uncle Charles I in the English Civil War in 1642. He served under Rupert with the cavalry at the Battle of Powick Bridge, where he was wounded, and the Battle of Edgehill. He commanded the army in Gloucestershire which engaged Sir William Waller in several battles in 1643, including the victory of Ripple Field (13 April), culminating in the Royalist victory at the Battle of Roundway Down (13 July). He took command of the army in Cornwall and campaigned in the southwest for the remainder of the year. In April 1644, he besieged Lyme Regis, but was forced to give up the siege in June, at considerable cost to his military reputation. He fought as a subordinate at the Battle of Lostwithiel and the Second Battle of Newbury, and under Rupert at the Battle of Naseby. He attempted to defend Rupert's surrender of Bristol in 1645 to Charles. While unsuccessful, he did not share in Rupert's disgrace. Banished with Rupert in October 1646, he served with the French army in Flanders, but rejoined Rupert in 1648 as vice-admiral of his fleet. He was created a Knight of the Garter in exile in 1649. In 1652, while sailing for the West Indies, specifically near the Virgin Islands, he was caught in a hurricane and went down with his flagship, HMS Defiance.

His main accomplishments were transforming poetry from an oral to a literary tradition, focusing upon secular themes with an emphasis on inner emotion, daily life, and nationalism, and translating numerous European authors into the Kyrgyz language, including William Shakespeare, S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi, and Alexander Pushkin.  Biography  Osmonov was born in Kaptal-Aryk in Panfilov District, Kyrgyzstan, about 75 km west of Bishkek. He was orphaned at a young age and was brought up in state care, first in a Bishkek orphanage, then in a Tokmok orphanage. From 1929, Osmonov studied at pedagogical school in Bishkek, but owing to tuberculosis which he had acquired from one of the orphanages, he was forced to leave. Nevertheless, he was able to begin a journalistic career, working for several early Soviet-era Kyrgyz- language newspapers, including \\"Chabul\\" (\\"Attack\\"), \\"Leninchil Jash\\" (\\"Lenin's Youth\\"), and \\"Kyzyl Kyrgyzstan\\" (\\"Red Kyrgyzstan\\", which continues to exist to this day under the title, \\"Kyrgyz Tuusu\\"). From 1939 to 1940, he served as secretary-in-chief for the Kyrgyzstan National Writers Union (\\"–ö—ã—Ä–≥—ã–∑—Å—Ç–∞–Ω –£–ª—É—Ç—Ç—É–∫ –ñ–∞–∑—É—É—á—É–ª–∞—Ä —Å–æ—é–∑—É\\", which also continues to exist today). A year before, he was granted membership into the Union of Soviet Writers. His first poem, \\"Kyzyl Juk\\" (\\"Red Strings of Wheat\\"), was published in 1930, and his first volume of poems, Tandagy Yrlai (Poems at Dawn), in 1935. Eventually he would publish up to 500 poems, including the well-known volume, Mahabat (Love), as well as several major translations, including Shota Rustaveli's The Knight in the Panther's Skin, Shakespeare's Othello and Twelfth Night, and Pushkin's Eugene Onegin. Several of his poems were inspired by his various romantic escapades, in particular his first love, a woman named Aida, whom he pursued in 1934, and his failed marriage to Zeinep Sooranbaeva (1941‚Äì1943), as well as the personal tragedies which seemed to pursue him, such as his parents' deaths or his own daughter's death in 1943. He, himself, would die tragically: in Bishkek of pulmonary disease pneumonia in 1950, at the age of 35.  Awards and museums  Osmonov was awarded the \\"Stalin Prize\\" (USSR State Prize) in 1950, and posthumously the \\"Lenin Prize\\" in 1967. His face and a piece of his poetry are on the 200 Kyrgyzstani som piece, and there is a statue of him outside the National Library in Bishkek. Osmonov traveled throughout Kyrgyzstan, and today there are several museums in his honor, including Bishkek, Tokmok, Cholpon-Ata, and especially his hometown Kaptal- Aryk, in the area of Kara-Balta.

It contains a mixture of C8 (octyl) and C10 (decyl) chains with C8 predominating. It is an ionic liquid. Applications=Organic Chemistry Aliquat 336 is used as a phase transfer catalyst, including in the catalytic oxidation of cyclohexene to 1,6-hexanedioic acid. This reaction is more environmentally friendly. It is an example of green chemistry, compared with the traditional method of oxidizing cyclohexanol or cyclohexanone with nitric acid or potassium permanganate, which produce hazardous wastes. Aliquat 336 was used in the total synthesis of manzamine A by Darren Dixon in an early step to the electrophile. Solvent extraction of metals Aliquat 336 has been used for the extraction of metals, it does so by acting as a liquid anion exchanger. It is often used while diluted in hydrocarbon solvents such as aromatic kerosene. It is possible to use it in aliphatic kerosene but in such solvents often a phase modifier (typically a long chain alcohol) must be added to prevent the formation of third phase.

Two versions were built, with the same RSD-7 model designation but different specifications and power ratings, although both used the ALCO 244 engine in V16 configuration. Specification DL-600, of which only two were built, developed and used the 244G engine. The revised specification DL-600A, numbering 27 locomotives, was rated at and used the 244H engine. The RSD-7 was superseded by the ALCO 251-engined ALCO RSD-15, which looks very similar. The RSD-7 was the last ALCO diesel built with a 244 engine. Both rode on a pair of three-axle trucks with all three axles on each truck powered; this is a C-C wheel arrangement. These trucks have an unequal axle spacing due to traction motor positioning; the outer two axles on each truck are closer together than the inner two. The RSD-7 used the GE 752 traction motor. The six-motor design allowed better tractive effort at lower speeds. Demonstrators The two RSD-7 demonstrators were significant for Alco. They were built with the intention of challenging the Fairbanks-Morse Train Master H24-66. When built in early 1954 the RSD-7 delivered the highest continuous tractive effort of all diesel locomotives then available. The RSD-7 offered 75% more dynamic braking capacity than any standard freight unit available at the time. The superlatives of the RSD-7 allowed two units to do the work of three conventional 4-motor units. The dynamic brake system was mounted on top the long hood, leaving room in the short hood for a steam generator. The RSD-7 was the first Alco built with the notched corner sand fills. The RSD-7 was the first Alco to use the coiled air brake intercoolers mounted just above and ahead of the radiator intakes. The RSD-7 was the first Alco to use the then new Model 710 water cooled turbocharger in a 16-cylinder engine. The two demonstrators were numbered DL600 and DL601. The DL600 weighed 360,000 pounds at the standard 60,000 pounds per axle. The DL601 weighed 390,000 to test the gains in adhesion from the extra weight. Additional experimentation by Alco used new fuel injection pumps and nozzles, increased fuel rack settings, and an aftercooler was applied to reduce engine air inlet temperature. The aftercooler allowed higher density inlet air into the engine that promoted greater fuel burning efficiency. The aftercooler became the feature that allowed the 244 to be pushed to 2400 horsepower and the designation of 244H. The 244H is also known as the Alco 250 engine to disassociate it from the troubled 244 engine series. The maroon, yellow and gray painted RSD-7 demonstrators began a 23-railroad, 50,000 mile demonstration tour in the Spring of 1954. The tour concluded in September 1954 and the two units were refurbished before sale to the Santa Fe.

Their 4th studio album, it represented a major departure from past recordings. Unlike the first album, Silent Steeples, it is electric; unlike the second, Bang Bang, many of its songs express political messages. Specifically, Open Up, Time Served, Passerby, and Blood have clear political undertones. This could be seen as foreshadowing for the development of Dispatch member Chad Urmston's post-Dispatch music career (as frontman for State Radio). In the album's booklet credits, the band members are referred to under their Dispatch aliases. Thus, Chad Urmston is \\"Chetro\\", Brad Corrigan is \\"Braddigan\\", and Pete Francis Heimbold is \\"Repete.\\" The Title of the album, cover and case art of the album was created by William Quigley based on a 10 ft painting he made during the 1992 La Riots on his birthday April 29 entitled \\"Who are we Living for\\". As he was working on the painting the title came to him because of the Fear, Violence and Fires occurring right outside the walls of his then Los Angeles studio. Quigley also performed with the Band as a Dancer Pete named \\"Mr. Wiggles\\" from 1999-2006 in over 50 performances, while also designing some of the stages. The band started to develop a stage personality and highly charged show incorporating video, light, and performance as part of their act. In 2004, Universal Records re-released Who Are We Living For with four additional tracks.

He was originally signed by the Chicago Bears as an undrafted free agent in 2003. He played college football at Fresno State. Worrell also played for the Miami Dolphins and was signed with the New York Jets. Cameron Worrell is the son of Dale Worrell and Polly Welk Worrell. His grandfather, Richard Welk, is the nephew of famous band leader Lawrence Welk. He is also a distant relative of American swimmer Michael Worrell. Early years Worrell was a two-year starter at both running back and safety at Chowchilla High School in Chowchilla, California. He earned North Sequoia League Offensive Player of the Year honors as a senior. He was also named to the All-Section team, gaining 1,300 yards on 160 carries with 16 touchdowns on offense and two interceptions on defense. College career Worrell originally attended Fresno State University, but did not play as a redshirt freshman in 1999 and subsequently transferred to Fresno City College where he helped the Rams to a perfect regular season. As a junior in 2001, Worrell appeared in 14 games and recorded 31 tackles with two sacks, four tackles for a loss, two interceptions and one fumble recovery. In his first year as a starter for Fresno State, Worrell earned All-Western Athletic Conference honors. He started all 14 games as a senior and led the Bulldogs with career-highs of 106 tackles and five interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown. He added four sacks, two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and seven passes defensed on the year. Professional career=First stint with Bears Worrell was undrafted in the 2003 NFL Draft, but was signed by the Chicago Bears after a tryout during a post-draft minicamp. He was the only undrafted free agent to make the team out of training camp in 2003. During his rookie season, Worrell saw action in 14 games on special teams and in a reserve role at safety. He recorded eight special teams tackles on the year and he also recovered an R.W. McQuarters fumble on a punt return. Worrell played in 13 games during the 2004 season, amassing 16 tackles, a sack and a forced fumble. He missed the final two games of the season after being placed on Injured Reserve with an ankle injury. A shoulder injury suffered in Week 3 of the preseason caused Worrell to miss the entire 2005 regular season. Worrell had the best statistical year of his career to date in 2006. He appeared in all 16 games for the first time in his career and totaled 21 tackles, a sack, a forced fumble and three fumble recoveries. He played in a reserve role against the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLI, but did not accumulate any statistics. Miami Dolphins As an unrestricted free agent the following offseason, Worrell signed with the Miami Dolphins on March 8, 2007. He received a two-year contract from the team worth $2 million and including a $285,000 signing bonus. Worrell suffered a torn ACL in Week 13 and was placed on season-ending injured reserve. The Dolphins waived Worrell on April 24, 2008 after he failed a physical. New York Jets Worrell signed with the New York Jets on June 8, 2008. He was assigned No. 45. Chicago Bears (second stint) Worrell after being injured for the whole 2008 season was signed on December 26, 2008 when Mike Brown was placed on injured reserve. He became a free agent following the season.

Because it is not tracked by the U.S. Census, a census population estimate is not available. Funk is a hamlet and was platted under the name Austen in 1894. Before that, it was called Kauffman Corners. The names Kaufman, Funk, and Austen all referred to local families who had owned land in and around Funk for generations. Funk's growth started in the late 1890s when a portion of the A&W; Railroad was built from Big Prairie to Ashland. This was completed in 1899. At this point, there was another village called Austin, Ohio so the name was changed to Funk after a local family that lived and farmed in the area. Before World War I, a Grain elevator was built. It is assumed it was built by a man named Craig, who may be the man who donated his farmland to form Craigton, another unincorporated community and railroad depot from the early 1900s located a few miles from Funk. This grain elevator passed through several hands before becoming known as the Funk Equity Union Co. It was later owned by William \\"D\\" Funk, who also owned the successful general general store and was an agent for the railroad in the village. D Funk inherited the general store from his father Zenas between 1895 and 1910. The store went through several more owners until it was finally closed in 1986. The grain elevator was operated until 1957. Funk had two blacksmiths, a scrap dealer, a butcher, several barbers, a make-shift automobile jack factory called The Black Jack Factory, an ice house, gravel pit, and in the 1980s was hom to the Austin Disposal headquarters. The only church in Funk was a Methodist Church located across the Ashland County line, the building later moved to Funk and remodeled into a home. They were destroyed in a fire in 1940. The locals transferred to Maple Grove Methodist Church. There is some confusion for outsiders about the origins of Funk's name because they were never explicitly recorded in public records. Funk is located at the intersection of South Funk Road and State Route 95, southwest of the county seat of Wooster.

The term is a pun on the name of Werner Heisenberg, the physicist who first asserted the observer effect of quantum mechanics, which states that the act of observing a system inevitably alters its state. In electronics the traditional term is probe effect, where attaching a test probe to a device changes its behavior. Similar terms, such as bohrbug, mandelbug,Raymond, Eric S.; The New Hacker's Dictionary, 3rd edition, 1996Clarke, Arthur C., The Ghost from the Grand Banks, Bantam Books, 1990 hindenbug, and schr√∂dinbugRaymond, Eric S.; The New Hacker's Dictionary, 3rd edition, 1996 (see the section on related terms) have been occasionally proposed for other kinds of unusual software bugs, sometimes in jest;The following article investigates the various definitions of bohrbug, mandelbug and heisenbug proposed in the literature, as well as the statements made about the relationships between these fault types: Grottke, Michael; and Trivedi, Kishor S.; Software Faults, Software Aging and Software Rejuvenation, Journal of the Reliability Engineering Association of Japan, Vol. 27, No. 7, pp. 425‚Äì438, 2005.Grottke, Michael; and Trivedi, Kishor S.; Fighting Bugs: Remove, Retry, Replicate, and Rejuvenate, IEEE Computer vol. 40, no. 2 (February 2007), pp. 107‚Äì109 however, unlike the term heisenbug, they are not widely known or used.A February 2012 Google Books search returns about 70 hits for \\"schroedinbug\\", 100 for \\"mandelbug\\", 400 for \\"bohrbug\\" or \\"heisenbug\\".  Examples  Heisenbugs occur because common attempts to debug a program, such as inserting output statements or running it with a debugger, usually have the side-effect of altering the behavior of the program in subtle ways, such as changing the memory addresses of variables and the timing of its execution. One common example of a heisenbug is a bug that appears when the program is compiled with an optimizing compiler, but not when the same program is compiled without optimization (as is often done for the purpose of examining it with a debugger). While debugging, values that an optimized program would normally keep in registers are often pushed to main memory. This may affect, for instance, the result of floating-point comparisons, since the value in memory may have smaller range and accuracy than the value in the register. Similarly, Heisenbugs may be caused by side-effects in test expressions used in runtime assertions in languages such as C and C++, where the test expression is not evaluated when assertions are turned off in production code using the \`NDEBUG\` macro. Other common causes of heisenbugs are using the value of a non-initialized variable (which may change its address or initial value during debugging), or following an invalid pointer (which may point to a different place when debugging). Debuggers also commonly allow the use of breakpoints or provide other user interfaces that cause additional source code (such as property accessors) to be executed stealthily, which can, in turn, change the state of the program.\\"Java toString() override with initialization as a side effect\\" Time can also be a factor in heisenbugs, particularly with multi-threaded applications. Executing a program under control of a debugger can change the execution timing of the program as compared to normal execution. Time-sensitive bugs such as race conditions may not occur when the program is slowed down by single-stepping source lines in the debugger. This is particularly true when the behavior involves interaction with an entity not under the control of a debugger, such as when debugging network packet processing between two machines and only one is under debugger control. Heisenbugs can be viewed as instances of the observer effect in information technology. Frustrated programmers may humorously blame a heisenbug on the phase of the moon,CATB.org, \\"phase of the moon\\" or (if it has occurred only once) may explain it away as a soft error due to alpha particles or cosmic rays affecting the hardware.  Related terms  A bohrbug, by opposition, is a \\"good, solid bug\\". Like the deterministic Bohr atom model, they do not change their behavior and are relatively easily detected.Goshgarian, Gary; Exploring Language, HarperCollins College Publishers, 1995\\"Such transient software failures have been given the whimsical name 'Heisenbug' because they disappear when reexamined. By contrast, 'Bohrbugs' are good solid bugs.\\" (IEEE Computer Group News, Volume 24, Numbers 7‚Äì12, 1991) A mandelbug (named after Beno√Æt Mandelbrot's fractal) is a bug whose causes are so complex it defies repair, or makes its behavior appear chaotic or even non-deterministic. The term also refers to a bug that exhibits fractal behavior (that is, self- similarity) by revealing more bugs (the deeper a developer goes into the code to fix it the more bugs they find). A schr√∂dinbug or schroedinbug (named after Erwin Schr√∂dinger and his thought experiment) is a bug that manifests itself in running software after a programmer notices that the code should never have worked in the first place. A hindenbug (named after the Hindenburg disaster) is a bug with catastrophic behavior. A higgs-bugson (named after the Higgs boson particle) is a bug that is predicted to exist based upon other observed conditions (most commonly, vaguely related log entries and anecdotal user reports) but is difficult, if not impossible, to artificially reproduce in a development or test environment. The term may also refer to a bug that is obvious in the code (mathematically proven), but which cannot be seen in execution (yet difficult or impossible to actually find in existence).  History of the term  The term was also used in 1985 by Jim Gray, in a paper about software failures (and is sometimes mistakenly attributed to him because of this publication) and also in 1986 by Jonathan Clark and Zhahai Stewart on the mailing list (later Usenet news group) comp.risks.(16 December 1986) RISKS DIGEST 4.30 - (23 December 1986) RISKS DIGEST 4.34, moderated by Peter G. Neumann Bruce Lindsay, a researcher at IBM, affirmed in a 2004 ACM Queue interview that he was present when the Heisenbug was originally defined. An earlier appearance in ACM publications is from 1983.Proceedings of the ACM SIGSOFT/SIGPLAN Software Engineering Symposium on High-Level Debugging, Pacific Grove, California, March 20‚Äì23, 1983, Association for Computing Machinery, 1983, Google Books search: Also cited in LeBlanc, Richard J.; Robbins, Arnold D.; Event-Driven Monitoring of Distributed Programs, in Proceedings of the IEEE 5th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS), IEEE Computer Society, Computer Society Press, 1985, pp. 515-522 Google Books search:  Resolution  Heisenbugs are difficult to identify and fix; often attempting to resolve them leads to further unexpected behavior.

The Petasis reaction Reported in 1993 by Nicos Petasis as a practical method towards the synthesis of a geometrically pure antifungal agent, naftifine. In the Petasis reaction, the vinyl group of the organoboronic acid serves as the nucleophile. In comparison to other methods of generating allyl amines, the Petasis reaction tolerates a multifunctional scaffold, with a variety of amines and organoboronic acids as potential starting materials. Additionally, the reaction does not require anhydrous or inert conditions. As a mild, selective synthesis, the Petasis reaction is useful in generating Œ±-amino acids, and is utilized in combinatorial chemistry and drug discovery. Reaction mechanism The mechanism of the Petasis reaction is not fully understood. In the Petasis reaction it is not clear which intermediate serves as the electrophile. Petasis proposes that the reaction is characterized by a complex equilibrium among the three starting materials and various intermediates, and the final product is formed via a rate-determining and irreversible C-C bond formation step. The condensation between amine 1 and carbonyl 2 forms hemiaminal 4, which is in a complex equilibrium with iminium ion 3 and aminal 5. Boronic acid 6 react with hemiaminal 4 and aminal 5 in a reversible fashion via intermediate 7 and 8 respectively, forming again electrophilic iminium ion 3, this time accompanied by nucleophilic boronate 3‚Äô. Note that there are no evidences suggesting that boronic acid alone can directly react with iminium ions: In addition to needing acid for an appreciable amount of iminium salt to be generated, it has been shown that vinyl boronic acids do not react efficiently with preformed iminium salts (like Eschenmoser‚Äôs salt). The irreversible C-C bond migration between 3 and 3‚Äôthen follows, furnishing desired product 9 with loss of boric acid. All intermediates will ultimately lead to the final product, as the reaction between 3 and 3‚Äô is irreversible, pulling the equilibrium of the entire system towards the final product. Petasis reaction with equilibrium relationships Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been performed to study the mechanism of Petasis reaction. Starting with the Petasis reaction between glyoxylic acid, dimethylamine and phenylboronic acid, Gois et al. reported that the migration of the boronic acid substituent (phenyl group) of the \\"ate complex\\" A incurs an energy barrier of 10kcal/mol and a five-membered transition state B. Formation of quaternary boron salts during the reaction has been experimentally confirmed by Hansen and coworkers. They reported that, in the absence of amine, an upfield 11B shift is observed after the addition of glyoxylic acid to a solution of phenylboronic acid. This is presumably due to the formation of electron rich boronate species. Petasis Mechanism_transition state and energy barrier Preparation The Petasis reaction proceeds under mild conditions, without the use of strong acids, bases, or metals. The amine is mixed with the carbonyl substrate using either dioxane or toluene as a solvent at 90 ¬∞C for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the boronic acid is added to the mixture and product is generated, either after 30 minutes at 90 ¬∞C, or after several hours at 25 ¬∞C. In Œ±-amino acid synthesis, Œ±-keto acids, such as glyoxylic and pyruvic acid, are stirred in ethanol, toluene, or dichloromethane with amines and vinyl boronic acids at 25‚Äì50 ¬∞C for 12‚Äì48 h to give the corresponding Œ≤,Œ≥-unsaturated compounds. Alpha amino acid synthesis One of the most attractive features of the Petasis reaction is its use of boronic acids as a nucleophilic source. Unlike most vinyl substrates, vinyl boronic acids are stable to air and water and can be removed during workup with a simple extraction. Many boronic acid derivatives are easy to prepare and with the advent of the Suzuki coupling, a larger number of them are now commercially available. In the seminal report of the reaction, the organoboronic acids were prepared by hydroboration of terminal alkynes with catecholborane. organoboronic acid synthesis Other methods of generating boronic acids were also reported. Reaction scope and synthetic applications A wide variety of functional groups including alcohols, carboxylic acids, and amines are tolerated in the Petasis Reaction. Known substrates that are compatible with reaction conditions include vinylboronate esters, arylboronate esters, and potassium organotrifluoroborates. Additionally, a variety of substituted amines can be used other than secondary amines. Tertiary aromatic amines, hydrazines, hydroxylamines, sulfonamides, and indoles have all been reported. Synthesis of allyl amines Petasis and coworkers proposed, in their seminal study, that vinyl boronic acids can react with the adducts of secondary amines and paraformaldehyde to give tertiary allylamines. The geometry of the double bond of the starting vinyl boronic acid is completely retained in the final product. Yield is typically in the good to excellent range. The following reaction is particularly effective, hitting a yield of 96%: geometrically pure allylamines Petasis and coworkers used this reaction to synthesize naftifine, a very potent topical antimycotic, in one step in 82% yield. Other compounds with related structure include terbinafine and NB598. synthesis of naftifine Synthesis of amino acids Œ≤,Œ≥-unsaturated, N-substituted amino acids are conveniently prepared through the condensation of organoboronic acids, boronates, or boronic esters with amines and glyoxylic acids. Yields are typically in the range of 60‚Äì80%, and a wide variety of polar or non-polar solvents can be employed (although DCM and MeOH is typically used). Free amino acids that do not have N-substitutions can be prepared by using trityl amine or bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl amine, followed by deprotection under aciic conditions. Piettre and coworkers found out that the usage of highly polar protic solvents like Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) can shorten reaction time and improve yield. Microwave irradiation was also be used to promote the reaction in methanol. PBM coupling to synthesize amino acid with HFIP solvent Apart from vinyl boronic acids, aryl boronic acids and other heterocyclic derivatives can also be used in Petasis multicomponent coupling. Possible substrate scope includes thienyl, pyridyl, furyl, and benzofuranyl, 1-naphthyl, and aryl groups with either electron-donating or electron- withdrawing substituent. PBM coupling to synthesize aryl glycine Clopidogrel, an antiplatelet agent, was racemically synthesized by Kalinski and coworkers in two steps, using Petasis reaction as the key strategy. Acid- catalyzed esterification immediately following the multicomponent coupling steps to afford Clopidogrel in 44% overall yield. synthesis of clopidogrel via PBM coupling The Petasis reaction exhibits high degrees of stereocontrol when a chiral amine or aldehyde is used as a substrate. When certain chiral amines, such as (S)-2-phenylglycinol, are mixed with an Œ±-keto acid and vinyl boronic acid at room temperature, the corresponding allylamine is formed as a single diastereomer. Furthermore, enantiomeric purity can be achieved by hydrogenation of the diastereoselective product. In the reaction with (S)-2-phenylglycinol, (R)-2-phenylglycinol is generated in 76% yield. stereoselective alpha amino acids Unconventional synthesis of carboxylic acids Apart from amino-acids, Petasis borono-Mannich reaction can also be used to prepare carboxylic acids, albeit with unconventional mechanisms. Naskar et al. reported the use of N-substituted indoles as amine equivalent. The mechanism begins with the nucleophilic attack of the 3-position of the \\"N\\"-substituted indole to electrophilic aldehyde, followed by formation of \\"ate complex\\" 1 via the reaction of boronic acid with the carboxylic acid. The intermediate then undergoes dehydration, followed by migration of boronate-alkyl group to furnish the final carboxylic acid product. The yield is in the moderate to good range (40‚Äì70%). A wide range of aryl boronic acids is tolerated, while the usage of vinyl boronic acids is not reported. \\"N\\"-unsubstituted indoles react very sluggishly under normal reaction conditions, thus confirming the mechanism below. PBM coupling with N-substituted indole Naskar et al. also proposed the usage of tertiary aromatic amines in Petasis reaction as another equivalent of amine nucleophile. The mechanism is similar to the N-substituted indole case. The reaction is carried out under harsh conditions (24-hr reflux in 1,4-dioxane), but the resultant carboxylic acid is obtained in reasonable yield (41‚Äì54% yield). Note that the usage of Œ±-ketoacids instead of glyoxylic acid does not diminish yields. 1,3,5-trioxygenated benzene derivatives can also be used in lieu of tertiary aromatic amines. PBM coupling with trisubstituted aromatic amine Synthesis of iminodicarboxylic acid derivatives When used as nitrogen nucleophiles, amino acids can furnish various iminodicarboxylic acid derivatives. High diastereoselectivity is usually observed, and the newly formed stereocenter usually share the same configuration with the starting amino acid. This reaction works well in highly polar solvents (ex. water, ethanol, etc.). Peptides with unprotected nitrogen terminal can also be used as a nitrogen nucleophile equivalent. Petasis and coworkers prepared Enalaprilat, an ACE inhibitor, with this method. synthesis of Enalaprilat via PBM coupling Synthesis of peptidomimetic heterocycles When diamines are used in PBM reactions, heterocycles of various structures, such as piperazinones, benzopiperazinones, and benzodiazepinones, are efficiently prepared. Lactamization reactions are commonly employed to form the heterocycles, usually under strongly acidic conditions. preparation of Piperazinones, benzopiperazinones, and benzodiazepinones via PBM coupling Synthesis of amino alcohols When a Œ±-hydroxy aldehyde is used as a substrate in the synthesis of Œ≤-amino alcohols, a single diastereomer is generated. This reaction forms exclusively anti-product, confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The product does not undergo racemization, and when enantiomerically pure Œ±-hydroxy aldehydes are used, enantiomeric excess can be achieved. It is believed that the boronic acid first reacted with the chiral hydroxyl group, furnishing a nucleophilic alkenyl boronate, followed by face selective, intramolecular migration of the alkenyl group into the electrophilic iminium carbon, forming the desired C-C bond irreversibly. In the reaction of enantiomerically pure glyceraldehydes, the corresponding 3-amino 1,2-diol product is formed in 70% yield and greater than 99% ee. Stereoselective B amino alcohols Pyne and coworkers suggested that diastereoselectivity arises from the reaction of the more stable (and, in this case, more reactive) conformation of the ate complex, where 1,3 allylic strain is minimized. diastereoselectivity of amino synthesis_mechanism and transition state Using dihydroxyacetone, a somewhat unconventional aldehyde equivalent, Sugiyama et al. is able to use Petasis reaction to assemble the core structure of FTY720 (a potent immunosuppressive agent) in 40% yield. A straightforward hydrogenation then follows to afford the product via a one-step benzyl-group removal and C-C double bond hydrogenation. synthesis of FTY720 Synthesis of amino polyols and amino sugars Petasis and coworkers reported the usage of unprotected carbohydrates as the carbonyl component in PBM reactions. It is used as the equivalent of Œ±-hydroxyl aldehydes with pre-existing chirality, and the aminopolyol product is usually furnished with moderate to good yield, with excellent selectivity. A wide variety of carbohydrates, as well as nitrogen nucleophiles (ex. amino acids), can be used to furnish highly stereochemically-enriched products. The aminopolyol products can then undergo further reactions to prepare aminosugars. Petasis used this reaction to prepare Boc-protected mannosamine from D-arabinose. synthesis of Boc-protected Mannosammine Applications in enantioselective synthesis With chiral amine nucleophile Generally speaking, when chiral amine is used in Petasis coupling, the stereochemical outcome of Petasis reaction is strongly correlated to the chirality of the amine, and high to excellent diastereoselectivity is observed even without the usage of bulky chiral inducing groups. Chiral benzyl amines, 2-substituted pyrrolidines, and 5-substituted 2-morpholinones have been shown to induce good to excellent diastereomeric excess under different Petasis reaction conditions. diastereoselective PBM coupling with chiral amine With chiral N-acyliminium ions Chiral N-acyliminium ion \\"starting materials\\" are generally prepared by in- situ dehydration of cyclic hemiaminal. They also carry a chiral hydroxyl group that is in proximity with the iminium carbon; boronic acids react with such chiral hydroxyl groups to form a chiral and electron-rich boronate species, followed by side-selective and intramolecular boronate vinyl/aryl transfer into the iminium carbon. Hence, the reaction is highly diastereoselective, with cis- boronate aryl/vinyl transfer being the predominant pathway. Hydroxypyrrolidines and Hydroxy-Œ≥- and Œ¥-lactams have been shown to react very diastereoselectively, with good to excellent yield. However, such procedures are limited to the usage of vinyl- or electron-rich aryl- boronic acids only. diastereoselective PBM coupling with chiral N-acyliminium ion Batey and coworkers take advantage of the high diastereoselectivity of this reaction to prepare (¬±)-6-deoxycastanospermine in 7 steps, with an impressive overall yield of 32% (from the vinyl boronic ester). The key acyclic precursor to deoxycastanospermine (A) is formed first by condensing vinyl boronic ester 1 with Cbz-protected hydroxy-pyrrolidine 2 with a PBM coupling, followed by dihydroxylation and TBS protetction. A then undergo intramolecular cyclization via a one-pot imine formation and reduction sequel, followed by TBS deprotection, to afford (¬±)-6-deoxycastanospermine. Deoxycastanospermine synthesis (Batey et al.) With thiourea catalyst Takemoto and coworkers of Kyoto University recently reported an enantioselective Petasis-type reaction to transform quinolines into respective chiral 1,2-dihydroquinolines (product) using alkenyl boronic acids and chiral thiourea catalyst. Good yields (59‚Äì78%) and excellent enantioselectivities (82‚Äì96%) are reported. Takemoto et al. Takemoto and coworkers observed that addition of chloroformates are required as electrophilic activating agents, and the reaction does not proceed without them. Also, a 1,2-amino alcohol functionality is required on the catalyst for the reaction to proceed stereoselectively. They rationalize these findings by suggesting that the chloroformate reagent reacted with the quinoline nitrogen to make an N-acyated quinolinium intermediate B, which is further activated by electrophilic chiral thiourea. They also suggest that the 1,2-amino alcohol functionality of the catalyst is chelating to the alkenyl boronic acids and that such chelation directed the stereochemical outcome. Takemoto et al. transition state With chiral biphenols Schaus and Lou of Boston University reported the following reaction, in which chiral Œ±-amino acids with various functionalities are conveniently furnished by mixing alkenyl diethyl boronates, secondary amines, glyoxylates and chiral biphenol catalyst in toluene in one-pot: Schaus reaction This reaction tolerates a wide range of functionalities, both on the sides of alkenyl boronates and the secondary amine: the electron-richness of the substrates does not affect the yield and enantioselectivity, and sterically demanding substrates (dialkylsubstituted alkenyl boronates and amines with Œ±-stereocenter) only compromise enantioselectivity slightly. Reaction rates do vary on a case-by-case basis. Under the reported condition, boronic acids substrates failed to give any enantioselectivity. Also, 3√Ö molecular sieve is used in the reaction system. While the authors did not provide the reason for such usage in the paper, it was speculated that 3√Ö molecular sieves act as water scavenger and prevent the decomposition of alkenyl diethyl boronates into their respective boronic acids. The catalyst could be recycled from the reaction and reused without compromising yield or enantioselectivity. More recently, Yuan with coworkers from Chengdu Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Science combined both approaches (chiral thiourea catalyst and chiral biphenol) in a single catalyst, reporting for the first time the catalytic system that is capable of performing enantioselective Petasis reaction between salicylaldehydes, cyclic secondary amines and aryl- or alkenylboronic acids: Yuan reaction In one application the Petasis reaction is used for quick access to a multifunctional scaffold for divergent synthesis. The reactants are the lactol derived from L-phenyl-lactic acid and acetone, l-phenylalanine methyl ester and a boronic acid. The reaction takes place in ethanol at room temperature to give the product, an anti-1,2-amino alcohol with a diastereomeric excess of 99%. Petasis reaction example (Kumagai et al.) Notice that the authors cannot assess syn-1,2-amino alcohol with this method due to intrinsic mechanistic selectivity, and the authors argue that such intrinsic selectivity hampers their ability to access the full matrix of stereoisomeric products for the usage of small molecule screening. In a recent report, Schaus and co-workers reported that syn amino alcohol can be obtained with the following reaction condition, using a chiral dibromo-biphenol catalyst their group developed: schaus_ACIE_reaction Although the syn vs. anti diastereomeric ratio ranges from mediocre to good (1.5:1 to 7.5:1), the substrate scope for such reactions remain rather limited, and the diastereoselectivity is found to be dependent on the stereogenic center on the amine starting material. Petasis reaction and total synthesis Beau and coworkers assembled the core dihydropyran framework of zanamivir congeners via a combination of PBM reaction and Iron(III)-promoted deprotection-cyclization sequence. A stereochemically-defined Œ±-hydroxyaldehyde 2, diallylamine and a dimethylketal-protected boronic acid 1 is coupled to form the acyclic, stereochemically-defined amino-alcohol 3, which then undergoes an Iron(III)-promoted cyclization to form a bicyclic dihydropyran 4. Selective opening of the oxazoline portion of the dihydropyran intermediate 4 with water or timethylsilyl azide then furnish downstream products that have structures resembling the Zanamivir family members. zanamivir core_Beau et al. Wong and coworkers prepared N-acetylneuraminic acid with a PBM coupling, followed by nitrone-[3+2] cycloaddition. Vinylboronic acid is first coupled with L-arabinose 1 and Bis(4-methoxyphenyl)methanamine 2 to form an stereochemically-defined allyl amine 3. Afterwards, the sequence of dipolar cycloaddition, base-mediated N-O bond breakage and hydrolysis then complete the synthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid. N-acetylneuraminic acid_Wong et al.

UW Tacoma opened in leased space in 1990 and opened its permanent campus in 1997. History Following the establishment of The Evergreen State College in Olympia in 1967, interest in additional higher education opportunities in the South Sound continued to grow. In 1986, the Higher Education Coordination Board suggested branch campuses for both the University of Washington and Washington State University. Tacoma and Bothell were chosen as new UW campus sites, and three locations were selected for new WSU campuses: Vancouver, the Tri-Cities and Spokane. The initial goal of the new campuses was to provide further education for the growing numbers of community college transfer students, as well as \\"time bound, place bound\\" students with limited access to educational opportunities in programs with \\"demonstrated regional needs.\\" The University of Washington Tacoma campus began classes on October 1, 1990 in downtown Tacoma's historic Perkins Building. The 8 story structure was chosen in part for its capacity; during UW Tacoma's early years and construction of the permanent campus further south, enrollments comprised a maximum of approximately 401 juniors and seniors. During this time, downtown Tacoma's appearance and local reputation began to change. The decision to site the new UW campus in downtown Tacoma and not in an outlying area of the city is often cited as one of the most important factors in the downtown's revitalization. The somewhat unorthodox choice to renovate some of Tacoma's oldest remaining industrial structures for campus classrooms and offices, instead of razing the buildings and erecting new ones, has since been heralded for its foresight. A former cluster of blighted, decaying buildings was given new life, and soon after businesses began opening en masse in the immediate area for the first time in decades. The current campus celebrated its long-awaited opening on May 29, 1997. Since the opening of the first building, several others have been renovated. Part of the campus library formerly served as the Snoqualmie Falls Power Company's transformer house. Building names such as Mattress Factory and West Coast Grocery recall the structures' earlier uses. Transportation within the downtown area was improved with the addition of Sound Transit's 1.6-mile Tacoma Link light rail line in 2003. Following several years of transfer-only undergraduate admissions, UW Tacoma admitted its first freshman class of just under 200 students in Autumn of 2006. UW Tacoma expects to continue to increase enrollment and add additional buildings. In March 2011, the campus opened the renovated Russell T. Joy Building, the last of the formerly blighted warehouse buildings along the campus' Pacific Avenue boundary. The campus purchased Court 17 Apartments in 2016 as a dorm that now houses 290 students. As of September 2016 the campus had 5000 students. Tacoma School of the Arts (SOTA) students use UWT classroom space for their humanities classes. In return, the University uses SOTA's artistic resources for evening classes. Campus The 46-acre campus is located on a hillside at the southern edge of downtown Tacoma, overlooking the Port of Tacoma and Mount Rainier. Set in the historic Union Station District, UW Tacoma renovated century-old, brick buildings that were built by businesses that depended on the railroad in the late 1880s and early 1900s. The university has earned architectural awards for transforming these buildings into modern classrooms. In the design of the campus, the UW Tacoma honored the traditions of the Northern Pacific Railway and its part in establishing the city of Tacoma. Located on the east side of the campus across Pacific Ave are the Washington State History Museum, the Tacoma Art Museum, the beautifully reconstructed Union Station, and the Children's Museum of Tacoma. On the north side of the Washington State History Museum is the Chihuly Bridge of Glass. The Chihuly Bridge of Glass is a pedestrian walkway that crosses over Interstate 705 and leads to the Museum of Glass. Academics UW Tacoma offers 35 undergraduate majors and 12 graduate programs. Degrees are offered through the University's nine schools and programs: * School of Education * School of Engineering & Technology * Global Honors * School of Interdisciplinary Arts & Sciences * Milgard School of Business * School of Nursing & Healthcare Leadership * School of Social Work & Criminal Justice * Undergraduate Education * School of Urban Studies Student life=Residence hall Student on-campus housing is offered at UW Tacoma's Court 17 Residence Hall.

The King continued his predecessors' ambitions of spreading rule over the coastal cities and conducted activities in that course greatly, but it was all eventually in vain. In 1035, Croatia under Stephen involved itself in the affairs of the neighbouring Holy Roman Empire between the Carinthian count Adalbero and Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II. Aldabero was accused on 18 May 1035 during the Bamberg assembly for conspiring against the emperor, relying on help from the Croats.

Biography=Reign After Croatia's King Stjepan Dr≈æislav died in 997, his brother Svetoslav Suronja had become King of Croatia. Together with his two brothers Gojslav and Kre≈°imir, they fought between each other for the crown in a civil war. The two brothers probably used his alliance with the Byzantine Empire to ask Bulgaria for help. During that time, a Bulgarian invasion was taking place in which the Bulgarian monarch Samuil pillaged the Dalmatian cities and great parts of Bosnia.Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja During last two years (999‚Äì1000) of the Croatian civil war, the revolters had managed to depose Svetoslav Suronja probably with some Bulgarian help, who later turned to the Venetian Doge for alliance in year 1000. Answering that political change, the Venetian Doge Pietro II Orseolo started military intervention in Dalmatia in which he will emerge victorious. In Trogir, which was brought under Venetian control, there was a meeting between Doge Pietro Orseolo II and the deposed king, in which his son Stephen was to be taken hostage and marry the Doge's daughter, Joscella (Hicela) Orseolo, as part of the agreement made at their meeting.

At that point, all the Dalmatian rulers submitted to the Doge \\"except for the King of the Croats\\".Fine, When ethnicity did not matter in the Balkans, pp 39-40. Around 1015, Kre≈°imir was given the honorary title of patrician from the Byzantines, possibly as a token of gratitude for his policy in the Balkans. The war between Venice and Croatia was renewed in Summer 1018, when Kre≈°imir launched a campaign against the Dalmatian cities in an attempt to retake the lost territories. The cities requested Otto Orseolo for help, who intervened on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea and managed to successfully repel these incursions from Croatia. According to surviving legal documents, the islands Krk and Rab, that were previously under Croatian control, restated their allegiance to Venice and promised to pay an annual tribute.≈†i≈°iƒá, pp. 479 Kre≈°imir III and Gojslav have spent their reign attempting to restore control over the Dalmatian cities that were now under Venetian rule. After the defeat and absorption of the First Bulgarian Empire, John Skylitzes records that, certain Croats \\"who had two brothers as their rulers\\", after approaching Basil, had subjected themselves to him, after which the tribes did as well. Later chronicler Cedrenus, makes a similar record, instead implying that the two brothers had subjected themselves to him.≈†i≈°iƒá, pp. 482 Later years On 1 September 1024, Basil Boioannes, Byzantine general and governor of the Byzantine Catapanate of Italy sailed across the Adriatic from Bari and invaded Croatia. In subsequent clashes, he captures Kre≈°imir's wife, who was first taken to Bari, and then to Constantinople as a hostage.Raƒçki doc. 434 Although Croatia and Boioannes maybe have harbored ill will towards each other, this clash does not necessarily prove that Constantinople itself suffered poor relations with Croatia. After the death of Emperor Basil II in 1025, Kre≈°imir stopped paying tribute to the empire. Around 1027, he collaborated with Stephen I of Hungary against Venice in an attempt to regain the cities of Dalmatia. The Hungarian king previously took his nephew Peter Urseolo, who was forced to flee from the republic when his father was deposed in a 1026 revolt.≈†i≈°iƒá, pp. 484 It is also assumed by one chronicle that Kre≈°imir took part in the 1030 war against the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad on the Hungarian side, though this is not corroborated in any other source.≈†vab, pp. 138 Stephen I also might have betrothed his son, Emeric, to one of Kre≈°imir's daughters, however records show that the preparations were cancelled due to Emeric's sudden death.Profile, fmg.ac; accessed 13 August 2015. Kre≈°imir was succeeded by his nephew Stjepan around 1030, when he returned from Venice back to Croatia.

Cooper was also a founding member of the Fourth International. In 1940, Jake Cooper was selected by the Socialist Workers Party to go to Mexico City and work as a bodyguard for Leon Trotsky, the exiled Russian Bolshevik leader. \\"I'm honored by the fact that I was selected because perhaps it tells you that they thought I was not only a militant, but that I was honest and would go there to die for our ideas if necessary,\\" Cooper said in an interview in 1988. Cooper remained a Trotskyist his entire life. When the Socialist Workers Party leadership faction of Jack Barnes abandoned Trotskyism in the 1980s and expelled the Trotskyist factions, he joined those who were expelled in the group called Socialist Action (US). As a member of Socialist Action Cooper was, among other things, very active in supporting the UFCW Local P-9 strike of meat packing workers against Hormel Foods in Austin, Minnesota during the 1985‚Äì86 Hormel strike, serving as the chairperson of the Metro P-9 Strike Support Committee. As a supporter of the strike he actively gathered large amounts of food for the workers and advocated the kinds of militant tactics that he was part of in the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934.

Its episcopal see is Superior, and the Cathedral of Christ the King in Superior is its mother church. It is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. History Augustine F. Schinner was the first Bishop of Superior. The diocese was established on May 3, 1905 by Pope Pius X. It was created from the northern part of the Diocese of La Crosse and the northwestern part of the Diocese of Green Bay, with Augustine Francis Schinner as the first bishop. Prior to the official founding of the diocese in 1905, there had already been a rich history of Catholicism in the region. Centuries earlier, Catholic missionaries had forged a dynamic presence throughout the Lake Superior region of Wisconsin. The early history of Catholicism in the state of Wisconsin started within the territory that the Diocese of Superior now encompasses, with the arrival of Father Ren√© Menard in 1661. Fr. Menard was a Jesuit missionary who came to North America to evangelize the Native American population, and was fluent in the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Huron dialects. After spending the winter of 1660‚Äì1661 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, some historical accounts have Fr. Menard venturing in the spring of 1661 to Chequamegon Bay, near Ashland. Although his time there was short, he cleared the path for fellow Jesuits who followed him. In 1665, Fr. Claude Allouez started a Catholic mission near Chequamegon Bay, and named it the Mission of the Holy Ghost. The exact location of the mission remains a mystery, although historians have speculated it was located at La Pointe, on Madeline Island. Historically, Madeline Island was a spiritual center for the Lake Superior Chippewa. In 1669, Fr. Jacques Marquette arrived at the Mission of the Holy Ghost, upon the departure of Fr. Allouez to the Fox River Valley. Fr. Marquette found success in his work among the native people, and baptized over 1,000 converts. During this time, the region was being overseen by French Catholic leaders in Quebec, which became a diocese in 1674, encompassing all of North America east of the Mississippi River. In 1791, the region was transferred to the Diocese of Baltimore, which was the first Catholic diocese created in the then-newly formed United States. In 1843, the Diocese of Milwaukee was established, and consisted of the entire state of Wisconsin. Northern Wisconsin remained within the Diocese of Milwaukee, until the formation of the Diocese of Lacrosse, and the Diocese of Green Bay, which then served the northern region. Finally, in 1905, the Diocese of Superior was created by Pope Pius X, encompassing 16 counties in northern Wisconsin. The oldest Catholic congregation in the state of Wisconsin (in continuous operation to the present-day) is within the Diocese of Superior. On July 27, 1836, Fr. Frederic Baraga arrived at La Pointe, and immediately set to work, building a log church. Fr. Baraga, like the Jesuit missionaries before him, had success evangelizing the native people. His congregation at La Pointe grew, and also included many early European immigrants, primarily French Fur Traders. In 1838, Fr. Baraga built a larger church at La Pointe, on the spot of the present-day location of St. Joseph's Catholic Church. The first Bishop to serve the Diocese of Superior was Augustine Francis Schinner, who was consecrated as Bishop on July 25, 1905. Bishop Schinner faced many challenges, as the head of the new diocese, including the need to recruit priests to serve the growing number of parishes throughout the diocese. By the time Bishop Schinner resigned as the bishop of Superior in 1913, he saw the pool of priests grow from 39 diocesan priests in 1905 to 62 in 1913. Today, there are now 105 parishes within the Diocese of Superior. Reports of Sex Abuse Lawrence Murphy, a priest from the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, was transferred to the Diocese of Superior in 1974 after sex abuse allegations surfaced against him in the archdiocese.https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/2295669-pope-linked-cover- superior-diocese-priest-sex-abuse-case It was reported that Murphy, who died in 1998, continued sexually abusing children while serving in the Diocese of Superior as well.https://www.wctrib.com/news/329945-alleged-abuse-father- murphy-continued-superior-diocese In January 2019, The Diocese of Superior agreed to cooperate with authorities following the arrest of Diocese priest Tom Ericksen on charges of sexually abusing children in the 1980s.https://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/news/2019/01/25/clergy-abuse- superior-diocese-vows-cooperation-priest-abuse-probes/2614316002/ These allegations against Ericksen, who was arrested in Minneapolis, Minnesota in November 2018,https://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/news/2018/11/20/clergy- sex-abuse-former-wisconsin-priest-thomas-ericksen-charged/2053706002/ had also surfaced in 2010 as well.

It was purchased by Best Buy in 2000, sold to Sun Capital in 2003, and filed for bankruptcy in 2006, closing most of its stores. The remaining stores were purchased by Trans World Entertainment which also runs FYE, Saturday Matinee, and Suncoast Motion Picture Company. It specialized in music, video, and video game sales.

History  Sam \\"Goody\\" Gutowitz (1904-1991) of New York City opened a small record store on New York's 9th Avenue shortly after the advent of vinyl long-playing records in the late 1940s.

He became something of a folk hero among penniless college students as the first successful large-scale LP discounter. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Later, the Sam Goody name was applied to a chain of record stores established in 1951 by Gutowitz. In 1959, a group of creditors took over the company to collect $2.4 million in debts. In 1978, the company was acquired by the American Can Company (later renamed Primerica), the owners of Minneapolis-based Musicland, Alternate Link via ProQuest. Goody's rival. Sam Goody continued to grow through both acquisitions and organic growth, including the launch of its website. The stores averaged but varied in size from 1000 to . The Musicland Group was once the largest music retailer in the country, operating at its peak more than 1300 stores, over 800 of them Sam Goodys, and earning over $2 billion in annual revenue. In 1986, Sam Goody's corporate parent Musicland purchased the then just recently purchased 34-store Southern California-based Licorice Pizza chain and 26 other record stores for $13 million from Record Bar. The Licorice Pizza stores were rebranded Sam Goody the following year.  Acquisition and demise  Best Buy attempted to diversify its retail holdings by purchasing Musicland. Best Buy's attempt to transform Musicland into a youth-oriented small-format technology hub failed after two years of ownership. Losses were exacerbated by a decline in physical CD sales in line with the general decline in CD sales, and by competition from big box retailers. Just weeks before Best Buy was prepared to liquidate the entire chain of stores (and after closing several hundred), they found a buyer in Sun Capital Partners, a private equity firm in Boca Raton, Florida, which acquired the chain in a cash-free transaction by acquiring Musicland's liabilities. In 2002, Best Buy decided to consolidate some of the acquired stores by converting On Cue stores to the Sam Goody brand. Under Sun Capital, the company closed more stores and tried to get the business back to basics, but ultimately the challenges of competition and lackluster music industry releases proved too much and in January 2006, The Musicland Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In February 2006, the company announced the closing of 226 Sam Goody and 115 Suncoast Motion Picture Company stores. Following the closings, the Sam Goody chain was left with 191 stores. In March 2006, Trans World Entertainment, which had been acquiring their competitors for several years, announced the purchase of 400 Sam Goody and Suncoast stores. Trans World kept 345 of the stores open and closed 55. In late 2006, Trans World Entertainment Corp. began changing the names of mall- based Sam Goody stores to f.y.e., the company's signature retail store. Trans World retained the Suncoast Motion Picture Co. name on about 170 stores. After a dismal fourth quarter 2006 and a lackluster year in general, Transworld admitted that it failed to anticipate some of the challenges that remained associated with the remaining Musicland stores that it acquired, especially the \\"Sam Goody Rural\\" concept located in small communities. As a result, they announced more store closings, many of which were likely to be former Musicland stores. The Sam Goody logo on the floor in front of a vacant store front, Moorestown Mall, July 2014. Trans World has announced their intention to focus on the f.y.e. brand and convert all Sam Goody stores to f.y.e stores in the future. By February 2009, Trans World had removed the Sam Goody brand from its corporate website. They kept a large store in San Diego branded Sam Goody due to the cost of changing the signs until late 2012.

However, whereas this format might have been successful in the United States in the 1980s and early 1990s, in the United Kingdom it came under pressure from a range of price led and established retailers. In 1999, Sam Goody had exited from UK marketplace, selling its stores off to rival retailers. At the chain's height, there were 22 stores and only 14 stores remained when the company exited the UK market.

The opening to Mokotua was marked by the operation of a special train from Invercargill hauled by a steam locomotive of the 1874 J class.Bruce Hermann, South Island Branch Lines (Wellington: New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society, 1997), 44. The next extension, into the lower Mataura River area, was ten kilometres long and not constructed immediately as there was some debate over whether the Wyndham Branch should be extended south from Glenham instead. Ultimately, the Wyndham Branch proposal was rejected and the line beyond Mokotua to Gorge Road was opened on 1 March 1895, and when a bridge over the Mataura River was completed, a further eleven kilometre extension to Waimahaka was opened on 18 June 1899. A connection with the Catlins River Branch was proposed and a further thirteen kilometres was added to the branch when it opened to Tokanui on 20 December 1911, making it 54.42 kilometres in total length. Although a connection with the Catlins River Branch appears logical on a map, the rugged country beyond Tokanui discouraged further extension, and the 'promise' to connect the two branches may have merely been an electoral ploy, though the Public Works Department referred to the line as 'Catlins-Waimahaka Railway' in 1910. Even the extension to Tokanui had curves with a radius as tight as and gradients as steep as 1 in 50. A ten kilometre route to Marinui was surveyed, but no further work was done and Tokanui remained the line's terminus.  Stations  Thirteen stations were established on the line even though none served any actual towns, and an engine shed with turntable was initially established at Waimahaka. This was also the first station on the line to actually have an enclosed goods shed. With the completion of the line to Tokanui, the locomotive depot was moved from Waimahaka to the terminus.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 125. The following stations were located on the Tokanui Branch (in brackets is the distance in kilometres from the start of the branch):New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, ed. John Yonge (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 30. *Appleby (3.14 km) *Seaward Bush Township (4.59 km) *Tisbury (6.76 km) *Waimatua (10.88 km) *Timpanys (16.91 km) *Mokotua (19.77 km) *Kapuka (24.24 km) - also known as Oteramika *Ashers (26.03 km) *Bush Siding (28.34 km) *Gorge Road (30.42 km) *Titiroa (36.03 km) *Waimahaka (41.14 km) *Te Peka (43.63 km) - junction with tramway to sawmill in Fortification *Pukewao (50.57 km) *Tokanui (54.42 km) Operation The Tokanui Branch was largely served by mixed trains that carried both passengers and freight. Upon opening, the first section to Waimatua was served by just two mixed trains from Invercargill per week, but when the line was opened to Waimahaka, services changed to a daily mixed train that ran from the terminus to Invercargill and back. These trains were changed to run from Tokanui when it was reached by the line. Initially, timber was the major traffic carried on the branch, but as farming areas developed, the main traffic became agricultural lime and fertiliser in and produce of the farms out. The arrival of the railway caused the decline of coastal shipping; the opening of the line to Waimahaka particularly impacted the fortunes of Fortrose's port on Toetoes Bay detrimentally.Catlins Promotions Association, \\"History - Fortrose\\", accessed 15 November 2007. The railway, in turn, was negatively impacted by the development of road transport in the region. The line was losing money by 1930 but no alterations to improve efficiency and profitability were made to the schedule until 1951, when the mixed service was cut to just once weekly. At this stage, it mainly operated for the benefit of families employed by the Railways Department. The daily freight continued to run on the other days of the week sans passenger wagon. Steam locomotives of the A class were the predominant form of motive power and they occasionally double-headed services during busy periods.R. A. John, South Island Steam Finale (Timaru: Pleasant Point Railway and Historical Society, 1991), 3.  Closure  Despite the service reductions of 1951, losses continued and the line's economic position was not helped by the improvement of roads in the area.Geoffrey B. Churchman and Tony Hurst, The Railways of New Zealand: A Journey Through History (Auckland: HarperCollins, 1991), 212. On 1 June 1960, the passenger service was cancelled for good, and the freight train was changed to run when required, which typically meant between three and five times a week. The demand for the line was now insufficient to justify its existence, and it was initially to close on 31 January 1966, but was given an extra two months of life to allow local farmers to rail in lime under subsidies from the government. The line's new closure date was 31 March 1966, but a final passenger excursion for local residents and railway enthusiasts was permitted to run on 2 April. Hauled by A 426, it was meant to also retrieve those goods wagons which had been left on the line. However, various problems meant that it was unable to haul the goods wagons and had to return to Invercargill with only the passenger carriages. Accordingly, one more service was required to run, and the next weekR. A. John states the service ran on 4 April and was headed by A 426; Leitch and Scott state 5 April and headed by A 178. it successfully retrieved the wagons and the line was officially closed. The closure directly caused the loss in lime traffic from the Browns Branch that led to its demise in 1968.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 122. The branch today Through the southern suburbs of Invercargill, the former line cuts diagonally across the grid pattern of the streets and creates a green belt of parks and playgrounds through the city. Embankments, cuttings, and evidence of level crossings used by the railway can be found at various points along its length, though due to the passage of time, remnants have diminished or been wholly destroyed, either by natural conditions or in the name of development. At the site of the yard in Waimahaka, the old goods shed has been refurbished, and the station platform and loading bank are also still visible. Large iron girders of the Mataura River rail bridge still span the river but are inaccessible as smaller spans at each end were removed during demolition of the line. Another one of the branch's goods sheds survives, in dilapidated condition in Tokanui, where it is owned by a transport company who have used the former yard area for their own business.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 126.

The complex consists of the Cleveland Police Headquarters Building, the Cuyahoga County and Cleveland Municipal Courts Tower, and the Correction Center (Jail I), and Jail II. It occupies a city block bounded by Lakeside Avenue, Ontario Street, West 3rd Street, and St. Clair Avenue. The Lakeside Avenue entrance faces the Cuyahoga County Court House, erected in 1912. Description When the Justice Center was proposed in 1969, then-Mayor Carl B. Stokes did not want to be part of the Justice Center project. At the time, the Cleveland Police were at an older headquarters on East 22nd Street. In 1971, voters elected Mayor Ralph Perk, who accepted the police department recommendation to move to the proposed Justice Center. The original cost for the Justice Center was set at $60 million, but infighting between Cuyahoga County and City of Cleveland officials escalated the cost to $128 million. On October 20, 1972, ground was broken for the Justice Center. Construction was complete in 1976. The Courts Tower component, 26 stories high, was designed by Prindle, Patrick and Associates. Jail I was built in 1976, when the rest of the construction of the complex was completed. It had 956 beds, arranged in pods of 23, and each pod was designed to take extensive advantage of natural light. The Courts Tower has been criticized by Steven Litt in The Plain Dealer as menacing, cold, and distracting. In 1995, the Robert P. Madison International-designed, $68 million Jail II was erected on the southern corner of the block. A suburban location was considered for the facility, but county officials found it was cheaper to demolish two older structures next to the Justice Center. Jail II added 480 beds. Determined to avoid cost overruns on the structure, Jail II was left without stone cladding‚Äîwhich made it clash with the three buildings beside it. Jail II was harshly criticized by Steven Litt in The Plain Dealer as \\"straight out of 1984\\" and for clashing with historic structures in the nearby Warehouse District. A four-story atrium exists in the center of the block, and serves as the secure public entry to the complex. The atrium helps resolve ground-level changes at the site, and connects the Courts Tower, Police Headquarters, and Correction Center (Jail I) structures internally. The north, south, and east walls of the atrium are glass curtain walls. An enclosed, elevated walkway connects Jail I and Jail II, while an enclosed walkway connects Cleveland Police Headquarters with Jail II. The entire complex contains about of interior space. The bases of both the Cleveland Police Headquarters and the Correction Center are deeply recessed with a regular spacing of bays and perimeter columns. Bronze tinted glass enhances the play of shadow upon the surface of the structures. Cleveland Police Headquarters and the atrium are set much further back from Ontario Street than the Courts Tower. An open paved plaza occupies this space. Located at the northwestern end of this plaza is the Isamu Noguchi sculpture, Portal, donated by the Gund Foundation in 1977. The $100,000, high sculpture was cast by the Patterson-Leitch Company of Cleveland. It is one of Isamu Noguchi's famous sculptures, and the most recognizable symbol of the Justice Center. One Cleveland art critic said Portal looked like \\"justice going down the drain\\". But artist John Clague highly praised it, and sculptor Clement Meadmore says it is Noguchi's best work. Renovations The granite veneer of the Courts Tower, Police Headquarters, and Corrections Center underwent a $3.2 million refurbishment in 1995. A $13 million renovation of the Corrections Center and Jail II was completed in 1999.; The renovations increased the capacity of Jail I to 1,749 beds. Future of the Justice Complex In 2013, Cuyahoga County officials commissioned a study from Osborne Engineering to assess the condition of the Justice Center Complex. The report, issued in spring 2014, found that the Justice Center Complex was in significant disrepair. The study cited significant architectural and construction issues which have affected the longevity of the three original structures, and Cuyahoga County Public Works Director Michael Dever said the electrical system, plumbing, elevators, and HVAC system all need replacing. The structures also have little capacity for modern communications and computer systems (such as broadband telecommunications), and currently systems are installed in insecure or temporary fashions. The buildings were not constructed to accommodate Wi-Fi or mobile phones, neither of which can be accommodated in many parts of the complex. The cost of renovation was pegged at a minimum of $300 million. The Osborne Engineering report estimated the cost of new construction at $429 million, which involved demolishing the Cleveland police headquarters and the Courts Tower and constructing a one or two new buildings in their place. County officials came to the preliminary conclusion that the Justice Complex should be demolished, and a new \\"justice center\\" erected elsewhere in downtown Cleveland. Cuyahoga County Council member Michael Gallagher told The Plain Dealer newspaper that advances in corrections design made the existing Corrections Center/Jail I significantly outdated. He also claimed that renovations could not correct the design and other deficiencies of the buildings. But county officials emphasized that no alternative site had been identified, and no budget proposals or even preliminary architectural discussions had occurred. In popular culture The Justice Center Complex plays an important role in the third season of the podcast Serial. The season opens with a general description of day-to-day lives inside the complex and then focuses on specific felony cases being handled and occasionally tried in the building. Several of the audio recordings take place inside the complex and feature the host, Sarah Koenig, discussing and interviewing those involved in the cases. The Complex is seen in several shots in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) when Nick Fury is trying to avoid the H.Y.D.R.A. agents. The distinctive black steel tube-like public art on the courthouse plaza outside the main entrance cannot be mistaken for any other building in the world. In addition, the courts tower is view-able when Bucky Barnes is attempting to assassinate Black Widow and Cap. A courtroom set for the 2020 Hulu miniseries Little Fires Everywhere, involving a Cuyahoga County court battle, recreates the slatted wooden walls of Justice Center courtrooms.

The result was the Peace of Phoinike, by which Philip agreed to surrender the territory of the Parthinoi\\" ending the First Macedonian War. It was drawn up at Phoenice in 205 BC. The Greek political balance between Macedon under Philip V and the Aetolian League was upset by the war between Rome and Carthage. Philip, seeking to enhance his position, raised a fleet and sent emissaries to Hannibal, then occupying part of Italy. Fearing that Philip could offer overt military assistance, Rome hoped to confine the Macedonians to the east of the Roman province of Illyria. Between 214 and 212 BC, Philip made two unsuccessful attempts to invade Illyria by sea and halting progress by ground, eventually succeeding in capturing the port of Lissus and gaining the province's capitulation. At this point, Rome was able to spur the Aetolians into an alliance against Philip. For two years the allies warred with Macedonia, achieving minor military victories, and politically gaining more allies from among the Greek city- states. When the Romans retired from the field, Philip's forces advanced against the Aetolians, turning the fortunes of the war. In the end, the Macedonians largely regained their original position, and the Romans and Aetolians were ready to make peace. The treaty formally acknowledged the favorable position of Macedonia, including the capture of Illyria, but Philip effectively repudiated his alliance with Hannibal. The conditions allowed that Rome would control the Parthinians, Dimallum, Bargulum, and Eugenium, and Macedonia, pending approval of the Senate of Rome, would control Atintania. Other parties to the treaty included Prusias of Bithynia, the Achaeans, the Boeotians, the Thessalians, the Acarnanians, and the Epirots, on the side of Philip, and the Ilians, Attalus, Pleuratus, Nabis of the Lacedaemonians, the Eleans, the Messenians, and Athenians, on the side of Rome.

Early life  Friedrich Josias was born at Callenberg Castle, the third son and youngest child of Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig- Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg. Charles Edward was forced to abdicate on 14 November 1918. In 1938, he entered the Wehrmacht and participated in the occupation of Czechoslovakia, Poland and France. In 1941, he fought in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. He fell seriously ill in the winter of 1941. After his recovery, he fought as Oberleutnant in the Caucasus. In 1944, he was an Ordonnanzoffizier under Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel on the French coast. He was stationed in June 1944 in Denmark under General von Hanneken, where he was captured by the British in May 1945 but released in autumn 1945. The third of three sons, Friedrich Josias was not expected to succeed as head of the ducal family. However, his eldest brother, Johann Leopold, married unequally and renounced his rights in 1932, and Hubertus was killed in action in 1943, thus leaving Friedrich Josias as the heir-apparent. He succeeded to the headship on the death of his father on 6 March 1954.

During the Stalinist attack against Trotsky‚Äôs household on 24 May 1940, Harte was abducted and later murdered by the Stalinist agents. Harte was 25 years old when he offered his services as a guard to the Trotsky household. He replaced the American Trotskyist, Alexander Buchman. He was described as popular and that although not an intellectual, he carried out any tasks without complaints.  The murder  The abduction and murder of Harte was carried out by David Alfaro Siqueiros. Pablo Neruda is also accused of conspiring in the plot because of his involvement in helping the latter to escape to Chile. However, Neruda denied this and claimed that he had issued the Chilean visa on the orders of Mexican President Manuel √Åvila Camacho. Harte's body (shot in the head) was later found alongside the road to Desierto de los Leones. Trotsky commissioned a plaque and had it placed at the front of the house with the text: \\"In Memory of Robert Sheldon Harte, 1915‚Äì1940, Murdered by Stalin.\\" In The Assassination of Trotsky, he is portrayed under the name \\"Sheldon Harte.\\" The Fourth International, the theoretical journal of the US Socialist Workers Party, published an article by Walter Rourke titled The Murder of Bob Harte, calling him the first American Trotskyist to fall victim to Stalin. An explanation provided for his murder was that he was able to identify Iosif Grigulevich, one of the attackers, in a previous assassination attempt against Trotsky. In the article Burke notes that Trotsky wrote in the Mexican press that ‚ÄúThe corpse of Bob Sheldon Harte is a tragic refutation of all the slanders and false denunciations made against him.‚Äù In his account of the attack Trotsky wrote that if Sheldon Harte were an agent of the GPU he could have killed me at night and gotten away without setting in motion 20 people all of whom were subjected to a great risk.Leon Trotsky, Stalin Seeks My Death.  Soviet agent  It was purported, contrary to Trotsky's opinion, that Robert Sheldon Harte was indeed a Soviet agent operating under the name 'Amur' and was an accomplice in the May 24, 1940, attack on Trotsky. Harte was a member of the Communist Party of the USA recruited in New York by the NKVD. He was reportedly given a mission to liaise with a Mexican assassination squad led by Siqueiros. However, according to statements made by the man in charge of this GPU operation, General Leonid Eitingon on March 9, 1954, Harte was liquidated afterwards because he had expressed second thoughts. Eitingon said: \\"During the operation it was revealed that Sheldon was a traitor. Even though he opened the gate to the compound, once in the room there was found neither the archive, nor Trotsky himself. When the participants in the raid opened fire, Sheldon told them that, had he known all this, as an American he never would have agreed to participate in this raid. Such behavior served as the basis for deciding on the spot to liquidate him.

The first, originally based on the goddess Venus (Aphrodite) from Roman and Greek mythology, was retconned to actually be a siren that only resembles the goddess. The second is stated to be the true goddess, who now wishes only to be referred to by her Greek name, Aphrodite. The similarities between the two characters are a point of conflict in the comics. Venus Venus is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe, originally based on the goddess Venus (Aphrodite) from Greek and Roman mythology; however, it is later revealed that she is a Siren and not the true goddess. The Marvel version of the character first appeared in Venus #1 (Aug. 1948). Publication history In the original 1940s Venus series, Venus dwelled on the planet Venus with her female companions. She traveled to Earth and took on the human identity of Victoria \\"Vicki\\" Nutley Starr, a journalist and editor for Beauty magazine. She developed a romantic relationship with Beauty editor Whitney Hammond; he and Venus' rival, Della Mason, were among the few people to meet Venus who did not believe her when she claimed that she was a goddess. She helps people repair their broken relationships. The series began as a light-hearted humor/fantasy series, but as the series continued, its focus shifted towards darker fantasy and horror themes. Through the course of the series, the Marvel Comics interpretations of several mythological figures appeared, including Hercules, Zeus, various other Olympians, Satan, and, in their first Marvel appearance, the Norse gods Thor and Loki. Venus was canceled with issue #19. The character drifted into obscurity after her series ended, and Venus did not reappear for 20 years, when she resurfaced in Sub-Mariner #57 (Jan. 1973). Venus manipulated Namor into defeating Ares, who was attempting to force her to love him.Sub-Mariner #57 Venus was now a guide for young activists such as Namorita, searching for ways to promote peace, and to end modern warfare. At this time, she wore only a swimsuit or a revealing white gown. Fictional character biography Venus is the Olympian goddess of love and beauty who is Zeus' daughter by the minor oak tree goddess Dione. Venus wears an enchanted girdle called the Cestus which enables her to arouse love and passion in others at will and to transform weapons into objects that can be used for peaceful purposes. In recent decades, she has used the secret identity on Earth of humanities professor Victoria N. Starr as a cover for her activates as an adventurer, but she is now back on Olympus. For the most part, her subsequent appearances featured her alongside other Greek deities, and did not reference the character's history from her own series. She appeared in modern times on Earth disguised as a mortal on a mission of peace. She was pursued by Ares, though defended by Namor, however she surrendered the Cestus to Ares. She was later commanded by Pluto to become the bride of Ares as part of Pluto's bid to overthrow Zeus. However, Venus opposed them alongside the Champions, and subdued Queen Hippolyta non-violently.Champions #1‚Äì3 She later aided the Avengers in their attempt to quell the rage of Zeus over Hercules' beating by mortals.Avengers #283‚Äì284 The series Marvel: The Lost Generation revealed that Venus and several other heroes who had been active in the 1950s briefly banded together, but did not remain as a team. This team has recently re-banded in Agents of Atlas and Venus has rejoined the team. Venus' true origins were revealed by Namora: this Venus was actually a soulless Siren that lured sailing ships to her with her voice and fed on the sailors. To prevent his ship and his crew from being feed on, the captain of a merchant ship hired a mystic to kill her. The mystic instead gave her a soul. The Siren then took the form of a beautiful woman (forbidding herself to speak again) and was taken in by a nunnery, where she lived for decades and believed herself a mute servant girl, until she joined a chorus, filling the visiting clergy with lust. She was then expelled from the nunnery. Learning how to use her voice for good, she blocked out all memories of her previous life and assumed that she was Venus reborn, based on the legends she had heard about a beautiful, immortal girl wandering the world as a goddess in a human body and winning her battles with the power of \\"love\\". 'Venus' resurfaced in the 1940s and acted as a superhero. Learning the truth about her past, Venus fell into despair and nearly destroyed her companions with her song. Jimmy Woo resisted her song and reminded her of all the good she had done, restoring her belief in herself, which allowed her to reverse the effects on the others.Agents of Atlas (vol. 1) #5 She had since elected to stay with the Agents of Atlas, using her restored powers to soothe and calm her opponents, while traveling around the world in Marvel Boy's ship, along with her teammates, shutting down the villainous branch of the former Atlas Foundation.Agents of Atlas (vol. 1) #6 She eventually came up with the idea to alter Spider-Man's perception of a common fight, leaving him with false memories of having helped someone else instead of mindwiping him. Subsequently, she was abducted by the true Olympian goddess Aphrodite, angry at her for assuming her name and guise.X-Men vs. Agents of Atlas #1 Rescued by the group, they have further battles with Aphrodite, until in a climactic battle of song, the goddess decides to appoint Venus in her place, recognizing that she has not been truly dedicated to love since Troy.Incredible Hercules #138‚Äì141 It is revealed Venus will be a part of the Second God Squad during the Chaos war against Mikaboshi. She helps get Galactus on their side. After Hercules' death, she and Namora roam the world, bringing his financial affairs in order. She uses her gifts to comfort many who are devastated by his loss.Hercules: Fall of Avenger #1‚Äì2 (2010) Powers and abilities Venus has the power to project images or illusions of herself and to control the emotions of others, as well as the ability to fly at high speeds, shield herself from mortal sight, and shift her physical form into other beings. Before the retcon, she was considered to be an Olympian goddess, and thought to possess the enhanced physical characteristics typical of Olympian gods in the Marvel Universe, including superhuman stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, extraordinary vitality, and virtual immortality. Venus possesses a magical girdle named Cestus that enables the wearer to enchant anyone to become a love-slave, and to neutralize or transform all weapons of war. Hephaestus designed this girdle for Venus. After her memories were restored, Venus realized her empathic abilities were really derived from a powerful \\"siren song\\" ‚Äî she is able to heal and restore, curing people's souls by giving them a moment of true bliss in which they can live their most prized fantasy. Her voice is mystically empowered with advanced mind-control abilities, related to her mood: when she speaks in joy, she fills her listeners with bliss and fanatical love for her; when she cries in sadness, her listeners drown in despair too. Her power was strong enough to immediately subdue the Sentry into helping her find Norman Osborn during \\"Dark Reign.\\" Like many characters with vocal-based abilities, it has been shown that Venus' siren song can be disabled if she is gagged. Other versionsWhat if?= *What If (vol. 1) #9 showed Venus as a member of a 1950s Avengers team called the G-Men which assembled to defeat the Yellow Claw.What If (vol. 1) #9 This story was initially suggested to have occurred in the main Marvel Universe (Earth-616) ‚Äî but the series Avengers Forever later revealed that it was an alternate timeline, which was soon destroyed by the time traveler Immortus. Reception Venus was ranked eighth in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list, although this list does not specify which version of the character was chosen. Aphrodite Aphrodite is a fictional character in the comic book, The Incredible Hercules published by Marvel Comics. Aphrodite is an Olympian based on the goddess of the same name from Greek Mythology first appearing in X-Men vs. Agents of Atlas #2 (November 2009) by Jeff Parker and Carlo Pagulayan. Fictional character biography Aphrodite was the wife of Hephaestus, whom she was given to by Hera in order to make amends for casting him out of Olympus when he was just a child. However Aphrodite never loved Hephaestus who she found to be hideous due to his physical handicap and instead desired Hephaestus' brother, Ares. The marriage was ended after Hephaestus caught the lovers in bed together, and with a net made of adamantine brought them before Zeus for retribution.The Incredible Hercules #140 (January 2010) =X-Men Vs. Agents of Atlas= With the help of Hera, Aphrodite locates Venus, whom she views as an imposter and sends one of her centaurs to kidnap her. Venus is bound and gagged and brought back to Aphrodite's temple where she is chained, branded with a poker and put before a statue of Aphrodite. Through the statue Aphrodite expresses her outrage that Venus has stolen her name and form. The Agents of Atlas, with the help of the X-Men, track Venus using Cerebro and rescues her from the temple.X-Men Vs. Agents of Atlas #1‚Äì2 (2009) Aphrodite, still angered, sends Phorcys, Venus' creator to reclaim her but is halted by the Agents of Atlas. =Assault on New Olympus= After the destruction of Olympus and the death and rebirth of Zeus, Hera takes control of the Olympus Group, a corporation that handles the Olympians' Earthly enterprises, and uses her power to create a product that would bring about mankind's extinction. In order to stop her, Athena and Amadeus Cho devise a plan which first involves seeking Aphrodite's help.Assault on New Olympus Prologue #1 (November 2009) Aphrodite agrees to stall Ares from defending the Olympus Group by sleeping with him and in turn Athena agreed to aid Aphrodite in confronting Venus.The Incredible Hercules #138 (November 2009) While The New Avengers, the Mighty Avengers and Athena stage a frontal assault on the Olympus Group, the Agents of Atlas try to infiltrate the corporation from underground. They are stopped by Aphrodite who confronts Venus. During the ensuing battle, Aphrodite comes to the realization that she hasn't felt love in centuries, since the Trojan War. Aphrodite then passes the title of 'goddess of love' and the girdle Cestus to Venus.The Incredible Hercules #141 (February 2010) Powers and abilities Aphrodite possesses the typical powers of an Olympian, including superhuman strength, speed, durability, and reflexes, and virtual immortality. Like all Olympians she has some resistance to magic and is immune to all terrestrial diseases, aging and poisons. As the goddess of love, Aphrodite has more power to sense, inspire and control the emotions of love and sexual desire than any other god. Her powers have been demonstrated to be powerful enough to influence Zeus himself. The only known beings who were immune to her influence were her half- sisters, Athena and Artemis and her aunt, Hestia. She also possesses the range of abilities endemic to most Olympian gods. Aphrodite can teleport between Olympus and Earth. She can fly/levitate. She can change her own shape and appearance and that of others. Aphrodite can turn invisible (demonstrated when she saved the Trojan prince Paris from his Greek rival Menelaus in the Trojan War). The goddess can generate fields of defensive energy (force fields) as when she similarly saved her son Aeneas from the Greek Diomedes. Like other gods, she also possesses some localized control over weather, the elements and animals. Aphrodite is the original owner of the Cestus, a magical girdle which enhances even further her already formidable powers over love and desire. It also enables her to transform weapons into objects that can be used for peaceful purposes.

The town comprises three quarters namely Obiuno, Ngo, and Ihite (an agglomeration of 4 quarters) with several villages within each quarter and thirty-six(36) administrative wards.It is also bordered by Ora-eri, Ichida, Azigbo, Ezinifite, Amichi and some other towns. Archaeological significance Human and ram's head pendants from Igbo-Ukwu in the British Museum Igbo-Ukwu is notable for three archaeological sites, where excavations have found bronze artifacts from a highly sophisticated bronze metal-working culture dating to 9th century AD, centuries before other known bronzes of the region. The first, called Igbo Isaiah, was uncovered in 1938 by Isaiah Anozie, a local villager, who found the bronze works while digging beside his home. Five bronze artifacts from the original excavation are now in the British Museum's collection.British Museum Collection They include a small staff, a head of a ram, a large manilla, an intricately designed crescent-shaped vessel and a small pendant in the shape of a local chief's head with scarification (ichi) marks on the face. Formal excavations by the archaeologist Thurstan Shaw in 1959 at the request of the Nigerian government, resulted in the discovery of two other sites, Igbo Richard and Igbo Jonah, containing the remains of an ancient culture. Later, these were excavated as well. Artifacts have included jewelry, ceramics, a corpse adorned in what appears to be regalia, and many assorted bronze, copper, and iron objects. Some of these contain materials that are evidence of a long-distance trading system extending to Egypt. Radiocarbon dating placed the sites to 850 AD Thurstan Shaw, Those Igbo-Ukwu radiocarbon dates: facts, fictions, and probabilities, Journal of African History, 1975 , which would make the Igbo- Ukwu culture the earliest-known example of bronze casting in the region. The craftsmen were working centuries before those who made the more well-known Ife bronzes. The archaeological sites in southeastern Nigeria are associated with the Nri-Igbo. The three sites include Igbo Isaiah (a shrine), Igbo Richard (a burial chamber), and Igbo Jonah (a cache). Artifacts found in these sites have shown that by the 9th century AD, the Igbo-Ukwu people had established a complex religious system and an economy based on agriculture and trade with other African peoples as far as the Nile valley.

He was known for his tenure on The Lawrence Welk Show. Early life Netherton was born on January 11, 1947 in Munich, Germany while his father, a United States Army officer, was stationed there. The eldest of four children, Netherton and his family relocated frequently due to his father's Army career. The Nethertons permanently settled in Bloomington, Minnesota in 1961. After enlisting in the Army during the Vietnam War, Netherton was stationed in Panama, serving as a 2nd Lieutenant. He had also decided to pursue a singing career and sang with Army and Air Force music ensembles. Netherton became a born again Christian following a sermon he heard at a Baptist church in Panama, spending a year at the Bethany Fellowship Missionary Training Center in Bloomington after his discharge from the Army. Faced with making a choice between missionary service and a career in entertainment, Netherton chose to follow the same path taken by his idol, Pat Boone, and became a Christian singer. Career Netherton joined the Lawrence Welk show cast in 1973. His inclusion with Welk's group of entertainers came as a result of a recommendation to Welk by Harold and Sheila Schafer, owners of a North Dakota theater where Netherton had been performing. Netherton appeared regularly on the Lawrence Welk show from 1973 to 1982. In 1975 he appeared on \\"The Dating Game\\", choosing from three bachelorettes. In 1979, he wrote an autobiography titled \\"In The Morning of My Life\\". Apart from his long-time attachment to the Welk program, Netherton recorded both Christian and secular music albums while still on the program and after. His career post-Lawrence Welk included touring and performing around the United States as well as acting in stage musical productions of Oklahoma! and Carousel. During the 1970s and 1980s he appeared on television commercials for Rose Milk skin care lotion and Nabisco's Triscuits crackers. Netherton was a guest on television shows such as Pat Robertson's The 700 Club, Robert Schuller's The Hour of Power and would appear at Billy Graham religious crusades. Personal life As of late 2007, Netherton had been living in Goshen, Indiana where he performed for holiday programs and entertaining local senior citizens at Greencroft Senior Center. Netherton never married. On January 11, 2018, Netherton's younger brother, Brad Netherton, announced on his Facebook page that the singer had died from pneumonia and the flu on January 7, 2018 at age 70.

The DSOC was founded in 1973 by Michael Harrington, who had led a minority caucus in the Socialist Party of America and disagreed with its transformation into Social Democrats, USA. Harrington's caucus supported George McGovern's call for a cease-fire and immediate withdrawal from Vietnam. In contrast to the traditional emphasis on strengthening the working class by organizing labor unions, Harrington reduced the emphasis on labor of previous socialist organizations. While continuing to work with unionists, Harrington instead placed more emphasis on middle-class political activists, especially those drawn to activism through the McGovern campaign. Developing a \\"realignment\\" strategy common to socialists since the 1960s, the DSOC tried to help to build a \\"democratic left\\" movement from the political movements participating in the Democratic Party. In 1982, the DSOC merged with the New American Movement to form the Democratic Socialists of America.  History = Origins  After nearly a decade of internal acrimony, the Socialist Party of America-Social Democratic Federation was clearly headed for a split as the decade of the 1970s opened. While sharing a common antipathy to the worldwide Communist movement, the organization was divided over two primary issues: # Should democratic socialists call for either an immediate withdrawal of United States forces from Vietnam or a negotiated peace settlement along with an immediate end to the bombing of North Vietnam? # Should the democratic left continue its traditional focus of organizing the working class in labor unions or should it shift its focus to (predominantly middle class) peace activists? = 1972 Convention of the Socialist Party of America = In its 1972 convention, the Socialist Party of America (SPA) had two Co-Chairmen, Bayard Rustin and Charles S. Zimmerman of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU);Gerald Sorin, The Prophetic Minority: American Jewish Immigrant Radicals, 1880-1920. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985; pg. 155. and a First National Vice Chairman, James S. Glaser, who were re-elected by acclamation. In his opening speech to the Convention, Co-Chairman Bayard Rustin called for Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA) to organize against the \\"reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration\\" while at the same time criticized the \\"irresponsibility and √©litism of the 'New Politics' liberals\\". The party changed its name to SDUSA by a vote of 73 to 34. * The New York Times reported on the 1972 Convention on other days, e.g. * * Renaming the party as SDUSA was meant to be \\"realistic\\". The New York Times observed that the SPA had last sponsored a candidate for President in 1956, who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only 6 states. Because the party no longer sponsored candidates in presidential elections, the name \\"Party\\" had been \\"misleading\\" as \\"Party\\" had hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party, according to the majority report. The name \\"Socialist\\" was replaced by \\"Social Democrats\\" because many American associated the word \\"socialism\\" with Soviet Communism. The party also wished to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the Socialist Workers Party and the Socialist Labor Party. During the convention, the majority (Unity Caucus) won every vote by a ratio of two to one. The convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, eight seats for the Coalition Caucus of Michael Harrington, two for a Debs Caucus and one for the independent Samuel H. Friedman. Friedman and the minority caucuses had opposed the name change. The convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two-one vote. On foreign policy, the program called for \\"firmness toward Communist aggression\\". However, on the Vietnam War the program opposed \\"any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission\\" and instead it endorsed negotiating a peace agreement, which should protect Communist political cadres in South Vietnam from further military or police reprisals. Harrington's proposal for a ceasefire and immediate withdrawal of United States forces was defeated. Harrington complained that after its convention the Socialist Party had endorsed George McGovern only with a statement loaded with \\"constructive criticism\\" and that it had not mobilized enough support for McGovern. The majority caucus's Arch Puddington replied that the California branch was especially active in supporting McGovern while the New York branch were focusing on a congressional race.  Foundation  Even before the convention, Michael Harrington had resigned as an Honorary Chairperson of the SPA. Some months after the convention, he resigned his membership in SDUSA. Harrington and his supporters from the Coalition Caucus soon formed the DSOC. Many members of the Debs Caucus resigned from SDUSA and formed the Socialist Party USA. Despite opposing the majority of the SPA, Harrington acknowledged the validity of its members' concerns: > The anti-war activists of the sixties were overwhelmingly white and middle > class. Many of them were unconcerned about the domestic political > consequences of their actions and were even contemptuous of that majority of > Americans who supported the war. There was a profoundly elitist tendency in > the movement that [the majority of the Socialist Party leadership] denounced > as dilettantish and collegiate. Moreover, there was a vocal, and regularly > televised, fringe of confrontationists, exhibitionists, and Vietcong flag > wavers who could plausibly be dismissed as freakish, or sinister, or > both.Harrington, Fragments of the Century, pp. 212‚Äì213. Harrington's caucus in the SPA endorsed the New Politics movement and sought to expand that tendency into a viable left-wing pressure-group within the Democratic Party, advancing an explicitly socialist agenda and attempting to win influence over elected officials for that program. Harrington led many members of this caucus and from his networks to establish the DSOC in 1973. Harrington, a former editor of the SPA's weekly newspaper, New America,Michael Harrington, Fragments of the Century. New York: Saturday Review Press/E.P. Dutton & Co., 1973; pg. 199. was the most important figure in the establishment of DSOC. Harrington had resigned as National Co-Chairman of the SPA, many of whose leaders criticized McGovern, when Harrington focused his efforts on electing McGovern in October 1972.Harrington, Fragments of the Century, pg. 195. In his first memoir, published in 1973, Harrington defended his choice of peace activists over trade unionists: > But in their derogatory comparison of this movement with the trade > unionists, my comrades failed to notice two of its historic aspects. First, > the anti-war young were right: Vietnam was not only an immoral conflict, it > was counterproductive from all points of view, including that of progressive > anti-Communism. Secondly, the new strata of the issue-oriented and college- > educated who provided the mass bass for this phenomenon were, and are, > extremely important to the creation of a new majority for change in this > country. At its start, the DSOC had 840 members, of which 2 percent served on its national board; approximately 200 had previously had membership in the SDUSA or its predecessors in 1973 when SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800, according to a 1973 profile of Harrington.: Originally:  Publications  The publication that would eventually become the official organ of the DSOC, initially an eight-page letter-sized monthly called Newsletter of the Democratic Left, predated the formal establishment of the DSOC as a national organization in October 1973. The first issue of Newsletter of the Democratic Left (the name was later shortened to Democratic Left) appeared in March 1973 under the editorship of Mike Harrington, assisted by Jack Clark as Managing Editor.Newsletter of the Democratic Left, vol. 1, no. 1 (March 1973). A front page essay by Harrington, entitled \\"The Shape of Our Politics\\", made nary a mention of the bitter faction fight within the SPA: > Liberalism is in transition. Important ideologists announce their > 'deradicalization.' On the other wing, many trade unionists and middle-class > liberals have become aware of the need for structural change in our society. > In the McGovern campaign, for instance, the frankly redistributionist > principle that revenue should be raised by levies on unearned incomes was a > major step forward. On the campus there is a decline of activism, a revival > of private concerns. The New Left is dead. But a large and serious > constituency of the Left remains, even if unorganized and uncertain. If > presented with a clear and reasoned perspective for basic change, it might > be won to a lifetime commitment, even in the Nixon years; if not, it could > vanish. The Left, more than ever before, needs thought, self-criticism, > candor, and communication. We hope this Newsletter will make a modest > contribution to that end. Democratic Left continues today as the publication of the Democratic Socialists of America, the organizational successor to the DSOC. The organization also published a number of issues of an internal discussion bulletin, containing typewritten content submitted by its members about various issues of concern.  Formal establishment  The June 1973 issue of Newsletter of the Democratic Left, the fourth monthly magazine off the press, announced to its subscribers that the never-before-mentioned National Board of the DSOC had issued a call for the launch of \\"a new, nationwide socialist organization\\".\\"The Journey of Ten Thousand Miles,\\" Newsletter of the Democratic Left, vol. 1, no. 4 (June 1973), pg. 6. The founding convention of the DSOC was initially slated to begin on October 12, 1973 in New York City. For the first time, membership dues were solicited, with rates of $3.50 for students and $7.00 for regular membership accepted until January 1, 1974. The Founding Convention was to be a three-day-long affair, beginning at 8 pm at the Eisner and Lubin Auditorium of New York University.\\"A New Beginning for American Socialism,\\" Newsletter of the Democratic Left, vol. 1, no. 6 (October 1973), pg. 6. The convention was not composed of elected delegates, but was rather open to a general admission and about 500 people were in attendance.Michael Harrington, The Long-Distance Runner: An Autobiography. New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1988; pg. 17. The keynote speaker chosen by the organizers of the DSOC to address this gathering was David Lewis, one of the key architects of the New Democratic Party, the social-democratic parliamentary opposition party of Canada. The following day on October 13, the convention moved to the McAlpin Hotel, located at the corner of Broadway and 34th Street in New York City and began in earnest. Harrington delivered an address to those attending the gathering which was undelegated and open to all desiring to attend from the general public and then the attendees broke up into various small workshops. Small group subjects included \\"the unions\\", \\"feminism\\", \\"racial equality\\", \\"Democratic Party\\", \\"equality\\" and \\"detente\\". Workshop chairs were appointed in advance and included Michael Walzer, Bogdan Denitch, Christopher Lasch and others. A panel discussion on \\"Socialism and the Welfare State\\" was also held, featuring prominently Harrington's close political associate, the historian and magazine editor Irving Howe, an individual who would become one of the organization's leading faces. The final day saw the election of a governing National Board and ratification of a constitution for the new organization.  Membership size and structure  According to the group's founder Michael Harrington, the DSOC began with a core of about 250 members.Harrington, The Long-Distance Runner, pg. 19. The group's first paid staffer was Jack Clark, a 23-year-old from Boston who received $50 a month and use of a spare bed in the home of Debbie Meier, herself a second generation socialist and important figure in the DSOC inner circle. Meier's home served as the group's base of operations up to the October 1973 convention, at which time the DSOC rented a tiny basement office.Harrington, The Long-Distance Runner, pg. 23.  Ideology and strategy  The DSOC presented itself as an explicitly socialist organization. In electoral politics, it worked within the Democratic Party in which it dedicated itself to building a base of support for democratic-socialist (\\"democratic-left\\") ideas. In Michael Harrington's view, the task facing the American movement was \\"to build a new American majority for social change\\".Michael Harrington, \\"The Left Wing of Realism,\\" Democratic Left, vol. 1, no. 1 (March 1973), pg. 5. While important, Harrington wrote that the union movement could not win political power in its own right, instead arguing that it needed to unite with the \\"college-educated and issue-oriented\\" adherents of the so-called \\"New Politics\\" in the Democratic Party: > In 1968, the Center-Right of Nixon and Wallace received almost 58% of the > votes; in 1972, in a two-way race, Nixon got over 61%. In 1968, the American > unions were a major, and sometimes sole, force behind Hubert Humphrey, > proving that the organized workers are the most cohesive element that can be > mobilized for social change. But the '68 election also proved that labor by > itself cannot come close to winning. [...] In 1968 many McCarthyites did not > understand that Humphrey was infinitely preferable to Nixon; in 1972, the > Meanyites did not understand that McGovern was infinitely preferable to > Nixon. If this split continues, the Republicans will hold the Presidency for > the foreseeable future. Therefore, the only way to build a new majority for > social change is for labor and the new politics to come together. The DSOC proposed winning power through the tactic of \\"realignment\\", i.e. uniting of forces within the Democratic Party on a democratic socialist platform. Its members ran for political office almost always within the Democratic Party. In addition, the DSOC publicized and promoted the individual efforts of its dues payers and supporters, many of whom were active in labor unions or other political organizations. There were members of the DSOC who were elected to the Congress (Berkeley, California Rep. Ron Dellums) and the New York City Council (Ruth Messinger). The DSOC had public support from union leaders as Victor Reuther of the United Auto Workers, William W. Winpisinger of the International Association of Machinists and various officials of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.  Democratic Socialists of America  The DSOC ceased to exist in 1982 when it merged with the New American Movement (NAM) to form the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Discussions with representatives of the NAM, a successor organization to Students for a Democratic Society, began as early as 1977.Harrington, The Long-Distance Runner, pg. 64. The move was favored by the DSOC's left-wing led by historian Jim Chapin which sought to bring into the DSOC many former participants in the New Left of the 1960s who were in search of a new home. The DSOC formally endorsed the idea of merger with the NAM at its 1979 Houston convention.Harrington, The Long-Distance Runner, pg. 65. However, the proposal for merger generated vocal opposition. Forces on the organization's right- wing, led by Howe and calling themselves the Committee Against the NAM Merger (CATNAM), urged that instead of courting New Left survivors. the DSOC should instead continue to place its emphasis on outreach to larger forces in the labor movement and the Democratic Party. In addition to noting the NAM's deep distrust of the Democratic Party, many adherents of the CATNAM had grave misgivings about the NAM's position towards Israel, with the DSOC maintaining belief in a two-state solution guaranteeing the existence of Israel while many in the NAM saw the Palestine Liberation Organization as engaged in an anti- colonial liberation struggle. Ultimately, a careful statement was worked out on the Middle East based upon a two-state solution and merger talks moved forward. The 1981 DSOC National Convention was marked by a very heated debate on the question of merger with the NAM, which was ultimately resolved by a vote of approximately 80% of the delegates in favor and none against, with the 20% or so supporting the CATNAM position abstaining.Harrington, The Long- Distance Runner, pg. 66. Harrington later noted: \\"Our opponents wanted to indicate they were unhappy ‚Äî and that they were staying\\". The unity convention joining the NAM and the DSOC was held in Detroit in 1982 and the DSA was thereby established. The gathering was addressed by George Crockett, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus in the House of Representatives, with Harrington delivering the keynote address. The new organization claimed a membership of 6,000 at the time of its formation.  Footnotes  Further reading  * Newsletter of the Democratic Left. First ten issues. New York.

After the war Dodd was demobilised and began to study art. He then found work in advertising and, after he won a competition to write a slogan for Time, Bill Herbert, by then the cartoon editor at The Daily Mirror, offered Dodd the chance to take over the writing of a comic strip he had created, The Perishers. Working with the artist Dennis Collins, Dodd provided rough layouts, which Collins then drew from. Dodd continued to work in advertising, such as on the Clunk Click Every Trip series of public information films intended to remind drivers of the benefits of wearing a seatbelt. It was while he was working on this campaign that Dodd came into contact with FilmFair, a company responsible for the creation of television programmes based on The Wombles and Paddington Bear. Dodd collaborated with the company in bringing The Perishers to television. Dodd left advertising in 1980 and subsequently wrote a number of children's books. In 1983 Collins retired, leaving Dodd to write and draw The Perishers alone until 1992, when Bill Mevin began doing all the art work for the strip.

The company was always closely allied with the Midland Railway, and within ten years the L&BR; had been absorbed into the Midland, and disappeared. History The line and the two termini opened on 1 July 1846, with hourly services between the two and some direct services from Bradford to London Euston via Derby and Rugby. The nine intermediate stations opened within the next few weeks. From 1848 an extension of the line ran via Skipton southwest towards Colne where it joined the East Lancashire Railway in 1849. This stretch was closed in January 1970. Today there is an active campaign to reinstate this missing stretch, led by the Skipton - East Lancashire Rail Action Partnership. Background to construction of the line During the 18th century, Bradford was becoming an important centre of the wool trade, but was beginning to be hampered by the cost of transport‚Äîthe town is not on a river of any size, and moreover is in a deep valley. During the 1760s and 1770s, a group of Bradford businessmen were the driving force for creating the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and its offshoot the Bradford Canal, in order to improve the town's communications. The canals were very successful for Bradford; but from the 1830s, railways began to be built around the country, and again a group of Bradford businessmen were eager to benefit from this development. Various schemes were started, but none received enough support. Nor could the North Midland Railway be persuaded to extend its Derby to Leeds line to Bradford. At last in 1843 they succeeded in forming the Leeds and Bradford Railway company, with George Hudson (known as the 'railway king') as chairman. They obtained the necessary Act of Parliament in July 1843, to build a line from Wellington Street, Leeds to Bradford via Shipley; and also a link to the North Midland Railway's terminus at Hunslet Lane, to allow connections to the south. The engineer in charge of the project was George Stephenson, who had been one of the engineers for the NMR's line. He routed the line up the Aire valley to Shipley, and then south up Bradford Dale to Bradford‚Äîthe only reasonably flat approach to Bradford. George Hudson was also chairman of the North Midland, and in 1844 he had persuaded the NMR and two other companies he controlled to merge, forming the Midland Railway. With him involved in both companies, the Midland was closely associated with the L&BR; from the start, but they remained separate entities for a few years. However, by 1853 the Midland had absorbed the L&BR.; Calverley & Rodley Station, with a St Pancras to Bradford express on its last leg from Leeds in 1964 The line today Today the line, and the four surviving stations on it, are run by West Yorkshire Metro: they form parts of the Leeds-Bradford Lines, the Airedale Line and the Wharfedale Line. Most services are provided by Northern. Features of the line The stations and other features of the line were as follows, in order from Leeds to Bradford. Unless otherwise noted, the stations all closed on 22 March 1965. * Leeds Wellington station is now part of Leeds City station. * After Armley Canal Road station, the railway crosses the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. This was formerly a four track section, and between the canal and Kirkstall the Bradford lines, which were on the north side of the formation, climbed to a bridge and crossed the Skipton lines, coming back down on the southern side of the formation so as to be convenient for the junction at Shipley. The start of the climb was on the bridge over the canal, and the gentle slope can still be seen in the girder structure of the disused span. * Kirkstall station. * The railway bridges a bight of the River Aire, crossing it twice. * Kirkstall Forge station, which closed in 1905, but reopened in June 2016. * Just after Newlay station (Newlay and Horsforth station during 1889 to 1961), the railway again crosses the Aire. * After Calverley and Rodley station, it again crosses the Aire, but crosses back before * Apperley Bridge and Rawdon station. A new station opened there on 13 December 2015. * Both the river and the canal then swing north round Thackley Hill, but the railway instead crosses over them both and enters Thackley Tunnel, about 1200m long. * Immediately on the west entrance to the tunnel was the original Idle station, which closed the very next year, in 1848. * At Shipley, the railway crosses the (now defunct) Bradford Canal and Bradford Beck, and then turns south towards Bradford. * Frizinghall station was reopened in a slightly different location in 1987. * Manningham station was the last stop before reaching Bradford. A railway depot was built here. * The Bradford terminus was at the bottom of Kirkgate, near the Canal Basin. A later station on that site would be called 'Bradford Forster Square', though the current station of that name is some north of the original site.

It takes the line between the stations at Goring and Streatley and Pangbourne, and crosses the Thames on the reach between Whitchurch Lock and Goring Lock. The western viaduct is the older of the two, having been engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and was constructed at the same time as Maidenhead Railway Bridge and Moulsford Railway Bridge. It was built between 1838 and 1840, opening later that same year. A second phase of work, conducted between 1890 and 1893, involved the construction of the east relief bridge along with the refurbishment of the west bridge. They have become prominent manmade features of the local riverside landscape; on 19 June 1984, they became formally protected as a Grade II listed structure. History The Gatehampton Railway Bridge is actually two individual viaducts running parallel to one another, sharing cutwaters. The west or fast viaduct was the first to be constructed, being a part of the Great Western Railway's (GWR) original route between London and Bristol. The line was authorised during 1835 by an Act of Parliament, while construction commenced during the following year. The bridge was designed by the noted civil engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who served as the lead engineer of the line for the GWR, to carry the main line over the River Thames. Brunel‚Äôs chosen route, designed to be as direct and level as possible, required the line to cross the River Thames twice in the narrow Goring Gap, west of Reading, necessitating the construction of two bridges at Gatehampton and Moulsford. At Gatehampton, Brunel opted to build a masonry bridge. This structure largely conformed with the typical architectural idioms of the era while featuring aesthetically pleasing detailing. His decision to adopt track broad gauge for the line necessitated the bridge's width of 30 feet to accommodate a pair of lines. Construction of the viaduct took place between 1838 and 1840. As a means of reducing the mass of the bridge and its foundations, which reduced material, time and cost alike, Brunel using a system of internal longitudinal walls and voids to lighten the superstructure above the arches, reduced the forces acting through the structure. Opened to traffic shortly thereafter, the line quickly became a busy trunk route. By the 1870s, it was clear that more capacity along the line was needed to meet demand, especially towards the London end of the route. The GWR's management decided to widen the line from two to four tracks wherever reasonable to do so. This work was carried out in two stages, between London and Taplow in 1875-1884, and between Taplow and Didcot in 1890-1893; around this same time period, the original broad gauge tracks were progressively phased out, the line being converted to standard gauge instead. To carry the additional two tracks, between 1890 and 1893, the east or relief viaduct was constructed. This extension work was designed with great respect for the existing structure, deliberately featuring little variation from Brunel's design; the west viaduct was also partly refaced around this period. On 19 June 1984, Historic England recognised Gatehampton Bridge as a historic feature, designated it as a Grade II listed structure. The reasoning for this protection included its age, dating back to the pioneering phase of the GWR, Brunel's involvement, and its engineering and material interest, observing the bridge's elliptical-arched design to be elegant and the brickwork to be of a high standard, with relatively little alteration from its original design since the 1890s. Design Gatehampton Railway Bridge from the upstream bank The each of the two bridges consist of four low semi-elliptical arches, having a combined length of 120 meters and a width of 18 meters. The arches rise from water level from round cutwaters moulded in ashlar and featuring a square span of 62 foot (19 meters). In relation to the river below, the bridge is noticeably skewed, using step-outs on each bank with raked and slightly splayed abutments. The bridge is primarily composed of red brick, laid in English bond with Bramley Fall gritstone dressings. It features a plain, shallow stepped string-course along with several tie plates. Several changes of the structure have been performed over time. The arch voussoirs, which were originally composed of stone, have been replaced with brick counterparts. Repairs to the structure have largely used red engineering bricks, somewhat similar to the original brickwork. The later-built eastern bridge is largely similar to the western structure; one difference is the presence of stone roll moulding around the arch rings, there are also no refuges or railings installed. In comparison, the parapets of the western bridge have stone coping with rounded edges, broken by open steel refuges over every pier, along with steel railings along the top of the parapet.

Alternatively, the handle can be inside a glove-like enclosure to help keep the user's hands warm and dry when using the scraper. The blade of an ice scraper is usually flat if it is made out of metal, though some varieties include ridges that can be helpful if it is necessary to break up a sheet of ice (such as what collects in freezing rain). Plastic blades tend to have a more complex shape with several thick \\"fingers\\" linked together. This form helps the blade to flex, since most modern car windows have a slight curvature.

It was invented by German automobile engineer Heinz Kunert. Types Side window defogger wires of Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003). Primary defogger For primary defogging, heat is generally provided by the vehicle's engine coolant via the heater core; fresh air is blown through the heater core and then ducted to and distributed over the interior surface of the windshield by a blower. This air is in many cases first cooled down and dehumidified by passing it through the vehicle's operating air conditioning evaporator. Such dehumidification, when followed by a reheating, makes the defogging more effective and faster, for the dry warm air has a greater capacity of absorbing water from the glass at which it is directed (with respect to the moist warm air provided by the heater alone, and the dry cold air provided by the air conditioning system alone). However, whenever the vehicle is equipped with an air conditioning system, care must be taken to keep it in an operational state for the primary defogger to operate optimally. Also, at very low ambient temperatures, the air conditioning system might not turn on, in order to prevent possible compressor damage. In modern vehicles, running this type of defogger often automatically switches the air conditioning system on, without further action required. Secondary defogger Secondary defoggers, such as those used on a vehicle's backglass and/or side view mirrors, often consist of a series of parallel linear resistive conductors in or on the glass. When power is applied, these conductors heat up, thawing ice and evaporating condensation from the glass. These conductors may be composed of a silver- ceramic material printed and baked onto the interior surface of the glass, or may be a series of very fine wires embedded within the glass. The surface- printed variety is prone to damage by abrasion, but can be repaired easily with a conductive paint material. Automation Resistive-heat defoggers are usually equipped with an automatic timer to operate for a set time period of 10 to 15 minutes before switching off. This is because most defogging is achieved within that timeframe, after which the vehicle's heater has usually brought the interior of the vehicle to a warm enough temperature that the fog does not recur. However, if this is not the case, the driver may activate the system again once it has timed out. There is usually a telltale on the vehicle dashboard, often on the defogger switch, to let the driver know.

It is located some 45 kilometres outside George, South Africa. It belongs, together with 20 other settlements, to the Mossel Bay Local Municipality. Originally a farm, the South African Railways and Harbours turned it into a holiday resort for their lower-rung employees in 1933. Population The 2001 census showed a population of 71,494 for the whole municipality. The official estimate of 2005 regards 99 676 as a proper figure for an increased population. Although no official figures have been made available, it is estimated that around 15% of these figures relate to the current population of Hartenbos. History In 1936 the Afrikaanse Taal en Kultuurvereniging (ATKV, and \\"Afrikaans Language and Cultural Society\\" in English) purchased the farm for 7000 pounds, divided it into 670 lots which sold for about 60 pounds each. The resort was expanded over the years, and several lots were hired out permanently on condition that no permanent brick structures were built on them; not until 1994 were people allowed to purchase these lots. Facilities The ATKV also has an amphitheater in the resort and holds Afrikaans cultural festivals, such as their 2005 Afrikiti concerts there. On Christmas morning, the Kersdiens is attended by thousands in this arena. Several other services, such as the Kerssangdiens (Christmas Carol Ceremony) and Middernagdiens (New Year Church Service) are held in the festive season. During this peak holiday season Hartenbos accommodates up to 15 000 visitors at a time. The resort includes five kilometers of Blue Flag Beaches, a river with paddle boats, a super tube, fun park, heated swimming pool, flea markets, conference facilities and shopping centres. The resort is the largest self-catering establishment on the Western Cape's Garden Route coast. The town of Hartenbos has its own primary and private schools, a private hospital, sport clubs and several churches. In December 2010, Mosselbaai Mall, one of the largest shopping malls on the Garden Route, opened its doors to the public. Cultural significance Hartenbos is embedded into the Afrikaner cultural thinking. Koos Kombuis, a rebel against apartheid and member of the Vo√´lvry movement which kickstarted Afrikaans rock and roll, writes of the 'pure zen' of this town: \\"As a child, Hartenbos symbolised to me everything that is positive, beautiful and noble about humanity. The fact that my parents could not afford anything better than a very small asbestos home right next to the railway line did not bother me...with the years Hartenbos has not changed much...even though the seafront restaurant is now licensed [to sell liquor] the ooms and tannies (not just their children) still drink pink milkshakes after Sunday lunch. On the dirt roads of Hartenbos, the play of growing up is performed every season... But Hartenbos is not white anymore. Afrikaans, yes, but indeed multi-racial... How did the ATKV manage that? They did nothing. It just happened. Virtually overnight... It's high time the whole of South Africa learns the pure zen of Hartenbos.\\" Modern There are radical changes and developments re-shaping the face of the municipality. Some of these new developments around the holiday area of the town have met with severe resistance from many locals, citing that the character of the town will be destroyed by these developments. Especially controversial are proposals to turn certain caravan parks into conference venues to ensure a constant market of tourists. To many people, however, these parks are the soul of the town. At the current stage, all talk of such development has ceased. It seems as though the town will remain as it is for some time to come.

These curias range from the relatively simple diocesan curia, to the larger patriarchal curias, to the Roman Curia, which is the central government of the Catholic Church. Other Roman Catholic bodies, such as religious institutes, may also have curias. For example, the Legion of Mary has a rank called the Curia. It stands above the Praesidium but below the Regia. The Curia is responsible for several Praesidia. These curias are historically descended from the Roman Curiae, and they keep that name even though they now have very different functions. When the Roman Empire collapsed, many of the administrative functions previously done by the state were subsumed by the only solid institution left, which was the church. The Bishop and curia took the place of the government officials, often to the point of sitting at the same chair in the same building. The Curia therefore passed into religious hands, and afterwards changed functions many times but always keeping its traditional name, at least in those Christian denominations that keep a strong continuity with the Apostolic tradition. Diocesan curia Every diocese and eparchy has a curia, consisting of the chief officials of the diocese. These officials assist the diocesan bishop in governing the particular church. This diocesan curia includes the vicar general, who is normally also the moderator of the curia, any episcopal vicars, the chancellor of the curia, vice- chancellors and notaries, and a finance officer and financial council. The bishop may also add other officials of his choice.Can. 469‚Äî494 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law Patriarchal curia Patriarchates and Major Archiepiscopates of the Eastern Catholic Churches have an assembly called the Patriarchal Curia, which assists the patriarch or major archbishop in administering the sui juris church. The patriarchal curia is distinct from the diocesan or eparchal curia of the patriarch or major archbishop's diocese or eparchy. The patriarchal curia consists of the permanent synod of the Church, the chancellor, assistant chancellor, and notaries, the patriarchal finance officer, the patriarchal liturgical commission and other patriarchal commissions, and the patriarchal tribunal.Can. 114‚Äî125 of the 1990 Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches Up to three bishops may be elected specifically to serve in the patriarchal curia.Can. 87 of the 1990 Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches.

The film's original Korean title is a satirical take on the 1872 novel A Dog of Flanders, a European pet story that is very popular in parts of East Asia. Barking Dogs Never Bite stars Lee Sung- jae as an out-of-work college professor who is irritated by the sound of barking dogs in his apartment building, and eventually resorts to abusing, kidnapping and killing them. Meanwhile, a young woman (played by Bae Doona) working at the apartment complex decides to investigate the matter after she starts receiving notices from the tenants about the missing dogs. Plot Ko Yun-ju, an unemployed academic, lives in a large apartment complex with his pregnant wife Eun-sil. Yun-ju is struggling to become a university professor and grappling with his strained relationship with Eun-sil. Searching for the loudly barking dog of one of his neighbors, which is driving him crazy, he finds an unattended Shih Tzu. He tries to drop the dog from the roof, but is stopped when an old woman comes to dry radishes there. He takes the dog into the basement instead and, after being unable to hang it, locks it inside a cabinet. Park Hyun-nam, the lazy bookkeeper and custodian of the apartment complex, longs to be famous like a bank teller she and her friend Soon Jang-mi saw on TV who was rewarded for stopping a robbery. A little girl comes to Hyun-nam with flyers she wants to hang up in order to find her missing dog, the Shih Tzu. Yun-ju continues to hear barking, and sees the old woman from the roof with her chihuahua, the actual source of the noise, and reads on the flyer for the missing dog that it was unable to bark because of a throat operation. Realizing his mistake, he goes to the basement at night to free the dog from the cabinet, but hides when a janitor comes in. Yun-ju watches in horror as the janitor pulls out the dead Shih Tzu and cooks and eats it. The next day, Yun-ju sneaks up on the old woman and steals her dog. Hyun-nam witnesses Yun-ju throw the dog off the roof. Seeing an opportunity to achieve her dream of gaining fame, Hyun-nam chases Yun-ju, but is knocked unconscious when she is hit by an opening door, allowing Yun-ju to escape. The old woman comes to Hyun-nam with lost dog flyers, and when Hyun-nam shows her the chihuahua's body, she faints from shock and is hospitalized. Hyun-nam gets the janitor to bury the chihuahua, but as soon as she leaves, he digs up the body and takes it to the basement to make into a stew. When he leaves to get some seasoning, a homeless man living in the basement is lured by the smell and tastes it. The janitor comes back to discover his stew gone. As Yun-ju struggles to come up with the money to buy his way into a professorial position, Eun-sil, who has lost her job, comes home with a toy poodle. Eun-sil shows more affection for the dog, which she names Baby, than her husband, and treats Yun-ju like a servant. While in the park, Yun-ju becomes distracted and loses Baby. When Eun-sil scolds him for losing the dog, Yun-ju snaps and accuses her of wasting money. Eun-sil tearfully tells him she bought the dog with a small portion of her severance from her job, and planned to give the rest to Yun-ju so he could become a professor. Shocked, Yun-ju makes up missing dog flyers and takes them to Hyun-nam, who offers to help him, but he gives up his search after nobody, not even the dog-eating janitor, seems to have Baby. While being berated for her sloppiness at work, Hyun-nam learns that the old woman died from the shock of losing her chihuahua, her only family, and left her a letter telling her she can have the dried radishes she left on the roof. When Hyun-nam goes to get the radishes, she discovers Baby on the roof with the homeless man, who kidnapped her after developed a taste for dog meat. Hyun-nam rescues the dog and the man chases her through the apartment building. Jang-mi arrives and knocks out the homeless man, who is arrested by police, and Hyun-nam brings Baby back to Yun-ju. Hyun-nam watches a TV broadcast on the missing dogs, but sees no mention of herself, leaving her distraught. Later that night, Hyun-nam finds a drunk Yun-ju on the sidewalk. Yun-ju, overcome with guilt about the trouble he caused, confesses to her that he killed the dogs. Some time later, Yun-ju has succeeded in becoming a professor and his marriage has improved. Hyun-nam goes on a long- awaited hike in the woods with Jang-mi.

The Oxford Companion to Music is a music reference book in the series of Oxford Companions produced by the Oxford University Press. It was originally conceived and written by Percy Scholes and published in 1938. Since then, it has undergone two distinct rewritings: one by Denis Arnold, in 1983, and the latest edition by Alison Latham in 2002. It is \\"arguably the most successful book on music ever produced\\" (Wright, p. 99). Single-volume edition by Percy Scholes The first edition, a single-volume work, was produced in 1938, edited by Percy Scholes, and was written almost entirely by him alone. The second edition, published 1939 includes a 64-page categorised List of books about music in the English language by Scholes. Wherever possible, Scholes tried to use primary source material, rather than summarizing other people's work. His preface to the First Edition describes how he played and read through thousands of sheets of music, as well as reading thousands of concert programs and studying \\"old literature and long-bygone musical journals\\". From this research, he produced about fifty-five volumes of notes. Each of these was devoted to a separate branch of musical knowledge. He then sought peer review of each of these volumes with specialists in the particular branch of musical knowledge. Finally, these volumes were broken up and re-constituted in alphabetical order. Scholes' intention was to produce a work relevant to a wide range of readers, from the professional musician to the concert-goer, \\"gramaphonist\\", or radio-listener. His work was aimed at a reader for whom it \\"will neither be beyond the scope of his pocket nor embarrass him by a manner of expression so technical as to add new puzzles to the puzzle which sent him to the book\\". The result was a work which was highly accessible to the general reader, as well as being useful for the specialist. While scholarly and well-researched, Scholes' style was also sometimes quirky and opinionated. For instance, his original articles on some of the twentieth-century composers were highly dismissive, as were his articles on genres such as jazz. His entry on the can- can concluded \\"Its exact nature is unknown to anyone connected with this Companion.\\" He produced several revisions prior to his death (in 1958), with the last full revision being the 9th edition in 1955. The Tenth Edition, published in 1970, was a revision of Scholes' work by John Owen Ward. Ward considered it \\"inappropriate to change radically the characteristic rich anecdotal quality of Dr. Scholes' style.\\" Although he brought some of the articles up to date, he left much of Scholes' distinctive work intact. A distinctive feature of this Companion is a series of \\"imaginative\\" portraits of composers created by the artist Oswald Barrett (known as \\"Batt\\"). These consist of engravings (Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Byrd, Chopin, Elgar, Handel, Haydn, Liszt, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner),A selection of Batt's composer portraits appear in a Flickr photoset (accessed: 12 May 2018). and a frontispiece which is a colour reproduction of an oil painting of \\"Beethoven in Middle Life\\", described by Scholes as \\"the artist's personal gift to the volume\\" (see the Preface to the First Edition). The New Oxford Companion to Music The New Oxford Companion to Music, 1983 In 1983 a wholly revised two-volume work, titled The New Oxford Companion to Music, was introduced. This was edited by Denis Arnold who made extensive use of other specialist contributors, some 90 in all. The work was significantly broader in coverage than Scholes' original (there was for instance a perceptive article on Bob Dylan), and is the most extensively illustrated of the three versions. Arnold expressed his intention of adhering to Scholes‚Äô principles and indeed included much of Scholes‚Äô material in the new work. Nevertheless, he cut out much of the personal opinion and quirkiness which was characteristic of the original. For instance, he substantially increased the coverage of female composers and performers, who were almost totally absent from Scholes' work. There were no further revisions of this version, probably due to its relative unpopularity and Arnold's own early death in 1986. 2002 revision The Oxford Companion to Music, 2002 edition In 2002, a third work was produced. This one, edited by Alison Latham, goes back to the original title and to the single-volume format. Latham assembled her own team of over 120 contributors, some of whom had contributed to the prior (Arnold) edition, and others drawn from her own previous editing work (for example on the Grove Concise Dictionary of Music). This edition consists of some 7400 articles and aims to bring the work up-to-date: for example, in its coverage of areas such as electronic music and computers.

It was developed and tested during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The DPCU is being phased out by the Australian Army in favor of the Australian Multicam Camouflage Uniform (AMCU), which uses an Australian-designed multi-camouflage pattern based on the US and British MultiCam.Australian Army launches new Multicam Camouflage Combat uniform at Chief of Army's exercise ‚Äì Armyrecognition.com, 24 September 2014  Overview  Members of the Royal Australian Air Force on an exercise in Guam in 2017 The first uniforms using the disruptive pattern camouflage (called Disruptive Pattern Camouflage Uniform ‚Äì DPCU) were issued in 1982. In 1986 the final production version was introduced with a number of changes. It is influenced partly by early US Jungle Camouflage patterns, such as \\"Duck Hunter\\"/\\"Frog-Skin\\". DPCU was developed following aerial photographs of the Australian terrain to determine which colours and patterns would be most suitable for camouflage uniforms. The selected five colour pattern consists of a greenish sand coloured background with randomly arranged spots of orange- brown, mid-brown, leaf-green and very dark green overlaid. While a mid-grey tone was included in early test uniforms, this was omitted in later uniforms in favour of a second brown tone. The standard DPCU works in areas from arid bushland through to tropical jungle all over Australia. Since the finalisation of the colour scheme, the Army uniform was modified to the standard NATO format, with a single rank slide in the centre of the shirt, zip pockets on the shirt and pants instead of the button-flap original, and larger sleeve pockets to fit unit patches on. Though outdated and no longer in production, DPCU is still being used in limited numbers in the Australian Defence Force, mostly Royal Australian Navy and reserve formations of the Australian Army (such as the 11th Brigade). In addition to this Australian Air Force Cadets (AAFC) and Australian Army Cadets (AAC) still use older variants of the DPCU uniform as of 2019.https://www.armycadets.gov.au/ Desert ‚Äì DPDU An Australian soldier wearing DPDU in Afghanistan. He utilises the latest version of the DPDU uniform. Officially named DPDU (Disruptive Pattern Desert Uniform), a DPCU variant designed for desert conditions using different colours, was first tested in 1998 at the Woomera Missile Test Site in South Australia. The first version, from 2001, was printed in 3 colours (brown and grey on a tan background) with 1/3 of the normal pattern missing and rushed into issue for the Australian Special Air Service Regiment deployed to Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). A second version from a year later used 5 colours: brown, lime green, grey, and a very light blue on a tan background. This was again issued to SASR in Afghanistan after the first version was found to be too light in colour for the terrain. This was followed by a third issue in: brown, grey, very light blue and purple on a yellow background. The cut was changed in the shirt with the bottom pockets being omitted and placed on the sleeves. This was replaced in 2006 by the current-issue DPDU. The colours remain the same as the previous DPDU. Changes to the uniform include repositioning of shoulder straps to the chest, the changes of the chest pockets and cargo pockets from the button- fastened flap of the pocket to zips and minor changes to the sleeve pockets. This the current type issued to all ADF personnel serving overseas in arid/desert regions such as Iraq. Midpoint ‚Äì DPMU (Variant of DPDU) A new DPDU variant known as 'Mid Point\\", later called DPMU was to be progressively introduced into selected service in Afghanistan (2010). Army chief Ken Gillespie toured Afghanistan showing off the new uniform. The pattern remained the same as that used for the DPCU and DPDU but with a light lime-yellow base colour, light grey, sand, olive-green and red-brown. The new variant was designed to overcome issues associated with operating in and around the \\"green belt\\" areas of Afghanistan (particularly in corn fields) where the DPDU was too light in colour but where the DPCU was too green for open areas. Trials however, showed that in most areas the original DPCU performed more effectively than the new Midpoint camouflage and it was not adopted. One criticism was that the new camouflage used colours that were still too biased towards desert operations. Australian special forces operating in Afghanistan have been seen wearing Crye's Multicam camouflage. A trial of MultiCam was undertaken and the decision made to broaden this trial for Australian operations in Afghanistan. In 2011, a contract was awarded to Crye to design a camouflage pattern with Multicam's effective colours but with a pattern changed to resemble the original DPCU. In October 2012, Australian troops about to deploy to Afghanistan were photographed wearing uniforms in the new pattern. Unlike the UK's MTP camouflage which was also based on the Multicam pattern, the changes have been confined to the darkest and lightest shapes which now mimic the familiar \\"bunny ears\\" or jelly bean\\" shapes of the original DPCU. Naval ‚Äì DPNU Royal Australian Seaman wearing the DPNU. Disruptive Pattern Naval Uniform (grey) on the right, worn by VADM Russ Crane. A naval version, consisting of the \\"littoral colours\\" of various shades of grey with greens, officially named Disruptive Pattern Naval Uniform (DPNU), has been adopted by the Royal Australian Navy. Before the uniform was introduced, there was some confusion as to why a disruptive pattern was used at all, given that the uniform incorporated reflective tape on the upper arms to make the wearer more visible if they should fall overboard, though the reflective tape is placed low enough on the arm to be covered when the sleeves are rolled up. The primary reason for the use of the AUSCAM pattern is not to provide camouflage, but to align with the other services which use the distinctly Australian pattern, making personnel identifiable as Australian, and through the use of the littoral colours as naval personnel. It will replace several sets of other clothing, including the grey fire resistant overalls and the blue Action Working Dress (AWD). RAN personnel previously issued DPCU uniform (such as clearance divers) will continue to be issued DPCU kit in addition to their DPNU uniforms.  Opposing Force ‚Äì DPCU  During the late 1990s a modified Auscam colour scheme was trialled to be used for OPFOR units during force vs force training exercises. This pattern was in the same style as the standard DPCU but in tones of red and brown, supposedly resembling a \\"Russian\\" style pattern. Colours used were: dark brown, mid- brown, light brown and blood red, all on a tan background. It was used sparingly during several exercises but not issued widely due to the cost associated with fielding a separate uniform with only minor colour changes solely for use as an OPFOR uniform and as such was withdrawn from official service in 1998. OPFOR DPCU was found to be very effective in the red sands of some Australian deserts.  Air Force - GPU  A variant of the DPCU pattern was proposed for the Royal Australian Air Force as a General Purpose Uniform designated as the Air Force Disruptive Pattern Uniform (AFDPU). This experimental pattern was the same as the DPCU with a colour palette consisting of a light grey background with one of the brown colours replaced by dark grey. It was not adopted, however a new variant (called DPAFU ‚Äì Disruptive Pattern Air Force Uniform) commenced user trials in late 2013 within the RAAF. This has adopted a more 'digi-cam' style, similar to that of the US, as opposed to the \\"hearts and bunnies\\" of the current DPCU format. In 2014 the RAAF announced the General Purpose Uniform will be issued to all members as the new working dress for non warlike environments.  Garments  Garments issued in DPCU have included uniform jackets and trousers, Howard jumpers with DPCU components, Jump smocks (for Paratroops), A wet weather ensemble and cold weather ensemble under land 125 phase 3C, a pre-land 125 wet weather ensemble and earlier a waxed cotton (Japara) rain jacket, almost always referred to as a Japarra. Common specialist uniforms include tanker, mounted and aviation variants of the standard DPCU uniform jackets and trousers, and flight-suits made in DPCU and DPDU. Head dress has included bush hats, wide brimmed bush hats (\\"boonie\\" hats) and a peaked cap with a fold up neck flap referred to as a kepi cap (worn only by members of units which operate armoured vehicles and by Regional Force Surveillance Units). Other more niche issued garments include reversible DPCU/Desert Camouflage Uniform jackets for use by SF early in the Iraq war, extreme cold weather uniforms in DPCU (for use in Afghanistan's mountains in winter), Ghillie suit/Yowie suit jackets and field hats made with shredded DPCU material, specialist sniper trousers, as well as specialist sniper boots with DPCU material covering the body of the boot, and the NBC ensemble including jacket, trousers, and boot covers. Several variants of the DPCU/DPDU uniform (mainly under armour variants) produced by private companies (mainly Platatac) have been trialed and fielded by SF in Afghanistan and Iraq, a DPNU variant was also produced. Several Australian companies make their own garments in DPCU, DPDU and DPNU, notable companies include Platatac, Sord and TAS. Equipment Rucksacks Issued in DPCU include the 'M88' and modified versions, including 'M94' revisions and ALICE modification. Other packs include pre-land-125 Para ALICE packs and Land 125 Alice packs. smaller packs include day-packs, land 125 zip on hydration and daypacks for land 125 vest and Alice packs (slim, large and large divided variants). Specialist packs include older and newer variants Raven radio packs in DPCU, Medical packs, Officers tote bags, and special forces specific packs including the SAS mk6 pack. The modular belt webbing/load carriage harness system is produced in DPCU, both the '88' version and the '94' revision, and includes steyr, minimi, water bottle, bumbag, grenade, wound dressing, and back pouches in DPCU, as well as a belt and harness in khaki. More specialist pouches include Minimi 'panic' pouches, Browning high power holsters, Medical tri-fold pouches and Steiner radio pouches. The Land 125 Individual Combat Load Carriage Equipment was produced in DPCU and DPDU including commando and standard variants of a vest with h-harness adapter, padded belt, 2 and 3 mag pouches, horizontal and vertical utility zip pouches, medium and large utility clip pouches, F1 grenade pouches, double and triple 40mm pouches, Entrenching tool pouches, leg panels, Browning high power holster, and pistol magazine double pouches. in addition to this, as discussed earlier hydration/day packs were made to be accommodated by the vest. Body armour carriers including individual body armour used with the land 125 and older webbing sets and pilot and crew body armours were produced in DPCU and DPDU. CBAS (Combat body Armour system) version 1 and 2 body armour was made in DPDU, MCBAS (Modular combat body Armour system) was made in DPDU and DPCU. These used the land 125 series of pouches for load carriage. Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops helmet covers were produced in DPCU, DPNU and early DPDU (1st and 2nd series). Enhanced Combat Helmet (Australia) covers have been produced in DPCU, DPNU and 3rd series DPDU. Some more niche equipment produced in DPCU includes Browning high power shoulder holsters, pre-land 125 tactical vests, trial chest rigs, SAS patrol chest rigs and vests, SF armour carriers and pouches (early 2000s). Private companies also produce body armour carriers, pouches, packs etc. in DPCU, DPDU and DPNU, most notably Platatac and Sord.

The Norsemen who settled in Iceland from the end of the ninth century worshipped the √Üsir (the Norse gods). The country converted about 999. In 1056, the country was given a bishop of its own, suffragan to the Archbishop of Hamburg, with his see at Sk√°lholt, while in 1106 a bishopric was established at H√≥lar. These two dioceses were first under the Archbishop of Lund, later (1152) under that of Trondheim, and until the middle of the 16th century were in close communion with Rome. The bishops were selected by the Al√æingi, but the nominees were consecrated by the metropolitan. Many of their prelates were distinguished for their virtue and wisdom. The priests of Iceland frequently went to French and English universities for studies. Many among the clergy and laity made pilgrimages to shrines of both East and West. Canon law was in force by the year 1053. Under the influence of the Church the old laws (Gr√°g√°s) were written down in 1117, but civil strife led to recognition of Norwegian hegemony. Upon the death of Haakon VI of Norway in 1380, his son Olaf, who since 1376 had ruled Denmark, ascended the Norwegian throne and thus effected a centuries-long union of Denmark and Iceland, which later facilitated the spread of Lutheranism during the Reformation.

The novel was written in 1997 and translated into English in 1999 Margaret Jull Costa, which won the Oxford- Weidenfeld Translation Prize. Saramago Plot summary The main setting of the novel is the Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths located in an ambiguous and unnamed city. This municipal archive holds the record cards for all of the residents of the city stretching back endlessly into the past. The protagonist is named Senhor Jos√©; the only character in the novel to be given a proper name (all of the others are referred to simply by some unique and defining characteristic). Senhor Jos√© is around fifty years old and has worked as a low-level clerk in the Central Registry for more than two decades. Senhor Jos√©'s residence, where he lives alone, adjoins the municipal building and contains the only side entrance into it. Lost in the tedium of a bureaucratic job, he starts to collect information about various famous people and decides, one evening, to use the side entrance to sneak in and steal their record cards. On one nocturnal venture Senhor Jos√© grabs the record card of an \\"unknown woman\\" by mistake and quickly becomes obsessed with finding her. Senhor Jos√© uses his power as a registry clerk to gather information about the \\"unknown woman\\" from her past neighbors and, when it is suggested to look her up in a phone book, he ignores the advice, choosing instead to keep his distance. The search for this woman begins to consume him and affects his work enough so to draw attention from the Registrar ‚Äî head of the Central Registry‚Äî who, strangely, begins to regard Senhor Jos√© with sympathy. This special attention given to a clerk by the Registrar is unprecedented in the known history of the Central Registry and begins to worry his fellow employees. Senhor Jos√© further neglects his duties as a civil servant and risks his career to pursue this \\"unknown woman\\" he knows almost nothing about. Themes One of the main themes in All the Names, highlighted through Senhor Jos√©'s journey in piecing together the life of the unknown woman and the effects she had on the people and things, as well as the registry's conclusion that the living and dead's files should be put together as one, is that in order to be properly looked at, the human condition must include the lives of the living and the dead, the remembered and the forgotten, and the known and unknown. Indeed, this is a recurring theme in Saramago's works. Another theme is the absurdity of human action.

Known primarily for playing punk covers of Jewish and Israeli songs, the band started writing more of its own material in later albums. The band's logo is a variation of the Ramones logo (which, in its turn, is based on the Seal of the President of the United States), with the names of the band members in Hebrew. The eagle is replaced by a chicken with a menora above its head, the apple tree branch replaced by a shofar, the arrows replaced by the Magen David and the writing \\"Oy Vey, Let's Eat\\" instead of \\"Hey Ho, Let's Go\\". The logo can be seen on the album cover of Yidcore's compilation Rocket to Rechovoth. The band's mascot is a rubber chicken called Scrambles, which was usually taped to lead singer Bram Presser's microphone on concerts. The chicken has since fallen apart, which was the reason for Yidcore's breakup. History Yidcore's first self-titled album was released in 2000. In 2002, the band released the Great Chicken Soup Caper EP, which contained a song, \\"Why Won't Adam Sandler Let Us Do His Song?\\", in which Presser laments about Adam Sandler not giving him permission to cover The Chanukah Song. In 2003 the band arrived in Israel for its first tour of the country, and released the live/rare tracks album Scrambles: New, Live, Rare and Classic Shtick to celebrate the tour. New, Live, Rare and Classic Shtick included a version of Skrewdriver's \\"White Power\\" titled \\"(Song Formerly Known As) White Power\\", with anti-racist lyrics. In 2004, when Yidcore returned to Australia, they put out the Adam Slander EP, in which they cover the Chanukah Song as \\"The Punk Rock Chanukah Song\\". The following year, the band released a double album, titled Eighth Day Slice/Fiddlin on Ya Roof, via Rubber Records. The band again arrived in Israel for a second tour, and this time released the compilation Rocket to Rechovoth to celebrate the event, in reference to Ramones album Rocket to Russia, using the Israeli city of Rechovot. The band's third and final album, titled They Tried to Kill Us. They Failed. Let's Eat! was released in 2007, again via Rubber Records. The 16-track album contained only 2 covers of Israeli songs, plus a cover of the World War II anti-fascist song \\"Zog nit keyn mol\\". In April 2008 Yidcore went on their third and final Israeli tour, and released a new EP, titled The Hummusexual E.P., given away for free with every band merchandise purchased at the tour. Yidcore played their final show on 17 December 2009 at the Esplanade Hotel in St Kilda, Melbourne. The final show resulted in the decapitation of Scrambles the rubber chicken. Yidcore's final show was supported by Madonna, The Duvtons & The Disables. In 2011, Yidcore reunited for a show at The Arthouse in Melbourne on April 7. The chicken was taped back together. It is now part of the Jewish Museum of Australia's collection. In 2013, Yidcore opened up a Blogspot website, ostensibly run by Scrambles the Rubber Chicken, offering free downloads of all their albums except Scrambles: Live, Rare and Classic Shtick, on the grounds that Scrambles found it too poor sounding even in 320kbit/s mp3. In 2019, Yidcore announced a performance to take place on 8 September at the Melbourne Recital Centre.

History  In December 1893, Sir Philip Magnus, a governor of the Borough Polytechnic Institute, now London South Bank University, proposed that a bakery school should be set up at the Polytechnic. During the following year Magnus visited a private bakery school run by a Mr John Blandy in Uxbridge (established 1889). He was impressed enough to invite Blandy to the Polytechnic for his advice on setting up a school for the technical and practical training of bakers. The scheme was approved by the London County Council Education Board in April 1894 and funds granted. On 10 October 1894 evening classes for Bakers and Confectioners were opened by Mr Henry C Kutz, President of the London Master Bakers' Protection Society. By 1898 bakers were the largest group in the Borough Polytechnic Institute's student body (142 students) and the success prompted John Blandy to propose that a national bakery school should be set up at the Polytechnic. The proposal prompted the National Association of Master Bakers (founded 1887) to take over the management of the Polytechnic's Bakery School on 25 September 1899 at their own cost. The bakery school was from then on formally known as the National School of Bakery and Confectionary. The School continued its evening classes but now put a focus on its full-time day students, of whom six enrolled in the first term. On 5 February 1902 the foundation stone of new bakery buildings was laid by Thomas Fletcher of Birmingham Town Council, with John Humphry, President of the National Association of Master Bakers and Adam Lawson Johnston, Chairman of the Committee present. On 9 September of that year, the School's new buildings were opened by Alderman Francis Tonsley JP, President of the National Association of Master Bakers, supported by the Mayors of Northampton and Southwark, the Chairman of the Institute and its Governing Body. Mr John Kirkland was appointed Head of Department in the same year. On 10 September 1909 the new day session of the National School for Bakers and Confectioners was opened by the Lord Mayor of London, Sir George Wyatt Truscott with 44 full-time students. The first fourteen female bakery students were admitted in April 1916. In 1927 John Kirkland left his position as Head of Department and a lecture theatre was named after him, which is still is use. During World War II Mr Bennion the School's Head was seconded to the Ministry of Food to advise on rationing and the use of potato flour in baked goods. A higher diploma in Baking Technology was introduced in 1947 and in the following year the School made a silver wedding anniversary cake for King George VI and the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother as well as the christening cake for the infant Prince Charles. In 1958 the Bakery Department won the grand prix d'excellence and a gold medal at the Brussels International Confectioners' Exhibition. In 1960 a member of the Department's staff, Miss Joan Russell designed one of the wedding cakes accepted for the wedding of Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret and Mr. Anthony Armstrong Jones. The Worshipful Company of Bakers Hall on Harp Lane was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of London in 1963 and the Bakery Department were invited to provide the peppercorn rent of three white and three brown loaves for the Bakers Company to provide to the Lessors of the Hall at a new annual event. In 1965 the National Bakery Students' Society celebrated it Diamond Jubilee with a sherry party held at the Borough Polytechnic's Edric Hall. In that same year the Lord Mayor of London was presented with special pieces of bread made by students of the Department, which were delivered by hand cart to Mansion House, where the Mayor and Lady Mayoress received students for afternoon tea. From 1969 the National Bakery School moved to purpose built accommodation within new extension buildings of the then Polytechnic of the South Bank, which were opened by the Duke of Edinburgh. In 1989 the School yet again baked a cake for a major celebration, this time marking the 800th anniversary of the office of Lord Mayor of London. The cake which stood nearly three metres tall featured a model of Dick Whittington and his cat. In 1992 the School pioneered a BSc (Hons) in Baking Technology and Process Management - a first in the UK. The National Bakery School celebrated its centenary in 1994, holding a celebration lunch at Mansion House and publishing a book of recipes submitted by staff and students of South Bank University called 'The Lightest Chocolate Mousse in the World'. During the 1990s John Marchant became Head of the National Bakery School, which ran until 2010, the Tower Restaurant, which was used to train students, sell food produced by the School and for formal dining at the London South Bank University. From September 2000 the School introduced foundation degrees in Baking Technology Management. During 2004 bakery students worked with designer Jean Paul Gaultier to recreate some of his iconic designs in bread. Another interesting commission was received in 1996 when artist Sharon Baker asked to bake bread in life-size moulds she had had made by lifecast artists CJ Munn and Andre Masters of herself. The finished body-shaped bread was presented to the audience at the art event 'Eat Me' which formed part of the annual London Thames Festival.

Edward Byles Cowell, (23 January 1826 ‚Äì 9 February 1903) was a noted translator of Persian poetry and the first professor of Sanskrit at Cambridge University. Cowell was born in Ipswich, and became interested in Oriental languages at the age of fifteen, when he found a copy of Sir William Jones's works (including his Persian Grammar) in the public library. Self-taught, he began translating and publishing Hafez within the year. On the death of his father in 1842 he took over the family business. He married in 1845, and in 1850 entered Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied and catalogued Persian manuscripts for the Bodleian Library. From 1856-1867 he lived in Calcutta as professor of English history at Presidency College. He was also as principal of Sanskrit College from 1858 to 1864. Official website of Sanskrit College, Principals of Sanskrit College In this year he discovered a manuscript of Omar Khayy√°m's quatrains in the Asiatic Society's library and sent a copy to London for his friend and student, Edward Fitzgerald, who then produced the famous English translations (the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, 1859). He also published, unsigned, an introduction to Khayy√°m with translations of thirty quatrains in the Calcutta Review (1858). Having studied Hindustani, Bengali, and Sanskrit with Indian scholars, he returned to England to take up an appointment as the first professor of Sanskrit at Cambridge. He was professor from 1867 until his death in 1903. He was made an honorary member of the German Oriental Society (DMG) in 1895, was awarded the Royal Asiatic Society's first gold medal in 1898, and in 1902 became a founding member of the British Academy.

Background In the Steppes of Central Asia had been intended to be presented as one of several tableaux vivants to celebrate the silver anniversary of the reign of Emperor Alexander II of Russia, who had done much to expand the Russian Empire eastward. The intended production never occurred, but the work has been a concert favorite since its first performance, on 20 April 1880 (8 April Old style) in St. Petersburg by the orchestra of the Russian Opera under the conductorship of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.Dianin, Serge. Borodin. Trans. from the Russian by Robert Lord. Oxford Univ. Press, 1967; rpt. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1980, pp. 113-114, 225-228. Structure The work depicts an interaction between Russians and Asians in the steppe lands of the Caucasus. A caravan of Central Asians is crossing the desert under the protection of Russian troops. The opening theme, representing the Russians, is heard first; after it, the strains of an ornamented eastern melody on English horn, representing the Asians. The melodies eventually combine contrapuntally. Amid these two ethnic melodies Borodin inserts a \\"traveling\\" theme in pizzicato that represents the plodding hoofs of the horses and camels. At the end, only the Russian theme is heard. Instrumentation The piece is scored for two flutes, oboe, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns in F, two trumpets in F, two trombones, bass trombone, timpani and strings. Somewhat unusually, the two scores available via the IMSLP show different tempo markings at the start. The Eulenberg score is marked Allegretto con moto, whereas the Russian Muzyka score shows Allegro con moto. Borodin also transcribed the piece for piano four hands. Composer's note The composer provided the following description in a note to the score: > In the silence of the monotonous steppes of Central Asia is heard the > unfamiliar sound of a peaceful Russian song. From the distance we hear the > approach of horses and camels and the bizarre and melancholy notes of an > oriental melody. A caravan approaches, escorted by Russian soldiers, and > continues safely on its way through the immense desert. It disappears > slowly. The notes of the Russian and Asiatic melodies join in a common > harmony, which dies away as the caravan disappears in the distance.

It was founded in 649 near Caudebec-en-Caux in Seine-Maritime, Normandy, France. First foundation It was founded by Wandregisel or Saint Wandrille (d. 22 July 668) on land obtained through the influence of Wandregisel's friend Saint Ouen, Archbishop of Rouen. Wandrille, being of the royal family of Austrasia, held a high position in the court of his kinsman Dagobert I, but wishing to devote his life to God, he retired to the abbey of Montfaucon-d'Argonne, in Champagne, in 629. Later he went to Bobbio Abbey and then to Romainm√¥tier Abbey, where he remained for ten years. In 648 he returned to Normandy and established the monastery of Fontenelle, using the Rule of Saint Columbanus, which he had known at Bobbio; the deed of gift of the land is dated 1 March 649. Architecture He first built a Carolingian style basilica dedicated to Saint Peter, nearly long, which was consecrated by Saint Ouen in 657. (This church was destroyed by fire in 756 and rebuilt by Abbot Ansegisus (823-33), who added a narthex and tower). The monastery was extremely successful at first, and produced many saints and prelates. In 740 however there began a series of lay abbots, under whom the monastery declined. Ansegisus, the reformer of Luxeuil Abbey, was appointed in 823, Abbot of Fontenelle, which he also reformed. The abbey soon became a target for Viking raids, culminating in that of 9 January 852 when it was burnt down and the monks fled with the relics of Saint Wandrille. After more than a century in temporary accommodation at Chartres, Boulogne, Saint-Omer and Ghent, the community was at length brought back to Fontenelle by Abbot Maynard in 966 and a restoration of the buildings was again undertaken. A new church was built by Abbot G√©rard, but was hardly finished when it was destroyed by lightning in 1012. Undaunted by this disaster the monks once more set to work and another church was consecrated in 1033. Two centuries later, in 1250, this was burnt to the ground, but Abbot Pierre Mauviel at once began a new one. The work was hampered by lack of funds and it was not until 1331 that the building was finished. Monks and arts Meanwhile, the monastery attained a position of great importance and celebrity for the fervour and learning of its monks, who during the periods of its greatest prosperity numbered over 300. It was especially noted for its library and school, where letters, the fine arts, the sciences, and above all calligraphy, were cultivated. One of the most notable of its early copyists was Saint Harduin (Haduin), a celebrated mathematician (died 811) who wrote with his own hand four copies of the Gospels, one of Saint Paul's Epistles, a psalter, three sacramentaries, and many other volumes of homilies and lives of the saints, besides numerous mathematical works. The Capitularia regum Francorum, a collection of royal capitularies, was compiled under Abbot Ansegisus in the 9th century, who also commissioned a chronicle of the abbey, the Gesta abbatum Fontanellensium. The monks of Fontenelle enjoyed many rights and privileges, among which were exemption from all river-tolls on the Seine, and the right to exact taxes in the town of Caudebec. The charter dated 1319 in which were enumerated their chief privileges, was confirmed by Henry V of England and Normandy in 1420, and by the Council of Basle in 1436. Some of the burials at the Abbey are *Saint Condedus (Conde), a 7th-century exile from England who became a monk *Saint Wando, Abbot, died around 756 AD *Saint Fulk of Fontenelle, 21st Abbot of Fontenelle *Saint Harduin of Fontenelle, died c. 811 AD *Saint Bagnus (Bagne), a monk, then Bishop of Therouanne, then Abbot of Fontenelle later in life. Died c. 710 *Saint Girald, a monk and then the Abbot of Saint Arnoul. He was asked by the Duke of Normandy to be the Abbot of Fontenelle. He was very exacting and was later murdered by one of his monks *Dom Joseph Pothier, Abbot of St Wandrille Abbey and scholar who reconstituted the Gregorian chant. Decline and suppression Commendatory abbots were introduced at Fontenelle in the 16th century and as a result the prosperity of the abbey began to decline. In 1631 the central tower of the church suddenly fell, ruining all the adjacent parts, but fortunately without injuring the beautiful cloisters or the conventual buildings. It was just at this time that the newly formed Congregation of Saint Maur was reviving the monasticism of France, and the commendatory abbot Ferdinand de Neufville invited them to take over the abbey and do for it what he himself was unable to accomplish. They accepted the offer, and in 1636 began major building works. Not only did they restore the damaged portion of the church, but they added new wings and gateways and also built a great chapter-hall for the meetings of the general chapter of the Maurist congregation. They gave the abbey new life, which lasted for the next hundred and fifty years. During the French Revolution in 1791 Fontenelle was suppressed, and in the following year the property was sold by auction. The church was partially demolished, but the rest of the buildings served for some time as a factory and later passed into the possession of the de Stacpoole family, to be turned to domestic uses. Second foundation George Stanislaus, 3rd Duke de Stacpoole, who had become a priest and a domestic prelate of the pope, and who lived at Fontenelle until his death in 1896, restored the entire property to the French Benedictines (Solesmes Congregation), and a colony of monks from Ligug√© Abbey settled there in 1893, under Joseph Pothier as superior. Dom Pothier, a scholar who reconstituted the Gregorian chant and one of the most well-known Benedictines of the world, later was elected abbot of Saint Wandrille, becoming upon his installation on 24 July 1898 its first abbot since the French Revolution and its first regular abbot since the 16th century. This community was expelled under the \\"Association Laws\\" by the French government in 1901, and spent years in Belgium until they were able to return on 26 January 1931, where they have remained until the present. From 1907 until 1914, the abbey was rented by the Belgian writer Maurice Maeterlinck, who lived there during the warmer months of the year with his lover, Georgette Leblanc. During the official visit of the British royal family to France, Queen Mary visited the monastery on 12 July 1917. Buildings Abbey of St Wandrille‚ÄîFontenelle Abbey Besides the chief basilica Saint Wandrille built seven other churches or oratories both inside and outside the monastic enclosure. All of these have either perished in the course of time, or been replaced by others of later date, except for the chapel of St Saturnin, which stands on the hillside overlooking the abbey. It is one of the most ancient ecclesiastical buildings now existing and, though restored from time to time, is still substantially the original construction of Saint Wandrille. It is cruciform, with a central tower and eastern apse, and is a unique example of a 7th-century chapel. The parish church of the village of Saint-Wandrille-Ran√ßon also dates from the saint's time, but it has been so altered and restored that little of the original structure remains. The buildings were damaged by bombing in 1944. A new abbey church was consecrated on 12 September 1970. Monks Fontenelle has produced an unusually large number of saints and the blessed. The calendar of the present monastery records thirty, from the founders Saints Wandrille and Gond to Blessed Louis Lebrun, martyred in 1794 during the Revolution. All have their own feast days, but 1 March (also the date of the foundation) is the feast of all the saints of Fontenelle.

It is a long zither similar to the guzheng but bowed by scraping with a sorghum stem dusted with resin, a horsehair bow, or a piece of forsythia wood. The musical instrument was popular in the Tang Dynasty, but is today little used except in the folk music of some parts of northern China, where it is called yaqin (simplified: ËΩßÁê¥; traditional: ËªãÁê¥).

Some contemporary players prefer to use an actual horsehair bow rather than a stick, believing the sound to be smoother. The instrument is used in court, aristocratic, and folk music, as well as in contemporary classical music and film scores. The Korean ajaeng (hangul: ÏïÑÏüÅ; hanja: ÁâôÁÆè) is derived from the yazheng. In 2002, the People's Republic of China released a postage stamp featuring the instrument.

It has been owned by the Selfridges Group, which itself is owned by British-Canadian businessman Galen Weston, since 2011. Through this ownership, it is affiliated with the Canadian department store Holt Renfrew and the European department stores Arnotts, Brown Thomas, de Bijenkorf, and Selfridges. The store is the only one of four major west-end retailers in Montreal that still operates with its original name, and is nicknamed the \\"grande dame of Saint Catherine Street\\". Ogilvy originated as a dry goods store, and was founded in 1866 by James Angus Ogilvy. The store moved into its present-day location on the corner of Saint Catherine Street West and Rue de la Montagne in 1912, and was considered a full-line department store by 1920. It now houses several departments of store-within-a-store designs for luxury goods brands including Burberry, Canada Goose, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, and Michael Kors. The store was rebranded to Holt Renfrew Ogilvy in 2019, and completed a significant renovation and expansion in 2020; it provides for the consolidation of the existing Holt Renfrew on Sherbrooke Street West into the larger, Ogilvy building. Operations during 19th century=Founding Display of a window at Ogilvy in 1941 In 1866, James Angus Ogilvy, a recent immigrant from Kirriemuir, Scotland, opened a wholesale and retail dry goods store at 91 and 93 Mountain Street in Montreal. Ogilvy is said to have started with a single counter and one employee. He remained at the same location for the next ten years until moving his \\"fancy and staple dry goods\\" business to 199 St. Antoine Street on the northeast corner of Mountain and Antoine. In 1884, Ogilvy relocated again, this time to the northwest corner of Mountain and St. Antoine. In 1889, James A. Ogilvy & Sons expanded its store to include house furnishings, household linens, and fine dry goods, in addition to serving as \\"agents for the celebrated Rob Roy Linen Fire Hose.\\" Move to Saint Catherine Street \\"The Ogilvy Store,\\" St. Catherine and Mountain streets, Montreal, 1906. In September 1896, James Ogilvy unveiled a new, larger, three storey granite premises, at the corner of St. Catherine Street West and Mountain Street. Designed by David Ogilvy, the proprietor's architect son, the store was described as \\"having every device known at the present time for the convenience of the public, the comfort of employees, and the economy of time.\\" Amenities included a ladies' sitting room, detailed in cherrywood, and furnished with writing tables and chairs. In spite of the larger, more prestigious quarters, Ogilvy declared that his business would remain largely unchanged: > We came up to St. Catherine Street and mean business ‚Äî a Dry Goods Business > ‚Äî only Dry Goods. A number of people have asked us if we are going into > department store work. This we have positively refused to do. Our business > is dry goods. In fact, one of the company's mail order catalogues boasted that Ogilvy's was the \\"largest exclusive dry goods store in Canada\\", featuring \\"the world's best merchandise at the lowest possible price\\". Operations during 20th century=Move to new building Grand opening of the new Jas. A. Ogilvy & Sons store, Montreal Daily Star, March 27, 1912 For the next sixteen years, the store remained at the northeast corner of St. Catherine Street West and Mountain Street. But with business expanding, Ogilvy bought land directly across the street and commenced construction of a new establishment in 1908. The four-storey, Romanesque Revival structure, again designed by David Ogilvy, and costing well over a million dollars, was formally unveiled in March 1912. Press reports noted the spaciousness of the new store and how \\"the accommodations are such that 1,000 people can be standing at the counters at one time and still have the aisle space for a couple thousand more people.\\" Advertisements promoted the new establishment as \\"The Daylight Store\\" - an apparent reference to the abundance of natural light allowed by its many windows. The company's founder, however, did not live to see the opening of the new store. James A. Ogilvy died the year before. Press reports referred to his \\"straightforward\\" character and \\"generous but never ostentatious\\" nature and how he was a major contributor to his church, as well as local charitable and community organizations. 1920-1949 By 1920, Ogilvy's array of merchandise and services had expanded and its policy of remaining strictly a dry goods business had changed. Jas. A. Ogilvy Limited now promoted itself as a department store that included amenities such as a \\"Hair Dressing Parlor\\" and a \\"Lunch Room.\\" During this period, the store's ownership also changed hands and Jas. A. Ogilvy & Sons became an asset of the Home Bank of Canada. In 1927, following the bank's failure, investment dealer Arthur J. Nesbitt, of Nesbitt, Thomson and Company, bought the firm's entire common stock at $5 a share, for a total of $38,500, on the urging of his 19-year-old son. J. Aird Nesbitt hoped to quickly resell the business for a profit. Instead, he \\"fell in love with the place‚Äù and proceeded to manage Ogilvy's for the next 54 years. As head of Ogilvy's, James Aird Nesbitt became a leading figure in Montreal retailing. Described as \\"an innovator and pioneer marketeer\\" who spent his career \\"ignoring the mass-merchandising techniques of the big department stores.\\" Nesbitt characterized himself as \\"more showman than storekeeper.\\" Soon after taking charge of Ogilvy's, he added a fifth floor to the building and opened Tudor Hall, a 300-seat oak-panelled music hall that featured an elaborate pipe organ. The venue hosted public concerts and shows, from Punch and Judy to performing baby elephants, early radio shows, including the first Montreal Symphony Orchestra across-the-country broadcast, and Canada's first experimental television transmission, aired in 1931. Other attractions included the world's fastest aircraft, a Vickers-Armstrongs Supermarine biplane, which in 1932 Nesbitt had dismantled and reassembled for in-store display. Jas. A. Ogilvy & Sons \\"spring fashions\\" mail order catalogue, Montreal, 1906. Nesbitt also placed renewed emphasis on elegant interior design and chandeliers became a common store fixture. During the 1960s, he purchased the century-old, 100-light crystal Bohemian chandelier from Her Majesty's Theatre, Montreal, following its demolition, and put it on display on Ogilvy's ground floor, where it still hangs today. Nesbitt also established a policy whereby Ogilvy's would carry items that its clientele would enjoy, rather than merchandise only designed to make the most money: > We feel that the more fun we get out of merchandising ourselves, the more > our customers will enjoy it, and the more successful we will be. Therefore, > it is our policy to both choose in Canada and to import from around the > world as many delectable and exciting things as we can afford, sometimes not > worrying too much whether the things will be a big commercial success as > long as they are a pleasure to have in the store. Nesbitt paid tribute to the store‚Äôs Scottish heritage, and his own, with the introduction of tartan shopping bags and store packaging. He also initiated the tradition of a Scottish bagpiper who paraded through the store, playing for the entertainment of patrons and staff. Beginning in 1945, the bagpiper closed the store at the end of the day ‚Äî at first on Saturdays only but later on a daily basis. For the past several decades, though, the bagpiper has played at noon hour, winding his way through all the floors of the store. Nesbitt was also responsible for the annual tradition of the store's Christmas window display. In 1947, he commissioned German toymaker Steiff to create two animated holiday scenes, known as \\"The Mill in the Forest\\" and \\"The Enchanted Village,\\" made up of dozens of handcrafted mechanical toy animals, with more than a hundred moveable parts. In 2008, the displays, in a state of disrepair, were completely refurbished. 1950-1999 Ogilvy entrance on Saint Catherine Street With the 1960s, the store was one of the first to use such contemporary expressions as \\"go-go\\" and \\"mod\\" in its promotional displays. It was also one of the first \\"to make use of the Chelsea look\\", associated with the miniskirt as it offered up the fashion of British designer Mary Quant. Ogilvy expanded into suburban Montreal with the opening of branch stores at Fairview Pointe Claire in 1965 and Anjou in 1968. By the 1970s, though, the store was no longer considered \\"the fashion leader\\", and was better known for its conservative clientele. Its profitability had also been on the decline. In 1976, it reported earnings of $81,000 on sales of more than $16 million. In 1981, after more than half a century as Ogilvy head, J. Aird Nesbitt retired. Edward Walls, a former general merchandise manager with the T. Eaton Company, became the new Chief Executive Officer. Among other changes, Walls expressed his desire to reduce the number of store departments from 66, which ranged from antiques to television sets. Four years later, after entertaining various offers, and asking for reassurances that \\"every reasonable effort\\" would be made to retain its retail tradition, the Nesbitt family sold Jas. A. Ogilvy Limited to Equidev, a Montreal development group led by real estate entrepreneur Daniel Fournier. The new owners undertook major structural and cosmetic renovations, which resulted in much of the store being gutted. A new retail format called the \\"store within a store\\" was introduced. Ogilvy was remodelled and transformed from a department store into a series of upscale shops and boutiques operated by independent retailers and brands, but under a common store policy. In November 1986, the first of the renovations, consisting of a completely redesigned second floor, were unveiled. It took two more years for the rest of the 150,000 square feet of retail space to be fully remodelled. The completed renovations saw 85 percent of the store‚Äôs space leased to some 50 retailers. In 1994, Standard Life Assurance Company bought Ogilvy. Operations during 21st century Ogilvy logo used until 2019 In 2000, the retailer again changed hands, this time acquired by Pyxis Real Estate Equities Inc. In 2004, the store underwent another remodelling at a cost of $12 million. In 2010, it was bought by a Quebec-based consortium but within a year was sold again, this time to the Selfridges Group Limited, chaired by W. Galen Weston, a subsidiary of Wittington Investments Limited. Wittington's other holdings include upscale retailers Selfridges in the United Kingdom, Brown Thomas in Dublin, Ireland, de Bijenkorf of the Netherlands, and Holt Renfrew in Canada. The intention to convert the Ogilvy building into a rebranded \\"Holt Renfrew Ogilvy\\" store and close the existing Holt Renfrew store on Sherbrooke Street West was first discussed in 2013. The renovation, which took place from 2017-2020, included a expansion and brought the total space to .

The starring television role made Graves the second African-Americans female lead in a U.S. network drama, after Diahann Carroll in Julia. The series is based on Dorothy Uhnak's crime- thriller novel The Ledger. Synopsis Based on the novel The Ledger, the main character \\"Christie Opara\\"‚Äîa white, New York City police detective‚Äîwas dropped completely and \\"Christie Love\\" emerged. Det. Olga Ford of the NYPD served as the series' Technical Advisor. Get Christie Love! was originally broadcast in January 1974 as an ABC Movie of the Week, inspired by the 1970s hero blaxploitation films such as Tamara Dobson's Cleopatra Jones (1973), and Pam Grier's Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974). The title character had a catchphrase; upon apprehending a criminal, Love would declare, \\"You're under arrest, Sugah!\\" The film proved a success, and consequently spawned a short- lived television series on the ABC network. 22 episodes were shown from September 11, 1974 ‚Äì April 5, 1975, featuring Charles Cioffi as Love's supervisor Lt. Matt Reardon, who was later replaced by Jack Kelly as Capt. Arthur Ryan. Financed on a meager budget and heavily sanitized to conform to Graves' religious morals (she had become a Jehovah's Witnesses since the making of the pilot, and eventually retired from the entertainment industry to focus on her faith), the series was cancelled after one year. One episode featured many of Graves' former Laugh-In co-stars such as Judy Carne, Jo Anne Worley, and Arte Johnson in particular playing a mad bomber. Another notable guest star was Jaclyn Smith, who appeared in an episode entitled \\"A Fashion Heist.\\" Cast and characters Charles Cioffi played Christie Love's boss for the first 12 episodes of the series (his character was featured from the season premiere until \\"The Longest Fall\\") and Jack Kelly took over for the last 10 (beginning with the episode \\"The Deadly Sport\\").

He was the seventh of eight princes commonly associated with the War of the Eight Princes. His title was the Prince of Hejian (Ê≤≥ÈñìÁéã), but he did not receive any posthumous names. Early career Sima Yong was the grandson of Sima Fu Prince Xian of Anping, the younger brother of Sima Yi and granduncle to Jin Dynasty's founder, Emperor Wu. His father Sima Gui (Âè∏È¶¨Áë∞) was the Prince of Taiyuan, and after his death, Sima Yong inherited his principality. In 276, he was sent to his principality (roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), but in 277 his principality was moved to Hejian (Ê≤≥Èñì, roughly modern Cangzhou, Hebei). He became known for his skill in finding capable associates, and when he visited the capital Luoyang on an official visit, Emperor Wu became impressed by him and stated that he could be a good example to other princes. In 299, during the reign of Emperor Hui, he was put in charge of defending the important city of Chang'an -- a post which Emperor Wu had left instructions that only someone who was closely related to the emperor should be allowed to take, but which the high level officials found appropriate for Sima Yong due to his reputation. Participation in various campaigns during the War of the Eight Princes Map showing the Wars of the Eight Princes When Emperor Hui's throne was usurped by Sima Lun the Prince of Zhao in 301, Sima Jiong the Prince of Qi (Emperor Hui's cousin) started a rebellion to restore Emperor Hui. Initially, Sima Yong sent his general Zhang Fang (ÂºµÊñπ) to support Sima Lun, but once he heard that Sima Jiong and his ally, Sima Ying the Prince of Chengdu (Emperor Hui's brother) had overwhelming force, he switched side and declared for the rebels. After Princes Jiong and Ying defeated and killed Sima Lun, Prince Jiong became regent and he, while angry at Sima Yong for initially supporting Sima Lun, nevertheless granted him additional honors as well as three of the nine bestowments. Sima Yong, however, knew that Sima Jiong was angry at him, and he started a conspiracy; he invited Sima Ai the Prince of Changsha (Emperor Hui's brother) to overthrow Sima Jiong, believing that Sima Ai would fail; his plan was then to, in conjunction with Sima Ying, start a war against Sima Jiong. Once they were victorious, he would depose Emperor Hui and make Sima Ying the emperor, and then serve as Sima Ying's prime minister. In winter 302, Sima Yong declared his rebellion, and Sima Ying soon joined, despite opposition from his strategist Lu Zhi (ÁõßÂøó). Hearing that Sima Ai was part of the conspiracy as well, Sima Jiong made a preemptive strike against Sima Ai, but Sima Ai was prepared and entered the palace to control Emperor Hui. After a street battle, Sima Jiong's forces collapsed, and he was executed. Sima Ai became regent, although he submitted all important matters to Sima Ying, then at his stronghold of Yecheng (ÈÑ¥Âüé, in modern Handan, Hebei) for decision. This ran counter to Sima Yong's plans. In fall 303, he persuaded Sima Ying to again join him against Sima Ai. While Sima Yong and Sima Ying had overwhelming force, their forces could not score a conclusive victory against Sima Ai. Sima Yong's forces were about to withdraw in spring 304 when Sima Yue the Prince of Donghai, the grandson of a great-granduncle of Emperor Hui, believing that Sima Ai could not win this war, arrested him and delivered him to Sima Yong's general Zhang Fang, who executed Sima Ai cruelly by burning him to death. Sima Ying became in effective control of the government, but continued to control it remotely from Yecheng. Sima Yong was given additional powers, and later in 304 submitted a pre-arranged petition to have Sima Ying created crown prince. Sima Ying, however, disappointed people who had high hopes for him. He put people he trusted in charge of the defenses of Luoyang, while remotely controlling the government from Yecheng. Eventually, the officials in Luoyang tired of the situation, and they rose under Sima Yue's command in summer 304. Sima Yue, with Emperor Hui accompanying him, then attacked Yecheng. Sima Ying, after some initial hesitation, battled Sima Yue's troops and defeated him, forcing him to flee and capturing Emperor Hui. He did not return Emperor Hui to Luoyang, but kept him at Yecheng. This gave Wang Jun (ÁéãÊµö), the commander of the forces in You Province (ÂπΩÂ∑û, modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei), with whom Sima Ying had prior disputes, an excuse to attack Sima Ying, and he did so, claiming that Sima Ying was improperly detaining Emperor Hui. Wang's forces were reinforced with ferocious Xianbei and Wuhuan soldiers, and Sima Ying's forces, in fear of their fighting abilities, collapsed, before they could be reinforced with Xiongnu forces under the command of Sima Ying's associate Liu Yuan. Sima Ying was forced to flee to Luoyang with Emperor Hui, now without troops to support him. As regent Once Sima Ying arrived in Luoyang, he found the troops of his ally Sima Yong there, commanded by Zhang Fang. Instead of continuing to support Sima Ying, however, Sima Yong turned his back on Sima Ying and had him removed from his crown prince position, instead creating another brother of Emperor Hui, Sima Chi the Prince of Yuzhang, crown prince. Sima Ying was demoted back to being the Prince of Chengdu. Soon, Zhang forced Emperor Hui, Crown Prince Chi, and Sima Ying to move from Luoyang to Chang'an, safely under Sima Yong's control. Sima Yong became regent. Sima Yong tried to appease possible opposing forces by promoting all of the major princes and warlords, but his promotions did not have the desired effect. In fall 305, Sima Yue declared yet another rebellion, this time against Sima Yong, claiming that Sima Yong had improperly forced Emperor Hui to move the capital. Various provincial governors and military commanders were forced to be on one side or the other. The war was initially inconclusive. In early 306, after a few victories by Sima Yue, Sima Yong became fearful, and he executed Zhang to seek peace; Sima Yue refused. By summer 306, Sima Yong was forced to abandon both Chang'an and Emperor Hui, and Sima Yue's forces welcomed Emperor Hui back to Luoyang. Sima Yong's troops soon fought back, however, and recaptured Chang'an for Sima Yong, but were unable to capture any other major city in the same region. Sima Yue then offered a high-level position to Sima Yong. Sima Yong agreed to accept it and started to travel back to Luoyang. When he got to Xin'an (Êñ∞ÂÆâ, near Luoyang), however, he was intercepted by Sima Mo (Âè∏È¶¨Ê®°) the Prince of Nanyang (Sima Yue's brother) and strangled to death. His three sons were killed with him. References * Fang, Xuanling. Book of Jin (Jin Shu).

The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census was 143.  Geography  The village is situated just west of the A1(M) motorway, and is about three miles south-east of Bedale. The B6285 road passes through the village.  History = Etymology  In the Domesday Book the place is recorded as Eston, in the 13th to 16th century as Texton, Thexton, or Thekeston and in the 17th century as Theakstone. The surname Theakston is derived from the name of the village. If the spelling \\"Thekeston\\" is assumed to be correct, the name of the village can be derived from the Old English given name Teodec and the suffix -tun, meaning \\"The farm (tun) of Teodec\\". The name \\"Theakston\\" is also believed to derive from the name of the leader of a family settling the area during the Anglo-Saxon colonisation of England. The first part \\"Theaks\\" is derived from the Norse \\"A√∞ √Öke‚Äôs\\". \\"A√∞\\" (with √∞ sounding like the English \\"th\\") became the English word \\"at\\". √Öke is a common Scandinavian given name. The suffix \\"-ton\\" (equivalent to \\"tuin\\" in Dutch = a garden and of \\"Zaun\\" in German = a fence and derived from old Germanic root word \\"tun\\") indicates an enclosure or in a wider sense a homestead. Hence \\"A√∞ √Ökes Tun\\" means \\"At √Öke's Homestead\\" and was changed over time into Theakston. The derivation is similar to that of Atherstone near Nuneaton which retained the \\"th\\" while the \\"k\\" was dropped, and gained an \\"e\\" at the end. A less likely explanation is that the name may be a corruption of \\"Thatchton\\", which in turn describes the roofing material thatch, popular in many towns at that time. However, while thatch was common in many areas in the southern part of England, it was not as common in the area surrounding Theakston where the predominant building and roofing material was and is stone.  Administrative history  In 1086 Theakston was recorded as being associated with Burneston with 12 carucates under the overlordship of the Honour of Richmond and count Alan Rufus. Mesne lordships were held by the lords of Middleham (8 carucates) and in the 13th century by Robert de Musters (1 carucate). The former was gradually acquired by the Abbey of Coverham and the priory of Mount Grace, and was granted to Sir Richard Theakston after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The latter went to the hospital of St. Leonard's and was also granted to Richard Theakston in 1590. His descendants sold the demesne lands in 1630, and they changed hands several more times in the following centuries. Theakston was a township in the parish of Burneston with a population of 57 persons around 1870 and an area of . It became a civil parish in the late 19th century. From 1836 to 1936 it was part of the Bedale Registration District, then until 1974 of the Wensleydale Registration District. As of 2017, Burneston, Swainby with Allerthorpe, and Theakston have a common Parish Council.  Notable buildings  Theakston Hall and Theakston Lodge are Grade II listed structures. The former is a large rendered brick and stone building originating in the late 18th century with moulded stone ornaments. The latter is a mid- to late-18th century house build from brick with Doric half columns surrounding the central door.

It is seen in livestock all over the world, usually affecting cattle, sheep, and goats. It has been seen occasionally in farmed bison and deer. The acute nature of the disease makes successful treatment difficult, and the efficacy of the commonly used vaccine is disputed. Susceptibility Most losses due to blackleg occur when the cattle are between the ages of six months and two years, although it can occur when they are as young as two months. Typically, cattle that have a high feed intake and are well-conditioned tend to be the most susceptible to blackleg. Furthermore, many blackleg cases occur during the hot and humid summer months or after a sudden cold period, but cases can occur at any time during the year. Causative agent Blackleg is caused by infection with Clostridium bacteria. The most common causative agent is C. chauvoei, but the disease can also be caused by C. septicum, C. sordelli, and C. novyi.https://www.zoetis.com.au/_locale-assets/faq/faqs- blackleg.pdfhttp://ucanr.edu/sites/UCCE_LR/files/152026.pdf C. chauvoei is Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, and motile, and can produce environmentally persistent spores when conditions are not ideal for growth. These spores can remain in the soil for years in an inactive state, and return to their infectious form when consumed by grazing livestock. Contaminated pasture is a predominant source of these organisms, which are also found naturally in the intestines of animals.Clostridial diseases: Blackleg. The Merck Veterinary Manual. Available from http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/50704.htm Retrieved 2012-03-20. Cases can occur over many years in areas where soil or manure is contaminated with the bacteria, and it is exceedingly difficult to remove the spores from the environment. C. chauvoei can produce a large amount of gas as a metabolic byproduct when growing and reproducing, hence the alternate name gas gangrene, present in humans. This gas builds up in infected tissue, usually large muscles, and causes the tissue to make a crackling or popping sound when pressed. Large gas-filled blisters can also form, which can be extremely painful as they build up in the tissues. Clinical presentations When infection begins, the animal may develop a fever, and the affected limb can feel hot to the touch. The limb usually swells significantly, and the animal can develop lameness on the affected leg. Crepitation (the sensation of air under the skin) can be noticed in many infections, as the area seems to crackle under pressure.Irsik, M.B. Blackleg in cattle. University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Available from http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/vm120 . Retrieved 2012-03-22. Once clinical signs develop, the animal may only live a short while, sometimes as few as 12 hours. Occasionally, cattle succumb to the disease without showing any symptoms, and only a necropsy reveals the cause. During a necropsy, a diagnosis is usually made very quickly, as the affected muscle is usually mottled with black patches, which are dead tissue, killed by the toxins the bacteria release when they infect live tissue. If viewed under a microscope, small rod-like bacteria can be seen to confirm the diagnosis. Vaccination and prevention The use of a seven-way clostridial vaccination is the most common and cost effective preventative measure taken against blackleg, but its efficacy is disputed. Burning the upper layer of soil to eradicate left-over spores is the best way to stop the spread of blackleg from diseased cattle. Diseased cattle should be isolated. Treatment is generally unrewarding due to the rapid progression of the disease, but penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment. Treatment is only effective in the early stages and as a control measure.

The NAM continued an independent existence until 1983, when it merged with Michael Harrington's Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee to establish the Democratic Socialists of America.  Organizational history = Establishment  The NAM was established at a conference held in Davenport, Iowa in December 1971 by radical political activists seeking to create a successor organization to Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).Stephen E. Atkins, Encyclopedia of Modern American Extremists and Extremist Groups. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2002; pg. 222. SDS, the leading organization of the New Left movement in the United States, had recently disintegrated into warring political sects and the need was perceived for a broad-based new organization free of sectarian rancor. The founding activists behind the NAM were vigorous opponents of the war in Vietnam who sought a new organization to serve as a forum for discussing where and how to redirect their activities. The call to convene was issued by Michael Lerner. Lerner became distant from the organization shortly after it was founded and went on to start the magazine Tikkun. In its early years, the NAM shared much of the political framework of the New Communist Movement, but rejected the strategy of building a \\"vanguard party\\", a position prominent NAM members defended in a debate in the pages of The Guardian. The organization was built around local groups called \\"chapters\\" which emphasized Marxist study, discussion of contemporary issues, support of local labor actions and work in the community to raise awareness. The national headquarters of NAM were located in Chicago.  Development  Healy standing before a jail cell in Los Angeles, California in 1949 By the early 1980s, after a great change in the American political climate and the departure of some of its more radical members, the NAM had moved away from its original neo-Leninist orientation and adopted a more traditionally social democratic outlook, culminating in a merger with the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) in 1982 to form the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).Max Elbaum, Revolution in the Air: Sixties Radicals turn to Marx, Mao, and Che. London: Verso, 2002; pp. 118-120. At the time of the merger, the NAM claimed 2,500 members.Mike Davis, Prisoners of the American Dream: Politics and Economy in the History of the U.S. Working Class. London: Verso: 1986. Richard Healey, son of Los Angeles Communist Party USA (CPUSA) leader Dorothy Healey, was a NAM leader from its founding in 1971. After his mother resigned from the CPUSA in 1973, Healey worked on recruiting her to the NAM, which she joined in 1974. In 1975, Dorothy joined Richard on the NAM's National Interim Committee and later became a Vice Chair of the DSA in 1982.Dorothy Healey and Maurice Isserman, Dorothy Healey Remembers: A Life in the American Communist Party. New York: Oxford University Press, 1990; pp. 245-249. The NAM made use of comparatively high membership dues which were tiered on the basis of the member's income. According to one analyst, total membership of the organization never exceeded 1,500 at any point in the group's existence. Membership was based almost wholly in large metropolitan areas and on college campuses. NAM activity often took the form of a group study circle dedicated to the collective study of Marxist or feminist writings. The group was ultimately hampered by its limited size and seeming inability to progress beyond the realm of doctrinal discourse into the world of practical politics.  Press organs  The NAM's official organ was a magazine called Movin' On. The independent journals Radical America and Socialist Revolution (later Socialist Review) were also vaguely associated with the NAM as were the weekly independent socialist newspapers The Guardian and In These Times which had their share of supporters both within NAM and in other radical groups. In addition to its magazine, the NAM produced several other targeted publications, including the Reproductive Rights Newsletter, dedicated to organizing to preserve women's rights of access to contraception and abortion, the Anti-Racism Bulletin and Women Organizing, a publication launched in 1979 and dedicated to questions of feminist organizing.Hannah Frisch, et al., Working Papers on Gay-Lesbian Liberation and Socialism. Chicago: New American Movement, 1979; pg. 47.  Dissolution  The NAM continued an independent existence until March 1983, when it voted to merge with Michael Harrington's Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) to establish the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).Aronowitz, Stanley.\\"The New American Movement and Why It Failed\\" in Works & Days 55/56, Spring/Fall 2010, page 30.

He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman from 1973 to 1987, most notably as a member of the Cincinnati Reds dynasty that won three National League pennants and two World Series championships between 1973 and 1976. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Baseball Hall of Fame on June 23, 2012. Early life Driessen was born in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina as one of eight children, all raised by their mother who worked as a maid. His father died when he was 6-years- old.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat;=19780715&id;=mXNJAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=NQsNAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1214,3316194 He attended Michael C. Riley High School (which did not have a baseball team) until his senior year. He then went to Hardeeville High School in Hardeeville, South Carolina, which also did not have a team, but he made a name for himself as a catcher with the town team, the Hardeeville Boll Weevils. His coach, Hal Young, wrote to Major League teams touting Driessen, and the Atlanta Braves and Reds showed interest. The Braves passed on him, but the Reds offered him a contract. Major League career Driessen was signed by the Reds as an amateur free agent in 1969. He made his major-league debut at age 21 on June 9, 1973 in an 8-4 Reds win over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. Starting at third base and batting sixth, he had one hit and one walk in five at-bats. His first career hit was a ninth-inning double off Jack Aker. He had a productive rookie season, hitting .301 with four home runs and 47 runs batted in. Driessen received the nickname \\"The Cobra\\" during his rookie season because of the quick, lethal way his bat struck. He became Cincinnati's starting third baseman in 1974, but was soon replaced at that position by Pete Rose. In 1976, Driessen became the National League's first-ever designated hitter in a World Series. Although he went 0-4 in the series opener against the New York Yankees, overall he made the most of his opportunity by hitting .357 with five hits (including two doubles and a home run) and two walks in 16 plate appearances as the Reds swept the series for their second consecutive World Series crown. He was part of the Reds' 1975 World Series-winning team, going hitless in two at-bats in the Reds' seven-game win over the Boston Red Sox. He was the Reds' starting first baseman from 1977 to 1981 after the trade of Tony P√©rez. His most productive year was in 1977 as he hit .300 with 17 home runs and a career-high 91 runs batted in along with a career-high 31 stolen bases. Driessen led all National League first basemen in fielding three times. He also led the NL in walks with 93 in 1980. He was traded in the middle of the 1984 season to the Montreal Expos. He saw significant playing time that season as well as in 1985 for the Expos and then, following another mid-season trade, to the San Francisco Giants. In 1986, his playing time fell significantly as, for the third consecutive season, he played for two teams, the Giants, who released him on May 1, and the Houston Astros, who signed him on June 2. He was released after the season and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on June 9, 1987. Filling in at first base for the 1987 National League champion Cardinals, in his third World Series he hit .231 in 14 plate appearances as the Cardinals fell in seven games to the Minnesota Twins. It was Driessen's final major-league season. Career statistics In 1732 games over 15 seasons, Driessen compiled a .267 batting average (1464-for-5479) with 746 runs, 282 doubles, 23 triples, 153 home runs, 763 RBI, 154 stolen bases, 761 bases on balls, .356 on-base percentage and .411 slugging percentage. He posted a .992 fielding percentage playing at first base, third base, and left and right field. In the post-season, in four National League Championship Series and three World Series covering 23 games, he batted .212 (14-for-66) with 9 runs, 1 home run and 4 RBI. Personal life Driessen married his wife, Bonnie, in 1976 and they raised three daughters. In the early 1990s the family moved from Cincinnati to Hilton Head, where Driessen owns and operates Driessen Excavating Services and helps coach the Hilton Head High School baseball team. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Baseball Hall of Fame on June 23, 2012. He is the uncle of former major-leaguer Gerald Perry.

Alejandro Rossi wrote philosophical essays, short stories and the following books: Lenguaje y significado (Language and Meaning) (Siglo XXI, 1968, FCE, 1995, 7th edition); Manual del Distra√≠do Manual of the Absent- minded (J. Mortiz, 1978, Anagrama, 1980, Monte Avila, 1987, FCE, 1992, 6th edition); Sue√±os de Occam (Occam's Dreams) (UNAM, 1982); La f√°bula de Las Regiones (the Fable of The Regions) (El Equilibrista, 1989), Ed√©n: Vida imaginada (FCE, 2006). Ortega y Gasset in collaboration (FCE, 1984); he edited Jos√© Gaos' Anthology: Filosof√≠a de la Filosof√≠a (Philosophy of Philosophy) (Cr√≠tica, 1989). Rossi won the Premio Nacional de Ling√º√≠stica y Literatura (National Literary and Linguistics Prize) in 1999. Rossi's writing is marked by a rich language that plays with generic definitions.  Independent and Collaborative Works  Rossi was co-founder and co-director of the Hispanic- American magazine Cr√≠tica (\\"Critic\\"). He was also a member of the editing board for the magazine Plural and acted as the interim director for the magazine Vuelta. In 1983, Rossi was invited to attend St. Anthony's College in University of Oxford in Great Britain. Then in 1989, Rossi edited and wrote the foreword for the anthology Jos√© Gaos: Filosof√≠a de la Filosof√≠a (\\"Jos√© Gaos: The Philosophy of Philosophy\\") (Cr√≠tica) and also collaborated with various foreign others in books like Philosophie und Rechtstheorie in Mexiko (Duncker & Humblot, Berl√≠n, 1989) and Philosophical Analysis in Latin America (Jorge J. E. Gracia et al., 1984). Some of his other well-known works include Manual del Distra√≠do (\\"Manual of the Distracted\\") (1978), La F√°bula de las Regiones (\\"The Legend of the Regions\\") (1997), and Lenguaje y significado (\\"Language and Meaning\\") (1968). On the same note, in a volume written in collaboration with other authors (FCE, 1984, 1996), Rossi paid homage to one of mainstays of his form of thought, Jos√© Ortega and Gasset. In addition to his work for Plural, Rossi also wrote supplemental articles on culture for the newspaper Exc√©lsior which, at the time, was headed by the poet Octavio Paz and under the editorship of Julio Scherer Garc√≠a. In 1976, the newspaper was subdued by members of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) led by Luis Echeverr√≠a √Ålvarez (1970-1976) -- due to the newspaper's views against his administration‚Äîleaving Rossi to follow Paz and his coworkers in founding the literary review Vuelta of which Rossi served as the interim director for a few months. From there, Rossi became part of the review's editing board until the very last day of publication. Vuelta later came to receive the Prince of Asturias Award (Spanish: Premio Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias de Comunicaci√≥n y Humanidades) in 1993.

He was the eighth of eight princes commonly associated with the War of the Eight Princes. Early career Sima Yue was the son of Sima Tai (Âè∏È¶¨Ê≥∞) the Prince of Gaomi, who was the son of Sima Yi's brother Sima Kui (Âè∏È¶¨È¶ó), making him cousin of Jin's founding emperor Emperor Wu. In 291, early in Emperor Hui's reign, he was created the Prince of Donghai. During the early parts of the War of the Eight Princes, he held a number of offices in the capital Luoyang. In early 304, when the regent Sima Ai the Prince of Changsha (Emperor Hui's brother) was battling the forces of Sima Ying the Prince of Chengdu (also Emperor Hui's brother) and Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian (grandson of Emperor Hui's great-granduncle Sima Fu the Prince of Anping), even though Sima Ai was fighting off the overwhelming force that Sima Ying and Sima Yong had, Sima Yue became convinced that a victory was impossible, and he seized Sima Ai and delivered him to Sima Yong's general Zhang Fang (ÂºµÊñπ), who executed Sima Ai cruelly by burning him to death. Sima Ying controlled the government remotely, with Sima Yue being one of the generals who stayed in Luoyang to execute Sima Ying's orders. Campaigns against Sima Ying and Sima Yong Map showing the Wars of the Eight Princes As Sima Ying continued to remotely control the government from his stronghold of Yecheng (ÈÑ¥Âüé, in modern Handan, Hebei) as both regent and crown prince, the officials in Luoyang tired of the situation. Later in 304, Sima Yue led them in a rebellion against Sima Ying's forces, and he took Emperor Hui with him on the campaign. After some initial hesitation, Sima Ying fought and defeated Sima Yue's forces, forcing Sima Yue to flee. Emperor Hui was captured and taken to Yecheng. Subsequently, however, Sima Ying was defeated by Wang Jun (ÁéãÊµö), the commander of the forces of You Province (ÂπΩÂ∑û, modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei) and fled to Luoyang without his troops. Sima Yong then seized control of the government and Emperor Hui, deposing Sima Ying from his position as crown prince and replacing him with another brother of Emperor Hui's, Sima Chi the Prince of Yuzhang. In late 304, he further had Zhang forcibly move Emperor Hui and Crown Prince Chi to Chang'an, under his firm control. Sima Yue decided to act against Sima Yong. In fall 305, he declared a rebellion with the stated intention of returning Emperor Hui to Luoyang. The warlords of the empire were forced to take sides, but eventually they generally fell into line behind Sima Yue because they were disgusted with Zhang's cruelty. The battles were initially largely indecisive, but early 306, after Sima Yue had some minor victories over Sima Yong's forces, Sima Yong panicked and killed Zhang, seeking peace with Sima Yue. Sima Yue refused, and by later that year was able to force Sima Yong to abandon both Emperor Hui and Chang'an. Sima Yue welcomed Emperor Hui back to the capital Luoyang. Early in 307, Emperor Hui was poisoned to death, and historians generally agreed that the poisoning was done at Sima Yue's orders, but the motive was unclear. Crown Prince Chi ascended to the throne as Emperor Huai. Domination over Emperor Huai Emperor Huai, in contrast with the developmentally disabled Emperor Hui, was intelligent and astute, and he sought to revive the war-ravaged empire, but Sima Yue maintained a tight grip on authority and would not allow the emperor much actual power. In spring 307, he left Luoyang and set up headquarters at Xuchang (Ë®±Êòå, in modern Xuchang, Henan), but continued to control the government remotely. Later that year, at the urging of his wife Princess Pei, he issued an order that appeared insignificant at the time but would turn out to be important later on‚Äîmaking Sima Rui the Prince of Langye be in charge of Yang Province (ÊèöÂ∑û, modern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu and Anhui), at the post of Jianye (Âª∫Ê•≠, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu); this was the post from which Sima Rui would later, after the fall of Luoyang and Chang'an to Han Zhao, claim the Jin imperial title. In 309, Sima Yue, concerned about the growing use of authority that Emperor Huai was exerting, made a sudden return to Luoyang and arrested and executed a number of Emperor Huai's associates, including Emperor Huai's uncle Wang Yan (ÁéãÂª∂). Other than privately mourning them, there was nothing that Emperor Huai could do. Sima Yue further disbanded the imperial guards and put his own personal forces in charge of protecting the emperor. For all of Sima Yue's assertion of authority, he could not stop Han Zhao, under its generals Liu Cong the Prince of Chu (the son of Han Zhao's emperor Liu Yuan, Liu Yao the Prince of Shi'an (Liu Yuan's nephew), Wang Mi (ÁéãÂΩå), and Shi Le (Áü≥Âãí), from disrupting Jin rule throughout northern and central China and gradually wearing out Jin forces and capturing Jin cities and towns. In late 309, he managed to fight off a joint attack by Liu Cong and Wang on Luoyang, but that victory was the exception to Han Zhao's inexorable advances. After Liu Yuan died in 310 and was succeeded by Liu Cong, Han Zhao renewed its attacks on the Luoyang region. Meanwhile, Sima Yue continued to alienate other generals and officials, and when Liu Kun (ÂäâÁê®), the military commander of Bing (Âπ∂Â∑û, roughly modern Shanxi) proposed to him the plan of an attack on the Han Zhao capital Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩ, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) in conjunction with the powerful Xianbei chieftain Tuoba Yilu (ÊãìÊãîÊº™Áõß) the Duke of Dai, Sima Yue was fearful of backstabbing attack by some of these warlords and therefore unable to accept Liu's plan. Indeed, when Emperor Huai and Sima Yue sent out calls for the various governors to come to Luoyang's aid later that year, there were few responses. Sima Yue became uncertain of himself, and late in 310 left Luoyang with virtually all of the central government's remaining troops, along with a large number of officials, effectively stripping Luoyang and Emperor Huai bare of their defenses, except for a small detachment commanded by Sima Yue's subordinate He Lun (‰ΩïÂÄ´), intended as much to monitor as to protect Emperor Huai. From that point on, Luoyang was left even without a police force and became largely a city abandoned to bandits and thugs. Emperor Huai soon entered into a plan with Gou Xi (ËãüÊôû), the military commander of Qing Province (ÈùíÂ∑û, modern central and eastern Shandong), who had been dissatisfied with Sima Yue, to overthrow Sima Yue's yoke. Sima Yue discovered this plan, but was unable to wage a campaign against Xun. He grew ill in his anger and distress, and died in spring 311. The generals and officials in his army, instead of returning to Luoyang, headed east toward Sima Yue's principality of Donghai (roughly modern Linyi, Shandong) to bury him there. He Lun, upon hearing about Sima Yue's death, also withdrew from Luoyang and sought to join that force. However, both were intercepted by Shi Le and wiped out. Shi, declaring that Sima Yue had caused the empire much damage, burned Sima Yue's body. Sima Yue's sons were all captured and presumably killed by Shi. Only Princess Pei fled, and after much suffering, including a stint where she was enslaved, she arrived in Jianye. Because she had persuaded Sima Yue to let Sima Rui have the Jianye post, Sima Rui was grateful to her and honored both her and Sima Yue posthumously, and allowed her to adopt his son Sima Chong (Âè∏È¶¨Ê≤ñ) to serve as Sima Yue's heir.

The first section was opened in 1882 and it operated until 1962. Although its name would imply that it terminated in Wyndham, an extension to a terminus in Glenham operated for forty years. It was operated by the New Zealand Railways Department. Construction The Main South Line from Dunedin to Invercargill was built on the west side of the Mataura River north of Edendale, thereby leaving the small east bank town of Wyndham off the route. To satisfy local residents, a 6.5 km long branch was built from Edendale to the town and it opened on 2 October 1882. A further section had been let to a contractor, but with half of the works complete, they abandoned the project. Further processes of plan review and granting of contracts meant that the branch did not reach the town of Glenham until 1 May 1890.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 114-5. There were proposals to continue the branch into the lower Mataura River area, but in August 1888, the Public Works Department stated that no further expenditure on the line was proposed once it was complete to Glenham, and the Tokanui Branch (which at the time terminated in Mokotua) was extended into the lower Mataura instead. As Glenham was now established as the terminus, a locomotive depot was established in the town. Along the route from Wyndham to Glenham, a tunnel was required, and it became the second to southernmost railway tunnel in New Zealand and thereby one of the most southern railway tunnels in the world.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 115. Stations The following stations were located on the Wyndham Branch (in brackets is the distance from the junction in Edendale):New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition, edited by John Yonge (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 30. * Menzies Ferry (3.4 km) * Wyndham Racecourse (5.2 km) * Wyndham (6.5 km) * Glenham (15.17) The tunnel between Wyndham and Glenham was approximately long. Operation Traffic on the Wyndham Branch was light from the beginning, and in its early years, it was described as being \\"in fine running trim\\". It adequately served the needs of the local community and provided access to markets before the establishment of a modern road network, but as the 20th century progressed, it began to lose money. Ford Model T bus equipment was used as the basis for two railcars in 1925, and in May 1926, the RM class Model T Ford railcars began providing a service on the line as well as on the Waikaia Branch. They were economic, consuming 18.8 litres per 100 km and capable of running at 48 km/h, a reasonable speed for rural branch lines at the time. Despite that, they did not prove sufficiently successful: problems related to rough riding and overheating made them unpopular with the public and they were discarded in 1931.David Jones, Where Railcars Roamed: The Railcars Which Have Served New Zealand Railways (Wellington: Wellington Tramway Museum, 1997), 10. A 1930 commission of New Zealand's railway network recommended that passenger traffic be discontinued on the Wyndham Branch, as well as reducing staff and closing the locomotive depot. The administration of the railways went one step further than that, closing the entire section from Wyndham to Glenham on 14 July 1930. Soon afterwards, passenger services on the rest of the line were cancelled on 9 February 1931 and goods services were modified to run from Invercargill and return rather than from the branch's terminus and return. The only passenger trains on the line after 1931 were infrequent chartered excursions, such as one from Waikaka at the end of the Waikaka Branch on 26 March 1962 that carried almost 800 passengers.\\"The Waikaka Excursion\\", Yarn 99 (May 1962). World War II provided a temporary boost in traffic and the line lost less money, but due to a lack of significant traffic, a 1952 commission recommended full closure. This did not occur for another ten years, however; the line essentially became an extended siding from Edendale's yard that was shunted by passing services on the main line. Closure was announced on 20 June 1962 and the last services ran a few months later on 9 September 1962. The branch today Remnants of old railways typically fade with time or wholly disappear, and this is true for the Wyndham Branch. Very little of the route from Edendale to Wyndham is evident, except some traces of the formation around Edendale. Traces of the formation to Glenham are clearer and include embankments and cuttings, and the tunnel is difficult to find but viewable. At some point in the 1990s, the Department of Conservation cleared access to the tunnel as part of a summer works programme, but their work has been somewhat undone by nature. In the tiny village of Glenham, the flat area of the yard remains, though it lacks any distinguishing features or railway remnants of note.

Career Watkins in 2007 Lewis' and Watkins's mutual enjoyment of rock and metal music strengthened their friendship, leading them to form a group as teenagers in 1991 called Aftermath, a thrash metal band that played in a shed in Watkins's garden. Whilst spending time in the local Ynysangharad Park, where (17 years later) Lostprophets would headline The Full Ponty festival, Watkins was introduced to future bandmate Lee Gaze through a mutual friend. Having abandoned Aftermath, which made two live appearances in its lifespan of two years, Watkins and Gaze decided to form a new band called Fleshbind, based on their American hardcore punk influences. The band played several shows, including one supporting Feeder in London, but the group was short-lived. Watkins reunited with Mike Lewis as a drummer in a hardcore band called Public Disturbance, formed in 1995. By this time, Watkins and Gaze had left Fleshbind to create their own band, Lost Prophets, who made their live debut in May 1997 alongside Public Disturbance, with Watkins as the lead vocalist. In 1998, Watkins left Public Disturbance to concentrate on the newly named lostprophets (all lower-case letters). On New Year's Eve 2008, Watkins took part in a concert for Kidney Wales Foundation and stated that his reasons for being involved were as a result of his mother needing a kidney transplant: \\"Having that direct experience is why I wanted to get more involved with Kidney Wales and organise a fundraising concert on New Year's Eve.\\" The concert featured Welsh bands the Blackout, Kids in Glass Houses, and Attack! Attack! Watkins was also featured in the Blackout's song \\"It's High Tide Baby\\", and also accompanied them on tour. In 2009, Watkins started a remixing side project called \\"L'Amour La Morgue\\". He released 17 remixes by artists such as the Killers, Beyonc√©, Young Guns, Magic Wands, Tears for Fears, and Bring Me the Horizon. He also released a free mixtape, which was available online, along with a free download of a song that was premiered at a fashion show in 2008. Lostprophets recorded five albums: The Fake Sound of Progress, Start Something, Liberation Transmission, The Betrayed, and Weapons. They toured extensively in Europe and America, playing shows such as the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2004, 2007, 2009, and 2010.  Convictions = Sexual offences  On 19 December 2012, Watkins was charged with conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a one-year-old girl and possession and/or distribution of indecent images of children and \\"extreme animal pornography\\", charges that were heard at Cardiff magistrates court. He was remanded in custody, as were his two female co-accused. His barrister said Watkins would deny the accusations. On 31 December, he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court via video link from HM Prison Parc in Bridgend, and was remanded in custody until 11 March 2013. The case was adjourned until May, with the trial date set for 15 July. At a hearing on 3 June, he denied the charges via a video link. On 6 June, it was announced that the trial would start on 25 November and was expected to last a month. A previous application for the court venue to be moved outside Wales was denied. On 26 November, Watkins pleaded guilty to attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13, but not guilty to rape. This was accepted by the prosecution. He further pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual assault involving children; six counts of taking, making, or possessing indecent images of children; and one count of possessing an extreme pornographic image involving a sex act on an animal. His victims included a baby boy, and he sent a text message to the mother of one victim that said, \\"If you belong to me, so does your baby.\\" The South Wales Police investigation into Watkins, codenamed \\"Operation Globe\\", required the co-operation of GCHQ to decrypt a hidden drive on his laptop, which was found to contain video evidence of his abuses. On 27 November, the day after his guilty plea had been accepted by the prosecution, Watkins referred to his sex offences as \\"mega lolz\\" in a recorded phone call to a female fan made from HM Prison Parc.\\"Convicted paedophile Ian Watkins told fan: 'It was mega lolz'\\", The Guardian, 18 December 2013. Retrieved 30 December 2013 A sentencing hearing was held at Cardiff on 18 December 2013. In mitigation, Watkins's barrister, Sally O'Neill QC, said that Watkins had no recollection of the case involving the attempted rape, but had \\"belatedly realised the gravity of what happened\\" after having developed an \\"obsession\\" with videoing himself having sex. Justice John Royce sentenced Watkins to 29 years in prison, with eligibility to apply for parole after serving two thirds of his prison term, followed by six years of supervised release. His two co-defendants, the mothers of his victims, respectively received sentences of 14 and 17 years' imprisonment. The judge said the case \\"plunged into new depths of depravity\\". A senior investigating officer on the case described Watkins as a \\"committed, organised paedophile\\" and \\"potentially the most dangerous sex offender\\" he had ever seen.\\"Ian Watkins could be 'most dangerous sex offender I have ever seen' ‚Äì officer\\", ''The Guardian'', 18 December 2013. Theguardian.com. Retrieved on 24 January 2016. Watkins was transferred from HM Prison Parc, where he had been incarcerated while on remand, to HM Prison Wakefield to begin serving his sentence. In order to be closer to his mother after she had a kidney transplant, he was transferred to HM Prison Long Lartin on 25 January 2014. He was subsequently transferred to HM Prison Rye Hill. On 9 October 2017, Watkins was accused of grooming a young mother from prison. As of March 2018, he was back at HMP Wakefield. = Police complaints = An Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation report published in summer 2016 said that three detectives from the South Wales force should face disciplinary action after they failed to act on earlier allegations of abuse by Watkins from 2008 onward. A further IPCC report, published in August 2017, found that police had failed a number of times from 2008 to 2012 to act on reports of Watkins's behaviour, quoting a detective who said that Watkins had \\"a number of fans and ex-girlfriends making allegations that when investigated are false\\". The report concluded: South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said his force \\"entirely accepts and regrets\\" the findings of the report.  Possession of mobile phone in prison  In March 2018, Watkins was found with a mobile phone that he had been hiding in his anus. Watkins pleaded not guilty to the offence of \\"possession of a mobile phone in a prison\\", claiming other inmates were threatening and extorting him, forcing him to hide the phone. After a five-day trial in August 2019, at Leeds Crown Court, Watkins was convicted and sentenced to an additional ten months' imprisonment.

R. Alexander, \\"One Rescuer's Obligation to Another: The 'Ogopogo' Lands in the Supreme Court of Canada,\\" The University of Toronto Law Journal, vol. 22, no. 2. (Spring, 1972), p. 110. is a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision where it was held that there is no duty at common law to rescue or aid anyone in distress. Furthermore, \\"a person who imperils himself by his carelessness may be as fully liable to a rescuer as a third person would be who imperils another.\\" Background MacLaren was the owner and captain of a boat called The Ogopogo. He invited several friends out on his boat including Mr. Matthews, Mr. Horsley, and Mr. and Mrs. Jones. During their cruise, Matthews fell overboard into the icy water which caused him to have a heart attack and die. MacLaren backed the boat up to rescue Matthews not knowing if he was alive. Horsley jumped into the water to save Matthews but he was also overcome by the cold water. Mrs. Jones then jumped in to help them both. Mr. Jones, Mrs. Jones' husband, moved the boat into a better position to rescue the three. In all, Mr. Matthews and Mr.Horsley were killed.. Opinion of the Court The Court held that \\"encouragement by the common law of the rescue of persons in danger would ... go beyond reasonable bounds if it involved liability of one rescuer to a succeeding one where the former has not been guilty of any fault which could be said to have induced a second rescue attempt.\\" The Donoghue v Stevenson case doesn't touch this principle, because it says that you have a duty to avoid causing harm, not a duty to help someone else. In the Court of Appeal for Ontario decision [1970] 2 O.R. 487, 11 D.L.R. (3d) 277, Arthur Jessup J. wrote for the court: \\"So, despite the moral outrage of the text writers, it appears presently the law that one can, with immunity, smoke a cigarette on the beach while one‚Äôs neighbour drowns and, without a word of warning watch a child or blind person walk into certain danger\\".

Development began in KRL as primarily based on multistage liquid fuel system with a planned stage of range of over 3,000km (1,864.1mi). The program was scaled down in 2004 which eventually led to its full termination. Results of the program remains classified and no production is believed to have been undertaken. Pakistan also allegedly pursued another ballistic missile called Tipu missile having range 4000 km however no information was revealed. Overview The KRL pursued the development on liquid fuel rocket system, which resulted in development of Ghauri-I and Ghauri-II. The Ghauri program owes its existence largely to the efforts of Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan who secured its funding from the Pakistan government. The Ghauri program was aggressively pursued along with the Shaheen program to reach as far as eastern region of India. As like Shaheen program, Ghauri also shrouded in secrecy where information regarding the existence of the program relied heavily on the reports of news media. Very little details were made public, Ghauri was presumed to be road mobile, being transported and launched by a transporter erector launcher. The warhead was believed to be HE/NE which was to be guided by an IGS system. In May 2004, it was rumored that the missile system would take its first test flight in June of that year.\\"Pakistan to Test-Fire Ghauri III Missile in October ‚Äî Daily,\\" BBC Monitoring International Reports, 30 August2004; in Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe, 30 August 2004, web.lexis-nexis.com However, no test occurred and speculations continued.\\"Pakistan Plans to Test-Fire Ballistic Missile on 3 June,\\" BBC Monitoring International Reports, 21 May 2004; in Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe, 21 May 2004, web.lexis-nexis.com.

Abdul Qadeer Khan's memoir published on 28 May 2011. Development on Ghauri program was completed around 50% but the funding for the program was halted in 2004. Although Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan held President Pervez Musharraf responsible for capping the program, on the other hand, the Shaheen program continued to progress well. In contrast to liquid-fuel systems that have less advantage in comparison to solid-fuel rockets. In 2015, the Shaheen-III was eventually revealed and successfully landed in Arabian sea.

Freiman Limited, or Freimans ( ), was a landmark department store at 73 Rideau Street in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, founded in 1918 by Archibald J. Freiman. Archibald Jacob Freiman was born in Lithuania in 1880, and emigrated to Hamilton, Ontario. Freimans rose to become the most successful department store in Ottawa because of its prominent location at Mosgrove and Rideau Streets, its aggressive marketing and its low prices. The company also operated stores in Westgate and St. Laurent Shopping Centres,Ward, Bruce. Ottawa 1967. The Ottawa Citizen. June 30, 2007. (retrieved July 1, 2007) as well as discount stores called Freimart in Shoppers City West and Shoppers City East. Then owned by A.J. Freiman's son, Lawrence (who wrote a book about the store), the company was acquired by Hudson's Bay Company in 1972 and rebranded to The Bay in 1973. The former Freimans store still operates as a retail store of The Bay, and an adjoining arcade linking Rideau Street to the Byward Market is named the Freiman Mall in honour of the longtime Ottawa retailer. In addition, the laneway around the north side of the nearby National Arts Centre which provides access to the box office has been named Lawrence Freiman Lane. Freimans was also the centre of an important battle against anti-semitism. In the 1930s, Ottawa police officer Jean Tissot, affiliated with Adrien Arcand's fascist movement, attempted to rally Christian Canadians to boycott Jewish businesses. Freimans, as the most prominent Jewish owned business in Ottawa was at the centre of his attacks. As a result, Freiman filed suit against Tissot, who was subsequently found guilty of criminal libel. The staunch condemnations of Tissot in the mainstream press and the utter failure of his movement to find support among the people led to a sound defeat for anti-semitism in Ottawa.

Early years and College Holloway was born to Condredge Holloway, Sr., and Dorothy Holloway. Condredge's grandfather on his father's side was born a slave, but was emancipated as a child in 1865. Dorothy was hired to work at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville in 1962, becoming the first African American employee of NASA. Surprisingly, football wasn't Holloway's favorite sport; he preferred baseball. After starring as a high school player at Lee High School in Huntsville, he was drafted as a shortstop by the Montreal Expos in 1971. Holloway was Montreal's first pick, and he was the fourth player selected overall. However, Holloway's mother, insisting her son attend college, refused to sign the contract (Condredge was 17, too young to sign a contract under Alabama law) and instead he went to Tennessee. In so doing Holloway became the first African-American to start at the quarterback position in a Southeastern Conference school. In addition to being the first black quarterback at Tennessee and in the Southeastern Conference, Holloway also was the first black baseball player in Tennessee history. The outstanding prospect bypassed a baseball career, and Holloway opted instead, for a two-sport collegiate career and went on to excel on the diamond. He garnered All-SEC and All-America honors as a shortstop in 1975 and finished with a .353 career batting average. Holloway ‚Äî still the owner of Tennessee's longest hitting streak at 27 games ‚Äî was selected to Tennessee's All-Century Baseball Team, making him the only Tennessee student- athlete named to all-century squads in both baseball and football. In his three seasons (1972‚Äì74) as a starter, Holloway directed the Vols to the 1972 Astro-Bluebonnet, 1973 Gator, and 1974 Liberty Bowls and an overall record of 25-9-2. He ended his career with the best interception-to-attempt ratio in Tennessee history, throwing just 12 interceptions in 407 collegiate attempts. During his three seasons, he completed 238 of 407 passes for 3,102 yards and 18 touchdowns, and rushed 351 times for 966 yards and nine touchdowns.Career Football Statistics , UTSports.com.

Yafforth was mentioned in the Domesday Book as a berewick in the royal manor of Northallerton. To the north of the village lies a notable mound called Howe Hill, It is a Norman motte probably built during the reign of King Stephen. Today it still stands high and retains some of its ditch and the counter scarp bank. Its position suggests that it was built to defend the River Wiske. Records suggest that it was disused by 1198. Yafforth was historically a manor in the ancient parish of Danby Wiske. Yafforth All Saints' Church was built in 1208 and extensively rebuilt in 1870. It was a chapel of ease to Danby Wiske. Yafforth also had a Methodist chapel which closed in 1966.

The battle took place along the Western Front on the outskirts of Lens in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France between 15 and 25 August 1917. The objectives of the assault were to inflict casualties and to draw German troops away from the 3rd Battle of Ypres and to make the German hold on Lens untenable. The Canadian Corps executed an operation to capture Hill 70 and then establish defensive positions from which combined small-arms and artillery fire, some of which used the new technique of predicted fire, would repel German counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible. The goals of the Canadian Corps were only partially accomplished; the Germans were prevented from transferring local divisions to the Ypres Salient but failed to draw in troops from other areas. A later attempt by the Canadian Corps to extend its position into the city of Lens failed but the German and Canadian assessments of the battle concluded that it succeeded in its attrition objective. The battle was costly for both sides and many casualties were suffered from extensive use of poison gas, including the new German Yellow Cross shell containing the blistering agent sulphur mustard (mustard gas). Background=Western front By May 1917, the Nivelle Offensive, despite the successful opening of the Battle of Arras, had come to a disastrous conclusion with the French Army mutinies. On 30 April, as the French hesitated to continue the Second Battle of the Aisne (16 April ‚Äì 9 May 1917), the commander of the British Expeditionary Force, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, gave orders to the First Army (General Henry Horne), to advance towards Lens to gain a line from M√©ricourt to Sallaumines Hill, Lens and Hill 70. Horne already desired to cut off the salient containing Lens to shorten the front, while unwilling to risk a costly and slow frontal assault into the maze of ruins. The First Army was understrength after the Battle of Arras but since Operation Alberich, the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line, in March, there was some hope that the 6th Army (General Otto von Below) could be manoeuvred out of Lens by gradual advances to capture the higher ground to the south, west and north of the city. On 7 May, Haig informed the British army commanders that the French had terminated the Nivelle Offensive and the strategy of returning to a war of manoeuvre. Operations to exhaust the powers of resistance of the German armies would resume by systematic surprise attacks and when this was complete, the British would begin an offensive at Ypres to capture the Belgian coast and reach the frontier with the Netherlands. The objectives of the First Army were unchanged but instead of capturing ground around Lens to shorten the front, the intention was to menace the German hold on Lens and the defences south of Lille, to distract, divert and weaken the defenders. The operations were not a diversion but a means to keep the First Army front active for as long as possible, to mislead the Germans as to British intentions in Flanders. On 8 May, Horne told the corps commanders that Lens \\"An Impression of Lens, France, Seen from an Aeroplane- the Anglo- german (sic) Front Line, 1918\\" (oil on canvass, Richard Carline Art.IWMART2661) From Vimy Ridge the ground declines about into the Douai Plain; the valley of the Souchez river is about wide and flows south-west to north-east through the south of the city of Lens. In 1914, the river had several road and rail bridges. By 1917, much of the city was derelict due to years of artillery bombardments, the ruins being natural strongpoints overlooked by (slag heaps) and several hills, including Hill 70, Hill 65 and Sallaumines Hill forming a shallow, saucer-shaped depression in which the city lay. To the south-east, on terrain that is above sea level, Sallaumines Hill rises to . On the west side of Lens is Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill) north of the Souchez, which is steep-sided and gives a fine view of the city. To the north- west, on the east side of the Lens‚ÄìBethune road, is a hill about high with the suburb of Cit√© St Pierre on top. Hill 70 is north of the city and has a flat top, giving a fine view of the city and the ground to the north and east. The hill slopes gently towards Lens and there is a shallow depression between it and Cit√© St Pierre. The slopes of Hill 70 towards Cit√© St Auguste are steeper. Lens, Hill 70, Sallaumines and Sallaumines Hill to the south-east and their commanding views over the area and the city, fell under German control in October 1914, during the Race to the Sea. In September 1915, the British overran the hill during the Battle of Loos but it was recaptured by the Germans. Local operations British defences of Hill 70, Vimy Ridge and Arras previous to March 1918 [enlargeable] (5003772) Horne began to make plans for the capture of Lens during the Third Battle of the Scarpe (3‚Äì4 May). Horne wanted the Canadian Corps to continue its operations east of Vimy Ridge to capture M√©ricourt and La Coulotte, which would endanger the German defences of Sallaumines Hill, south-east of Lens, as I Corps (Lieutenant-General Arthur Holland) north of the Souchez, with twelve tanks, captured Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill) and Hill 70. The attacks would envelop Lens on three sides and give forward observation officers (FOO) sight of the German defences in the city, potentially to force the 6th Army to retire without the need for a frontal attack. In May, Holland had surveyed the I Corps front, noted that the tactical value of Hill 70 and that it would be inevitable that the Germans would make great efforts to re-capture the hill. German counter-attacks could only be resisted if plenty of reserves and much artillery support were made available. Deliberate attacks to capture the high ground around Lens would meet the goals of the First Army despite its limited means. In May and early June, First Army units conducted eighteen raids and minor actions, moving the front line slowly eastwards over the Douai Plain. By 6 June, the First Army had captured all the high ground in the area, except that around Lens. I Corps was west of the city from the Souchez north to Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill), through and along the ridge of the 70-metre hill to the north of Cit√© St Pierre. On 9 June, the commander of the Canadian Corps, Lieutenant-General Julian Byng was promoted and assumed command the Third Army. Arthur Currie, the 1st Canadian Division commander, was promoted in his place. On 10 June, Holland told Horne that only the capture of Hill 70 was important and suggested inflicting mass casualties by raids, bombardments and gas attacks, to create the impression that a big attack was imminent. The defenders would be subjected to anxiety and have to move more troops and artillery to the hill, despite the inevitable losses. Horne doubted that the army had sufficient men and artillery for the task and arranged for the 46th (North Midland) Division, on the right of I Corps, to make preparations to take Hill 70 and the vicinity but only if reinforcements from GHQ were forthcoming. While waiting, I Corps would capture Hill 65 and south of the Souchez, XIII Corps and the right hand divisions of the Canadian Corps would prepare to attack from Gavrelle to Oppy, Fresnoy, Acheville and Mƒóricourt, digging jumping-off trenches to simulate a threat to Lens from the south. The real attack was to come from the left flank of the Canadian Corps towards Sallaumines Hill and the east end of Avion. Success would trap the Germans in Lens between Sallaumines Hill to the south and Hill 70 to the north. If the 6th Army did not retire, the preparations by I Corps at Hill 70 would make it impossible to predict from which direction the next attack would come. =Affairs south of the Souchez= Diagram of the Souchez River and associated canal system To create a threat to Lens, Horne intended that XIII Corps on the southern flank would attack to reach better positions between the villages of Gavrelle and Oppy by advancing the front line for on a front. The 4th Canadian Division on the left flank of the Canadian Corps south of the Souchez River (a tributary of the De√ªle) and the 46th (North Midland) Division on the right of I Corps, north of the river, were to attack on a front of to eliminate a German salient from Avion to the west end of Lens and to occupy Hill 65 (Reservoir Hill). I Corps was to plan for an attack on Hill 70 with the 6th Division on the left (northern) flank. Horne expected that the operations would take place in early July but found that many of the best heavy guns were to be sent to Flanders and brought forward the date to 28 June. The plans were made less ambitious; the XIII Corps scheme was retained but the attack either side of the Souchez was reduced to the capture the German front line west of Avion and Hill 65; the Hill 70 plan was postponed. 28 June was dull, humid and storm clouds appeared in the south over the afternoon. The First Army artillery, assisted by Third Army guns en route to Flanders, began a bombardment along the army front from Gavrelle to Hulluch. The simulation of a much bigger attack on Lens was enhanced by lightning, thunder and a downpour, which began at when the infantry advance began. The adjacent brigades of the 31st and 5th divisions had been bombarded in their jumping-off trenches at and suffered 200 casualties before the advance began. The survivors moved so fast that when a German counter-barrage fell on no man's land three minutes later, the British were on the far side and unharmed. The attackers suffered few casualties, took and counted German soldiers. Gavrelle Mill and a new line was consolidated, despite the rainstorm, from which the areas to the north-east and east around Neuvireuil and Fresnes could be observed, along with Greenland Hill to the south-west. =Capture of Avion= Map of Avion, Sallaumines and vicinity (commune FR insee code 62065) Orders from the First Army HQ reached Currie on 12 June, who replied with a suggestion that the capture of Hill 65 was tactically desirable to gain observation over Lens and to deprive the Germans of reciprocal observation of the British rear. The capture of Avion could be replaced by a raid, to avoid the casualties of a permanent occupation. Preparations for offensive operations towards Avion would be more meaningful to German observers than the attack which followed. The suggested alternative was not well received by Major-general W. H. Anderson, the First Army chief of staff, because one purpose of the operation was to threaten Lille, which could only occur with the capture of Lens, after the attack on Avion. The Canadian operation was only a stage in the plan, to be followed by an attack or decoy towards Sallaumines Hill. A few days later more artillery was transferred to Flanders, which led to the postponement of the Hill 70 attack. Further north, opposite the 4th Canadian and 46th (North Midland) divisions, the German 56th Division had on 22 June, moved into reserve to substitute for a division transferred to Flanders. The division holding the line had orders to retire from the salient to the Avion‚ÄìLens railway if pressed. The western slopes of Hill 65 had been occupied on 24 June after a German retirement and patrols pushed forward towards Avion Trench, which was taken early on 28 June. The divisions made ready to resume the advance when the army barrage began at Most of Avion, √âleu-dit-Leauwette and the eastern slope of Hill 65 was captured, as the 3rd Canadian Division formed a defensive flank along the Arleux‚ÄìAvion road, joining with the 4th Canadian Division in Avion. Rain and the flooding from the Souchez stopped patrols from probing the German main line of resistance in the north-eastern part of Avion and along a railway embankment about further on. Prelude=First Army Location of Lens The Canadian Corps (Lieutenant-General Arthur Currie) had the 1st, 2nd and 4th Canadian divisions for the attack and the 3rd Canadian Division in reserve. Artillery planning was delegated to Major Alan Brooke who had 240 18-pounder field guns and 78 4.5-inch howitzers of the Canadian Corps field artillery, 31 of the 18-pounders being unusable due to barrel-wear. I Corps contributed twelve more 18-pounders and XIII Corps eighteen. Brooke also had 38 batteries of heavy siege howitzers consisting of twenty 9.2-inch howitzers, twenty 8-inch howitzers, eighty 6-inch howitzers, 42 60-pounder guns and two 6-inch guns. The British contributed 28 batteries but approximately 25 per cent of the heavy artillery for the operation was of dubious value due to barrel wear. Twenty batteries were in three Heavy Artillery Groups (HAGs) for destructive bombardment, and 18 batteries in three HAGs for counter-battery-fire, four British and two Canadian. 6th Army The 6th Army was responsible for the defence of the area between Lille and Cambrai, Lens being about halfway between. The town was an important railway junction and after the Battle of Arras, earlier in 1917, had become a salient in the German defences. Hill 70 and the vicinity was held by the 7th Division, part of , the headquarters of IV Corps. (The German army had begun to use corps headquarters as territorial command units, rather than of a permanent complement of divisions, during the Battle of the Somme.) Lens was garrisoned by the 11th Reserve Division in (VI Corps). In anticipation of an attack, Army Group Crown prince Rupprecht had moved the 4th Guard Division and the 220th Division into the 6th Army area in reserve. The divisions in reserve rehearsed reinforcement and counter-attacks with the two front divisions, Below having written of an expected Canadian () attack on 15 July. Plan On 7 July, due to a lack of artillery, Currie was ordered to take over more of the line to the north and to attack the objectives west of Lens not taken by the 46th (North Midland) Division from 29 June and 2 July. In the south the Canadian Corps was to attack beyond Avion to a railway embankment, ready to advance to Sallaumines Hill. Soon afterwards, GHQ announced that more artillery would be forthcoming and Horne met the corps commanders again on 10 July; Currie wanted to make the main effort north of the Souchez, the Canadian Corps taking responsibility for the front from Avion to Hill 70. Horne agreed and on 11 July, Currie issued the first orders for the attack. The Canadian plan for 30 July used the I Corps plan for the abortive June attack as a basis; the scheduled attack to the embankment east of Avion was to go ahead, to obtain a good jumping off point for a later advance on Sallaumines Hill to mislead the defenders about preparations for an attack. From 11 to 19 July, Canadian Corps intelligence discovered that German dispositions had changed. A new third defensive line had been completed along the northern outskirts of the city, from Cinnabar Trench along Nun's Alley, Norman Trench, Hugo Trench to Bois Hugo, beyond the objectives given to Currie on 10 July. The position had three thick belts of barbed wire, a light railway for supply and eleven strongpoints with fields of fire into Commotion Trench, the final Canadian objective. The new position was judged to have become the main German defence line. Hill 70 overlooked Lens and the Douai plain and Currie believed that the Germans would commit troops that they could ill- afford to lose, to regain a position that they dared not leave in Canadian possession. Artillery observers on the hill could defeat German counter- attacks with accurate artillery-fire. The hill was to be occupied quickly and strongpoint defensive positions were to be established around the allocated to each brigade. A combination of small-arms and artillery firepower would defeat German counter-attacks and inflict as many casualties as possible. The 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions were to attack on a front of to a depth of and capture the main enemy defensive positions on the eastern (reverse) slope of Hill 70. In the first stage, the first objective of the attackers was the German front- line, the second objective (blue line) was the German second position on the crest of the hill and the third objective (green line) was the German third line, on the far slope, about from the start line. The 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Division would attack north of Hill 70 and its 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade would attack the summit. The 4th and 5th Canadian Infantry Brigades of the 2nd Canadian Division would attack the ruins of suburbs , and directly south of the hill. By 16 July, the 1st Canadian Division infantry had transferred from the south-west of Lens to the north- western fringe of Hill 70. On 22 July, the divisional artillery arrived and by 25 July was in position from the south of Li√©vin to Bully-Grenay, among mine workings, slag heaps and ruined villages, many next to light rail lines, the Canadians having inherited the preliminary work done by I Corps. Wire cutting had been going on since 11 July but there was no time for the fifteen-day preliminary bombardment laid down in the artillery plan of 11 July. On 26 July the last orders were issued and a document \\"Canadian Corps Scheme of Operations\\" by the Brigadier-General, General Staff (BGGS), Percy Radcliffe set 30 July as the date of the attack, to coincide with the Flanders Offensive. Heavy rains reduced the area to a swamp, grounded the RFC, which provided information on the progress of the bombardment, some guns were late arriving and others had too many defects to use for wire-cutting. The attack was postponed and despite the mediocre state of many of the guns, the bombardment continued into August and several creeping barrages were fired to provoke German counter-barrages and reveal German gun positions. The 15th, 50th and 2nd Canadian Heavy Artillery Group bombarded German gun positions revealed by aerial photographs, flash spotting and sound ranging, neutralization being more effective than destruction. =Artillery= For the eighteen-pounders and forty-eight were to fire a creeping barrage; the 1st Canadian Division front eighteen-pounders from the 1st and 3rd Canadian divisional artilleries and thirty field guns from the British, the 14th Army Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (RFA), six from the 53rd Battery and six from the 112th Battery. The 2nd Canadian Division had its eighteen-pounders and another eighteen-pounders of the 46th (North Midland) divisional artillery, twelve 18-pounders of the 179th Army Field Brigade and another the 120th, 165th and 317th batteries. All of the 4.5-inch howitzers were from the 2nd Canadian divisional artillery, making sixty Canadian and guns. The attack had guns and howitzers, with guns and howitzers, with shells, and more than artillery rounds. The Canadian Corps Heavy Artillery HQ had the 63rd, 64th Heavy Artillery Groups HAG) with eight siege batteries each and the Canadian Heavy Artillery Group with five, for wire-cutting and trench destruction. Barrel wear and general unreliability meant that about half of the 18-pounders could not be used in the preliminary bombardment. eighteen-pounders were to fire the first layer of the creeping barrage, with the infantry advancing about behind. To make it harder for the German artillery to bombard the infantry by following the creeping barrage, the rest of the 18-pounders and some 4.5-inch howitzers were to fire a barrage further forward; 6-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers were to fire beyond the second barrage line. The 15th, 50th and 2nd Canadian Heavy Artillery Group had pieces, from 60-pounder guns to 9.2-inch howitzers and four super heavy 12-inch gun and one 15-inch howitzer. The 12-inch guns had the ammunition for eighty rounds-per-day-per-gun for fifteen days. High explosive, gas and shrapnel shells were to be fired at German gun positions revealed by RFC reconnaissance photographs and the flash- spotters and sound rangers, to kill gunners and supply horses. One report had the 6th Army artillery in nine groups of half of them field guns and half of them heavy. On the eve of the attack, the counter-batteries claimed that forty of 102 German guns had been knocked out. Many of the field guns were beyond the range of Hill 70 but I Corps on the northern (left) flank and XIII Corps on the southern (right) flank were to induce German guns to reply to harassing fire. The counter-batteries were also to be used to destroy German counter- attacks and soon after zero hour, guns from the bombardment HAGs were to join in with the counter-battery HAGs against German infantry counter-attacks. Forward Observation Observers were to accompany the Canadian infantry and establish observation posts connected to the rear with telephones, wireless and visual signalling equipment to direct the artillery. =Gas= By 1917, gas was delivered by shell, the substances being classed as lethal, harassing and persistent; lethal types were chlorine, phosgene and diphosgene, the phosgene types having little colour or smell. Harassing gases were non-lethal and included tear gas to compel the opponents to wear their gas masks. Catching troops not wearing gas masks with a lethal concentration of gas was difficult but phosgene bombardments could cause casualties, slow the completion of tasks and tire the victims. The Canadians collected 4.5-inch and 60-pounder gas shells for the operation. Before the attack, the Royal Engineers bombarded the German defences with () of gas fired from Livens Projectors. Two prisoners of Infantry Regiment 156 said that their companies of eighty men and 56 men had suffered twenty and 29 gas casualties. A prisoner from Infantry Regiment 22 said that two companies had suffered 90 gas casualties. =Machine-guns= Example of a Vickers gun in action Sixteen companies from the Canadian Machine Gun Corps with 128 Vickers machine guns and the armoured cars of the Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade (CMMGB) with 32 guns, under the command of the divisions were to supplement the artillery by firing a barrage over the heads of the Canadian infantry. The harassing machine-gun fire was to impede the movement of German troops and supplies, with targets engaged by at least four guns. The Vickers guns were supplied with 20,000 bullets per gun per day, to fire day and night, to make it more difficult for German troops to repair their defences and put out more barbed wire. The cars of the CMMGB drove back and forth behind Canadian lines and from mid-July to early August fired including the static guns about ten million rounds were fired before the Canadian attack. When the hill was captured, guns were to be dug in, one for every of front, guarded but several infantry sections. =Royal Flying Corps= The Canadian Corps had 16 Squadron (BE2cs), 40 Squadron (Nieuport 17s) and 43 Squadron (Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutters) RFC in support and the Sopwith Camels of 8 (Naval) Squadron, Royal Naval Air Service for high patrols over the battlefield. An advanced landing ground at Petit Sains was made ready for 43 Squadron Strutters to mount continuous, counter-attack reconnaissance patrols. Formations of three Strutters were to observe an area wide and deep, that counter-attacking German troops would have to traverse. The Strutter crews were to report their observations by wireless to the Canadian Corps and Heavy Artillery Group headquarters, then attack with their machine-guns any German artillery or concentrations of troops seen at bottlenecks. Contact patrols to mark the progress of the Canadian infantry were to be flown by the B.E.2c crews of 16 Squadron. On 9 August, six 40 Squadron Nieuport 17s made a low-level attack on the six German observation balloons along the Hill 70‚ÄìLens front and shot them down. German artillery observation was obstructed but the attack made the Canadian interest in the area obvious. For the two days and nights before the attack, 10 Squadron, 25 Squadron (DH.4) and 27 Squadron (Martinsyde Elephant) bombed railway junctions, airfields and billets. In earlier battles, British fighters patrolling at height to engage German fighters had not been able to see low-flying, camouflaged German aircraft, which flew artillery-observation and ground attack sorties without interference. Six Nieuport 17s of 40 Squadron moved to an advanced landing ground at Mazingarbe, about behind the front and a ground station was established on the heights west of Loos. When observers spotted a German aircraft at low altitude, a wireless message was sent to Mazingarbe for a Nieuport 17 to be sent up to engage the German aircraft. A letter-code on white canvas sheets containing the location of German aircraft could be laid on the ground for an airborne fighter pilot to read. =Deception operations= Artillery map of the Lens area, marking locations to bombard with harassing fire By 16 July, the Canadian Corps had redeployed for the attack on Hill 70; the 1st Canadian Division had taken over from I Corps to the north-west of the hill, and the Canadian Corps occupied a line from the Souchez River northwards to just beyond Hill 70. To deceive the Germans about the place and size of the attack and to disguise Canadian preparations, the XIII, Canadian, I and XI, corps began to conduct larger raids in battalion strength, on most nights from the middle of July, along with gas discharges along the front. Towards the end of the month, raids and bombardments on the army front increased, XI Corps to the north raided nightly, I Corps conducted destructive and wire-cutting bombardments at night and bombarded the German front with machine-guns and mortars during the day; XIII Corps conducted similar operations on the right (southern) army flank. In late July, the 9th Canadian Brigade feinted a direct attack of Lens by engaging units of the German 36th Reserve Division at M√©ricourt Trench. Bad weather led to the attack on Hill 70 being postponed from late July until mid- August. In the interim, special companies of the Royal Engineers augmented the regular level of bombardment by firing drums from Livens projectors and shells into Lens by 15 August. The artillery neutralized of an estimated batteries in the area by zero hour, partly using the technique of predicted fire using datum points and calibrated guns for the first time, which greatly improved the accuracy of the artillery. Troops were rotated through the reserve area to conduct training and rehearsals in preparation for the assault. On the northern (left) flank, the 46th (North Midland) Division made a diversionary attack north of the hill, with poison gas discharges, artillery bombardments and the preparation of dummy tanks and troops on the two nights before the attack to be exposed to view at zero hour. Battle=15 August A ruined house west of Lens, used to shelter water tanks During the night of the Canadian infantry assembled in their jumping-off points; harassing fire from German artillery continued but with no particular intensity. The Germans had moved up reserves on the previous night in anticipation of an attack and the main assembly of Canadian troops was detected by At the Canadian creeping barrage began and the infantry advanced, some troops having left their trenches early to avoid the German counter-barrage expected as soon as the attack began. At Special Companies RE fired of oil from Livens projectors, which dropped into the German defences in Cit√© St √âlisabeth, creating a smoke- screen and began an hour-long smoke bombardment from 4-inch Stokes mortars. Artillery Forward Observation Officers moved forward with the infantry and artillery-observation aircraft flew overhead sending for artillery fire by wireless that day. In the 1st Canadian Division area, 4 Special Company RE fired mortars and Livens projectors against the left flank of the attack, as a deception and to shield the attack front from observers on higher ground several miles to the north. On the right (southern) flank in the 4th Canadian Division area, a Special Company used Livens projectors to fire cylinders into German positions around Avion. After four minutes, the creeping barrage began to move in increments, keeping about 25 per cent of the ground to be crossed under bombardment. Vickers gunners fired a machine-gun barrage at maximum range then gradually fired shorter towards the German positions. The Canadian infantry reached the blue line, forward in twenty minutes and paused to dig in. The advance began again and reached the final objective (red line) at German resistance was determined and the Canadians used Lewis guns to pin down the German infantry as rifle and bombing sections attacked from a flank. On the southern (right) flank, the 4th Canadian Division diversion succeeded and with fewer guns in support, the German artillery reply was more effective than further north. The 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade anticipated the German artillery bombardment and the Canadians took cover in deep shelters in the edge of Lens, the brigade suffering fewer than 24 casualties during the first day. The four attacking Canadian brigades began to consolidate as soon as they reached their objectives and each brigade emplaced 48 Vickers guns in its section of the blue line. Connexions to the artillery were established by observers with field telephones, wireless and signal lamps and the artillery changed from bombardment and creeping barrage fire to be ready to fire SOS barrages against German counter-attacks. At about the 4th Guard Division began the first German attack, having been seen assembling in Cit√© St Auguste. The Germans had to move over about of open ground and the Canadian gun-, machine- gun and rifle fire covered the ground with corpses and wounded. An attack at met the same fate, the few Germans reaching the Canadians being bombed out. German counter-attacks continued and the German artillery still in action tried to support the attacks and shell the Canadian defences. A counter-attack at was prepared by German heavy artillery, which cut many of the field telephone links to the Canadian artillery but some remained operational and several runners got through with messages. The 2nd Canadian Division artillery received the message \\"Please turn Artillery on.\\" and did, repulsing the attack; the Canadian gunners did the same to another German attempt at Canadian machine-gunners fired all day, seven guns of the 3rd Canadian Machine Gun Company firing in a few minutes. Air operations The Sopwith Strutters of 43 Squadron received many hits from ground fire but only two were shot down, three crew being wounded; a German aircraft was shot down and others driven off but four more Sopwith Strutters were too badly damaged to be serviceable for 16 August. One Sopwith attacked troops in Drocourt Trench, another aircraft attacked a transport column near Fouqui√®res, then troops near Annay and in . About infantry behind , north of Lens, were strafed, then the information was reported from Mazingarbe to the Canadian Corps heavy artillery, which dispersed the German troops. While flying artillery- observation sorties in the afternoon, 16 Squadron aircrew saw four waves of German infantry advancing in the open to counter-attack. The crews called on the Canadian heavy artillery and then attacked with their machine-guns, which \\"all but annihilated\\" the German force. From 15 to 17 August, the RFC sent of German artillery in action and all were answered by the counter-battery groups. Counter-attacks To prepare for German counter-attacks, the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions began to reverse captured trenches and construct strong points immediately after capturing the blue line. Within two hours of the start of the battle, the Germans began using their immediate reserves to mount local counter-attacks (). Between on the morning of 15 August, the Germans executed four local attacks against Canadian positions. Each attack was repulsed due in large part to the work of forward artillery observers, who could now overlook some of the German positions. On one occasion, a German counter-attack was only repulsed after engaging in hand-to-hand fighting. The Germans rapidly brought up seven additional battalions from the 4th Guards Division and 185th Division to reinforce the eight line battalions. Over the following three days, the Germans counter-attacked 21 times against Canadian positions. A frontal attack against the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade on the afternoon of 15 August ultimately failed. A German attack against the 4th Canadian Infantry Brigade re-captured Chicory Trench but the German infantry were expelled later that afternoon. 16‚Äì17 August German flamethrower teams temporarily breached the Canadian line. The morning of 16 August was relatively quiet, with only a few attempts made by small German parties to approach the Canadian lines. After having failed to capture all their objectives the previous day and after several postponements, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade relieved the two attacking battalions with the 5th and 10th Canadian battalions, which attacked by short dashes for down the bare slope and captured the remainder of the final objective. The attack was costly as the Germans opposite were preparing their own counter-attack and hand-to-hand fighting took place at the chalk quarry, which cost the Germans 100 fatal casualties, 100 wounded and thirty prisoners. The Germans began to counter- attack at after a delay but good observation enabled the attacks to be repulsed by massed artillery-, machine-gun and rifle-fire. To the south, the 5th Canadian Battalion retired from the final objective for about to shell- holes, after suffering many casualties and running short of ammunition. The brigade suffered casualties of killed, wounded and missing. Attempts by the 4th and 11th Canadian Infantry Brigades to eliminate a German salient between Cit√© St √âlisabeth and Lens on 17 August failed and as had been foreseen, the Germans continued to mount determined counter-attacks. The German commanders realized that the Canadian and British artillery would need to be neutralized before a counter-attack could succeed. The Germans began a series of counter- attacks against a chalk quarry under Canadian control outside Cit√© St. Auguste and tried to mislead the Canadian artillery by sending up false flare signals or provoking the infantry to call for unnecessary artillery fire. The Germans stopped wave attacks and counter-attacked with dispersed groups of troops trickling forward using cover; some managed to reach the Canadian defences and fight hand-to-hand. The Germans began to use poison gas in earnest and from 15,000 to 20,000 of the new Yellow Cross shells, containing the blistering agent sulphur mustard, were fired in addition to Green Cross (diphosgene) shells. The positions of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Artillery Field Brigades and the Canadian front line were gassed. The 1st Canadian Division artillery suffered 183 casualties and three batteries suffered direct hits. Many gunners became casualties after gas fogged the goggles of their respirators and they were forced to remove them to set fuses, lay their sights and maintain accurate fire. 17/18 August On the night of German troops made several attempts to recapture the chalk quarry and Chicory Trench under the cover of gas. All attempts against the chalk quarry failed and only one company of the Reserve Infantry Regiment 55 (on loan to the 11th Reserve Division) managed to breach the Canadian defences at Chicory Trench before being repulsed. German troops employing flamethrowers managed to penetrate the Canadian line north of the quarry on the morning of 18 August before being driven out. 19‚Äì20 August David Milne ‚Äì \\"Loos from the Trenches on Hill 70\\" The front quietened significantly after the final counter-attack against the chalk quarry. For the Canadian Corps, the following two days consisted largely of consolidation. The front line was drawn back , midway between the original intermediate and final objectives. The 4th Canadian Division slightly advanced its forward posts on the outskirts of Lens and extended its front northward to include the Lens‚ÄìB√©thune road. Currie wished to further improve the position around Hill 70 and ordered an attack against German positions along a front, opposite the 2nd and 4th Canadian Divisions. 21‚Äì22 August (Attack on Lens) The operation was scheduled for the morning of 21 August, the tasks being divided between the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade on the left and the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade on the right. The attack was to begin at but the Germans began shelling the Canadian positions at Just before the Canadian attack, the left flank of the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade was attacked by units of the 4th Guard Division and a battalion of the 220th Division. The forces met between their objectives and fought hand-to-hand and with the bayonet; in the the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade advance was stopped and the troops forced back to their start line. Communication between the forward units and brigade headquarters had broken down at the beginning of the attack and could not be restored due to the German bombardment, making it all but impossible to co-ordinate the infantry and artillery. On the right flank, a battalion of the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered many casualties to the German artillery while assembling for the attack and was met with massed artillery and machine-gun fire, near its objective. Only three small parties, the largest of not more than twenty men, reached their goal. The other two attacking units captured their objectives late in the evening, creating a salient in the 4th Canadian Division line. On the evening of 21 August, three parties went forward to bomb the German position from the flanks but were only moderately successful and an attack on 22 August failed to materialize, due to battalion-level misunderstandings. A brigade reserve unit was ordered to remedy the situation by attacking the Green Crassier slagheap and the mine complex at Fosse St Louis. The attack was repulsed, most of the attackers being killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The Germans held on to the area until the beginning of the final German retreat in 1918. Aftermath=Analysis Corporal Filip Konowal, the only Ukrainian Victoria Cross recipient On 15 August, Haig made a diary note that the attack had gone \\"very well\\"; Horne called it \\"an unqualified success\\", despite the failure of the 6th Army to retreat and began to plan an attack on Sallaumines Hill for early September. In 1942, the writers of , the German official history (volume XIII), wrote that since mid-July, the German defences at Lens and for about to the north had been under bombardment, which became more intense in August because Haig wanted a diversion from the offensive in Flanders. On 15 August, the Canadian Corps attacked the German positions from Lens to about north, took an important height [Hill 70] for observation and pushed beyond the First Position (). Counter-attacks recaptured pockets of ground but the Canadians could not be expelled from . Fighting continued intermittently until 24 August but did not lead to more significant changes. The Canadians took over and in their counter-attacks the Germans over prisoners. In 1981, Sydney Wise, author of the Royal Canadian Air Force official history, called the attack at Hill 70 \\"a demonstration of how a set-piece attack should be carried out\\". The Germans refrained from attempts to recapture the lost ground at Lens, due to the need to avoid diverting resources from the Third Battle of Ypres in Flanders, the main strategic effort on the Western Front by both sides. In 2009, Tim Cook wrote that the Canadian attack had crushed the defenders by 18 August, 21 German counter-attacks being repulsed. The Canadian plan had succeeded but had depended on the determination of the Canadian infantry against equally determined opponents, who suffered approximately against The attack ended on 25 August and was a considerable victory despite the Germans retaining their hold on occupation of Lens. Two German divisions intended for Flanders had been diverted to Hill 70 and the reinforcement plan for the fighting at Ypres had been dislocated. Cook called the battle the most one-sided German defeat apart from the Battle of Messines in June. The attacks into Lens had been \\"clumsy, hurried affairs\\" and that the Canadians suffered nearly from 21 to 25 August. The frontal attacks on 21 and 23 August were rash and demonstrated that Currie lacked experience; Cook placed blame on Watson and Hilliam, the latter of whom should have been sacked. In 2016, Robert Foley wrote that Army Group Crown Prince Rupprecht and the 6th Army headquarters thought that the Canadian advance had been stopped by 16 August. Below wrote in his diary that more than ten attacks by the Canadians, \\"the best English (sic) troops\\", had been repulsed. The Canadian attack had been stopped because the \\"English\\" lacked the flexibility to exploit success, a criticism that had emerged during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The Canadian attack was seen as a feint to divert German divisions from Flanders and the army group ordered the 6th Army to fight with its own resources, including the seven divisions in army reserve. The 4th Guard and the 220th divisions acted as on 15 August and with the existing divisions, conducted most of the German defence. Once the German counter-attack in 15 August had failed, the attempt to recapture Hill 70 was abandoned and counter-attacks were restricted local efforts to repulse Canadian attacks and for tactical improvements to the German defences. Two divisions were moved from reserve to replace the 4th Guard and the 220th divisions, three more divisions in reserve remaining available to the 6th Army. No forces were transferred to Lens from Flanders or anywhere else and no divisions were sent to Flanders from 15 to 25 August. Foley wrote that the 1st Guard Reserve Division had been included in some accounts but that neither Below or other German sources from the time refer to it; Foley also wrote that Canadian sources mention the 185th Division in interrogation reports. In 2017, Andrew Rawson wrote that the Canadian attack prevented the Germans from transferring five divisions in the Lens area to Flanders. Casualties Around 22 August, the First Army intelligence department estimated that the Germans had suffered casualties. In the History of the Great War (1948), the British official historian, James Edmonds wrote that from 15 to 23 August, the 1st Canadian Division suffered , The Second Canadian Division suffered being killed and the 4th Canadian Division had including Corps troops and other troops attached to the 1st Canadian Division suffered a total of troops were taken prisoner. In the Canadian Official History (1962), G. W. L. Nicholson wrote that the Canadians and attached troops suffered In Surviving Trench Warfare (1992) Bill Rawling wrote that the attack on Hill 70 cost the Canadian Corps and prisoner. In the subsequent attacks into Lens, the Canadian Corps suffered another increasing the number to in eleven days. In 2009, Tim Cook wrote that the Canadians suffered during the preparations for the attack in the first two weeks of August and from 15 to 25 August, Hill 70 and another on the Western Front. The Canadians had suffered nearly their casualties from 21 to 25 August. In Capturing Hill 70 (2016, eds. Douglas Delaney and Serge Durflinger) Delaney wrote that Tim Cook had remedied a mistake in the Canadian official history which gave Canadian Corps casualties for August rather than for the period 15 to 25 August. In 2016, Robert Foley wrote that German casualties were difficult to measure, the German official history (Der Weltkrieg) volume noting that complete records did not exist. The 7th Division suffered about before being withdrawn on 17 August, the 4th Guard Division about 15 to 21 August and that the 220th Division also suffered many casualties, Reserve Infantry Regiment 99 losing in four days. Foley estimated that the Germans suffered casualties; Delaney and Durflinger wrote that the lower estimates of German casualties were higher than those of the attackers, an unusual occurrence in the war. Subsequent operations From the rest of August to the beginning of October the front was relatively quiet, with Canadian efforts devoted mainly to preparations for another offensive, although none took place, largely because the First Army lacked sufficient resources for the task. The Canadian Corps was transferred to the Ypres sector in early October in preparation for the Second Battle of Passchendaele. Soon after the battle, Below was transferred to the Italian front, where he took command of the new Austro-German 14th Army. In this capacity, he executed an extremely successful offensive at the Battle of Caporetto in October 1917. Ferdinand von Quast took over command of the 6th Army until the end of the war.

The village is situated about three miles north-east of Thirsk. The population of the civil parish was estimated at 100 in 2014. In the 2011 census the population of Felixkirk was included with Upsall, Thornbrough and North Kilvington parishes and not counted separately. History The village is named after the local church, which is dedicated to St Felix. St Felix, a Burgundian, travelled with St Paulinus converting the Saxons in England in the seventh century. It may have not been known by its current name at the time of the Norman invasion as it does not appear in this form in the Domesday Book of 1086. Instead it is known as Fridebi with the manor lands shared between Gamal, son of Kalri and Ligulf. The lands passing after the invasion to Hugh, son of Baldric, who made Gerard of Boltby, lord of the manor. There are competing etymologies for the old name of Fridebi. It is recorded in some texts as being the same as the old place name of Firby near Snape Castle in Bedale, and which means Peaceful Place from the Danish word for peace which is fred. Alternatively it has been recorded as Freda's dwelling along the same naming convention for hamlets with Danish influences at that time. Freda as a personal name in Danish, would also mean Peace The nearby hill, Mount St John, was the location of a preceptory of the Order of St John of Jerusalem built in the 11th century. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the preceptory buildings were handed to the Archbishop of York. In 1720 the buildings were pulled down and a new manor house built. Still known as Mount St John, it is a grade II* listed building. Governance The village is within the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency. It lies within the Whitestonecliffe ward of Hambleton District Council and Thirsk electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council. The parish shares a grouped parish council, known as Hillside Parish Council, with the civil parishes of Boltby, Cowesby, Kirby Knowle and Upsall. Geography The village is at an elevation of above sea level at its highest point. The nearest settlements are Thirlby to the east; Sutton-under-Whitestonecliffe to the south-east; Upsall to the north; Boltby to the north-east and Thirsk to the south-west. According to the 1881 UK Census, the population was 113. The 2001 UK Census recorded the population as 104, of which 85 were over the age of sixteen. Of those, 56 were in employment. The village contains 45 dwellings of which 24 are detached properties. A bowl barrow at Howe Hill in the parish is a scheduled ancient monument. There are two Grade II* listed buildings (St Felix church and Mount St John) in the village and five Grade II listed structures. Education Felixkirk, The Church of St Felix Primary education is provided at nearby Thirsk Community, South Kilvington CE Primary and Knayton CE Primary Schools. These schools are within the catchment area of Thirsk School for secondary education. Religion The village church is dedicated to St Felix and was substantially rebuilt in 1860 by William Hey Dykes, who is responsible for the unusual rounded apse. It is a grade II* listed building.

Harris the son of John Harris Sr., who is considered the first settler to establish a trading post along the Susquehanna River at what would later become the state capital of Pennsylvania. Biography John Harris Jr. was born in Harrisburg in 1716, and after his father's death in 1748 Harris continued to operate his father's trading business and ferry operation. For many years, Harris and his family were considered the principal store keepers on the American frontier; and at his house two notable \\"council fires\\" were held with the Indians of the Six Nations and other tribes. At the first, June 8, 1756, Governor Morris, with his council, was present; and at the second, April 1, 1757, the deputy of Sir William Johnson, his majesty's deputy of the affairs of the Six Nations, met the representatives of the Indian Nations and many of their warriors. It was said that John Harris Jr. had the confidence of the Indians. At a conference of Governor Hamilton with them, August 23, 1762, they asked that \\"the present store-keepers may be removed and honest men placed in their stead,\\" and selected John Harris. Said the chief, who addressed the governor, \\"I think John Harris is the most suitable man to keep store, for he lives right in the road where our warriors pass, and he is very well known by us all in our Nation, as his father was before him.\\" Harris's house, built in 1766, along what is now Front Street in downtown Harrisburg, still stands today.

It is located in the Klamath Basin near Klamath Falls, Oregon. It has a total area of , of which are in California and are in Oregon. The refuge includes shallow freshwater marshes, open water, grassy uplands, and croplands that are intensively managed to provide foraging and breeding habitat for waterfowl and other animals. The market hunting of migratory birds in the late 19th century created the need for preservation and creation of a wildlife refuge. Refuge objectives include the protection of habitat for flora and fauna, including migrating waterfowl, and preserving the biodiversity of the Klamath Basin. It works to integrate wetlands and sustainable agriculture and promote integrated pest management. The refuge provides wildlife-related public services, including education, hunting, and viewing and photography opportunities. Avian species on the refuge include the bald eagle, golden eagle, American white pelican, white- faced ibis, snow goose, Ross's goose, greater white-fronted goose, Canada goose, peregrine falcon, northern pintail, mallard, gadwall, canvasback, western grebe, eared grebe, black tern, and tricolored blackbird. Conservation and management activities include the maintenance of a local water infrastructure and the monitoring of the interaction between agriculture and habitat. Issues in focus include the loss of wetland habitat, the degradation of water quality, drought, and water rights.

The former abbey is a stop on the Romanesque Road. History The monastery was built in the Saxon lands of Eastphalia at the site of a former Pfalz and hunting lodge, mentioned as Elysynaburg in a 995 deed issued by King Otto III. On 15 April 1003 King Henry II donated the estate for this purpose to the Bishop of Halberstadt, and the abbey had been founded by 1009. In 1018 the Halberstadt bishop vested the monastery with further possessions around Ilsenburg and Osterwieck. The first monks possibly descended from Fulda Abbey in Franconia. Refectory Fostered by Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt from about 1070, the convent experienced a flourishing period whereupon numerous filial monasteries were established, such as Huysburg, and the abbeys of Harsefeld, Hillersleben, and Wimmelburg. A larger Romanesque church was erected and dedicated to Sts Peter and Paul on 5 June 1087; including the oldest preserved three-aisled choir of all Benedictine sacral buildings in Germany. The adjacent cloister buildings were erected after a blaze in 1120 and finished in 1176. The monastic community included up to 25 monks, it joined the Benedictine Bursfelde Congregation in 1464/65. The V√∂gte, or lords protectors, were the Counts of Wernigerode until 1429, when on their extinction their inheritance passed to the Counts of Stolberg, who were supporters of Lutheranism when the Reformation spread throughout the country. During the Peasants' War in 1525 it was stormed, plundered and largely demolished by rebellious peasants; the monks were driven away, and did not return for several months. From 1546 onwards the abbey turned Protestant and was subjected to severe changes; in 1555 it became, with its properties and assets, part of the territorial possessions of the Counts. The northern part of the church was demolished in 1573; part of the premises was used for a choral school, as in other monastic properties acquired by the Counts, and considerable re-building and improvements were made for the better accommodation of the function. The Counts' financial difficulties however caused the school to be suspended while the property was mortgaged, and although they regained it in 1608, and indeed lived there themselves for some years, the school finally closed in 1626. After the Counts finally relocated their residence to Wernigerode in 1716, also the cloister buildings were demolished and the premises were used for commercial purposes. The monastery remained a possession of the House of Stolberg even after the County of Stolberg-Wernigerode was mediatised and incorporated into the Prussian Province of Saxony in 1815. The Ilsenburg manor was finally disseized after World War II in the course of the land reform during Soviet occupation.

They sell cardiovascular and strength equipment such as stair climbing machines, TreadClimber cardio machines and dumbbell sets. History StairMaster was founded by Lanny Potts, Jim Walker, and George Schupp and launched by Tri- Tech, Inc of Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1983 at the National Sporting Goods Association trade show. The first piece of equipment, StairMaster 5000, was a rotating staircase machine. In March 1984 the StairMaster 5000 was replaced with the StairMaster 6000. Mechanically the StairMaster 6000 was virtually identical to its predecessor, but the 6000 displayed workout information on a CRT, printed a workout summary on a thermal printer, and included a heart rate monitor. In February 1986 the StairMaster 4000PT was launched at the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association (IHRSA) convention in Nashville, TN. The StairMaster 4000PT provided two pedals with independent motion to simulate stair climbing. Updates of this machine appeared in 1998 and 2005, and in 2011 the StairClimber 5 was released. In 1987 an assisted chin and dip machine was launched under Gravitron name. The original Gravitron used a compressor, accumulator, and pneumatic cylinder to provide programmable assistance to an exerciser. The pneumatic Gravitron proved a little too complex to maintain for the typical health club and was later replaced with the Gravitron 2000 AT, a weight-stack version. In 1988 the Gauntlet was introduced. The Gauntlet was a rotating staircase like the StairMaster 6,000, but used an alternator-based braking system to bring electronic speed control to the product. The Gauntlet eventually became known as the StepMill in 2005. In 2011 the latest version, the StepMill 5, was released at IHRSA in Los Angeles, CA with technology of a touch screen console, iPod connectivity and high definition television.

Leipzig, August 28, 1913 ‚Äì Guanajuato, June 28, 1993) was a painter and cultural promoter who immigrated to Mexico from Germany when she was twelve. She began to study art at the Academy of San Carlos but left after only three months to help support her family. However, she met her husband, artist Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado during this time. Her marriage to him involved her in Mexico's cultural and intellectual scene and she began to develop her ability to paint on her own, with encouragement from her husband. She had numerous exhibitions of her work in Mexico, with her work also sent to be sold in the United States. She was also involved in the founding and development of various galleries, cultural societies and three museums in the state of Guanajuato. She received the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes among others for her work. Life Costa was born in 1913 in Leipzig, Germany. Her parents, violinist and composer Jacobo Kostakowsky and Ana Falvisant Bovglarevokeylandel, were from Czarist Russia but left the Ukraine region to escape the persecution of Jews just before the First World War . They fled first to Leipzig, where Olga was born and after the war began to Berlin where her sister Lya was born. When the war ended, the family had severe economic problems, prompting her father to become radicalized politically, influenced by figures such as Rosa Luxemburg. He was detained several times by the German government but when sentenced to death, the family escaped to Mexico in 1925. The family arrived to the country at the port of Veracruz then in the same year settled in Mexico City . Olga's full legal name was Olga Kostakowsky Falvisant but shortly after arriving to Mexico, she began signing her name Olga Costa, which sounded more Spanish. It would become the name used in her art career. She and her sister Lya first attended the Colegio Alem√°n (German School) in the city, with Lya becoming a writer (later married to historian and art critic Luis Cardoza y Arag√≥n) and Olga participating in music, especially playing the piano and singing in the school choir. This musical bent was due to the influence and encouragement of her father. Her first exposure to painting was attending concerts at the Anfiteatro Sim√≥n Bolivar where Diego Rivera had painted a mural, the colors of which fascinated Olga. In 1933, Costa entered the Academy of San Carlos but left only three months later, needing to work in order to help her family. However, before she left, she studied painting with Carlos M√©rida and engraving with Emilio Amero, meeting her husband Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado. M√©rida later called Costa the ‚Äúwhite angel of Mexican painting.‚Äù Costa‚Äôs nickname came from her not compromising her painting to western culture. In Merida‚Äôs word she was the white angle of Mexican Painting due to Mexican artists being seduced by the western style of painting and ridiculing those who continued painting traditionally. Costa herself voiced that she would continue to paint in a traditional way, like Diego Rivera and Jose Chavez Morado, and keep on making Nationalist content even if it angered the people dominating the art scene at the time. Costa and Ch√°vez Morado married on May 18, 1935 in Mexico City. Her marriage introduced her to new artistic and intellectual circles in Mexico as Ch√°vez Morado's career was on the rise and encouraged her to participate in the cultural scene of the country. In 1941 she lived a short time in San Miguel Allende while Ch√°vez Morado worked as a teacher at a local art school for foreigners. In Mexico City in the 1940 and 1950s, their social life revolved around the Monument to the Revolution area or Tabacalera, then filled with refugees from the Spanish Civil War including Andr√©s Henestrosa, Lola √Ålvarez Bravo, Julio Prieto Posadas, Mar√≠a Izquierdo, Juan Soriano and In√©s Amor. This connection landed Costa her first exhibition of her work. In 1955 she lived for a while in Guanajuato while Ch√°vez Morado painted the murals of the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas. Eleven years later the couple moved back to stay, where Costa continued to paint and do cultural promotion. She hosted Queen Elizabeth II at her home at the end of the 1970s. She came from a leftist family and with other artists was politically active with the Mexican Communist Party for decades. Olga Costa died on June 28, 1993 in Guanajuato. Painting and cultural promotion Olga Costa was one of a number of prominent female artists in 20th century Mexico, along with Mar√≠a Izquierdo, Lola Cueto and Helen Escobedo although the field was dominated by men. Although she studied very briefly at the Academy of San Carlos, she began to paint in 1936 ‚Äúas a game‚Äù she said with no intentions of doing it professionally. This began in while she followed her husband, Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado to Xalapa, Veracruz to open a painting school and paint the halls of the teachers‚Äô college there. Ch√°vez Morado encouraged her to experiment although she was hesitant about it. Through her husband, Costa was active in Mexico's cultural and intellectual scenes, where she became friends with Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano owner In√©s Amor. Amor invited Costa to exhibit her work for the first time in 1945, with major individual exhibits at the same gallery in 1948, 1950, 1962 and 1971. Amor was also the first to start sending Costa's work to the United States where it received higher prices. Other individual exhibits include El Cuchitril (1954), the Galer√≠a de Arte Contempor√°neo (1955), Centro Cultural Ignacio Ram√≠rez in San Miguel Allende (1965), the Instituto Cultural Mexicano- Israel√≠ (1969), the Galer√≠a de Arte in Monterrey (1969), the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana (1950, 1963, 1972, 1983), the Galeri√° de Arte Contempor√°neo (1974, 1975), the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas (1975), the Galer√≠a Lourdes Chumacero (1977), the Palacio de Bellas Artes (1979), and the Festival Internacional Cervantino (1985, 1986). She also participated in numerous collective exhibits in Mexico and abroad. Her work was also exhibited at the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1990. Her major canvas works include Cabeza arcaica, La novia, Figuras en el tr√≥pico algo tiesas, Casa azul 3, Casa roja, Follajes azules, Pueblo minero de noche, Ladera and Niebla although her best known work is probably La vendedora de frutas from 1951. In addition to painting, she spent most of her life on various projects to promote the arts in Mexico. In 1941, she opened the Galer√≠a La Espiral along with her husband, Angelina Beloff, Gabriel Fern√°ndez Ledesma, Germ√°n Cueto, Francisco Z√∫√±iga and Feliciano Pe√±a, which Costa directed. The art gallery was more of a meeting place for artists rather than a business for selling artwork and welcome foreign contacts such as Mal√∫ Block, Alfred H. Barr, Jr. and Henry Clifford of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, one of the first the promote foreign artists in Mexico. In 1943, the gallery moved and morphed into a house on Paseo de la Reforma and became the Sociedad de Arte Moderno. This society sponsored a major exhibition of the works of Picasso with the collaboration of In√©s Amor. She became a member of the Sociedad Para el Impulso de las Artes Pl√°sticas in 1948, and the following year she was a co founder of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana . In addition to her canvas and promotional work, Costa worked with the theatre and created one mural. She worked on the set and wardrobe design of the Ballet Waldeen in 1942, the wardrobe for Homenaje a Garc√≠a Lorca in 1949 and El hombre fue hecho de ma√≠z in the 1950s. In 1952 she created a mosaic mural called Motivos sobre el agua for the Agua Hedionda Spa in Cuautla . Later in life, she and Ch√°vez Morado worked on the creation of several museums in the state of Guanajuato. In 1975, they donated their collection of pre Hispanic, colonial and folk art to the museum of the Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas. In 1979 the couple founded the Museo del Pueblo de Guanajuato with 18th and 19th century pieces from their private collection. In 1993, the couple donated their home, a former hacienda in the city of Guanajuato to create the Casa de Arte Olga Costa-Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado museum. It houses a permanent collection of 293 pieces acquired by the couple over their lifetimes of pieces from the 16th to 18th centuries, which includes ceramics, embroidered pieces, furniture, tapestries and glass, as well as works by both painters. Near the end of her life, she received a number of recognitions for her artistic and cultural work, individually and along with her husband. A book about her life Olga Costa was published in 1984. In 1989, he received the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes . That same year she also was named a ‚ÄúDistinguished Daughter of Guanajuato‚Äù and was honored by the Festival Internacional Cervantino . In 1993, she received, along with her husband, the El P√≠pila de Plata prize from the city of Guanajuato. In 2000, the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo held an exhibition about her and her husband's lives. The state government of Guanajuato created the Bienal de Pintura y Escultura Olga Costa in her honor, which is a competition only for women artists.  Paintings  Women were usually drawn from a male perspective in Western art. Mexican female artists not only diverged from that by portraying women from a female perspective, they deconstructed the Mexican ideal of womanhood. Costa painted the Mexican woman in her diversity and independence in her works such as ‚ÄúThe Bride‚Äù and the ‚ÄúFruit Vendor.‚Äù She did this in a ‚ÄúCostumbrismo‚Äù style, illustrating local daily life and customs with bright colors allocated to the Mexican traditional painting. ‚ÄúLa Vendedora de Frutas‚Äù made in 1951, portrays a fruit vendor in the center-right surrounded by a multitude of fruits known to originate Mexico displayed and ready for tasting and selling. Some noticeable fruits are sugar cane, pears, mameys, and guavas. This artwork shows the harvest of Mexico and its workers, the variety of literal ‚Äúfruit‚Äô which the people have worked for. Costa once again illustrates a woman, this time a hard-working woman in an honorable job showing the ‚Äúfruit‚Äù of Mexico in the traditional way of painting. Olga Costa has a specific painting of hers, The Bride, used as an example of matrimony deconstruction. The painting shows a bride in the center-left accompanied by flowers and a colorful dress with a sorrowful face on her wedding day. The bride is shown not to be the ideal woman, has no say in the matter, and is in general unhappy with her situation. The term ‚Äúdeflower‚Äù is used to refer to the woman‚Äôs loss of virginity and presumed maturity by way of metaphorical wilted flowers standing behind the bride. It is a commentary on the state of the woman and the idealistic views others have of women in general. Artistry Although she took some classes in painting and engraving at the Academy of San Carlos, she was there only for three months in 1933. Her development came on her own as a hobby starting in 1936, with Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado's encouragement. For this reason, she is considered to be mostly self- taught. During her lifetime, she painted costumbrista subjects, still lifes, portraits and landscapes which are noted for their use of color. She has been classed as a ‚Äúcolorista along with artists such as Rufino Tamayo and Pedro Coronel. While her techniques were not always solid, the innocent quality of her work has been judged as moving. One recurring element in her work is the desire to create one key piece with the rest impeding its dominance as much as possible. Landscapes tend to repeat, not as main elements but rather as background from which to interpret the main idea. She was not interested in a faithful reproduction of images but rather an impression of what she saw. This often led to distortion in the images and experiments in the use of color. She had a preference for painting the female form, especially indigenous women and children in her earlier work. Her portrait work was dedicated mostly to women, with two notable early exceptions of her husband. She began painting at a time when Mexico was nationalistic as well as anti-capitalistic and anti- imperialistic, reinforced by the Mexican muralism movement. While focused on Mexico, her work was not political. Her first works were formal and rigid focusing on Mexican folklore with bright colors and marked by influence from Diego Rivera, along with geometric forms from Carlos M√©rida and the use of fruit from Rufino Tamayo, classified as costumbrista, but also contain Expressionist type elements in the style of Mar√≠a Izquierdo. Her early work is considered to be fragile and insecure due to her lack of formal training and much of the costumbrista element was purposely integrated with an eye to selling the work in the United States. Her paintings often contain one or more elements larger than proportion to the rest of the composition such as the chair in La Novia from 1941, on which sits a bride. Her early models, especially in the 1930s where local people. In the mid-1940s her techniques began to change especially her handling of materials and use of color, breaking away a bit from Mexican muralism. In the 1950s, her work evolved with richer and more varied use of color, especially deep greens, blues, oranges, reds and pinks which contrasted with the silent and somber depictions of Mexico's indigenous. The compositions are formal and academic and show strong influence from Rivera. She still worked with costumbrista subjects but she was also beginning to move into nudes, still lifes and landscapes. Her best known work is from this time, La vendedora de frutas from 1951. Most of her landscape paintings date from the 1950s on which also included still lifes and images related to Day of the Dead altars. By the 1960s, she had moved into paler colors such as pinks, grays, beiges and greens not contrasting strongly and more influence from Expressionism. Her later work is marked by abstraction and the painting of landscapes of the Baj√≠o region, with red and deep green tones. These show changing color compositions with strong influence from Rufino Tamayo with emphasis on yellows, ochres and purples. Depictions of textures become more sophisticated especially in her depictions of Baj√≠o landscapes. In these works, depictions of human beings all but disappear but those of what people create such as houses, roads and more still remain as a form of abstractive figurativism. Her last works were produced between 1978 and 1979 and include Ladera and Niebla. The works create an impression of large space that extends beyond the frame with the eye traveling over the various colors of the work without stopping.

The village is situated on the River Swale, on the A167 road and close to the A168. It is about south-west of Thirsk and south of the county town of Northallerton. It has a population of 1,489. An army barracks, with a Royal Air Force airfield enclosed within, is located to the north of the village. History Topcliffe Motte, Maidens Bower The name is derived from the Old English words topp and clif and combined give the meaning top of the cliff, from its position at the top of a steep bank overlooking the River Swale. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as \\"Topeclive\\" in the \\"Yarlestre hundred.\\" At the time of the Norman invasion, the manor was the possession of Bernwulf. Afterwards it was granted to William of Percy. The manor became the chief seat of the Percy family until the middle of the 17th century, though there was some confusion of the line of inheritance in the 12th century. There was a short interruption to this line in the 15th century when the manor was granted to the Neville family following the death of Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland at the Battle of Towton in 1461, where he was fighting for the Lancastrians who lost. This was reversed in 1469 and the manor restored to the Percy family. In the 16th century there were two other brief periods when the manor was granted first to the Archbishop of York and then to the Earl of Warwick. The manor was restored to the Percy family in 1557. The last of the family to hold the manor in their name was Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland, though it passed to his daughter who married Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset. Their son inherited the manor, but he died heirless and the manor was passed to his nephew Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont. The manor remained in the Wyndham family into the 20th century. A motte and bailey castle was built at the strategic location of the junction of the River Swale and Cod Beck about 1071, soon after the Harrying of the North and re-fortified in 1174 by the Percy family. This was the principal residence of the Percy family until the early part of the fourteenth century, when Henry de Percy purchased the barony and castle of Alnwick. The castle was succeeded by a moated manor house on an adjacent site, of which earthworks also remain.Topcliffe Maidens Bower The manor house was the home of John Topcliffe, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, who died in 1513. The village was the centre of a large ancient parish in the North Riding of Yorkshire. The parish included the townships of Asenby, Baldersby, Catton, Dalton, Dishforth, Eldmire with Crakehill, Marton-le-Moor, Rainton with Newby, Skipton-on-Swale and Topcliffe. All of these townships became separate civil parishes in 1866. The village used to be a stop between Baldersby and Thirsk on the Leeds & Thirsk Railway. Topcliffe railway station was opened on 1 June 1848 and closed on 14 September 1959. It was located at the junction of the A167 and Catton Moor Lane to the north of the village near the present day MoD base. Topcliffe Airfield During the Second World War an airfield was constructed 1.5 miles from the village which was for some time a Royal Canadian Air Force base. After the war it had a number of roles until 1972 when much of it was taken over by the army and converted into Alanbrooke Barracks.RAF History: Bomber Command Topcliffe The airfield continues to be used for RAF glider training.World Aero Data EGXZ Governance The village is located in the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliamentary constituency.

Economy Topcliffe Mill The village is surrounded by farmland and it played an important role in the past as a major market place, much lessened these days. There are a number of small businesses in and around the village. There is a large industrial estate within the Parish boundary on the outskirts of neighbouring Dalton. On the outskirts near the bridge over the river is a caravan park. On Catton Lane just outside the village is Topcliffe Mill, a Grade II Listed building. A mill at Topcliffe was mentioned in the Domesday Book and may have been situated on the current site of the Roller Mill, which produced flour until 1961. It had been converted into a restaurant and now houses apartments. Culture and community Topcliffe is home to Deer Shed Festival, an annual music festival established in 2010, which attracts over 10,000 people to the village every July. Topcliffe has a park and two pubs, The Angel and The Swan. The old school house of Topcliffe is now a post office, the toll house is now an ordinary cottage. Topcliffe has been extended over the years. East Lea was built in the 1950s and has been developed over the years, by the demolition of some old houses on a sizeable plot of land, to make way for extra houses. In the late 1980s Manor Close and a small part of Winn Lane were built on the site of a farm. Transport The village lies on two main routes through the county, the A167 and A168. The A168 bypass was first considered in 1963 as part of \\"The North East Programme for Regional Development and Growth\\". Work did not start though until 1976 and took two years to complete. The village is served by the bus route between Ripon and Northallerton. Education The primary school at Topcliffe There has been a school in the village since the establishment of a Free Grammar School in 1549. A school house was built in 1822 on the site of one previously erected in 1695. The Grade II listed building is located in the north side of the St Columba churchyard. The current primary school at Topcliffe was opened in 1966. It is a Church of England and caters for mixed genders from years 1‚Äì6, and a playgroup. It has a student capacity of 114. The school is within the catchment area of Thirsk School and Sixth Form College for secondary education. The nearby Army Barracks operate a school primarily for Service personnel.

Religion Topcliffe, The Church of St Columba The village has a church dedicated to St Columba. As the name suggests, there has been a church in the site since early Saxon times, possibly around the time of St Aiden's mission in 650AD. The present building date from the 13th century with improvements being made throughout the ages. It is a Grade II* listed building. There is a Wesleyan Methodist Church in the village built in 1840 located in Church Street opposite St Columba Church. It is a Grade II Listed building. Sport Topcliffe Football Club play at the Playing Fields on Winn Lane, next to the Bowling Club. They play in local leagues but have been in existence since at least the 1920s.

His work has roots in minimal music. Life Gheorghi Arnaoudov was born in 1957 in Sofia and graduated in composition with Alexander Tanev and contemporary music with Bojidar Spassov from the State Academy of Music Pancho Vladigerov. At the same time, he attended summer courses working with Brian Ferneyhough and Ton de Leeuw. His artistic career started in the early 1980s. At the same time, he did research work in the fields of electronic music, music theory and musique concr√®te, as well as ancient far-Eastern and ancient Greek music. He has won many international and national awards, including the Grand Prix of the European Broadcasting Union (1985), the Golden Harp Prize from Jeunesses Musicales (1985), the Special Prize of the Union of Bulgarian Composers (1986), and the Carl Maria von Weber International Prize for Music (1989). He is the author of scientific and theoretical articles in music, as well as of reviews in musical and scientific periodicals, mainly in the spheres of the aesthetics of modernism and postmodernism, communications in the music, the contemporary arts, musical semiotics, and the theory of contemporary music. In 2000 Gega New released a CD with Arnaoudov's music called \\"Thyepoleo. Orphic Mysterial Rites\\". The texts used by the composer are the original preserved Orphic hymns. For this project he consulted renowned Thracologist Alexander Fol, who wrote the programme notes. To date Arnaoudov has produced numerous symphonies, oratorios, concertos and has won several international prizes. He currently teaches in the Theatre and Music departments of New Bulgarian University. In 2009 he was appointed associate professor in Composition and Harmony. The antecedents of his music can be found in Alexander Scriabin, Olivier Messiaen, the Edgard Var√®se and, more recently, in the work of Krzysztof Penderecki and Arvo P√§rt. The influence of composers like Anton Webern and Morton Feldman is shown in the lack of any kind of conventional process or development. In a series of works of Gheorghi Arnaoudov composer's vision is directed towards attaining a new aesthetic of pure music (Adorno), aestheticizing renaissance sound purity. By using various techniques (including also techniques legitimizing the language of Musical Avant-garde) and their substance rethinking is achieved a new music-sensuous semantic field.

Charles IV, king of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, had it made for his coronation, dedicating it to the first patron saint of the country St. Wenceslas and bequeathed it as a state crown for the coronation of (future) Bohemian kings. On the orders of Charles IV the new royal crown was deposited in St. Vitus Cathedral, however, it was later transferred to Karl≈°tejn Castle. It was used for the last time for the coronation of Ferdinand V in 1836. Description The St. Wenceslas Crown is made of 21 to 22 carat (88 to 92%) gold and decorated with 91 precious stones and 20 pearls. It has a total of 19 sapphires, 44 spinels, 1 ruby and 30 emeralds. The crown has two hoops and an upstanding cross at the point of intersection. There is no monde; the cross stands directly on the crown. It weighs two and a half kilos. The sapphire cross has an inset cameo in which the scene of the Crucifixion is cut. Location Replica of the crown in the Old Royal Palace of Prague Castle Unlike many other European royal treasures, the St. Wenceslas Crown is not normally displayed to the public, and only a replica is shown. Along with the other Bohemian crown jewels, it is kept in a chamber within St. Vitus Cathedral accessible by a door in the St. Wenceslas Chapel. The exact location of the chamber is not known to the general public. The entrance to the jewels is locked by seven locks whose keys are held by the President of the Czech Republic, the Chair of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament, the Chair of the Senate of the Parliament, the Prime Minister, the Mayor of Prague, the Archbishop of Prague, and the Dean of the Metropolitan Chapter of St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague. The jewels are only taken from the chamber and displayed for periods of several days on notable occasions approximately once every five years. The crown was exhibited in May 2016 to mark the 700th anniversary of the birth of Charles IV, and in May 2013, celebrating the inauguration of a new Czech president. Legend An old Czech legend says that any usurper who places the crown on his head is doomed to die within a year, as the Crown is the personal property of St. Wenceslas and may only be worn by a rightful Bohemian king during his coronation. During World War II, Reinhard Heydrich, the Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, is said to have secretly crowned himself while inspecting St. Vitus' Cathedral, and was assassinated less than a year later by the Czech resistance. Although there is no evidence proving that Heydrich did so, the legend is widely believed.Kl√≠ƒçe od fascinuj√≠c√≠ch klenot≈Ø See also *≈öroda Treasure ReferencesExternal links *Official info of Prague Castle Saint Wenceslaus Category:Crown jewels Category:Kingdom of Bohemia Category:National symbols of Austria-Hungary Category:Crowns of the coat of Arms of Austria-Hungary Category:Medieval European metalwork objects Category:Medieval crowns Category:National symbols of the Czech Republic Category:Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia ","title":"Crown of Saint Wenceslas"},{"id":"3591256","text":"Bruce Eliot Jones (born 1946) whose pen names include Philip Roland and Bruce Elliot, is an American comic book writer, novelist, illustrator, and screenwriter whose work included writing Marvel Comics' The Incredible Hulk from 2001 to 2005. Biography=Early career Jones broke into comics in 1969 when he moved to New York City from his native Kansas City, Missouri, looking for work as a comics artist. He made his professional debut with Major Publications' black-and-white horror-comics magazine Web of Horror #3 (cover dated April 1970), writing and drawing the six-page story \\"Point of View\\". Jones then wrote for Warren Publishing's black-and-white horror-comics Creepy and Eerie, and, under the pseudonym Philip Roland, for rival Skywald Publications' line. During this time he wrote his first novel, The Contestants. Jones later freelanced for Marvel Comics, writing stories for Ka- Zar and Conan the Barbarian, as well as writing and drawing anthological science fiction and other stories for Marvel's black-and-white magazine line. In 1979, Jones met April Campbell and formed a writing partnership. From 1982‚Äì1984, Jones and Campbell, who formed the company Bruce Jones Associates, packaged, edited, and chiefly wrote the Pacific Comics titles Twisted Tales and Alien Worlds, as well as Somerset Holmes, Silverheels, and Pathways to Fantasy. During this time, Jones published the short story collection The Twisted Tales of Bruce Jones, with a cover and occasional illustrations by Richard Corben. When Pacific went bankrupt, subsequent issues were published by Eclipse Comics. Later career Jones wrote artist Richard Corben's Rip in Time five-issue miniseries (1986‚Äì1987), published by Fantagor Press. By the early 1990s, Jones had shifted to screenwriting, working on HBO's The Hitchhiker TV series and several television movies with writing partner and now-wife April Campbell Jones. He also wrote a series of thriller novels including Sprinter, Maximum Velocity, and Game Running. From 1990 to 1992, Jones took over as writer of the newspaper comic strip Flash Gordon, then drawn by Ralph Reese, occasionally assisted by Gray Morrow. He returned to Kansas City with his wife and children in 2000 and wrote two more novels, Still Life and Death Rites, under the pseudonym Bruce Elliot. In 2001, he was contacted by Marvel editor Axel Alonso, with whom Jones had worked when Alonso was at rival company DC Comics. Alonso offered him a job scripting the then- floundering comic The Incredible Hulk. Sales of the title rose significantly, and in 2003, Jones noted that he planned to stay on as Hulk writer \\"until they [Marvel] throw me off\\". However, the following year he signed a two-year contract with rival company DC Comics. In the interim, he scripted the five- issue series Call of Duty: The Precinct #1‚Äì5, a naturalistic drama about the New York City Police Department. Other work includes a seven-issue stint on Nightwing, a Deadman series for Vertigo, and various limited series for DC comics, including Man-Bat, OMAC, and Vigilante. In 2005, Jones' 10-page story \\"Jenifer\\" from Creepy #63 (July 1974), drawn by Bernie Wrightson, became the basis for filmmaker Dario Argento's segment of Masters of Horror, a Showtime television series. Awards Bruce Jones received an Inkpot Award in 2004.

The nephew and adopted son of Frederick Law Olmsted, he worked with his father and his younger brother, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., in their father's firm. After their father retired, the brothers took over leadership and founded Olmsted Brothers as a landscape design firm. The firm became well-known for designing many urban parks, college campuses, and other public places. John Olmsted's body of work from over 40 years as a landscape architect has left its mark on the American urban landscape. Early life John Charles Olmsted was born in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1852 to John Olmsted and Mary Cleveland (Perkins) Olmsted. His father John, had contracted tuberculosis, which at the time had no treatment. Fresh air and healthy living, including exercise, were recommended. Some sanatoriums were established in mountain areas. The John Olmsted family returned to the United States to reside at Tosomock Farm on Staten Island in New York.Witold Rybczynski (1999). A Clearing in the Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the Nineteenth Century. Scribner: New York, p.124. After his father died, his mother remarried, to John's brother, Frederick Law Olmsted. Frederick adopted John as his son. Later he and Mary had a son of their own, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., born in 1870. Career John Olmsted began his career at his father's firm, where he was later joined by his younger brother Frederick. After their father retired, the two took over leadership, establishing the firm as Olmsted Brothers. They each contracted separately for some projects. Olmsted expressed his design philosophy of integrated park systems into planning projects in such cities as Portland, Maine; Portland, Oregon; Seattle and Spokane, Washington; Dayton, Ohio, and Charleston, South Carolina. In these cities, he pioneered his comprehensive planning philosophy of integrating civic buildings, roads, parks, and greenspaces into livable urban areas. Olmsted also designed individual parks in New Orleans; Watertown, New York; and Chicago, Illinois. His work in park design led to commissions for numerous institutions such as school campuses, civic buildings, and state capitals, as well as designs for large residential areas, including roads and schools. His work in comprehensive planning for the communities surrounding industrial plants and factories is considered especially noteworthy. In all his work, John Olmsted retained a sensitivity to the natural beauty of the site, including its views, vistas, and greenways. He wanted to ensure that communities and public areas must be comfortable and inviting. He favored modest, informal structures in a naturalistic setting to large, imposing structures. His father used him as an assistant in designing landscapes for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. The younger Olmsted had primary responsibility for the 1906 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon, and the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. In 1899, John Olmsted was a founding member and first president of the American Society of Landscape Architects.

The role was played by actress Mary Stuart for the show's entire run (1951‚Äì86). Joanne was married four times, making her full legal name Joanne Gardner Barron Tate Vincente Tourneur. Style A \\"salt of the earth\\" kind of heroine, Stuart's character was the understanding best friend who would love to (and often did) commiserate with other characters about their sorrows over coffee. She frequently counseled best friends Stu and Marge Bergman. Her role shifted in the 1970s to counseling younger women on the program, when the actress who played Marge died, and Stu was given his own story. Even when truly dismayed by actions (such as sister Eunice sleeping with her husband, or her daughter willfully marrying into a family who wanted to alienate her from her mother), she usually forgave offenders who showed true remorse. She got a reputation for being \\"simple-minded\\" by forgiving and forgetting, as other characters (Irene Barron in the early days, Aunt Cornelia Simmons, Patti's in-law Andrea Whiting, and Stephanie Wilkins later) saw her to be weak and attempted to prey upon her. In true soap opera fashion, however, it was Joanne's rivals who ate crow. Background Joanne was raised in the city of Henderson somewhere in the U.S. Midwest. Her parents were Frank Gardner, an accountant, and Helen Gardner, a housewife. Helen died of heart disease in the mid-1950s. Joanne has at least one sibling, a sister named Eunice, who came to town and slept with Joanne's second husband Arthur Tate. However, Eunice reformed, apologized to Joanne, and became part of the family again. Joanne attended Wilson Grammar School, Henderson High School and attended Henderson College (later Henderson University) for two years before marrying Keith Barron. Storylines Joanne was whisked away from her college studies by wealthy Keith Barron, who married her and bought her a house in the town of Henderson. Shortly after, she gave birth to a daughter named Patricia (nicknamed Patti). Keith's meddling mother, Irene, tried very hard to turn him away from Joanne, as Irene believed that Joanne wasn't nearly good enough for her son. Keith's sister was wise to Irene's controlling ways and tried to warn him, but to no avail. He died of injuries from a car accident in 1952, leaving Joanne a widow. Irene, sensing opportunity, fought for custody of young Patti, arguing that Joanne was unable to provide for her daughter. Joanne proved her wrong by buying and running the Motor Haven Inn. In an attempt to tarnish Joanne's reputation, Irene hired people to sabotage the inn. At the same time, Mafia thugs tried to take over control of the inn, as they didn't believe a woman was strong enough to run a business on her own. Both attempts failed, and Irene left town. A local businessman, Arthur Tate (Terry O'Sullivan), was interested in financing the inn when Joanne experienced difficulties. Arthur and Joanne fell in love and were married. Patti, now in her early teens, was legally adopted by Arthur shortly after he married Joanne. To get enough money, Arthur persuaded his Aunt Cornelia to give him part of his inheritance. She agreed, if only to meddle in their affairs, because, like Irene, Cornelia hated Joanne and the stock she came from. Eventually, Aunt Cornelia died and Arthur earned all of his inheritance. Arthur was not a strong man, but he loved Joanne. First, he became an alcoholic. Then, in 1962, a woman came to town suing him for paternity (it was really not his child). In 1963, Arthur and Joanne's son, Duncan Eric Tate, ran in front of a car and was killed, causing mental anguish for both of them. Finally, Joanne's sister Eunice came to town and slept with Arthur. The stress surrounding the possibility that he could shatter his marriage and his relationship with his daughter caused him to die of a heart attack in February 1966. To keep herself busy after Arthur's death, Joanne took a job as the librarian at Henderson Hospital. A suitor came calling later in the year in the form of Sam Reynolds (Robert Mandan), who was Arthur's rival. To prove his worth to Joanne, he saved her daughter Patti when she was held at knifepoint (a nurse, Patti had access to drugs that gang members wanted). Sam and Joanne started 1967 with major decisions. Sam offered to sell the Motor Haven Inn for her, while Joanne cut off her excess hair, which she had grown while married to Arthur. It was a soap event when Joanne took off her kerchief to show a modern hairstyle‚Äîone of her gifts to Sam. While very devoted to one another, both Sam and Joanne were over the age of 40 and wished to take things slowly. In 1969, Sam proposed to Jo, with a wedding planned for 1970. However, Sam went on a trip to Africa and was presumed dead, leaving Joanne devastated. He later returned to town, but they could not rekindle their old feelings. Later that year, Joanne lost her eyesight in a car accident, and neurosurgeon Dr. Tony Vincente saved her life. She regained her vision and fell in love with her doctor, whom she married in 1972. The actor who played Tony, Anthony George, did not like how his character developed, and he was written out in June 1975 as Tony died of a heart attack in Jo's arms. At the age of 50, Joanne had endured the deaths of four significant others. Another devastating blow came in 1976 when her sister Eunice, who had long since given up her scheming ways and reformed, was fatally shot by her husband's mistress. After Eunice's death, Joanne adopted her niece, Suzi Martin. In 1976, Joanne teamed up with her best friend Stu Bergman and bought the Hartford House, turning it into an upscale bed and breakfast. She ran this business until the inn was destroyed in an explosion in 1982. After Hartford House, Jo became a hostess for a tavern along the Henderson River called \\"The Riverboat,\\" which Stu, Jenny (Linda Gibboney) and Wendy ran. It too was destroyed when Travis (Rod Arrants) met his demise against Warren (Michael Corbett) and Ringo Altman (Larry Fleischman). Starting in the mid-1970s, Joanne was showcased less on the program. She became rivals with Stephanie Wilkins, who had an affair with her third husband, Tony, and later married John Wyatt, her former brother-in-law, out of spite. Joanne's final stories involved her romance with Martin Tourneur (John Aniston), whom she married in 1980. They later divorced, which was considered a scandal because it was Joanne's first divorce. Mary Stuart confessed that because she had divorced him because of his infidelity, she laughingly considered herself the \\"world's oldest ingenue\\". In early 1985, Jo's granddaughter Sarah Whitting (Michelle Joyner) came to town to pursue a music career as a folk singer. Sarah was hiding out inside an abandoned building in Henderson. One day it caught fire, and Wendy and Quinn saved her life. When Sarah recovered after the fire, she told Jo that she left Seattle because there were problems with Patti and Len, her parents. Sarah also helped Jo and Stu turn the abandoned building that caught fire into another upscale bed and breakfast called Caldwell House, which was operated by a scheming man named Melvin Hibbard (Ralph Byers). In October 1985, Jo received a letter from one of her ex- husbands, Martin Tourneur, that said he was in trouble. Jo flew to San Marcos to search for him but was unsuccessful. As she was about to return home, some people who were after Martin abducted but eventually released her, unharmed. Jo then returned to Henderson and received a telegram from Martin, who said he was no longer in San Marcos but he was somewhere safe. He also told Jo that he still loved her. While Jo sought information through Hogan McCleary, Adair McCleary and Chase Kendall went to San Marcos in search of Martin. Adair and Chase found Estelle Kendall: T.R.'s, Alex, Steve, and Chase's mother, also Lloyd's wife, who had supposedly died years ago. Estelle learned about what had happened to Martin through Adair and Chase. After hearing about recent events in San Marcos through the Henderson Herald newspaper, Jo became concerned along with Hogan about Bragg (Viggo Mortensen), the man who was hired by Hogan McCleary to investigate Martin and his connections to San Marcos. In November 1985, Jo was devastated when her granddaughter Sarah Whitting was murdered by her business partner for The Caldwell House, Melvin Hibbard, who at the time was plotting to destroy Joanne and her bed and breakfast. With Sarah dead, Melvin kidnapped Jo for revenge and so that he could kill her too and then ruin the Caldwell House. After her ordeal with Sarah's death and her kidnapping situation, Jo went to confront Estelle Kendall (Domini Blythe) about her connections to Martin, the island of San Marcos, and Rivera (Lloyd Battista); afterwards, Jo blamed Estelle for all that she had done to Martin during their love affair. While still sad over the death of Sarah, Jo, Stu, Cagney, Suzi, Bela and Wendy all believed that Melvin Hibbard didn't kill Sarah, this coming to the conclusion that someone else did. It turned out there was a serial killer loose in the town of Henderson, the killer eventually murdered Stephanie Wyatt (Maree Cheatham, Louise Shaffer), in February 1986, right before the major flood that wiped out almost all of Henderson; On Christmas Day in 1985, her daughter Patti came back to town after not being in Henderson for eight years. She had divorced her husband, Len, who remained in Seattle with his mother. Patti returned partially to bring closure to the murder of her daughter, Sarah. In February 1986, a major flood caused much destruction for the town of Henderson. Jo almost died but was rescued by Hogan (David Forsyth) and Patty (Jacqueline Schultz). Jo then helped others get back on their feet following the flood. The Caldwell House survived, but many residents died or were missing, and buildings were destroyed. Robert Olsen (Nicholas Hormann) made an offer to Jo after he resigned his position at the Liberty House. Jo decided not to run the Caldwell House anymore and to start a new bed-and-breakfast called \\"Liberty House\\". In October 1986, Jo was devastated when her niece Suzi McCleary (Eunice's daughter) was killed by an unstable woman, Ella Hobbs (Ann Flood), who wanted revenge from the McCleary family after a payroll robbery that Ella was involved in with her lover, Judge Jeremiah Henderson (William Prince), years earlier with Suzi's husband's father, Malcolm McCleary (Patrick Tovatt). It turned out the Malcolm was alive and fled to Ireland and that his twin brother was the one that was killed in the payroll robbery, not him. While the McClearys were about to reunite with the patriarch of the family,Ella was about to kill Jo, when she was held hostage in the elevator shaft at Liberty House. But Stu, Evie, Cagney, Jerry and Jeremiah rescued Jo, and Ella fell to her death. On December 26, 1986 (the final episode Of Search For Tomorrow), Jo watched Patti marrying Hogan McCleary. Later in the evening, Stu Bergman asked Jo, \\"What is it, Jo, what is it you're searching for?\\". She replied, \\"Tomorrow, and I can't wait!\\" They then hugged as they looked back on thirty- five years of friendship.

Partners Whitney Warren was a cousin of New York's Vanderbilt family, and spent ten years at the √âcole des Beaux Arts. There he met fellow architecture student Emmanuel Louis Masqueray, who would, in 1897 join the Warren and Wetmore firm. He began practice in New York City in 1887. Warren's partner, Charles Delevan Wetmore (usually referred to as Charles D. Wetmore), was a lawyer by training. Their society connections led to commissions for clubs, private estates, hotels and terminal buildings, including the New York Central office building, the Chelsea docks, the Ritz- Carlton, Biltmore, Commodore, and Ambassador Hotels. They were the preferred architects for Vanderbilt's New York Central Railroad. Whitney Warren retired in 1931 but occasionally served as consultant. Warren took particular pride in his design of the new library building of the Catholic University of Leuven, finished in 1928, which he wanted to carry the inscription Furore Teutonico Diruta: Dono Americano Restituta (\\"Destroyed by German fury, restored by American generosity\\") on the facade. This post-war propaganda was never added to the building. The library was severely damaged by British and German forces during World War II, but was completely restored after the war. The architectural records of the firm are held by the Dept. of Drawings & Archives at the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, Columbia University. Commissions The firm's most important work by far is the construction of Grand Central Terminal in New York City, completed in 1913 in association with Reed and Stem.

The Romanesque abbey has existed since about 1080 and was secularised in 1804. A new Benedictine community was founded in 1972 and has been headed by a prior since 1984. History Remains of a circular rampart denote a Frankish castle at the site, erected about 790 AD during the Saxon Wars of Charlemagne. When in the mid 10th century Emperor Otto I built his residence in Magdeburg on the Elbe river, the strategical significance of the Huy fortress decreased. In 997 Emperor Otto III ceded it to the Bishops of Halberstadt. According to the chronicles by the Annalista Saxo, they had a first chapel built on the Huy hills, which was consecrated in 1058. In 1070 Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt gave permission to establish a hermitage of three Benedictine nuns from Quedlinburg and Gandersheim. Huysburg Abbey Church and sacristy The first abbot, Ekkehard of Huysburg, a canon of Halberstadt Cathedral, was appointed on 24 December 1080 and ordained on 21 June 1081; he died three years later. The convent received extended manors by Bishop Burchard and from 1114 onwards was vested with further estates by Burchard's successor Bishop Reinhard. Beside the convent, the hermitage of nuns existed until the early 15th century. Huysburg Abbey was among the earliest monasteries to join the reform movement of the Bursfelde Congregation in 1444 and by the late 15th century the convent comprises 31 monks. The economic situation suffered from the German Peasants' War and the Schmalkaldic War, as well as from the devastations during the Thirty Years' War. Nevertheless, Huysburg was one of the very few Catholic monasteries of the region which survived the Reformation under the provisions of the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia ‚Äì Abbot Adam Adami was actively involved in the negotiations. Within the secularised Principality of Halberstadt under the 'Great Elector' Frederick William of Brandenburg, the abbey again prospered as a centre of the Catholic minority. It was finally dissolved in 1804 as part of the secularisation process and its estates were taken by the Prussian state. Its domains were incorporated into the Province of Saxony. In 1823 King Frederick William III ceded them to his general Karl Friedrich von dem Knesebeck. Huysburg Priory Church interior After World War II, the Knesebeck noble family was disseized by the Soviet occupation forces. Huysburg again became an ecclesiastical site, when a branch seminary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn was set up here in 1952 for those parts of the diocese lying in East Germany. The seminary was closed in 1993 after the reunification of Germany. The Benedictine community which is now located within the walls of the Huysburg was founded in 1972, then the only Benedictine monastery in East Germany. It was established as a filial by the monks of Tyniec Abbey in Krak√≥w in cooperation with the Paderborn diocese and its Magdeburg administrator Johannes Braun. Huysburg was elevated to a priory on 8 September 1984. Under the auspices of the newly established Diocese of Magdeburg, Huysburg since September 2004 has been joined as the priory of St. Matthias' Abbey in Trier. In August 2005 the brothers of St. Matthias' and of the Huysburg priory elected a joint abbot, Ignatius Maass, resident in Trier. Church Floor plan of Huysburg The Romanesque abbey church was consecrated on 7 August 1121. It contains the tomb of the Blessed Ekkehard, the first abbot of Huysburg. In 2004, at his own request, the former apostolic administrator in Magdeburg, Bishop Johannes Braun, was also laid to rest here. Pilgrimages The Huysburg is one of the main places of pilgrimage in the Diocese of Magdeburg, and many Catholics come there every year, for example on the first Sunday in September for the Family Pilgrimage of the Diocese.

He served as Bishop of Toledo (1931‚Äì1950) and Archbishop of Cincinnati (1950‚Äì1969). Early life Karl Alter was born in Toledo, Ohio, to John P. and Elizabeth (n√©e Kuttner) Alter. His father was a cigar manufacturer and liquor dealer. He attended St. John's High School, and was a member of the first graduating class of St. John's College in 1905. He made his theological studies at St. Mary's Seminary in Cleveland. Priesthood On June 4, 1910, Alter was ordained to the priesthood. He then served as administrator of St. Mary's Church in Leipsic until 1912, when he became a curate at St. John's Church in Lima. In 1914, he was appointed the first diocesan director of Catholic Charities, coordinating various charitable organizations in the diocese into one agency. During this period, he also served as vice-president of the Toledo Social Service Foundation, a trustee of the Toledo Red Cross and of the Toledo Society for the Blind, and a member of the children's division of the state department of public welfare. He was a lecturer in sociology at St. John's College and at Mary Manse College from 1914 to 1930. He earned a Master's degree from St. John's in 1923 and a doctorate in 1929. In 1929, he was named director of the School of Social Service at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. While in Washington, he also served as chairman of the speakers' committee for the Catholic Hour radio program. Episcopacy=Toledo On April 17, 1931, Alter was appointed the third Bishop of Toledo by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 17 from Archbishop John T. McNicholas, with Bishops Augustus John Schwertner and Joseph H. Albers serving as co-consecrators. He was the first native son of the diocese to become its bishop. He founded the Catholic Chronicle in 1934. In 1938, he deplored religious persecution in Germany and unrest in the Holy Land. Along with fellow American bishops, Alter publicly criticized the Moscow Agreement of 1943.TIME Magazine. Moscow: Catholic View November 22, 1943 In 1944, he drafted a proposal for a joint declaration on world peace by Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant leaders. Following World War II, he offered a 10-point program for economic security; among his points were such contemporary ideas as wage equalization on the basis of cost of living, representation of laborers on a firm's board of trustees, profit-sharing, and special consideration for persons living on fixed incomes. During his tenure as bishop, the construction of Rosary Cathedral was completed and an addition to Central Catholic High School was built. He established DeSales College in 1942 and donated a parcel of land in East Toledo for the construction of St. Charles Hospital. Cincinnati Following the death of Archbishop McNicholas, Alter was appointed the fifth Archbishop of Cincinnati on June 14, 1950. During his administration, he established 98 churches, 94 elementary schools, 14 high schools, 79 rectories, and 55 convents. He also instituted a priests' senate and an archdiocesan school board composed of lay members, and encouraged the formation of parish councils. He undertook a restoration of Saint Peter in Chains Cathedral. Within the National Catholic Welfare Conference, he served two terms as vice- chairman (1950‚Äì52, 1956‚Äì58), two terms as chairman (1952‚Äì55, 1958‚Äì62), and one term as secretary (1962‚Äì66). As chairman of the NCWC, he issued a protest against religious and racial discrimination in June 1960. Between 1962 and 1965, Alter attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council, having previously served on the Central Preparatory Commission. At the Council, he sat on the Commissions for Bishops and for the Government of Dioceses. He discontinued first grades in Cincinnati parochial schools in 1964 because of high costs and overcrowded classrooms.TIME Magazine. Schools Under Strain March 20, 1964 However, Alter did not believe that this would greatly interfere with children's religious education. He resigned as Cincinnati's archbishop on July 19, 1969, after nineteen years of service. At the same time Alter was appointed Titular Archbishop of Minora, a post from which he stepped down on December 31, 1970. Alter died in Cincinnati at age 92. Archbishop Alter High School in Dayton is named in his honor, as was the former Alter Elementary (now All Saints Catholic School) in Rossford, Ohio.

It opened in 1877 and operated until 1966; for some of this time, it included an extension to Waihao Downs that was known as the Waimate Gorge Branch or Waihao Downs Branch. When the line closed, Waimate received the dubious distinction of being New Zealand's first major town to lose its railway line.Geoffrey B. Churchman and Tony Hurst, The Railways of New Zealand: A Journey Through History (Auckland: HarperCollins, 1991), 185. Construction Located roughly halfway between Timaru and Oamaru, Waimate is the major market and service town for the surrounding district, but when the Main South Line between Christchurch and Dunedin was constructed, it was built some 7 km to the east of the township so that it could follow a direct route along the coastal plain without deviating. Both government and residents agreed that a link from the main line village of Studholme to Waimate was necessary.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 80. In 1876, tenders were called for the line and the winning offer, George Pratt's of ¬£4,831, was accepted on 10 March 1876.\\"Wellington\\", North Otago Times 23(1220) [10 March 1876]: 2. Construction was not difficult and the branch opened on 19 March 1877. The first train was hauled by an A class tank locomotive and had three carriages plus a guard's van.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 81. Two proposals for an extension were made, of which only one eventuated. The plan which did not eventuate was to link Waimate to either Duntroon or Livingstone. One of the proposals for the Otago Central Railway was to build a line from Oamaru to Naseby, and in 1877 an invitation was extended to the Waimate County Council to partake in a plan to connect Waimate to the Oamaru-Naseby line in either Duntroon or Livingstone and thus establish a through route from Central Otago to Canterbury.\\"Oamaru - Naseby Railway Committee\\", North Otago Times 26(1626) [6 July 1877]: 2. A deputation representing the advocates of the Oamaru-Naseby line made a presentation before the Waimate County Council on 12 July 1877, but the Council did not view the proposal as desirable.\\"Waimate County Council\\", North Otago Times 26(1632) [13 July 1877]: 2. The Oamaru-Naseby proposal itself failed to come to fruition, with Duntroon ultimately served by the Kurow Branch and Livingstone located near the terminus of the Tokarahi Branch. The other extension proposal was for a line into the hinterland behind Waimate, and this one was successful. Local residents established the Waimate Railway Company in late 1878 to construct an extension from Waimate to the Waihao Valley, and work commenced after W. J. Black's tender for construction of the first section was accepted on 16 April 1882.\\"Timaru\\", North Otago Times 28(3038) [17 April 1882]: 2. The initial 11.27 km were built quickly, with the line opened to Waihao Forks on 2 February 1883. Another 2.05 km of trackage to Waihao Downs followed, and this was opened on 24 April 1883, with a small locomotive depot established at the Waihao Downs station. On 1 April 1885, in accordance with the terms of the 1878 District Railways Act under which the Waimate Gorge Branch had been built, the government agreed to take control of the line. There was local pressure to extend the line further and some formation was constructed in 1914 with the goal of continuing the railway to Waihaorunga. However, World War I brought construction to a halt as resources were diverted elsewhere and work did not resume after the war ended. By 1924, the government had decided that extending rural branch lines was not profitable and thus permanently put an end to any plans to build beyond Waihao Downs.  Stations  The only station on the Waimate Branch was the terminus, located 7.42 km from the Main South Line junction in Studholme. The following stations were located on the Waimate Gorge Branch (in brackets is the distance in kilometres from Waimate): * Arno (?? km) * McLeans (?? km) * Waihao Forks (11.27 km) * Waihao Downs (13.32 km)New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition, edited by John Yonge (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 24. Operation From the opening of the Waimate Branch, a shuttle service operated between Waimate and the main line at Studholme, while a daily mixed train ran between Waihao Downs and Waimate. Motive power on the Waimate Gorge Branch was provided by FA class tank locomotives for many years, primarily by FA 10, FA 41, and FA 251\\\\. Due to Waimate's status as the central town of the surrounding region, it attracted inbound freight from over 160 km away, and most outbound traffic went to Timaru or Oamaru and the wharves located in those two centres. Waimate is known for its berry gardens, and at the height of the season in 1898, an average of five wagons of strawberries were railed out of Waimate daily.Jenny Haworth, \\"Go Down to Strawberry Fields\\", New Zealand Herald (16 July 2006), 2. Passenger traffic on the line ceased and was replaced by buses on 9 February 1931, and around this time, the locomotive depot in Waihao Downs was closed and the Waimate Gorge Branch's regular daily mixed train was replaced by a goods service when required. Passenger trains did not become wholly absent from the Waimate Branch, as picnic trains still ran on occasions. Traffic surged during World War II, in part due to petrol restrictions, but it slipped again with the coming of peace in 1945. New freight handling techniques and changes in coastal shipping patterns served to further lower the traffic on the branch, and with running costs mounting and deferred maintenance becoming more and more necessary, the government took the step of closing the Waihao Downs section on 11 December 1953 and then the entire line on 31 March 1966. All previous branch closures had been of lines serving rural areas and small townships, so Waimate became New Zealand's first major town to lose its railway connection if one excludes the 1955 closure of the isolated Nelson Section (although it served only small settlements, it began in Nelson and was the only railway to serve the city). The branch today The remains of old railways typically perish with time due to both natural influences and human development, and the Waimate Branch is no exception. There are no readily obvious remnants of the line in the town of Waimate, though the formation between Waimate and the junction with the Main South Line can be clearly seen. Along the route of the Waimate Gorge Branch out of Waimate, the line's formation including a cutting, a bridge abutment, and some brick culverts can be located, and for about 5 km, a walkway follows the route of the line beside the Waihao River.Central South Island Tourism, \\"The Strawberry Trail\\", accessed 22 October 2007. At Waihao Forks, the old station still sits on a hillside with a carriage nearby, and at Waihao Downs, the loading bank and goods shed both exist in relatively good condition, though the goods shed has been added to on one side. Continuing past Waihao Downs, some of the formation created for the never-built extension is still visible.

He was an accomplished zoologist and paleontologist, as well as an ordained Presbyterian minister. Life Holland was born August 16, 1848 in Jamaica, West Indies, the son of Rev Francis R Holland and his wife, Eliza Augusta Wolle. He spent his early years in Salem, North Carolina, later attending Nazareth Hall, a Moravian boys' school in Pennsylvania, followed by Amherst College, (A.B., 1869), and Princeton Theological Seminary (1874). At Amherst Holland's roommate was a student from Japan, causing Holland to become interested in Japanese and to learn that language well before it was a common pursuit in the United States. In 1874 he moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to become pastor of the Bellefield Presbyterian Church in the city's Oakland neighborhood. At this time Holland was also a trustee of the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University), where he taught ancient languages. He also was active in the sciences, serving as naturalist for the United States Eclipse Expedition, which in 1887, at the bequest of the National Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Navy, explored Japan. In 1879 Holland married Carrie T. Moorhead, a daughter of a wealthy Pittsburgh family. They had three children, John M. Holland (b. 1881), who died at the age of 13 days, Moorhead Benezet Holland (1884-1946), who became vice president of the Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company, and Francis Raymond Holland (1886-1934), who became a prominent artist. In 1891 he became chancellor of Pitt, where he taught anatomy and zoology. His 1890s administration is best known for dramatically increasing the size and scope of the university (then called the Western University of Pennsylvania). In 1901 his friend Andrew Carnegie hired him as director of the Carnegie Museum, where he remained until retirement in 1922. He died on December 13, 1932 and was buried at Allegheny Cemetery, Pittsburgh. Work Holland's main interest was in lepidoptery, but he trained himself as a paleontologist when he assumed the directorship of the Carnegie Museum. As director of the Carnegie Museums, Holland achieved international renown for supervising the mounting of several casts of the sauropod dinosaur Diplodocus, a donation by Carnegie to natural history museums throughout Europe. His trip to Argentina in 1912 to install a replica of a Diplodocus, at the behest of Carnegie, is told by Holland in his 1913 travel book To the River Plate and Back.Holland, W. J. (1913). To the River Plate and Back. The narrative of a scientific mission to South America, with observations on things seen and suggested. New York & London: G. P. Putnam's Sons. The Diplodocus campaign earned him his share of international recognition as well, in the form of a French legion d'honneur and a German knight's cross, among others.Nieuwland, Ilja (2010). The colossal stranger. Andrew Carnegie and Diplodocus intrude European Culture, 1904‚Äì1912. Endeavour 34(26). Holland was America's great popularizer of butterflies and moths in the first half of the twentieth century. Holland's The Butterfly Book (1898) and The Moth Book (1903) are both still widely used. Holland donated his private collection exceeding 250,000 specimens to the Carnegie Museum . He supported active collectors worldwide, obtaining major collections from previously uncollected regions between 1890 and 1930 through the efforts of William Doherty, Herbert Huntingdon Smith, H.L. Weber, J. Steinbach, S.M. Klages and many others. Legacy The University of Pittsburgh's Holland Hall at 3990 Fifth Avenue is named in his honor. It is a student residence for 600 first-year women students and is part of the Schenley Quadrangle complex. The University Book Center is on the ground floor of Holland Hall. Holland was also interested in the history of his forebears, particularly that of his Moravian and Huguenot ancestors in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, England, and France. He amassed a considerable amount of material, comprising letters, diaries, portraits, and other artifacts, and donated it to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh, now known as the Senator John Heinz History Center. The collection includes 17 linear feet of materials and is known as the Holland Collection. ReferencesLiterature * * Holland, W. J. (1898).

The interface between matter and air, or matter and vacuum, is called a surface, and studied in surface science. In thermal equilibrium, the regions in contact are called phases, and the interface is called a phase boundary. An example for an interface out of equilibrium is the grain boundary in polycrystalline matter. The importance of the interface depends on the type of system: the bigger the quotient area/volume, the greater the effect the interface will have. Consequently, interfaces are very important in systems with large interface area-to-volume ratios, such as colloids. Interfaces can be flat or curved. For example, oil droplets in a salad dressing are spherical but the interface between water and air in a glass of water is mostly flat. Surface tension is the physical property which rules interface processes involving liquids. For a liquid film on flat surfaces, the liquid-vapor interface keeps flat to minimize interfacial area and system free energy. For a liquid film on rough surfaces, the surface tension tends to keep the meniscus flat, while the disjoining pressure makes the film conformal to the substrate. The equilibrium meniscus shape is a result of the competition between the capillary pressure and disjoining pressure. Interfaces may cause various optical phenomena, such as refraction. Optical lenses serve as an example of a practical application of the interface between glass and air. One topical interface system is the gas-liquid interface between aerosols and other atmospheric molecules.

Career=Early years While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale. He saw academia as an opportunity to make an \\"impact,\\" but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. \\"When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact.\\" With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship.

Profile Established in Plymouth in 1965 as Marine Projects (Plymouth) Ltd, Princess Yachts was bought in 1981 by South African businessman Graham J. Beck. Marine Projects became Princess Yachts International PLC in 2001. In June 2008, Beck sold a 75% stake in the business to French businessman Bernard Arnault's investment group, L Capital 2 FCPR, a division of LVMH, for 200 million euros/pounds[1]. The LVMH group includes over 60 international luxury brands, including: Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, De Beers, Mo√´t & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot and Krug. Princess Yachts operates in 119 countries and employs over 3,000 people worldwide, whilst their shipyards cover a combined area of over 1.1 million square feet.  Range of yachts  The Princess Yachts range is sub-divided into the following class types: M Class, X Class, Y Class, F Class, V Class, S Class and R Class. * M Class: super yachts ranging from 99 to 131 feet. * X Class: 'Super Flybridge' yacht at 95 feet * Y Class: motor yachts ranging from 80 to 88 feet. * F Class: flybridge yachts ranging from 47 to 69 feet. * V Class: sports yachts ranging from 42 to 66 feet. * S Class: sportbridge yachts ranging from 62 to 80 feet. * R Class: fully carbon fibre performance sports yacht at 35 feet  Partnership with BAR Technologies and Pininfarina  In January 2018, Princess Yachts announced they were partnering with BAR Technologies to create a new yacht, the Princess R Class, to be launched later in 2018(3). BAR Technologies, founded by gold medal-winning Olympian Ben Ainslie, is a team of naval architects and engineers formed to use the skills and experience built up by the British yacht racing team, Land Rover BAR. The new yacht is fully carbon fibre and features Princess‚Äô Active Foil System, resulting in Princess‚Äô fastest yacht to date. Princess also collaborated with Italian design house, Pininfarina to create the R Class' carbon-fibre monocoque hull, enhancing the boat's aerodynamics. During its development stage, the R Class has been covered in dazzle camouflage to confuse the eye and help conceal its design from competitors. The camouflage was created by Katie Sheppard, a student at the Plymouth College of Art, who won a competition to design the pattern.  Work with the Marine Conservation Society  Princess Yachts are the first luxury yacht manufacturer to officially collaborate with the Marine Conservation Society, whose aim is to support and sustain marine environments for future generations(2). The partnership began in 2016 with an awareness campaign centred around an illustrated children‚Äôs book, ‚ÄòEnid & Her Magic Yacht‚Äô, which highlights the importance of marine conservation for future generations. Princess Yachts made a three-year commitment to funding research at Eddystone Reefs, 12 miles off the South West England coast, and close to Princess‚Äô home in Plymouth. They have also sponsored two satellite tags to track turtles to help inform the Society‚Äôs efforts in conserving regional turtle populations.

History The earliest known inhabitants of the area were the Solymoi (or Solymi), also known as the Solymians, who may have spoken a Semitic language. Louis H. Feldman, 1996, Jew and Gentile in the Ancient World: Attitudes and Interactions from Alexander to Justinian. Princeton, Princeton University Press, pp. 190‚Äì1; 519‚Äì21. Later in prehistory, another people, known as the Milyae (or Milyans) migrated to the same area; they spoke an Anatolian language (Indo-European) language known as Milyan and the area was known as Milyas. According to Herodotus, Milyas was subsequently settled by a people originating in Crete, whose endonym was trmÃÉmili ‚Äì the hellenized form of this name was Termilae (Œ§ŒµœÅŒºŒØŒªŒ±Œπ). Under a leader named Sarpedon, the Termilae had been driven out of Crete (according to Herodotus) by Minos and settled in a large part of Milyas. Subsequently, the Milyae were concentrated increasingly in the adjoining mountains, whereas the Termilae remained a maritime people. The area occupied by the Termilae gradually became known to them as trmÃÉmis. Greek sources referred to trmÃÉmis as Lykia (Latin: Lycia). The reason for this, according to Greek mythology, was that an Athenian aristocrat named Lykos (Lycus) and his followers settled in trmÃÉmis, after being exiled from Athens. The land was known to the Greeks as Lukia (later Lykia; Latin Lycia) and its inhabitants were referred to as Lukiae (later Lykiae; Latin Lyciani). However, trmÃÉmili remained their endonym. From the 5th or 4th centuries BCE, Lycia came under increasing Greek social and political influences. The Lycian language became extinct and was replaced by Ancient Greek, some time around 200 BCE. Photios I of Constantinople wrote that Theopompus in one of his books mention how the Lycians, under the command of their king Pericles fought against Telmessos and they managed to corner them within their walls and forced them to negotiate.Photius, Bibliotheca excerpts, 176.3 During the Alexander the Great period, Nearchus was appointed viceroy of Lycia and of the land adjacent to it as far as mount Taurus.Arrian, Anabasis of Alexander, 3.6 Later classical scholars offer differing and sometimes plainly erroneous accounts of the Lycians. Strabo distinguishes \\"Trojan Lycians\\" from the Termilae mentioned by Herodotus.Strabo. Geographica, 12.8.4. \\"The existence of two groups of Lycians arouses suspicion that they were of the same tribe, whether it was the Trojan Lycians or those near Caria that colonized the country of the other of the two.\\"Strabo. Geographica, 12.8.5. \\"Not only the Carians, who in earlier times were islanders, but also the Leleges, as they say, became mainlanders with the aid of the Cretans, who founded, among other places, Miletus, having taken Sarpedon from the Cretan Miletus as founder; and they settled the Termilae in the country which is now called Lycia; and they say that these settlers were brought from Crete by Sarpedon, a brother of Minos and Rhadamanthus, and that he gave the name Termilae to the people who were formerly called Milyae, as Herodotus says, and were in still earlier times called Solymi, but that when Lycus the son of Pandion went over there he named the people Lycians after himself. Now this account represents the Solymi and the Lycians as the same people, but the poet makes a distinction between them.\\" Cicero, who may be unaware of the region's previous history (and subsequent hellenization), states flatly that the Lycians are a Greek tribe.Cicero, Verrine Orations, 2.4.21Cicero, Verrine Orations, 2.4.21 - LA  Culture  Lycian tomb relief at Myra, 4th century BC. Horsemen, on the tumb of Pericles, last Lycian ruler. According to Herodotus, the culture and customs of the Lycians resembled a hybrid of Cretan culture (like that of the Termilae) and that of the neighboring Carians. (The Carians spoke an Anatolian language and one might infer from this that they were closely connected culturally to the Milyae). For instance, Herodotus mentioned a unique custom, whereby Lycian males named \\"themselves after their mothers\\" and emphasized their \\"mother's female ascendants\\".Macaulay, G.C. and Lateiner, Donald. The Histories. Spark Educational Publishing, 2004, , p. 63. This passage has normally been understood as meaning that the Lycians were a matrilineal society. In Greek culture, Lycia (like Delos and Delphi) was sacred to Apollo, who was also known as Lycian, Delian and Pythian (Delphi).Diodorus Siculus, Library 1-7, 5.77.5Diodorus Siculus, Library 1-7, 5.77.5 - GR In the Homeric Hymns, Apollo is mentioned as the lord of Lycia: \\"O Lord, Lycia is yours and lovely Maeonia and Miletus, charming city by the sea, but over wave-girt Delos you greatly reign your own self\\".Homeric Hymn to Apollo, 179-181 Bacchylides in his Epinician Odes, called Apollo \\"lord of the Lycians'.Bacchylides, Epinician Odes, 13.140 Pindar in his Pythian Odes, called Apollo the \\"lord of Lycia and Delos, you who love the Castalian spring of Parnassus\\".Pindar, Pythian Odes, ŒµœÄœâŒ¥ŒÆ 2, 40 In the Aristophanes work, The Knights, at some point Cleon called Apollo, god of Lycia.Aristophanes, THe Knights, 12260 Semos the Delian wrote: \\"Some say the birth of Apollo took place in Lycia, others Delos, others Zoster in Attica, others Tegyra in Boeotia.\\"Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, T611.3 Pausanias wrote that the Lycians in Patara show a bronze bowl in their temple of Apollo, saying that Telephus dedicated it and Hephaestus made it.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 9.41.1 In addition, Clement of Alexandria wrote that the statues of Zeus and Apollo, along with the lions that were dedicated to them were created by Phidias.Clement of Alexandria, Exhortations, 4.2 Solinus wrote that the Lycians dedicated a city to Hephaestus and called it Hephaestia.Solinus, Polyhistor, 39.1 The 2nd century (CE) geographer Pausanias wrote that the Lycian poet Olen from Lycia, composed some of the oldest Greek hymns.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 9.27.2 Archaeology Throughout the 1950s, P. Demargne and H. Metzger meticulously explored the site of Xanthos in Lycia, which included an acropolis.Cook, p. 54. \\"The remainder of this survey is of necessity sketchy and selective. In LYCIA P. Demargne and H. Metzger have carried out an extensive exploration of the site of XANTHUS in the years 1950‚Äì1959. They have devoted special attention to the so-called Lycian acropolis which rises sheer above the river; this seems to have been the citadel of Xanthus in early times, with monumental tombs of its occupants on the shelf to the north. Metzger reported the discovery of Geometric pottery dating the occupation of the citadel to the 8th century BC. J.M. Cook concluded that these discoveries constituted the earliest form of material culture in Lycia since the region was uninhabited throughout prehistoric times. The Lycians may ultimately have been nomadic settlers that descended into the southwestern areas of Asia Minor only during the 8th century BC.Cook, p. 55. \\"Professor Metzger now kindly informs me that Geometric pottery has been found at the citadel, thus dating the occupation back to the eighth century (and so to the time of Homer). This is the earliest stratum encountered at Xanthus‚Äîdespite the recent researches in the field‚Äîin Lycia as a whole. The problem of Lycian origins is a baffling one. The country may have been uninhabited in prehistoric times; but it is strange if the Lycians did not descend into south-west Asia Minor until the eighth century. It may be that nomadic settlement, leaving virtually no trace behind, is in part the explanation here.\\" See also *Lycia *Lycian language *Lycian script *Carians *Mysians *Lydians ReferencesSources *Cook, J.M. \\"Greek Archaeology in Western Asia Minor\\".

Contents and history  The book provides mathematical knowledge and skills for computer science, especially for the analysis of algorithms. According to the preface, the topics in Concrete Mathematics are \\"a blend of CONtinuous and disCRETE mathematics\\". Calculus is frequently used in the explanations and exercises. The term \\"concrete mathematics\\" also denotes a complement to \\"abstract mathematics\\". The book is based on a course begun in 1970 by Knuth at Stanford University. The book expands on the material (approximately 100 pages) in the \\"Mathematical Preliminaries\\" section of Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. Consequently, some readers use it as an introduction to that series of books. Concrete Mathematics has an informal and often humorous style. The authors reject what they see as the dry style of most mathematics textbooks. The margins contain \\"mathematical graffiti\\", comments submitted by the text's first editors: Knuth and Patashnik's students at Stanford. As with many of Knuth's books, readers are invited to claim a reward for any error found in the book‚Äîin this case, whether an error is \\"technically, historically, typographically, or politically incorrect\\". The book popularized some mathematical notation: the Iverson bracket, floor and ceiling functions, and notation for rising and falling factorials.

It travels within portions of Muscogee, Harris, Talbot, Meriwether, Coweta, Fayette, and Clayton counties. It connects the Columbus and Forest Park areas, via Manchester, Woodbury, Senoia, Fayetteville, and Riverdale. Route description SR 85 begins at an intersection with US 27/SR 1 (Veterans Parkway) in downtown Columbus, within Muscogee County. It heads west on 14th Street, before turning north on 2nd Avenue. It continues to the north, until it meets the southern terminus of SR 22 Conn., which takes on the \\"2nd Avenue\\" name. At this intersection, SR 85 heads east on Manchester Expressway and meets SR 219 (River Road) before it has a second intersection with US 27/SR 1 (Veterans Parkway). At this intersection, US 27 Alt. begins, running concurrent with SR 85\\\\. The two routes continue to the east, to an interchange with Interstate 185 (I-185), then curve to the northeast on the south side of Peachtree Mall, which is located just south of the Columbus Airport. Just past the mall, the highways become a limited-access highway. They have an interchange with Warm Springs Road, which leads to Cooper Creek Park. They head to an interchange with Miller Road, which leads to the neighborhood of Crystal Valley. To the northeast is US 80/SR 22/SR 540\\\\. Then, they meet County Line Road, which leads to Midland. This road is actually about south of the Muscogee‚ÄìHarris county line. In Harris County, the concurrency skirts past the Woodland Hills Golf Course. Just before entering Ellerslie, the limited-access highway ends. A little while later, SR 315 joins the concurrency, and leaves it in town. US 27 Alt./SR 85 head to Waverly Hall, where they intersect SR 208\\\\. On the Harris‚ÄìTalbot county line, the two routes meet SR 85 Alt./SR 116\\\\. At this intersection, US 27 Alt. north/SR 85 Alt. north/SR 116 west take the left fork, on Warm Springs Road, while SR 85 north/SR 116 east take the right one. Less than into Talbot County, SR 116 splits off to the east, while SR 85 continues to the northeast. Just before entering Manchester is SR 41, which begins a short concurrency. Almost immediately, the two highways enter Meriwether County and Manchester. They intersect the eastern terminus of SR 190 (Pine Mountain Highway) just after the city limits. At 2nd Street, SR 41 departs to the northwest, while SR 85 heads into downtown Manchester. At Foster Street, SR 85 turns to the east, while SR 85 Spur continues straight ahead, on Truitt Street. In Woodbury, it meets SR 18/SR 74/SR 109 (Woodbury Highway). At this intersection, SR 74 turns to the north, concurrent with SR 85\\\\. They reach the northern terminus of SR 85 Alternate (Whitehouse Parkway). Farther to the north-northwest, in Gay, is the eastern terminus of SR 109 Spur (Greenville Street). In the unincorporated community of Alps, they intersect SR 362, which briefly joins the concurrency. Less than later, they reach the Meriwether‚ÄìCoweta county line. The concurrent highways travel through Haralson and enter the southeast part of Senoia. There, they intersect with SR 16 (Wells Street). Less than later, they cross over Line Creek, into Fayette County. They enter Starrs Mill, where SR 74 (Joel Cowan Parkway) departs to the northwest, while SR 85 continues to the northeast. In Fayetteville, it intersects SR 92, which forms a concurrency through the city. Then, they intersect SR 54\\\\. After that, SR 92 departs to the northwest. Next, is the southern terminus of SR 314\\\\. Farther on, in Kenwood, is the southern terminus of SR 279\\\\. After that, SR 85 crosses over Camp Creek, into Clayton County. On the southwestern edge of Riverdale, it intersects SR 138\\\\. Approximately later is the southern terminus of SR 139 (Church Street). Farther to the north-northeast is the western terminus of SR 331 (Forest Parkway), which the northbound lanes of SR 85 have to take to access I-75. SR 85's northbound lanes continue for another , and then they end at a U-turn to go back to the south. However, the southbound lanes actually start at a partial interchange with I-75 (which does not have access from I-75 north to SR 85) and I-285, approximately farther to the north-northeast. There are two sections of SR 85 that are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: * From its southern terminus to the Muscogee‚ÄìHarris county line, south-southwest of Ellerslie * From its intersection with SR 54 in Fayetteville to its northern terminus Major intersectionsHistory=1930s In 1930, SR 85 was established from Columbus to SR 41 in Warm Springs, with the Muscogee County portion and a small portion just slightly north of the Muscogee‚ÄìHarris county line having a completed hard surface. By the middle of 1933, the portion of the highway from about Ellerslie to Warm Springs had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. The next year, the segment of the highway just south-southwest of Warm Springs was shifted westward to a curve into the city. In 1935, SR 85 was extended southeast on SR 41 to Manchester and then north-northeast through Woodbury and Senoia and into Fayetteville. At the end of 1936, two segments were under construction: around Shiloh and just west-southwest of Warm Springs. A few months later, SR 85 was extended north-northeast to US 19/US 41/SR 3 in Hapeville. By the middle of the year, a portion from approximately halfway between Waverly Hall and Shiloh to Warm Springs was under construction. Near the end of the year, the entire highway from Columbus to just south-southwest of Waverly Hall had a completed hard surface. A portion north-northeast of Waverly Hall was under construction, while the rest of the Waverly Hall‚ÄìWarm Springs segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. In 1938, a portion about halfway between Woodbury and Gay was under construction. A portion south of the Meriwether‚ÄìCoweta county line under construction, as well. The portion just north-northeast of Riverdale was under construction, while the rest of the Riverdale‚ÄìHapeville segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By mid-1939, a small portion just south of Waverly Hall had a completed hard surface. Near the end of the year, a small portion just north-northeast of Senoia had a completed hard surface. The year ended with the segment from Waverly Hall to Warm Springs having a completed hard surface. 1940s In 1940, SR 163 was built from Warm Springs to Woodbury. From Manchester to approximately halfway between it and Woodbury, as well as the Gay‚ÄìOakland and Clayton County portions, SR 85 was under construction. From approximately halfway between Woodbury and Gay into Gay, SR 85 had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1941, SR 163's segment just northeast of Warm Springs was under construction. At the end of the year, a portion of SR 85 just east-northeast of Manchester, as well as a segment from the Fayette‚ÄìClayton county line to Riverdale, had a completed hard surface. At this time, a portion of the highway from south of Woodbury had completed grading, but was not surfaced. In 1942, a portion of SR 163 northeast of Warm Springs, as well as the Fayette County portion of the Fayetteville‚ÄìRiverdale segment of SR 85, had completed grading, but was not surfaced. SR 85, from north-northeast of Starrs Mill to Fayetteville was under construction. The next year, a portion northeast of Manchester had a completed hard surface. In 1944, a portion south of Woodbury had a sand clay or top soil surface. Also, the Gay‚ÄìAlvaton segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the end of 1946, SR 85 was shifted eastward to a more direct path between Columbus and Manchester. Its old path between south of Shiloh and Warm Springs was redesignated as a southerly extension of SR 163\\\\. SR 85 Spur was built in Manchester from SR 41 to SR 85\\\\. The entire length of SR 85 from Columbus to Chalybeate Springs had a completed hard surface. A small portion north- northeast of Chalybeate Springs had a sand clay or top soil surface; the portion from there to Woodbury had a completed hard surface. Between 1946 and 1948, the Chalybeate Springs‚ÄìWoodbury and Starrs Mill‚ÄìHapeville segments had a completed hard surface, while the Woodbury‚ÄìSenoia segment had a \\"sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth\\" surface. The next year, from Woodbury to just north-northwest of Gay, SR 85 had a completed hard surface. 1950s By the middle of 1950, US 27 Alt. was designated on SR 85 between Columbus and a point south of Shiloh and on SR 163 from there to Warm Springs. The segment of SR 85 from just north-northwest of Gay to Starrs Mill had a completed hard surface. By 1952, SR 163 was redesignated as SR 85W. That year, SR 85W's segment south of Warm Springs was reverted to being designated as SR 163. The next year, this was undone. Also, the segment of SR 85W from Warm Springs to Woodbury had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1955, this segment was hard surfaced. Two years later, SR 85 from south of Shiloh to Woodbury was redesignated as SR 85E. 1960s to 1990s Between 1960 and 1963, US 27 Alt. was shifted eastward onto SR 85E from south of Shiloh to Manchester. Between 1963 and 1966, the northern terminus was truncated to its current location in the extreme western part of Forest Park. About thirty years later, SR 85W was redesignated SR 85 Alt., while SR 85E was redesignated as part of the SR 85 mainline again. Special routes=State Route 85 Alternate State Route 85 Alternate (SR 85 Alt.) is a alternate route of SR 85 that connects the Shiloh and Woodbury areas, via Warm Springs.

Early life Rudolph was born in Los Angeles, the son of Oscar Rudolph (1911-1991), a television director and actor. He became interested in film and was a prot√©g√© of director Robert Altman. Rudolph worked as an assistant director on Altman's film adaptation of Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye and later on his original movie Nashville. Career Rudolph's films focus upon isolated and eccentric characters and their relationships, and frequently are ensemble pieces featuring prominent romanticism and fantasy. He has written almost all of his films, and repeatedly has worked with actors Keith Carradine and Genevi√®ve Bujold, and composer Mark Isham (see List of noted film director and composer collaborations). Director Rudolph came to prominence with Choose Me (1984), the story of the sexual relationships among a handful of lonely, but charming, people ‚Äì an ex-prostitute bar owner (Lesley Ann Warren), an emotionally repressed radio talk show hostess (Bujold), and a disarmingly honest madman (Carradine). Trouble in Mind (1985) featured Kris Kristofferson as well as Bujold, Carradine and John Waters icon Divine. The film was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival. The Moderns (1988) was a love story, set in 1926 Paris, about an expatriate American artist (Carradine) re-igniting his love for his wife (Linda Fiorentino), despite her marriage with a sinister, philistine art collector played by John Lone. In 1990, Rudolph wrote and directed the private eye love story Love at Large, which was filmed in Portland, Oregon. After the thriller Mortal Thoughts (1991) starring Demi Moore, Equinox (1992) starred Matthew Modine as a pair of separated twins, and Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994) was a loving recreation of the Algonquin Round Table and a sympathetic biopic of Dorothy Parker, with Jennifer Jason Leigh in the title role.

History The site of the Fifth Third Center was occupied by the Hollenden House from 1890‚Äì1989. The original Hollenden House Hotel was built in 1890 but demolished in 1963. In 1963, as demolition of the Old Hollenden House Hotel was occurring, the foundation for a new 1960s style hotel was being built. In 1989, developer John Galbreath, who had his hand in the Erieview and One Cleveland Center project, worked with Japan's Nissi Iwho Realty Trust of Tokyo to build a new Tower. In 1989, Citibank agreed to finance the construction of the tower. It cost $70,000,000 to build. In 1990, as construction was progressing, Bank One Corporation took five floors and renamed the Tower as Bank One Center. Bank One stayed in the tower from 1991‚Äì2003. In 2002, Bank One was acquired in a massive merger with JP Morgan Chase. In 2003, Chase reduced its Cleveland presence and Bank One moved its Cleveland Operations from its Tower to the Penton/IBM/Bond Court Tower.

The building has 35 stories and rises to a height of , and was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Construction on the building was finished in 1980. It served as the headquarters for the now defunct National City Corporation, and is now the Cleveland-area offices for PNC Financial Services. History In 1975, National City Bank had many of its office functions scattered in Downtown Cleveland. National City almost had moved from Downtown Cleveland to a suburban location but opted to remain in Downtown Cleveland. In 1977, National City announced plans for a new corporate headquarters in Downtown Cleveland. The cost was set at $50 million. Tax abatement, then a new form of financing, was used in its construction. Tax Abatement started in New York City under then Mayor Abraham Beame to spur growth in New York City after its default in 1975. Tax Abatement is used to cut property taxes to develop a property. In 1976, then Cleveland Mayor Ralph Perk brought NYC's idea to Cleveland. In 1977, National City Bank became the first Cleveland company and project to use tax abatement. The site of National City was a complex one. The site had the old Bond Clothing Store complex (1947‚Äì49) and before that was the Hickox Building (1874‚Äì1947). There was an adult movie house that showed X-rated movies named the Roxy. These buildings were demolished in 1978 and construction began for the tower. The National City Bank Tower rises from a seven-foot pad of concrete. The tower itself was not built with steel, instead it became Cleveland's tallest reinforced concrete structure. A floor was poured and jacked up 1 floor a week. The skin of the National City Bank Tower is a White Travertine Marble. During the day, National City Bank is whitish in color. At night, National City is bathed in light. During October, it is bathed in pink light for National Breast Cancer month which National City Bank sponsors research in. When the Tower opened in 1980, National City occupied the tower as its own. Other tenants include KPMG, and several law firms, including Baker Hostetler. A kinetic sculpture by George Rickey named Triple L Excentric Gyratory III sits outside the building. In August 2009, PNC Financial Services replaced the National City sign atop of the building with its own, following the acquisition of National City by PNC in late 2008.

It was adjacent to the Fernhill Branch and was, in the words of David Leitch and Brian Scott, essentially \\"an industrial service siding rejoicing in the status of a branch line.\\" Construction The line was built to serve coal mines and ran east from the Main South Line, with the junction at Green Island. Construction commenced on 17 February 1874, and on 2 July 1874, it was open some 3.22 kilometres to Walton Park.Otago Witness, 31 March 1898, \\"Chronological Index of the Settlement of Otago: 1874\\", accessed 13 October 2007. Five years later, a brief extension of 0.77 km was opened to Saddle Hill on 24 September 1879. The only structure associated with the branch built along its entire length was a shelter shed at Walton Park. Operation The Walton Park Branch's operations were of little significance. A review in 1895 said the line was in good order, and nothing of any note occurred until the section from Walton Park to Saddle Hill closed on 24 July 1944. This event in itself was so unremarkable that the railways annual report failed to mention it. After this stage, the branch was shunted only when required and did not even appear on the public timetable by 1950. Coal traffic ceased seven years later and official closure occurred on 1 May 1957, though the first 0.58 km to Geddes was retained and used as a spur until 1 January 1980, and had necessitated the construction of an expensive underpass tunnel when the long drawn out construction of the Dunedin Southern Motorway began in the 1970s. The branch today Very little remains of the Walton Park Branch. In 2000 the Southern Motorway extension was built over the formation to Saddle Hill. Commercial and residential development has obliterated the rest of the old formation, though some is still visible from State Highway 1, a significant relic being the motorway underpass tunnel at Green Island. The rather unremarkable line is just as unremarkable in death as it was in life.

The Capcom Five are five video games that were unveiled by Capcom in late 2002 and published from March 2003. At a time when Nintendo's GameCube console had failed to capture market share, Capcom announced five new GameCube titles with the apparent goal of boosting hardware sales and showing off third-party developer support. Capcom USA followed up with confirmation that they would be exclusive to the GameCube. The five games were P.N.03, a futuristic third-person shooter; Viewtiful Joe, a side-scrolling action-platformer; Dead Phoenix, a shoot 'em up; Resident Evil 4, a survival horror third-person shooter; and Killer7, an action- adventure game with first-person shooter elements. Though not directly related to each other, they were all overseen by Resident Evil director Shinji Mikami and, except Killer7, developed by Capcom's Production Studio 4. Capcom USA later clarified that only Resident Evil 4 was intended to be exclusive; the initial announcement was due to a miscommunication with their parent company. Of the five games, Dead Phoenix was canceled and only P.N.03 remained a GameCube exclusive. It was a critical and commercial failure. Both Viewtiful Joe and Killer7 sold modestly, the former despite critical acclaim and the latter owing to polarized reviews. Killer7 gained a significant cult following, effectively launching the career of director Suda51. Resident Evil 4 was the runaway success of the five, though its GameCube sales were undercut by the announcement of a PlayStation 2 port to be released later in 2005. Viewtiful Joe also saw a PlayStation 2 version with expanded features, and Killer7 debuted on multiple platforms simultaneously. Since the release of the Nintendo 64, Nintendo has struggled to attract third-party developers like Capcom to produce games for its systems. Industry analysts see the Capcom Five case, particularly the loss of GameCube exclusivity for Resident Evil 4, as a major blow to Nintendo‚ÄìCapcom relations and is emblematic of Nintendo's failure to attract third-party support during the GameCube era. Background During the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super NES (SNES) eras, Nintendo and Capcom enjoyed a close relationship, with Mega Man as one of the NES' most prominent franchises. This closeness was partially due to Nintendo's monopoly of the video game console market, which allowed the company to compel third-party developers to release exclusive content according to Nintendo's schedule. Sega's rival Genesis system forced Nintendo to relax some of its restrictions on third parties with respect to the SNES. However, relations with third-party developers reached a turning point when Nintendo decided to retain a proprietary cartridge-based format for the Nintendo 64, in the face of Sony's disc-based PlayStation. Due to increased manufacturing costs and severely limited cartridge memory capacity, many third parties‚ÄîCapcom included‚Äîmoved to the PlayStation to start new franchises, such as Resident Evil. On this new platform, developers could create bigger games while avoiding the restriction of ordering the manufacture of expensive proprietary cartridges through Nintendo, which could lead to under- or overstocking inventory which might eat into revenue. This third-party abandonment allowed the PlayStation to outsell the Nintendo 64 during that console generation. With the GameCube, Nintendo tried to reclaim third-party developers and catch up to Sony's PlayStation 2 by featuring disc-based media and powerful system hardware. However, in the first year after its launch, Nintendo sold 4.7 million consoles. In this climate of flagging sales, Capcom held a surprise press conference in Japan in November 2002, announcing five new titles for the GameCube: P.N.03, Viewtiful Joe, Dead Phoenix, Resident Evil 4, and Killer7. The games would be developed in-house by Capcom's Production with Resident Evil 1 director Shinji Mikami as supervisor. The lone exception was Killer7, to be produced at Grasshopper Manufacture, with Mikami as co-writer alongside director Suda51. When pressed for comment on console exclusivity, a Capcom USA representative confirmed the claim, generating the perception that Capcom was hoping to boost the GameCube's sales and reputation. A statement on their website echoed this support for GameCube. However, Capcom USA soon rescinded their confirmation, blaming it on a miscommunication with the parent company. They clarified that only Resident Evil 4 would definitely be exclusive. Release and reception=P.N.03 P.N.03 is a science fiction-themed third-person shooter, released in Japan on March 27, 2003. The game features a dexterous protagonist named Vanessa Z. Schneider who battles an army of maverick robots. The game earned the name Jaguar during development due to Vanessa's fluid motions and agility. Acting as director, Mikami attempted to differentiate it from Devil May Cry by adding defensive and evasive maneuvers. This desire, combined with the limited development time, also led to the replacement of Vanessa's guns with energy bolts. Upon its release, reviewers criticized the game's short length and sluggish controls, with an average score of 63 out of 100 on Metacritic. Mikami was unsatisfied with the finished product, stating he had hoped to put \\"a lot more\\" time into its development. P.N.03 was the only game of the five that remained a GameCube exclusive. Viewtiful Joe Viewtiful Joe is a 2.5D side-scrolling action-platformer, released on June 26, 2003. The title character is a parody of tokusatsu superheroes and is trying to save his girlfriend, who has been trapped in \\"Movieland\\" by a group of supervillains known as Jadow. To complete his quest, Joe must use his Viewtiful Effects Powers, which are based on camera tricks and special effects used in films. These include \\"Slow\\", which simulates bullet time; \\"Mach Speed\\", allowing Joe to attack all enemies with his afterimages; and \\"Zoom In\\", which triggers a camera close-up and unlocks special attacks. Internally, Capcom treated the game as a \\"staff-focused project\\" with the goal of increasing the skills of director Hideki Kamiya. The game achieved a Metacritic score of 93 and won GameCube Game of the Year awards from numerous publications including IGN, GMR, and USA Today. The game sold out its initial shipment of 100,000 to achieve a lifetime total of 275,000 units. Producer Atsushi Inaba considered the game a success, achieving his goals of training staff, keeping a small budget, and selling well. However, these numbers were lower than Capcom expected, prompting the publisher to port Viewtiful Joe to PlayStation 2 in 2004, with expanded features. This version sold 46,000 copies with a slightly lower Metacritic score of 90 owing to the lack of progressive scan and frame rate slowdown generated by the porting process. Dead Phoenix alt=A man with wings, at bottom, soars through a canyon inhabited by a large horned demon. An aiming reticle on the demon's head shows where the man will shoot. Dead Phoenix was going to be a 3D shoot 'em up featuring a winged man named Phoenix. Based on trailer footage, IGN compared the gameplay to Panzer Dragoon. Players would take control of a winged man as he flies around shooting massive enemies, with the aid of allies on foot. Capcom's announcement described the setting as a mythical floating city, full of monsters and dragons. Game Informer announced that a Japanese release was planned in mid-2003. The game was believed to be canceled by May 2003, but Capcom stated at a press conference prior to the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that it was still in development. IGN speculated that the game may have been retooled as a new Kid Icarus title, based on Nintendo's trend in the early 2000s of licensing properties to third parties. It was canceled in August 2003 after failing to appear at E3. Resident Evil 4 Resident Evil 4, a survival horror third-person shooter, had its North American premiere on January 11, 2005, and its Japanese release on January 27. Players take on the role of Leon S. Kennedy, a United States Secret Service agent who has been ordered to rescue the daughter of the President of the United States from a cult in rural hispanophone Europe. The cult has been using a mind-controlling parasite to turn local villagers into violent drones. The game went through numerous changes during its long development‚Äîthe team created and discarded four prototypes before settling on the final product. Among these was a version directed by Hideki Kamiya that would be turned into the first Devil May Cry game. Taking over directorial duties, Mikami made the fifth and final version very different compared to previous Resident Evil games, with an over-the-shoulder perspective and an increased emphasis on action and combat. Resident Evil 4 was the only game of the five to remain confirmed as a GameCube exclusive; Mikami claimed that he would \\"cut his own head off\\" (a Japanese colloquialism for quitting his job) if it were to be released on another platform. However, just two months before the game's January 2005 release, Capcom revealed that a PlayStation 2 port would be published nine months after the GameCube version in response to pressure from users and shareholders. This surprise announcement undercut the title's GameCube sales, which totaled 1.6 million, compared to the sales of the PlayStation 2 version, which exceeded 2 million. Mikami apologized to GameCube fans for failing to uphold his promise of console exclusivity. Despite these corporate conflicts, the game received an overwhelmingly positive critical response with Metacritic scores of 96 for both versions. It went on to sweep many Game of the Year awards for 2005 and is consistently listed among the greatest games of all time. Killer7 Killer7, released on June 9, 2005, is an action-adventure game with first-person shooter elements and an unconventional \\"on rails\\" control scheme. Unlike other members of the five, Killer7 was developed at Grasshopper Manufacture under the direction of Suda51. Players control the members of an elite group of assassins who are actually physical manifestations of a god-like being named Harman Smith. The game restricts the player's movement to specific branching paths through the environment and combat is only available while stationary in first-person view. This stripped-down control scheme was implemented as a deconstruction of conventional control mechanics. Gameplay was not finalized until late in development as Suda51 concentrated most resources on story and visual work. This back-loading of development resulted in several delays, the last of which was due to an artistic desire to release the game on July 7 (7/7) in North America. Killer7 debuted as a multi-console release, the only one of the five to do so, to polarized reviews. Some reviewers praised the game for its complex noir plot involving a political conflict between Japan and the US, while others panned it as confusing and incomprehensible. Similarly, the control scheme had both critics and proponents, the latter comparing it to Myst, Snatcher, and other \\"old-school\\" adventure games. Although it received a lukewarm 74 Metacritic score, Killer7 was honored by many video game publications in their year-end awards. Common nominations included \\"Best Story\\", \\"Best Artistic Design\\", and \\"Most Innovative Design\\". However, the central theme was a recognition of Killer7's status as a cult game with limited appeal. IGN named it \\"Best Game No One Played\\" and Kristan Reed of Eurogamer called it \\"a concept game, an arthouse game, a simple game, an often beautiful game, but most certainly never an everyman's game\\". Legacy The Capcom Five announcement came at a time when Nintendo had been struggling with its new console, with the apparent goal of supporting the fledgling system. However, each successive game's release reinforced Capcom's view that the GameCube was unprofitable; they ported the games one-by-one to Sony's PlayStation 2. These ports were generally inferior in quality: many reviewers noted slowdown issues and lower resolution graphics. Ultimately, four games were released and only one remained exclusive to GameCube. This lone GameCube exclusive was P.N.03 and not Resident Evil 4, as Capcom had repeatedly emphasized in press releases. GameCube owners and Nintendo fans were disappointed by the Capcom Five's failure to improve the GameCube's reputation and sales. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku noted that despite best intentions, Capcom's five even at their full potential could not have made up for the GameCube's failings in that generation's console wars. The dramatic reversal of the five is representative of the attitudes of third-party developers toward Nintendo's platform. Capcom discovered a few business principles through their experience with development and release of the five. The first was to focus on multi-platform releases. Second, Capcom needed to streamline development. Prior to the five, the company had announced expected losses of US$103 million for fiscal year 2002, largely due to poor sales and extended development times, and ultimately posted over US$163 million in losses. Resident Evil 4 was a case in point, beginning development in 1999 and going through four discarded versions by the time of its 2005 release. The third lesson was to focus on old franchises rather than create new ones; Resident Evil 4 was the only unmitigated commercial success of the five and also the only game based on an existing property. To wit, Viewtiful Joe 2 started development shortly after the release of Viewtiful Joe and was completed just a year later. However, the brisk schedule meant that the team was not given time to implement all the features they had wanted, including a cooperative gameplay mode. Viewtiful Joe 2 debuted on both GameCube and PlayStation 2 to reach a wider audience and maximize profitability. Shinji Mikami left Capcom in 2006 after the company closed Clover Studio, which developed Viewtiful Joe 2. To facilitate Viewtiful Joe 2s development, Capcom turned \\"Team Viewtiful\\" into Clover Studio, a semi-autonomous production company with a focus on developing new intellectual properties (IPs). The separation was also in part due to Resident Evil 4s PlayStation 2 release, which caused significant tensions between Capcom and Mikami, who had touted the game's console exclusivity. However, the studio only produced two new IPs before Capcom closed it in late 2006, following the resignations of Atsushi Inaba, Hideki Kamiya, and Shinji Mikami. These resignations were part of a series of high-profile departures from Capcom, including Yoshiki Okamoto in 2003 and Keiji Inafune in 2010. The former Clover developers charged that Capcom's corporate management was reluctant or actively opposed to risky new ideas, a complaint shared by Inafune. They would go on to found PlatinumGames with members of their old studio. In 2008, they announced the \\"Platinum Three\\", referring to MadWorld, Infinite Space, and Bayonetta, which would attempt to carry on the Capcom Five's ambitious and creative original spirit. Outside of Capcom, Killer7 served as a turning point for Suda51 and his studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, effectively launching his career. With Capcom as publisher, Killer7 was his first game to be released outside Japan. While its sales were not up to Capcom's standards, the game's cult success encouraged the director to remake two of his older Japan-only games, The Silver Case and Flower, Sun, and Rain, for Western release. It also allowed his next major title, No More Heroes, to be released to critical and commercial success. The game also cemented Suda51's status as an auteur video game director. He would later work with Shinji Mikami again on Shadows of the Damned. Despite the relative failure of the project as a whole, the individual games of the Capcom Five had a lasting impact on game design. After experimenting with action gameplay in P.N.03, Mikami was able to apply his experience to Vanquish, which serves as an evolution and refinement of the former's gameplay. On the other hand, Adam Sorice of Nintendojo suggested that the commercial failure of such a women-driven game made Capcom reluctant to feature female leads in future games for a number of years. Beyond its critical success, Resident Evil 4 became one of the most influential games of the decade. Its \\"over-the-shoulder\\" perspective has inspired third-person shooters and action games as diverse as Gears of War and Batman: Arkham Asylum. Leon's precision-aiming laser sight has also found its way into Dead Space and Grand Theft Auto, as an alternative to \\"lock-on\\" targeting. On a broader scale, Resident Evil 4 deconstructed the survival horror conventions the first Resident Evil games established. Some reviewers accused the game of abandoning the genre's essence by adopting an increased emphasis on action and combat. Following Resident Evil 4s lead, many \\"horror\\" games in the next few years would shift toward more combat-heavy gameplay, including Silent Hill: Homecoming and Alone in the Dark. According to industry sources, Capcom's reversal on GameCube exclusivity, particularly with Resident Evil 4, was a betrayal that soured relations between Capcom and Nintendo for several years. After this early pulling of Capcom support, the GameCube went on to sell 22 million units, less than the Nintendo 64's 33 million units and only a fraction of the PlayStation 2's 155 million units. Though Resident Evil 4 was eventually ported to Nintendo's Wii in 2007, it also received a high- definition re-release for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. The 2002 GameCube remake of Resident Evil and Resident Evil Zero also received remasters for newer consoles in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Super Smash Bros. Brawl was released in 2008, featuring third party characters like Solid Snake from Konami and Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega as a selling point. Kotaku reported on a rumor that Nintendo refused to include a character from Capcom as a direct result of Resident Evil 4s multi-platform release. Years later, Capcom's own Mega Man and Ryu appeared as playable characters in the next game in the series, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, with both returning for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate along with the debut of Ken Masters. Ultimately, the GameCube failed to reinvigorate flagging support from third parties, a trend continued from the Nintendo 64 through its successors, the Wii and Wii U. The Wii had mostly relied on first-party titles to sell systems until 2009 when in-house development could not keep up with demand for new material. This caused sales to drop and prompted a shift toward more aggressive courting of third-party developers. Despite this, the Wii would go on to become one of the most commercially successful home video game consoles of all time. For the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo attempted to recruit outside developers early on to avoid a repeat of what happened to the Wii and reclaim the third-party support it enjoyed in the NES and SNES eras, though low Wii U sales resulted in continued poor third-party support until the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017.

It includes three buildings, the largest of which is a 29-story, tower commonly known by its previous name of Ameritrust Tower and formerly known as the Cleveland Trust Tower. The tower was completed in 1971 and is an example of brutalist architecture, the only high-rise building designed by Marcel Breuer and Hamilton Smith. The complex also includes the adjacent Cleveland Trust Company Building, completed in 1908, and the Swetland Building. Although plans called for a second mirror-image tower, the second building was never constructed. The Breuer tower initially served as headquarters for Ameritrust Bank before its merger with Society Bank. Society Bank has since merged with Key Bank. The tower was vacant from 1996 until September 2014, before it was converted to apartments and a hotel as part of a larger project involving the other buildings in the complex. The space also includes a wine cellar and restaurant. The rotunda was renovated and reopened as a Heinen's Fine Foods grocery store in 2015 and the Swetland Building was restored for residential use. PNC Center looking north up East 9th.alt=center Ameritrust Tower 1997 proposal In 1990, developer Richard Jacobs proposed constructing a new tower for the AmeriTrust Corporation on Cleveland's Public Square. About $500 million was budgeted for the project. The Architectural firm of Kohn Pedersen Fox or KPF of New York City would have designed the new AmeriTrust Tower. Coincidentally, KPF would have designed the new Cuyahoga County Administration Building which was planned in the late 2000s to replace the Ameritrust Tower (built in 1971). In 1992, Ameritrust merged with Society Bank (now KeyBank), obviating the need for the Ameritrust Tower. Had the Ameritrust Tower been built, The Tower was planned to have a curved glass curtain wall, a Hyatt Hotel, and high-end shopping including Giorgio Armani and Versace as anchor tenants. 2005 Purchase In 2005, Cuyahoga County purchased the tower, the historic Cleveland Trust Company rotunda, and several other surrounding structures from the Jacobs Group for use as the site for a new county headquarters. On March 29, 2007, the Cuyahoga County Commissioners voted to demolish the tower and to replace it with a new building to be designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox.Miller, Jay. \\"Ameritrust Tower to come down\\", Crain's Cleveland Business. 2007-03-29. Two commissioners, James \\"Jimmy\\" Dimora and Timothy Hagan, wanted to demolish the tower, while commissioner Peter Lawson- Jones supported renovation. The Cleveland Planning Commission approved demolition of the landmark Ameritrust Tower, to the chagrin of preservationists, who argued that the county would destroy a valued piece of architecture. A June 2008 Cleveland Magazine article said that the county's own consultants told commissioners that it would be cheaper and more prudent to renovate the tower for its own use. However, later in 2007, the Cuyahoga County Commissioners, claiming a desire to devote more of their energies for Medical Mart and Convention Center, decided to attempt to sell the complex to private developers. The County declared that it would not sell the property for less than $35 million, which represented the purchase price plus expenditures on the property, including the removal of asbestos. The only bid on the complex was submitted by the K&D; group of Willoughby, Ohio, for $35,005,000. The deal fell apart in 2009. Federal investigators scrutinized the 2005 purchase of the Ameritrust complex, the attempted sale, and the removal of the asbestos as part of their probe into corruption in the Cuyahoga County government. In 2012, federal prosecutors alleged that attorney Anthony Calabrese III had offered to bribe county employee J. Kevin Kelley in 2005 if Kelley could convince Dimora to vote to purchase the complex. The accusation was contained in a witness-tampering charge against Calabrese, which was later dropped. 2013 Sale and Rebranding In December 2012, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald announced that the County would sell the Ameritrust complex, including the tower, the rotunda building, and two other office buildings to the Geis Companies of Streetsboro, Ohio, for $27 million. Geis Cos. agreed to raze the smaller buildings, known as the P&H; buildings, and to build an eight story office building to be used by the County as a consolidated headquarters building. The parties envisioned that the county would move about 750 employees into the newly constructed building from eight other locations by mid-2014. The County agreed to make lease payments of $6.7 million on 222,000 square feet of space for a period of 26 years with a County option to buy the new building at the end of the term for $1. Chaim Schochet argued against the project stating that the last thing Cleveland needed was more office space and instead proposed that the headquarters be put on the first six floors of the half vacant Huntington Bank Building owned by Optima Ventures.Cleveland Plain Dealer: \\"Optima Ventures challenges Cuyahoga County on planned headquarters, Ameritrust deal\\" By Michelle Jarboe McFee January 02, 2013 The Cuyahoga County Council approved the sale in January 2013.

The station carries a variety of mostly news-oriented programming from broadcasters outside the United States, in several languages. In Pinellas County, WZRA is available on WOW! cable TV channel 122 and on Spectrum digital channel 948. WZRA is also on channel 24 on Verizon FiOS throughout the market, as far south as Sarasota County. The station also offers a live feed of its programming on the Internet. Programming Most of WZRA's programming is Greek, aimed for the Greek audience in Tarpon Springs, but the channel also offers programming in other languages, such as Italian and English. WZRA also presents daily newscasts from Greece (from ERT), which (reflecting the station's Greek ownership) makes up the majority of the station's evening, overnight and Sunday programming. The station carries programs from the national broadcasters in Russia (RT) and Italy (RAI) as well as local news from Newfoundland's NTV, aimed at Canadian \\"snowbirds.\\" WZRA carried CTV Television Network newscasts in the early 21st century; they also carried Dini Petty's CTV talk show, via NTV, until CTV cancelled the series' repeats in the early-2000s. The station carries general entertainment programs from Youtoo America during the morning hours between Monday and Saturday. History When the station signed on the late-1990s, channel 48 went by the translator-style call sign W48AY, and used the moniker \\"Bay TV\\". When the station became a Class A station in the early 2000s, the call sign changed to WZRA-CA, though at present, it is unknown for what the call sign meant, or if they were randomly chosen by the FCC. WZRA originally had its transmitter in Oldsmar, broadcasting at 41.7 kW. They since relocated to a 150 kW transmitter, broadcasting from facilities near the corner of US 19 and Palmetto Road in Port Richey, increasing coverage in west Pasco and southwestern Hernando counties, but reducing coverage in Hillsborough and central Pinellas. They have since filed a construction permit to flash cut channel 48 to a digital signal, still broadcasting from Port Richey, but at 15 kW. On July 8, 2015, this construction permit was granted. As of April 2017, WZRA-CD only broadcast programming on Channel 48-3. Bright House dispute in Tarpon Springs Until mid-February 2006, WZRA was seen on Bright House channel 15 in the Tarpon Springs area. But on that date, WZRA was unceremoniously replaced with Tarpon Springs' local government channel, which, at its debut, was mainly a promo loop for an upcoming municipal election, plus live City Commission meetings. Prior to December 2007 (when all local public service channels moved to the digital tier), Bright House allocated channel 15 for local Government-access television in Pinellas County, and had given that slot to WZRA on an interim basis, until Tarpon Springs started their own channel. And with WZRA being a low-powered station, Bright House is not obligated to carry the channel. Since being dropped, WZRA received thousands of calls in support of the station, especially from the Greek community. Support was so huge, WZRA's station manager Angelos Angelatos urged their viewers to call Bright House, as well as call its Vice-President, Mike Robertson, direct. Angelatos and his brother, talk show host Sam Angelatos, said that Bright House's discontinuation of WZRA was a form of discrimination, favoring the Hispanic community with four Spanish channels, while ignoring and mistreating other ethnic groups.\\"Company unplugs Greek TV\\", St. Petersburg Times, March 2, 2006 In July 2006, Bright House gave WZRA a permanent home, on digital channel 948 in Northern Pinellas County.

This building had to be vacated due to the construction of the Terminal Tower complex. During construction some 10,000 miles of lines and switches were moved from Michigan Avenue to the current Huron Complex. In 1938, the Ohio Bell installed a new switching board, which by 1944 was receiving some 25,300 long-distance calls daily on average.Cormack, G. (Ed.) (2002). Women at work in Cleveland.

The story revolves around the theft of a famous diamond aboard a train. It is one of four films in the series in the public domain. The film's plot is a mostly original story not directly based on any of Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes tales, but it uses minor plot elements of \\"The Adventure of the Empty House,\\" \\"The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax,\\" and The Sign of Four.Alan Barnes, Sherlock Holmes On Screen: The Complete Film and TV History, Titan Books, Third Edition, January 31, 2012, , page 287  Plot  In London, Vivian Vedder (Renee Godfrey) verifies that a carpenter has completed a coffin for her recently deceased mother's body, which she is transporting to Scotland by train. She boards the train that evening, as do Lady Margaret Carstairs (Mary Forbes), who owns and is transporting the famous Star of Rhodesia diamond; Lady Margaret's son, Roland (Geoffrey Steele); Holmes, whom Roland has hired to protect the diamond; Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoey), who is also worried about the diamond's safety; and Watson and Watson's friend Major Duncan-Bleek (Alan Mowbray). Holmes briefly examines the diamond. Shortly afterward, Roland is murdered and the diamond is allegedly stolen. Lestrade, Holmes, and Watson learn nothing conclusive in questioning the other passengers. At one point during the investigation, Watson believes an elderly couple is guilty of the crime but the only crime that they have committed is stealing a teapot from a hotel. While searching the train, Holmes is pushed out of the train, nearly to his death, but climbs back into the day coach and discovers a secret compartment in the coffin carrying Miss Vedder's mother. He suspects that one of the people on the train is the notorious jewel thief Colonel Sebastian Moran. Upon further questioning, Miss Vedder admits that a man paid her to transport the coffin. As Watson and Duncan-Bleek join the group, Holmes reveals that he swapped the diamond with an imitation while examining it. Lestrade ostensibly takes possession of the real diamond. In the luggage compartment, Holmes and Watson find a train guard murdered with a poisoned dart. Meanwhile, a street criminal named Sands (Skelton Knaggs) incapacitates the conductor. Sands was hidden inside the coffin, and is in cahoots with Duncan-Bleek, who is, in fact, Colonel Moran. Sands and Moran go to Lestrade's room, where Sands knocks Lestrade unconscious and steals the diamond from him; but Moran double-crosses Sands, shooting him dead with the same dart gun he used to kill Roland and the guard. The train makes an unexpected stop to pick up several Scottish policemen, led allegedly by Inspector McDonald (Boyd Davis). Holmes informs McDonald that Duncan-Bleek is really Moran, and McDonald arrests Moran and finds the diamond in his vest, but Moran seizes a policeman's gun and pulls the emergency cord to stop the train. During a scuffle in which the lights are turned off, Holmes subdues and handcuffs Moran, then secretly hides him under a table. When the lights are turned on again, the officers leave the train with Lestrade, his coat covering his face, believing he is Moran. As the train departs, Lestrade captures the thieves in the railway station, and Holmes reveals to Watson and Moran that he recognized McDonald as an impostor and recovered the diamond from him during the fight.

It originally aired on December 27, 1963 on CBS. In this episode, a movie star (played by Maggie McNamara) receives a mystical summon to return to her hometown on a matter of life and death. Opening narrationPlot Barbara \\"Bunny\\" Blake is a movie star living in Hollywood, California. Her hometown fan club in Howardsville, Virginia sends her a ring, and she tells her manager that her loyalty is still to her town because they all chipped in to help her go to Hollywood to pursue her career. Looking into the stone, she sees her sister imploring Bunny to come home. Though she has been hired to make a movie in Rome, Bunny makes an impromptu trip to Howardsville to surprise her sister Hildy and her nephew Bud. Hildy and Bud hope that she will attend the annual founder's day picnic, which coincidentally happens to be that very afternoon. Upon hearing this and after seeing a vision of local television newsreader Ben Braden also asking her to \\"come home\\", Bunny suffers a seizure, and Hildy calls over an old friend, the town doctor, who diagnoses that Bunny has been working too hard at her acting career and orders her to rest, despite her claiming that she was faking the seizure as an excuse to call him over. As he is also the chairman/organizer for the annual founder's day picnic, Bunny requests that he postpone the entire event so that she can see her friends in more personal settings, but he refuses and interprets her request as a sign that she has been spoiled by her Hollywood lifestyle. As she sees a vision of her high school's custodian, Cyrus Gentry, requesting her help for the town, Bunny flees to the bathroom. The doctor gives Bunny's prescription slip to Hildy,. She accompanies Bud to the drugstore, and on the way, they stop by her old school to meet Gentry, whom she asks to leave the school gates open. She then goes to the local TV station for an impromptu interview with Braden. In the interview, she announces a one-woman show in the high school gymnasium for the same time as the picnic. When Braden points out the conflict, she flippantly says the people will enjoy her show more. Hildy accuses Bunny of \\"showing off\\" by forcing the town to choose between seeing her or attending the picnic. Bunny insists that she loves the town and its people and that she is using her show as a way of thanking them. Hildy at first says that she and Bud are going to the picnic. When Bunny sees a vision in her ring of a jetliner and its passengers, including herself and her manager, Hildy reconsiders, and agrees to attend Bunny's show. As they are about to leave, it begins to rain. They hear sirens and rush to look out the window. Bunny envisions herself on the jetliner in the rain, and she hugs her slightly bewildered sister. A breaking news flash comes on over the radio, and while Hildy and Bud are listening to the first reports of an airplane crash, Bunny goes outside in the rain and vanishes. A police officer calls to inform Hildy that Bunny is among the deceased passengers on the plane. The radio news anchor confirms that Bunny was on the plane while stating that several townspeople claimed to have seen her that day. The anchorman notes that many of the townspeople were in the auditorium waiting to see Bunny's show and that they would have died had they gone to the picnic because the jetliner crashed on the grounds. Hildy finds Bunny's ring, which had fallen to the floor, is now chipped and charred.

At the 2011 Census, the population was 16,115. History Kirkdale is a working class area with mainly Victorian terraced houses. From 1885 to 1983, it was part of the Liverpool Kirkdale constituency. Kirkdale is bordered by Bootle to the north, Walton and Everton to the east and Vauxhall to the south. Boundary Street was an ancient division between the township of Kirkdale and Liverpool before Liverpool's expansion took in Kirkdale in the 1860s. It thus separates Kirkdale and Vauxhall. Kirkdale is now undergoing a large amount of regeneration. The old Easby estate has been demolished to make way for new two-, three- and four-bedroom properties. They have been built for both local residents and incomers. Transport There are three railway stations in the district, owing to its size and location near where the Merseyrail Northern Line branches diverge. The stations are: Bank Hall, near the boundary with Bootle on the branch to Southport; Kirkdale station itself, serving the main housing area and Sandhills, a busy station acting as the Northern Line junction station. Places of worship St. Lawrence with St. Paul's, Kirkdale is the Church of England parish church. The parish boundary runs from the edge of Bootle to the north down until the edge of the Vauxhall area and to the edge of Walton in the east. St. Lawrence church joined with St. Paul's in 2002 when the parish of St. Paul with St. Mary's, Bootle, was split in two and brought into the Liverpool North Deanery, in Liverpool Diocese. Liverpool Youth For Christ is currently based in The Shepherd Centre, a specially designed community centre attached to the St. Paul's building. The Catholic community is served by the Parish of St John and St John the Evangelist's Church, a Grade II listed building. The affiliated primary school is located across Sessions Road. Kirkdale Cemetery Kirkdale has a large cemetery containing 386 Commonwealth War Graves from the First World War and 115 from the Second World War. Over 100 of these graves from the former war are of Canadian servicemen who died at No 5 Canadian Hospital established at Kirkdale in July 1917. There are two War Graves plots (mostly of First World War dead) with the names of those buried in them listed on Screen Wall memorials. There were formerly large numbers of graves of German and American war dead from the First World War and Belgians from both world wars but these were nearly all removed to dedicated national cemeteries within the United Kingdom or repatriated to their home countries. There are also buried some of the victims of the Liverpool Blitz including notably Francis William Lionel Collings Beaumont, son of the Dame of Sark, and his actress wife Mary Lawson.

It is located near the northern end of Amelia Island in the northeastern part of the state. Its light marks St. Marys Entrance, the inlet leading to St. Marys River, the Cumberland Sound and the harbor of Fernandina Beach, Florida along the Amelia River. The white light flashes every ten seconds which turns red from 344¬∞ to 360¬∞ when covering the shoal water in the vicinity of Nassau Sound. The lighthouse is listed as number 565 in the United States Coast Guard (USCG) light list. History The lighthouse was built in 1838 using materials taken from the former Little Cumberland Island Light on Cumberland Island in Georgia just north of the inlet, which had been built in 1820. The brick tower was originally tall placed on a hill. In 1881, a lantern was installed on the tower increasing the tower height to with the focal plane height of above sea level. The tower for the light formerly on Cumberland Island was taken down and rebuilt on Amelia Island in 1838. The new light was originally equipped with 14 lamps each with a reflector when first lit in 1839. The reflector size was increased to by 1848. This arrangement was replaced by a third-order Barbier Benard Fresnel lens in 1903, which is still used in the lighthouse. The Amelia Island Light was automated in 1970. The next-to-last civilian keeper of the lighthouse was Thomas J. O'Hagan, who was the son of the previous keeper, Thomas P. O'Hagan, and was married to a direct descendant of the first keeper, Amos Latham. The light remains in operation, but the lighthouse structure is now a private residence. Management The ownership of the lighthouse was transferred from the United States Coast Guard to the City of Fernandina Beach in 2001, which now maintains the historical monument. The Coast Guard, though, is still responsible for the function of the beacon. Access to the lighthouse is limited by the city. As of 2015, the lighthouse is not open to the public, except on Saturdays when the grounds are open for viewing for three hours only. The city also offers tours to the lighthouse twice a month.

Born in Mondov√¨, Italy, he served with the Spanish Army in New Orleans. In 1772 he established a fur trading business in St. Louis. In 1783 Vigo moved to Vincennes and operated a fur trading business there. Early lifeAmerican Revolution Vigo often aided American forces during the Revolutionary War, most famously as an informant to George Rogers Clark. Vigo was sent by Clark to Post Vincennes to inspect and report on the conditions there, but was captured by American Indians and turned over to Lt-Gov Henry Hamilton, who had recaptured Vincennes for the British Crown. Vigo was a Spanish citizen and thus, in 1778, considered a non-combatant, but Hamilton was suspicious of Vigo and held him on parole until the French citizens of Vincennes, led by Father Gibault, demanded that he be released at the threat of cutting off local supplies to Fort Sackville. Hamilton released Vigo on the condition that he would not \\"do any thing injurious to the British interests on his way to St. Louis.\\" True to his word, Vigo travelled down the Wabash, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers to St. Louis before returning to KaskaskiaLaw, pg 29 to inform Col. Clark of the British hold on Vincennes, which prompted Clark to retake the town in 1779. In addition to his services as a patriot and spy, Vigo was the foremost financier of the American Revolution in the Northwest. When Clark arrived with Continental promissary notes of paper, Vigo exchanged them evenly for hard coin. The American dollar traded poorly among the French citizens, and soon became worthless. Vigo was never repaid during his lifetime, and would recollect that the term douleur to the French signifies grief or pain.Law, pg 50. Law adds, \\"The above anecdote I had from the Colonel's own lips.\\" Post-War years In the 1790s Vigo traded with American merchants on the East Coast of the U.S. In 1801, Vigo petitioned the U.S. Congress for a donation of land to establish the Jefferson Academy in Vincennes. In 1806, Vigo was named one of the original trustees of the now renamed Vincennes University. From 1790 to 1810 he was a colonel in the Knox County Militia before resigning, citing age and infirmity. In 1818 Vigo County, Indiana, was establishedVigo County :: Home and named for him. After he was royally feted during a visit to Terre Haute, the Vigo County seat, on July 4, 1834, Vigo revised his will to provide money to purchase a large bell for the Vigo County Courthouse, should he ever be compensated by the United States for services rendered during the Revolution. As an Italian surname, Vigo's name is pronounced \\"VEE-goh\\"; therefore, all streets, buildings, schools, towns, townships, or cities named after him should have their names pronounced \\"VEE-goh\\" (not \\"VY-goh\\").\\" Death Francis Vigo died March 22, 1836, while living in the home of Jean Baptiste and Elizabeth (Martin) LaPlante, in Vincennes. It was not until 1875, that his estate was allowed payment for $8,016.00, the amount he had used to fund Clark's aborted campaign to take Fort Detroit. This was the only expense the government would officially recognize, but it came with $41,282.60 in interest.Somes, 129 As Vigo had no blood-related descendants, however, the government only had to pay for the expenses requested in Vigo's will (which included a bell for the courthouse in Vigo County).

It is published five days a week, from Tuesday to Saturday. It publishes a mix of community, national and international news and is currently owned by Postmedia. It has . The Saturday edition of The Whig features a life and entertainment section, which includes a travel section, restaurant reviews, a section for kids and colour comics.  History  The British Whig was founded in 1834 by Edward John Barker (1799‚Äì1884) on Kingston‚Äôs Bagot Street between Brock and Princess... Barker was born in Islington, a suburb of London, on New Year‚Äôs Eve, 1799, emigrating to South Carolina as a child before coming to Canada in December 1832. Barker served a short naval career, appointed as surgeon‚Äôs mate on the sloop Racehorse in 1819. The next decade of his life was said to be spent as a doctor in the London district of East Smithfield, though his work may have been closer to that of an apothecary. In 1821, during his time in London, Barker married Elizabeth Phillips. While practising medicinal arts in Kingston, he took up an offer to edit the Spectator, and after a year decided to publish his own semi-weekly Liberal-Reform paper. His medical training would also have effect on his editorials, as he encouraged sanitation to combat cholera. His political views were not extremely popular, but those opinions were turned around by Barker‚Äôs efforts of advocacy of agricultural and mercantile interests. During the Rebellion of 1837-1838, Barker's press and house were attacked and damaged. Over the next few years, the Whig and Barker‚Äôs editorials would begin to support a more Conservative view. From 1841 through 1844, during the time of Kingston as Canada‚Äôs capital, Barker‚Äôs Atheneum Press Job printing company would be busy thanks to validation from the Conservatives. Trouble would never be far for Barker as Queen‚Äôs University surgeon Dr. John Stewart would start a local paper, the Argus, with the intention of ‚Äúdissecting‚Äù Barker and the Whig in 1846. That same year Barker would launch an ambitious project, Barker‚Äôs Canadian Monthly Magazine, a rich literary magazine but financial failure. Despite setbacks from the Monthly and the Argus, business went well for Barker, the Whig switching to daily publication in 1849, followed by a weekly edition in 1862. The poet Charles Sangster, who had been editor for the Amherstburg Courier, returned to work at the paper in 1849, previously having been a 12-year part-timer there. In the same year, the paper began issuing the Daily British Whig, in addition to the variously semi-weekly/weekly/triweekly edition. By 1871, Barker was planning to retire, having had his grandson assisting in the managing of the paper for some years. After stepping back from the paper, Barker would be appointed Registrar of Kingston, and died April 27, 1884 of gout at his home in Barriefield. The Whig had Joseph Grey Elliott as managing editor, and listed as president of the 94 Barrie Street offices in 1922. Elliott was born in Port Hope, and a printer‚Äôs devil for the Review in Peterborough at 14. Elliott was lauded for his views on education. Elliott died in November 1949, aged 93. Between Pense‚Äôs death and the next family ownership by the Davies‚Äô clan, the Whig was being published by the British Whig Publishing Company Limited. This group was made up of Elliott, Harry E. Pense, Dr. Bruce Hopkins (married to a Pense) and two other gentlemen, with Williamson as managing editor. William Rupert Davies would then purchase the paper from the estate of Pense in April 1925. Davies was born in Wales, immigrated to Canada in the 1880s, and had owned the Renfrew Mercury prior to coming to Kingston. W. R. Davies served as president of the Canadian Press 1939‚Äì1941, as well as president of the Canadian Weekly Newspaper Association. Prior to his ownership, the Whig had lost between five and ten thousand dollars that year. Knowing that the town could not support two, Davies brought in Harry B. Muir, manager of the London Advertiser, to purchase the Kingston Standard. The Standard was created by William R. Givens in 1907, when he acquired the News and Times, which had been an amalgamation of the Kingston News and Evening Times in 1903. The two men amalgamated the papers on December 1, 1926, creating the Whig-Standard. The word \\"Kingston\\" was dropped from the name in 1973, but was reinstated in the early 1990s. The Press Publishing Company, a business controlled by Davies, Muir, and Givens, also bought the Peterborough Examiner in the 1940s, just after Davies acquired Muir‚Äôs interest in the Whig after the latter‚Äôs death. Givens retired in 1931, died in 1950, and a year later Rupert leaving Canada with his son Arthur stepping up as publisher. The elder Davies had sold the paper to his sons Arthur Llewellyn, Robertson and Fred R. in 1946, with Arthur L. staying on as publisher until 1969. Arthur worked at the paper from 1926, spending the last 18 years as publisher and chief executive officer. Arnold Edinborough was the editor of the Whig-Standard starting 1954 until 1958, having met Rupert Davies‚Äô son Robertson when Robertson was editor of the Examiner, owned by Rupert. Robertson had begun editing Examiner in 1942, where he was creating and developing his Samuel Marchbanks character. Neil Reynolds, born 1940, left the Toronto Star in 1974 to join Whig as an editor. He soon became editor in chief, staying with the paper until 1992, when Harvey Schachter took over. The paper excelled during the 1980s under Michael Davies (son of Arthur Llewellyn) and Reynolds, winning eight National Newspaper Awards, four National Magazine Awards, three Nathan Cohen Awards for dramatic criticism and two Michener Awards for public service journalism. Prior to the Whig, Reynolds had been with the Sarnia Observer, London Free Press, and after leaving Kingston spent time at the New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal and the Saint John Times-Globe. Others who contributed to the award-winning stories include Steve Lutkis, on staff from 1989 as an editorial writer, Douglas Fethering, Literature editor from 1988 to 1992, David Pulver, a writer and editor in Entertainment and editorials from 1977, and Sylvia Barrett Wright, the medical and science reporter from 1974 to 1981. Despite the recognition through this time, the late 1980s were difficult for the paper financially, leading Michael Davies to sell the paper. Thus ended the largest, longest independently owned paper in Canada in October 1990. The paper continues today as the oldest continuously publishing daily in Canada under the Postmedia Network of newspapers. (The first Canadian daily is the now defunct Montreal Daily Advertiser.) The Whig-Standard has a 20‚Äì25,000 circulation under the editorship of Steve Serviss and publisher Ron Laurin.

The town was settled in 1874 in what was then the Arizona Territory. History In 1768 Spanish soldiers from the Presidio de Tucson farmed the area along the San Pedro River to supply food for the Presidio. Later, in 1830, Mexican farmers settled in the area, establishing more permanent farming operations and transporting their produce through the Redington Pass to Tucson with the protection of soldiers from the Presidio. In 1860 the Soza family settled in the area and operated a prosperous cattle ranch. As other Mexicans immigrated from the south the community grew with the building of an adobe chapel called La Capilla de San Antonio de Padua de Lisboa. The community also had a gristmill and built a school for the children of the community. In 1865 several Anglos from Tucson settled in the area including Billy Ohnesorgen. Ohnesorgen ran a stage stop on what had been the Butterfield Overland Mail route as well as constructed a wooden toll bridge over the San Pedro River. Though farming was productive, the settlers found the Apache raids intolerable, many of the settlers were killed, and they abandoned the area after a few years. With the coming of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1880 and the establishment of the town of Benson just a couple miles south, and the private construction of a new stage road by J.D. Kinnear that bypassed the Tres Alamos location, the stage stop became superfluous and was abandoned.William Ohnesorgen, as told to Mrs. George Kitt, October 22, 1928. Arizona Historical Society The Tres Alamos post office was established in 1874 to serve ranchers along the San Pedro River. The post office was eventually closed in 1886.

It is previously believed that the round dance indicates that the forager has located a profitable food source close to the hive and the round dance transitions into the waggle dance when food sources are more than 50 meters away. Recent research shows that bees have only one dance that always encodes distance and direction to the food source, but that precision and expression of this information depends on the distance to the target; therefore, the use of \\"round dance\\" is outdated. Elements of the round dance also provide information regarding the forager's subjective evaluation of the food source's profitability. Nobel laureate Karl von Frisch was one of the first ethologists to investigate both the waggle dance and round dance through his studies examining honey bee foraging behaviours, and is credited with translating many of their underlying mechanisms.  Description  If a foraging honey bee (Apis mellifera) locates a profitable food source, she returns to the hive and performs a round dance to communicate its location. The forager bee moves in close circles over the comb, alternating directions. The round dance is performed by the forager bee when the food source is located in the immediate vicinity of the hive. Karl von Frisch determined that the critical distance for switching between the round dance and the waggle dance exists at 50 meters away from the hive. The scent attached to the forager bee's body communicates the type of food source in question to the follower bees. However, the scent of the food source alone is not sufficient information to guide the follower bees to said food source.  Mechanism  It has been shown that many of the mechanisms used to communicate distance and direction in the waggle dance are also employed in the round dance. The following section will focus on the role of each mechanism as a function of the round dance, specifically.  Acoustic signals  Acoustic signals are produced as a part of the round dance. These acoustic signals communicate information regarding direction, and give an indication of the distance to the food source. The dance sounds produced by the round dance are airborne, and are of sufficient strength to stimulate Johnston's organs in the antenna of the follower bees to which the forager is communicating. The follower bees extract information about the direction of the food source from the acoustic field that the forager produces. Direction to the food source is communicated through the sound information emitted by the forager bee, as well as through the air currents that accompany the dance sound. Such that, the duration and frequency of the sound produced, along with the magnitude of the pressure gradient produced provide the follower bees with information regarding the direction to the food source. Acoustic signals are also used to communicate distance. The duration of the acoustic signal transmitted is proportional to the distance to the food source. In that, the train of sound pulses produced by the forager bee, known as the dance sound, increases relative to the distance to the food source.  Position of the sun  The round dance uses the position of the sun to indicate the direction from the hive to the food source in the same way that the waggle dance does The round dance uses the position of the sun in order to indicate the direction of the food source in the same way that the waggle dance does. On the vertical surface of the comb, the forager expresses the angle between the position of the sun and the path to the food source through an angular deflection from perfect vertical. Honey bees use both the position of the sun and the polarization patterns of a blue sky to communicate the direction to the food source. Support for this theory rests in the observation that honey bees can still recognize the sun's position when it is obscured by a cloud or a mountain, for example. Honey bees also recognize the daily movements of the sun and can use the sun as a compass by calculating the hour of the day.  Communicating profitability  The round dance communicates the subjective evaluation of a food resource's profitability made by the forager. In regards to nectar, a common food source for honey bees, profitability is determined by its energetic value. Karl von Frisch originally suggested a relationship between what he termed the \\"liveliness\\" of the round dance and the value of the food source. Since then, the liveliness of the round dance has been dissected into quantifiable parts. Honey bees communicate information regarding the profitability of a food source through: rate of reversals, number of reversals, and dance duration. Research indicates that the rate of reversals in the round dance is the measure of profitability that is most highly correlated to food source quality. The energetic value of the food source is also correlated with several aspects of the dance sound. There is a positive correlation between energetic value and mean carrier frequency, pulse repetition rate, amplitude, and duration of the sound bursts. However, costs can be associated with the food sources, and consequently lower their subjective profitability. Some possible costs include: distance from the hive, and nectar flow rate. Furthermore, the forager's subjective rating of the profitability of a food source depends on the quality of food sources that the forager had previously encountered. If the forager had previously encountered a food source of higher energetic value, and less cost, she will rate the current food source as less profitable than if she had previously encountered a food source of less energetic value. Thus, the forager bee integrates the costs and benefits associated with each potential food source and communicates their subjective profitability through their round dance performance. However, the forager bee only communicates the food source if it passes a certain concentration threshold for dancing, by passing this threshold it is determined that there are enough benefits associated with the food source to justify expending the energy required for performing the round dance.  Response to communicated profitability  Although the round dance communicates the different profitabilities associated with each food source, the round dances displaying both rich and poor food resources are equally stimulating to the follower bees. The follower bees do not respond to only the most rich food resources because the benefits of being highly selective about which dance to respond to are low. It is suggested that honey bees benefit more from responding to a wide array of food sources rather than all congregating at the same, slightly richer food source. Also, since all food resources have to pass the concentration threshold for dancing in order to be communicated via the round dance, any food resource that is communicated through the round dance must have a relatively high profitability.

This system has been practised for many centuries in the island nation. The Sri Lankan Ayurvedic tradition is a mixture of the Sinhala traditional medicine, Ayurveda and Siddha systems of India, Unani medicine of Greece through the Arabs, and most importantly, the Desheeya Chikitsa, which is the indigenous medicine of Sri Lanka. History Sri Lanka developed its own Ayurvedic system based on a series of prescriptions handed down from generation to generation over a period of 3,000 years. The ancient kings, who were also prominent physicians, sustained its survival and longevity. King Buddhadasa (398 AD), the most influential of these physicians, wrote the Sarartha Sangrahaya, a comprehensive manuscript which Sri Lankan physicians still use today for reference. Some believe the age of \\"Hela wedakama\\" comes from the great King Ravana as most of the real traditional medicine practitioners still worship the King Ravana in order to obtain the permit prior to start treatments for the patients or prior to starting making medicines according to the ancient traditions. Ancient inscriptions on rock surfaces reveal that organized medical services have existed within the country for centuries. In fact, Sri Lanka claims to be the first country in the world to have established dedicated hospitals with the capability of performing surgeries even for the animals. The Sri Lankan mountain Mihintale still has the ruins of what many believe to be the first hospital in the world. Old hospital sites now attract tourists, who marvel at the beautiful ruins. These places have come to symbolize a traditional sense of healing and care, which was so prevalent at that time. Historically the Ayurvedic physicians enjoyed a noble position in the country's social hierarchy due to their royal patronage. From this legacy stems a well-known Sri Lankan saying: \\"If you can not be a king, become a healer.\\" Along with Buddhism, the interrelationship between Ayurveda and royalty continues to influence politics in Sri Lanka. However, most of the traditional values of Sri Lanka had died with the invasions of Dutch, Portuguese and English Nations. Recently however many tourists seek out traditional Ayurveda in Sri Lanka at one of the many Ayurveda resorts on the island, offering Ayurveda, yoga and meditation.

As a result, Cartier was fined 1,000 British pounds.http://boxrec.com/en/event/247730 Cartier, who never fought for a world title despite having faced these four former world champions, finished his professional boxing career with a record of 46 wins, 13 losses and 2 draws (ties); 24 wins and 9 losses were by knockout. Ancestry Cartier's ancestry was Irish, his grandfather having changed the family name from McCarthy, initially to Carter, and later to Cartier.http://idyllopuspress.com/idyllopus/film/day_of_the_fight.htm References Category:1922 births Category:1995 deaths Category:American male film actors Category:American male television actors Category:Sportspeople from the Bronx Category:American male boxers Category:Male actors from New York City Category:20th-century American male actors ","title":"Walter Cartier"},{"id":"3591885","text":"Joaqu√≠n Loyo-Mayo (August 16, 1945, Veracruz ‚Äì December 27, 2014, C√≥rdoba, Veracruz) was a left-handed Mexican athlete who played amateur and professional tennis in the 1960s and 1970s.Hispano americano 1973 \\"Ra√∫l Ram√≠rez y Joaqu√≠n Loyo Mayo dieron a M√©xico los dos primeros puntos, el viernes 23.

An anal fistula can be described as a narrow tunnel with its internal opening in the anal canal and its external opening in the skin near the anus. Anal fistulae commonly occur in people with a history of anal abscesses. They can form when anal abscesses do not heal properly. Anal fistulae originate from the anal glands, which are located between the internal and external anal sphincter and drain into the anal canal. If the outlet of these glands becomes blocked, an abscess can form which can eventually extend to the skin surface. The tract formed by this process is a fistula. Abscesses can recur if the fistula seals over, allowing the accumulation of pus. It can then extend to the surface again ‚Äì repeating the process. Anal fistulae per se do not generally harm, but can be very painful, and can be irritating because of the drainage of pus (it is also possible for formed stools to be passed through the fistula). Additionally, recurrent abscesses may lead to significant short term morbidity from pain and, importantly, create a starting point for systemic infection. Treatment, in the form of surgery, is considered essential to allow drainage and prevent infection. Repair of the fistula itself is considered an elective procedure which many patients opt for due to the discomfort and inconvenience associated with an actively draining fistula. Signs and symptoms Anal fistulae can present with the following symptoms: *skin maceration *pus, serous fluid and/or (rarely) feces discharge ‚Äî can be bloody or purulent *pruritus ani ‚Äî itching *depending on presence and severity of infection: :*pain :*swelling :*tenderness :*fever :*unpleasant odor * Thick discharge, which keeps the area wet Diagnosis Diagnosis is by examination, either in an outpatient setting or under anaesthesia (referred to as EUA or Examination Under Anaesthesia). The fistula may be explored by using a fistula probe (a narrow instrument). In this way, it may be possible to find both openings. The examination can be an anoscopy. Diagnosis may be aided by performing a fistulogram, proctoscopy and/or sigmoidoscopy. Possible findings: *The opening of the fistula onto the skin may be observed *The area may be painful on examination *There may be redness *An area of induration may be felt; thickening due to chronic infection *A discharge may be seen Classification *Park's classification: This was done by Parks et al. from the UK in 1976, before MRI or endoanal ultrasound was available. It classified the fistula in four grades: * St James University Hospital Classification: This was done by Morris et al. in the year 2000. This classification was improvement over Parks classification as it was based on MRI studies. It classified the fistula in five grades. *Garg classification: This was done by Pankaj Garg in 2017. This classification is improvement over both Parks and St James University Hospital Classification. This was based on MRI studies and operative findings in 440 patients. It classified the fistula in five grades. The grades of this classification correlate quite well with the severity of the disease. Grade I & II are simpler fistulas and can be managed by Fistulotomy whereas Grade III-V are complex fistulas in which fistulotomy should be not be done. They should be managed by Fistula experts. Unlike Park's and St James University Hospital Classification, this correlation is quite accurate with Garg's classification. Therefore this new classification is useful to both surgeons and radiologists. Types Depending on their relationship with the internal and external sphincter muscles, fistulae are classified into five types: *Extrasphincteric fistulae begin at the rectum or sigmoid colon and proceed downward, through the levator ani muscle and open into the skin surrounding the anus. Note that this type does not arise from the dentate line (where the anal glands are located). Causes of this type could be from a rectal, pelvic or supralevator origin, usually secondary to Crohn's disease or an inflammatory process such as appendiceal or diverticular abscesses. *Suprasphincteric fistulae begin between the internal and external sphincter muscles, extend above and cross the puborectalis muscle, proceed downward between the puborectalis and levator ani muscles, and open an inch or more away from the anus. *Transphincteric fistulae begin between the internal and external sphincter muscles or behind the anus, cross the external sphincter muscle and open an inch or more away from the anus. These may take a 'U' shape and form multiple external openings. This is sometimes termed a 'horseshoe fistula.' *Intersphincteric fistulae begin between the internal and external sphincter muscles, pass through the internal sphincter muscle, and open very close to the anus. *Submucosal fistulae pass superficially beneath the submucosa and do not cross either sphincter muscle. Differential diagnosis Other conditions in which infected perianal \\"holes\\" or openings may appear include pilonidal cyst. Treatment There are several stages to treating an anal fistula: Definitive treatment of a fistula aims to stop it recurring. Treatment depends on where the fistula lies, and which parts of the internal and external anal sphincters it crosses. *Lay-open of fistula-in-ano ‚Äì this option involves an operation to cut the fistula open. Once the fistula has been laid open it will be packed on a daily basis for a short period of time to ensure that the wound heals from the inside out. This option leaves behind a scar, and depending on the position of the fistula in relation to the sphincter muscle, can cause problems with incontinence. This option is not suitable for fistulae that cross the entire internal and external anal sphincter. *Cutting seton ‚Äì if the fistula is in a high position and it passes through a significant portion of the sphincter muscle, a cutting seton (from the Latin seta, \\"bristle\\") may be used. This involves inserting a thin tube through the fistula tract and tying the ends together outside of the body. The seton is tightened over time, gradually cutting through the sphincter muscle and healing as it goes. This option minimizes scarring but can cause incontinence in a small number of cases, mainly of flatus. Once the fistula tract is in a low enough position it may be laid open to speed up the process, or the seton can remain in place until the fistula is completely cured. This was the traditional modality used by physicians in Ancient Egypt and formally codified by Hippocrates,Hippocrates, \\"On Fistulae\\", translation by Francis Adams, Internet Classics Archive, Massachusetts Institute of Technology who used horsehair and linen. *Seton stitch ‚Äì a length of suture material looped through the fistula which keeps it open and allows pus to drain out. In this situation, the seton is referred to as a draining seton. The stitch is placed close to the ano-rectal ring ‚Äì which encourages healing and makes further surgery easy. *Fistulotomy ‚Äì till anorectal ring *Colostomy ‚Äì to allow healing *Fibrin glue injection is a method explored in recent years, with variable success. It involves injecting the fistula with a biodegradable glue which should, in theory, close the fistula from the inside out, and let it heal naturally. This method is perhaps best tried before all others since, if successful, it avoids the risk of incontinence, and creates minimal stress for the patient. *Fistula plug involves plugging the fistula with a device made from small intestinal submucosa. The fistula plug is positioned from the inside of the anus with suture. According to some sources, the success rate with this method is as high as 80%. As opposed to the staged operations, which may require multiple hospitalizations, the fistula plug procedure requires hospitalization for only about 24 hours. Currently, there are two different anal fistula plugs cleared by the FDA for treating ano-rectal fistulae in the United States. This treatment option does not carry any risk of bowel incontinence. In the systematic review published by Dr Pankaj Garg, the success rate of the fistula plug is 65‚Äì75%. *Endorectal advancement flap is a procedure in which the internal opening of the fistula is identified and a flap of mucosal tissue is cut around the opening. The flap is lifted to expose the fistula, which is then cleaned and the internal opening is sewn shut. After cutting the end of the flap on which the internal opening was, the flap is pulled down over the sewn internal opening and sutured in place. The external opening is cleaned and sutured. Success rates are variable and high recurrence rates are directly related to previous attempts to correct the fistula. Japan: A man with an anal fistula. From the Yamai no Soshi, late 12th century.LIFT Technique is a novel modified approach through the intersphincteric plane for the treatment of fistula-in-ano, known as LIFT (ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract) procedure. LIFT procedure is based on secure closure of the internal opening and removal of infected cryptoglandular tissue through the intersphincteric approach. Essential steps of the procedure include, incision at the intersphincteric groove, identification of the intersphincteric tract, ligation of intersphincteric tract close to the internal opening and removal of intersphincteric tract, scraping out all granulation tissue in the rest of the fistulous tract, and suturing of the defect at the external sphincter muscle. The procedure was developed by Thai colorectal surgeon, Arun Rojanasakul, The first reports of preliminary healing result from the procedure were 94% in 2007. Additional ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract did not improve the outcome after endorectal advancement flap. *Fistula clip closure (OTSC Proctology) is the latest surgical development, which involves the closure of the internal fistula opening with a superelastic clip made of nitinol (OTSC). During surgery, the fistula tract is debrided with a special fistula brush and the clip is transanally applied with the aid of a preloaded clip applicator. The surgical principle of this technique relies on the dynamic compression and permanent closure of the internal fistula opening by the superelastic clip. Consequently, the fistula tract dries out and heals instead of being kept open by continuous feeding with stool and fecal organisms. This minimally-invasive sphincter-preserving technique has been developed and clinically implemented by the German surgeon Ruediger Prosst. First clinical data of the clip closure technique demonstrate a success rate of 90% for previously untreated fistulae and a success rate of 70% for recurrent fistulae. *PERFACT Procedure is another latest addition to the armamentarium to treat complex and highly complex fistula-in-ano. It is a minimally cutting procedure as both the anal sphincters (internal and external sphincters) are not cut/damaged at all. Therefore, the risk of incontinence is minimal. PERFACT procedure (proximal superficial cauterization, emptying regularly fistula tracts and curettage of tracts) entails two steps: superficial cauterization of mucosa at and around the internal opening and keeping all the tracts clean. The principle is to permanently close the internal opening by granulation tissue. This is achieved by superficial electrocauterization at and around the internal opening and subsequently allowing the wound to heal by secondary intention. Early results of this procedure are quite encouraging for complex fistula-in-ano (86.4% in highly complex anal fistulae). The procedure is effective even in fistula associated with abscess, supralevator fistula-in-ano and fistula where the internal opening is non-localizable. Infection Some people will have an active infection when they present with a fistula, and this requires clearing up before definitive treatment can be decided. Antibiotics can be used as with other infections, but the best way of healing infection is to prevent the buildup of pus in the fistula, which leads to abscess formation. This can be done with a seton. Epidemiology A literature review published in 2018 showed an incidence as high as 21 people per 100,000. \\"Anal fistulas are 2‚Äì6 times more prevalent in males than females, with the condition occurring most frequently in patients in their 30s and 40s.\\" References External links  Category:Colorectal surgery Fistula Category:Diseases of intestines Category:Fistulas ","title":"Anal fistula"},{"id":"3591910","text":"In his book Milton's Prosody, Robert Bridges undertakes a detailed analysis of the prosody of John Milton's Paradise Lost. Bridges shows that there are no lines in Paradise Lost with fewer than ten syllables, and furthermore, that with a suitable definition of elision, there are no mid-line extra-metrical syllables. He also demonstrates that the stresses may fall at any point in the line, and that although most lines have the standard five stresses, there are examples of lines with only three and four stresses. All this amounts to a statement that Milton was writing a form of Syllabic verse. Bridges explains this in historical terms by observing that Milton followed the practice of Geoffrey Chaucer, who -- in Bridges' view -- adopted the Romance prosody of French verse, which was syllabic, having itself derived from the practice of Latin poets who through a corruption of Greek quantitative meters also counted syllables. Bridges notes that the approach Milton takes in Paradise Lost represents a certain tightening of the rules, compared to his earlier work, such as Comus, in which he allowed himself the Shakespearian 'liberty' of a feminine ending before a caesura. Bridges' approach Bridges takes an empirical approach to his analysis of the blank verse of Paradise Lost, and tabulates all the exceptions to the regular iambic pentameter line, although he avoids this classical description of the line, preferring to describe it as a 'decasyllabic line on a disyllabic basis and in rising rhythm (i.e. with accents or stresses on the alternate even syllables)'. He categorizes the exceptions into three groups, citing lines where: # the number of syllables is not ten # the number of stresses is not five # the position of the stresses is not standard Lines where the number of syllables is not ten Bridges describes the cases where there are: #fewer than 10 syllables #more than 10 syllables He notes that there are no examples in Paradise Lost of a line having fewer than ten syllables, other than X.827 as it appeared in the first edition. It was corrected to a ten syllable line in the 1674 edition. He also notes that Milton would have been aware of Chaucer's practice of omitting the first unaccented syllable on rare occasions. The section on where there are more than ten syllables in a line is mainly taken up with a detailed description of elision; see Robert Bridges' theory of elision for more details of this. He does categorize lines with extra syllables thus: # lines with an extra syllable (or syllables) at the end # lines with an extra syllable mid- line Lines with an extra syllable at the end This is the standard feminine ending, where there is an extra unstressed syllable at the end. Bridges cites two examples of where there are two extra unstressed syllables at the end of the line, the final 'foot' being 'no satietie' (VIII.216) and 'best societie' (IX.249), although he suggests that these could be counted as a single extra syllable by means of elision. Lines with an extra syllable mid-line Bridges notes that in Milton's earlier work, such as Comus, Milton had permitted the use of the feminine ending, mid-line, directly preceding a caesura, (as had Shakespeare). Here is an example: :Root-bound, that fled Apollo. Fool do not boast -- (Comus, 662) However, Bridges holds that in Paradise Lost there are no examples of this. Lines such as: :Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers (P.L. X.86) he treats as a ten syllable line by virtue of elision. Lines where the number of stresses is not five Bridges cites examples of four-stress and three-stress lines. He also states that there can never be more than five stresses in a line, refuting the example : Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens and Shades of Death (P.L., II.621) Lines with non-standard stresses Bridges examines the inversion of each of the five feet. # the first foot is commonly inverted to give freshness to the rhythm # the second foot is rarely inverted # the inversion of the third foot is fairly common # the inversion of the fourth foot is fairly common # the inversion of the fifth foot is very rare, and considered by some to be impossible; Bridges cites two clear examples Notes # see page 15 of Milton's Prosody Category:Poetic rhythm Category:John Milton ","title":"Bridges' analysis of Paradise Lost"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},H={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",H,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",I]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/57.md","filePath":"glossary/57.md"}'),x={name:"glossary/57.md"},W=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,W as default};
