He was famed for his skills as a chairman and well known for his \\"unmistakably Scottish\\" accent, eloquent speeches and dry sense of humour. Biography =Early life and career= He was born in Peebles, Scotland, in 1901. He worked as a shop steward for a wool mill where he first became involved in trade unionism, joining the National Union of General Workers. After being laid off from his job he emigrated to New Zealand in 1921. Shortly after arriving he married Agnes Anderson, a fellow Scottish emigrant whom he had met on the voyage. He then found employment as a woollen worker (spinner) at the Kaiapoi woolen mills. A short while later he briefly worked as an industrial insurance salesman before joining the Christchurch Tramways Board as a conductor in 1924, later becoming a tram driver. He became the president of the Tramway Workers' Union from 1928 to 1932. During his tenure as president there was a 10-day strike in 1932 protesting layoffs which failed and the 60 men were not reinstated. After being laid off himself from his job as a driver he was elected Chairman of the Tramways Board. He was also the chairman of the Christchurch Unemployed Workers' Union. He also worked for many years at the Christchurch Star-Sun newspaper as a publisher. He resigned from his role there upon his election to Parliament. =Local politics= Mathison joined the Labour Party two weeks after arriving in New Zealand. He was a member of the Christchurch City Council from 1933 to 1958 when he resigned upon being elected a cabinet minister. He stood as the Labour Party's candidate for Mayor of Christchurch in the 1968 election, but was beaten by councillor Ron Guthrey. In 1933 he became a member of the Christchurch Transport Board and was a member, over separate spells, for decades. Following the 1980 local elections he was appointed chairman. He was still chairman at the time of his death. =Member of Parliament= He unsuccessfully stood for the Hurunui electorate in 1946. He represented the Christchurch electorate of Avon from a by-election in to 1972, when he retired. He became the chairman of the caucus transport committee and from 1952 until 1958 he was the Labour Party's junior whip. For many years he was Parliament billiards champion, leading him to later become patron of first the Canterbury Billiards Association and later the New Zealand Billiards Council. He was a cabinet minister from 1957 to 1960 in the Second Labour Government. Mathison served as Minister of Transport, Minister of Island Territories, Minister of Tourism and Minister of Civil Aviation.New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, Vols 318-326 (1958-1960). As Minister of Island Territories he did the preliminary work which lead to the independence of Western Samoa as well as establishing self- government in the Cook Islands. As Minister of Civil Aviation he was responsible for the arrangement that safeguarded New Zealand's interests in Tasman Empire Airways. When in opposition, Mathison was Shadow Minister of Transport, Marine, Railways and Tourism under Norman Kirk who had a fond respect for him, despite Mathison voting for Arnold Nordmeyer in the 1965 leadership challenge. Kirk had wanted Mathison to remain in Parliament in order to appoint him Speaker of the House following a Labour victory, thinking that he would be 'firm but fair' to assist an inevitably inexperienced Labour government. However Kirk was unable to convince the party executive to overlook the statutory retirement age of 70 which necessitated Mathison's retirement. =Later life and death= Mathison was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1973 New Year Honours, for services to politics. After retiring from politics he was a board member of the New Zealand Ports Authority for three years. He also became a trustee of the Canterbury Savings Bank and was president of the board for two years. He died in Christchurch on 12 October 1982, aged 81. He was survived by a son and daughter.

She was dux and prefect at Gisborne Girls' High School. She graduated with honours in history from the University of Otago in 1926. She lectured in history at Otago for a year, during which time she met the medical student and her future husband, Gervan McMillan. She then taught at Nelson College for Girls for three years. After their wedding on 4 September 1929 at Gisborne, they settled in Kurow, where he had worked as a locum and then purchased the medical practice. They moved to Dunedin in 1934, where her husband was elected to Parliament for the Labour Party in the Dunedin West electorate in . He was cabinet minister for a year, but retired from Parliament in 1943 to concentrate on his medical practice. Gervan McMillan died from a heart disease in 1951, aged 46. During their time in Kurow, the McMillans had friendships and political discussions with their neighbours, Arnold Nordmeyer and Jerry Skinner; both would become influential MPs for the Labour Party. They also hosted Michael Joseph Savage, who in 1935 would become Prime Minister. Her husband had been involved with the Labour Party since 1923, and Ethel McMillan joined the party in about 1930. =Local politics= McMillan had a distinguished local career in Dunedin. She was the first woman to be elected onto Dunedin City Council in 1950 (the second woman was elected in 1970) and remained a councillor until 1980.

She continued to represent the electorate to 1963, and then Dunedin North from to 1975, when she retired. Although she was a senior parliamentarian when Labour came to power in 1972, she was not elected to cabinet, possibly due to her strained relation with Norman Kirk. However, she did serve as Labour's Spokesperson for Health in Kirk's Shadow Cabinet. She was known as the 'Queen of Quiz' in Parliament for the numerous questions that she asked. =Later life= She was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services in the 1976 New Year Honours, and many felt that she should have received more official recognition.

The blade often incorporated one, two, or three fullers (grooves) and had a spear-tip shaped point. The sword could be used to both cut and thrust. Examples with narrow rapier blades have survived, though in small numbers. The hilt was of the type sometimes called the \\"Indian basket-hilt\\" and was identical to that of another Indian straight- bladed sword the khanda. The hilt afforded a substantial amount of protection for the hand and had a prominent spike projecting from the pommel which could be grasped, resulting in a two-handed capability for the sword. Like other contemporary Indian swords the hilt of the firangi was usually of iron and the tang of the blade was attached to the hilt using a very strong resin, additionally, the hilt to blade connection was reinforced by projections from the hilt onto either face of the forte of the blade which were riveted together through a hole passing through the blade. The finest examples of this type of sword can have extensive gold \\"koftigari\\" decoration to both hilt and blade. Use Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan standing, carrying a lily and a firangi sword as a symbol of martial power. Because of its length the firangi is usually regarded as primarily a cavalry weapon. Illustrations suggest a 16th-century date for the development of the sword, though early examples appear to have had simpler cross-guard hilts, similar to those of the talwar. The sword has been especially associated with the Marathas, who were famed for their cavalry. However, the firangi was widely used by the Mughals and those peoples who came under their rule, including Sikhs and Rajputs. Images of Mughal potentates holding firangis, or accompanied by retainers carrying their masters' firangis, suggest that the sword became a symbol of martial virtue and power.Evangelista and Gaugler, p. 247 Photographs of Indian officers of Hodson's Horse (an irregular cavalry unit raised by the British) show that the firangi was still in active use at the time of the Indian Mutiny in 1857-58.David, ill. 29, showing British and Indian Officers of Hodson's Horse March 1858.

Education He was educated at Durnford School an independent school near Swanage, Dorset, before going to Royal Naval College, Dartmouth in 1935.Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives War service in the Royal Navy In May 1939 Midshipman Mansfield joined the destroyer and then the heavy cruiser at Alexandria. At the start of the war, Sussex joined Force H hunting for the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee in the South Atlantic. He then escorted the first troop convoy from Australia and New Zealand across the Indian Ocean, and took part in the campaign against Italian Somaliland. He spent a short period in the battlecruiser followed by professional courses at Portsmouth during the Blitz - \\"not conducive to diligent study,\\" he recalled. Promoted to sub-lieutenant, he first served in the J-class destroyer in the North Sea and Mediterranean. On 26 March 1942 he was in when she was hit by two torpedoes from the submarine U-652, catching fire and sinking quickly. Three officers and 190 ratings were lost, and Mansfield, though wounded in the head, was one of 53 men rescued.

Occurrence Phlorizin is found primarily in unripe Malus (apple) root bark of apple, and trace amounts have been found in strawberry. In Malus, it is most abundant in vegetative tissues (such as leaves and bark) and seeds. Closely related species, such as pear (Pyrus communis), cherry, and other fruit trees in the Rosaceae do not contain phloridzin. Phloridzin is a phytochemical that belongs to the class of polyphenols. In natural sources, it may occur with other polyphenols such as quercetin, catechin, epicatechin, procyanidins, and rutin. Properties Phlorizin is a white to yellow crystalline solid with a melting point of 106‚Äì109 ¬∞C. It is of sweet taste and contains four molecules of water in the crystal. Above 200 ¬∞C, it decomposes. It is poorly soluble in ether and cold water, but soluble in ethanol and hot water. Upon prolonged exposure to aqueous solutions phlorizin hydrolyzes to phloretin and glucose. Pharmacology Phlorizin is a competitive inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2 because it competes with D-glucose for binding to the carrier; this reduces renal glucose transport, lowering the amount of glucose in the blood. Phlorizin was studied as a potential pharmaceutical treatment for type 2 diabetes, but has since been superseded by more selective and more promising synthetic analogs, such as empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin. Phlorizin is not an effective drug because when orally consumed, it is nearly entirely converted into phloretin by hydrolytic enzymes in the small intestine.

Between 1907 and 1941, it was the largest and arguably the most influential political party in the Slovene Lands. It was dissolved by the Yugoslav Communist authorities in 1945, but continued to be active in exile until 1992, when it merged with the Slovene Christian Democrats. The contemporary Slovene People's Party, founded in 1988, was named after it. Representatives of the Slovene People's Party in the Provincial Diet of Carniola shortly before World War I. The party's president Ivan ≈†u≈°ter≈°iƒç sits in the middle. The funeral of Janez Evangelist Krek in Ljubljana in 1917 turned into a manifestation of the Party popular support. Cultural meeting organized by the Slovene People's Party during the January 6th Dictatorship, when the SLS became the main opposition to the authoritarian regime of Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Slovenia.  From the establishment of the party to the collapse of Austria Hungary  The Slovene People‚Äôs Party was founded under the name Catholic National Party (Katoli≈°ka narodna stranka) in 1892 in Ljubljana with the aim of working in the Carniola region. On 27 November 1905, the ruling body of the party adopted a motion changing the name to Slovene People‚Äôs Party. Under the influence of Ivan ≈†uster≈°iƒç, Evgen Lampe and Janez Evangelist Krek, the party evolved in the early years of the new century from a conservative party into a Christian Social party, based on mass support. The main plank of its programme was support for workers and farmers. ≈†uster≈°iƒç, Krek and their colleagues worked to establish a broad network of cooperatives and lenders, which offered credit on favourable terms and assistance. By 1907, they had already established 433 collectives. In October 1909, the Carniolan SLS joined with related Catholic organisations from Lower Styria, Carinthia, Gorizia and Gradisca and Istria. It was renamed to Pan- Slovene People's Party (Vseslovenska ljudska stranka, VLS) and became the leading and most powerful Slovene political party. In the last elections for the Reichsrat in the Habsburg Monarchy, the SLS won some 87% of all Slovene mandates. Until World War I, the party campaigned for greater autonomy for Slovene within the Habsburg Monarchy.  In Yugoslavia  In 1917, the SLS had a decisive influence on the adoption of the May Declaration, in which members of the Reichsrat called for the union of South Slav lands under the Habsburg crown. Anton Koro≈°ec became the leader of the party in the same year. Even before the conclusion of negotiations on the fate of the Slovenes in the Habsburg Monarchy, Anton Koro≈°ec had supported the secession of the Slovenes and Croats from the Habsburg Monarchy and the creation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. In 1920, the party reverted to its original name 'Slovene People's Party'. In the general Yugoslav elections of November 1920, the SLS lost its absolute majority in Slovenia for the first time since 1907. From 87% of all Slovenian mandates before the elections, it fell to just 36% of the popular vote after the elections. Thereafter, the party gradually shifted its orientation: it quit the Yugoslav government and began to agitate for greater autonomy for Slovenes within the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In this period, the SLS formed the Federalist Bloc together with the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, Yugoslav Muslim Organization, and other minor parties. The coalition was however too heterogeneous, and was held together by a single issue: the wish of decentralization of the Yugoslav State. In 1925, the Federalist Bloc fell apart when the Croatian Peasant Party, led by Stjepan Radiƒá, entered a compromise with the centralist government and formed a ruling coalition with the People's Radical Party, the main political representative of Yugoslavia's Serbian establishment. Following the breakdown of the Federalist Bloc, the SLS was forced to redefine its tactics. From a federalist program, it turned back on the defence of purely Slovenian interests, trying to form a compromise with the centralist establishment. After multiple unsuccessful attempts, the SLS was included in the Yugoslav government in 1927, when it formed a coalition with the Serbian People's Radical Party. The roles were now reversed, with the Slovene People's Party in government, and its former Croatian agrarian allies in opposition. After the assassination of Stjepan Radiƒá in 1928, which was followed by the resignation of the Prime Minister Velja Vukiƒáeviƒá, the leader of the SLS Anton Koro≈°ec became Prime Minister of Yugoslavia. Koro≈°ec however only held the premiership for less than one year, until King Alexander declared a dictatorship in January 1929. Following the royal coup d'√©tat, all parties, including the SLS, were forced to stop their activities. After some initial opposition to the dictatorship, the leadership of the Slovene People's Party started to collaborate with the government, in the hope to alleviate possible negative consequences for Slovenia. By 1931, however, the relations between the SLS and the royalist administration worsened. Because of SLS's demands for the reintroduction of free suffrage, for greater autonomy for Slovenia and for a federal constitution for the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, several members of the SLS were arrested. Koro≈°ec was placed under house arrest. After King Alexander‚Äôs death in 1934, the SLS started working for a gradual re- approachment to the central government. In 1935, the SLS entered a new Yugoslav government together with Serb radicals and Bosnian Muslims. The three groups formed a unified coalition party, called Yugoslav Radical Community, led by the Prime Minister Milan Stojadinoviƒá. Nevertheless, the SLS maintained its independent organization within the new party. In the years prior to World War Two, the SLS started facing opposition from its own files. Its Christian Socialist members started fleeing massively the party, and many centrist, Christian Democratic and autonomist members became alienated from the party's authoritarian turn. Nevertheless, the party won a landslide victory in the last general elections before World War Two in 1939. The impressive and unprecedented result (over 78% of the vote) was however achieved with a low voting outcome (only around 60% of those entitled to vote showed up in the polls) and in a controlled a non-secret elections (the voters had to publicly express their vote).  World War II  Despite questions of fairness in the elections, it is beyond doubt that before the outbreak of World War II, the SLS was still the largest and most powerful political party in Slovenia, enjoying the support of vast strata of the population. When Anton Koro≈°ec died in 1940, the party was left without any real leadership, because there was no charismatic personality that could effectively take on the role of leading the party. The new president of the SLS was Father Franc Kulovec, a Roman Catholic cleric, but he was killed in 1941 during the German bombardment of Belgrade. At the start of the war, the SLS had two leaders: Miha Krek and Marko Natlaƒçen. After internal discussions, it was decided that Krek should leave with members of the Yugoslav government for London, while Natlaƒçen, who was also governor (ban) of the Drava Banovina, should lead the party during the occupation. On 6 April 1941, in light of the combined German, Italian and Hungarian attacks on Slovenian territory, then still part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, SLS suggested the holding of a national council with the goal of achieving Slovenian autonomy under one sole occupier. The Slovenian parliamentary parties chose Marko Natlaƒçen, as the head of the most powerful political party, to lead the council, but in 1942, an officer in the secret services working for the Communist Party of Slovenia assassinated Natlaƒçen, leaving the SLS without a leader. Natlaƒçen was replaced by various other politicians, but they did not have the same political convictions and there were numerous divisions within the party. During the civil war that took place during World War II, the SLS began to lose support and its former political influence because many of its politicians collaborated with the occupying forces. Despite his calls from London to stop collaborating, Miha Krek was not able to re-establish control over the Slovene People's Party.  After World War II  After World War II, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia took power and banned all other political parties, including the SLS. The party‚Äôs leading politicians emigrated to the US and to Argentina. Miha Krek left for Washington, D.C. but remained president of the SLS. The party, which could not operate in Slovenia, was accepted into the League of Central European Christian Democrat Parties in 1952. Following Krek‚Äôs death in 1969, Milo≈° Stare, who lived in Argentina, was elected president of the SLS. Following his death in 1984, Marko Krem≈æar took over the helm of the party. 1992 marked the party‚Äôs return to Slovenia, when the party merged with the Slovene Christian Democrats (SKD), led by Lojze Peterle, and Marko Krem≈æar was elected its vice- president. In the year 2000, the Slovene Christian Democrats merged with the modern Slovene People's Party, which had been founded in 1988; the modern Slovene People's Party thus became the official successor of the historical SLS.

History =Construction= The one-storey andesite (Ankara stone) building was designed by architect Salim Bey, at the request of Enver Pasha, as the headquarters of the Committee of Union and Progress. Construction began in 1915, under the supervision of Turkish Army Corps architect Hasip Bey. Before the building was finished, the Turkish Grand National Assembly decided use it, and its completion had to be hurried for the inaugural meeting. =Grand Opening= Thousands gathered in Ulus Square for the opening of the assembly on April 23, 1920, and Sinop representative Serif Bey, who as the oldest member had been chosen as President of the Assembly, made the first speech. Ankara representative Mustafa Kemal followed him. Mustafa Kemal was elected President of the Assembly at the second session of the Assembly held the following day and concluded his acceptance speech by stating, ‚ÄúThere is no power above this Grand Assembly anymore...‚Äù =Independence War= The building continued to serve as the headquarters of the Turkish Grand National Assembly throughout the War of Independence and many significant decisions were made here; *January 20, 1921: Approval of the First Turkish Constitution *March 12, 1921: Approval of the Turkish National Anthem *November 1, 1922: Abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate *July 24, 1923: Approval of Treaty of Lausanne *October 13, 1923: Establishment of Ankara as the Capital City of the Turkish Republic *October 29, 1923: Declaration of Republic and the election of Mustafa Kemal as first president Atat√ºrk stated, ‚ÄúThe Grand National Assembly is the living symbol of the Turkish Nation's century‚Äôs old search for self determination and consciousness...‚Äù The building continued to house the assembly until October 15, 1924. =Later use= The building served as the headquarters of the Republican People's Party and then as the School of Law before being turned over to the Turkish Ministry of Education in 1952. Work started in 1957 to convert the building into a museum and it was opened to the public as the Turkish Grand National Assembly Museum on April 23, 1961. The building was further restored, as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Atat√ºrk, by the Antiquities and Museums General Directorate of the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and was reopened as the Independence War Museum on April 23, 1981. Museum The building remains open to the public, having recently undergone further renovation, as the Independence War Museum with a number of rooms currently open to view. =Corridor= The main corridor contains oil paintings depicting the events of the years from 1918 to 1923, and the work of the assembly in its first and the second terms. =Masjid (prayer room)= The masjid was used by the Assembly as a prayer room and has prayer rugs and Koran Rahle on display. =Assembly president‚Äôs room= The original appearance and arrangement of Mustafa Kemal's has been preserved. The presidential seal, which is on display in this room, is described as the most important and distinguished piece of the museum‚Äôs collection. =Chambers of the ruling council= The cabinet and presidential board rooms have also been preserved. The President‚Äôs pulpit and the cabinet table and chairs used at the Sivas Congress are on display alongside photographs of the members of the first cabinet of Turkey after the declaration of the Republic. =Committee room= The committee room contains an exhibition of documents, photographs and artefacts relating to the Armistice of Mudros, Mustafa Kemal‚Äôs arrival in Samsun, the Amasya Circular, the Sivas and Erzurum Congresses, and the Misak-ƒ± Mill√Æ.

This page also covers how specific fungal infections affect crops present in the United States.  Almonds  = Alternaria leaf spot = Symptoms of Alternaria leaf spot appear as lesions with tan spots on the leaves. The centers of these lesions become black with fungal sporulation. This infection can lead to tree death within 3‚Äì4 years of the first serious outbreak. Orchards in high humidity areas result in the largest yield loss, often in excess of 50%. Yield loss tends to rise every year as the tree becomes weaker each year after infection. Three fungicide applications can achieve 60‚Äì80% control of leaf spot.Specific Section 18 Emergency Exemption Request to use Azoxystrobin (Abound Flowable) to Control Alternaria on Almonds in San Joaquin Valley of California, California Department of Pesticide Regulation, 1999. = Anthracnose = Anthracnose was not seen on California almonds until the early 1990s. By 1996 it was widespread and causing severe yield losses throughout the state.Teviotdale, Beth L., et al., eds., Compendium of Nut Crop Diseases in Temperate Zones, APS Press, 2002 Typical losses in 1996 were 10‚Äì15% of the almond crop with severely affected crops incurring losses of 25%.Anthracnose called ‚ÄòUgliest Orchard Disease‚Äô by Farm Advisor, Ag Alert, August 14, 1996 Under wet conditions, orange spore masses are produced and appear as visible droplets. Lesions on mature fruit are rusty orange and gum profusely. Once the diseased fruit die they become mummies that remain on the tree. The pathogen overwinters in these mummies. 80‚Äì90% control can be achieved by applying fungicides to protect the crop before rains begin. The California Department of Pesticide Regulation has estimated that without the fungicides to control anthracnose the state's almond production would drop 15‚Äì30%.Specific Exemption for Use of Propiconazole (Break EC) for Control of Anthracnose on Almonds in California, California Department of Pesticide Regulation, Section 18 Emergency Exemption Request, November, 1997. = Brown rot = Damage from brown rot occurs several years after the infection strikes. The primary symptom is fruiting spur loss. Brown rot was first discovered on California almonds in the late 19th century and currently affects most almond-producing areas of California. Brown rot can be controlled using fungicides through bloom in order to protect the flower parts from brown rot attacks. Experiments have demonstrated that 44% of twigs were infected with brown rot when crops were left untreated compared to only 4% when the crop was treated. = Crown and root rot = Crown and root rot of almonds is caused by at least 14 different Phytophthora species. The risk of root or crown infection is greatest during cool to moderate temperatures with prolonged or frequent soil saturation. A tree infected with Phytophthora can either undergo a period of slow decline that may last years or it can suddenly collapse and die in spring with the advent of warm weather.Integrated Pest Management for Almonds, University of California, Statewide Integrated Pest Management Project, Publication 3308, 1985. Eventually, leaves drop, terminal shoots die back, and death of the tree follows. Once in the root or crown the infection may extend into the crown, trunk, or branches. Currently, crown and root rot are a problem affecting 20% of California's almond orchards with potential yield losses of 50%. = Green fruit rot = Green fruit rot can be found throughout virtually all almond-producing regions of California.Years of Discovery: A Compendium of Research Projects 1972-1998, Almond Board of California, 1999. Green rot is typically controlled by fungicides applied to control other fungal diseases that occur during blooming. It is only when cooler temperatures and heavy moisture is present that almond growers are recommended to make fungicide applications specifically for the disease. When left untreated, green fruit rot can cause up to a 10% yield loss. = Leaf blight = Leaf blight of almonds was first discovered in 1950, and by 1983 it had spread throughout the Sacramento Valley. Almond leaf blight is characterized by the death of leaves throughout the summer. The fungus interferes with water conduction in the leaf. In fall and winter, dormant buds are killed by an extension of the lesion and in the spring, flowers are killed. Repeated attacks of leaf blight, though rarely killing more than 20% of the leaves, ultimately reduce tree vigor. Experiments have shown that the use of ziram and captan can reduce the incidence of leaf blight by 75‚Äì80% in treated trees. = Rust = Almond rust is a disease of almond trees that is characterized by angular yellow leaf spots on upper leaf surfaces and rusty brown masses of spores on lower leaf surfaces. It was first discovered in the upper Sacramento Valley area of California but now has subsequently spread throughout both the Sacramento and San Joaquin valley orchards. It typically emerges in the summer and fall seasons and has been shown to cause rapid and extensive defoliation of trees. Treatments of maneb and sulfur in the early season months (typically spring and summer) have been shown to significantly reduce incidence and severity of rust outbreaks. = Scab = Almond scab was first documented in almond orchards in the 1950s. However it did not become a major disease until sprinkler irrigation became popular in the 1980s. By the early 1990s almond scab could be found throughout California almond orchards. Scab infects leaves, fruit, and twigs in almonds causing dark spots to form. Scab lesions look greasy and oily. The major concern with almond scab is partial or complete defoliation of the tree. As with leaf blight use of captan and ziram has been shown to reduce total incidence of almond scab infection. = Shot hole = Shot hole affects almonds by disrupting both the leaves and the fruit of the plant. It can result in premature nut ripening and plant defoliation. In some occasions, especially when rain persists in the springtime, complete defoliation and tree weakening can occur. Estimates have shown that approximately 80% of California's almond acres are infected with this fungus.Gubler, W. Douglas, Fungicide Benefits Assessment Fruit and Nut Crops - West, USDA National Agricultural Pesticide Impact Assessment Program, January, 1991. A four-year research project by the Almond Board of California determined that production losses from shot hole could range from 50 to 75%. Captan in one to three applications has been used as the primary fungicide to combat this disease. It has been shown to reduce lesions per fruit by 96%.  Apples  Brown Rot on Apple Spraying for control of fungal diseases of apples started in the U.S. some time between 1880 and 1905. = Apple scab = Apple scab is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. Mating among different strains of the fungus occurs shortly after leaf fall with spores developing in the fallen leaves during the winter. Spring rains cause spores to be forcibly discharged; they can be carried long distances by air currents to flowers, leaves, or young fruit.Keitt, G.W., \\"Scab of Apples,\\" Yearbook of Agriculture 1953, United States Department of Agriculture, p. 646, 1954. The spores then continue to develop and are released over a period of 5‚Äì9 weeks.Jones A.L., and H.S. Aldwinckle, eds., Compendium of Apple and Pear Diseases, APS Press, 1990. These spores germinate and penetrate the outer layers of the plant, causing infection. The fungus grows beneath the cuticle and eventually ruptures to form dark green lesions. The number of lesions per leaf can be as few as 1‚Äì2 or there can be hundreds. The USDA's National Agricultural Pesticide Impact Assessment Program estimated that 100% of eastern apple orchards are stricken with apple scab and that without fungicide treatments yield losses would be as high as 90%.Hickey, Kenneth D., Fungicide Benefits Assessment Fruit and Nut Crops - East, USDA National Agricultural Pesticide Impact Assessment Program, January, 1991. In the western orchards 52% are infected and apple yield loss can be as high as 22%. However, with the use of fungicides experiments have shown heavy reductions in the percentage of infected apples. One study was able to reduce the incidence from 77% to 2%. = Bitter rot = Bitter rot is a major disease in the Southeast U.S. in the summer months when the weather is hot and damp. The organism has a short incubation period and as a result epidemics of bitter rot can develop rapidly. The presence of the disease is first indicated by the very small light brown sunken spots beneath the apple skin.Hurt, R.H., and F.J. Schneiderhan, New Methods of Bitter Rot Control, Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin No. 254, February, 1927. As the fungus grows and invades more of the apple tissue, the area becomes engorged until the entire apple is rotted.Dunegan, John C., \\"Bitter Rot of Apples,\\" Yearbook of Agriculture 1953, United States Department of Agriculture, p. 655, 1954. Around the start of the 20th century Bordeaux mixture was the primary technique for controlling the disease; in the 1940s growers shifted to synthetic chemical use. Without these fungicides is it estimated that apple yield loss due to bitter rot would be as high at 90%. = Black pox = This disease primarily affects the southeastern portion of the United States and is known to infect the cultivars Rome Beauty, Grimes Golden, Delicious, York Imperial, and Golden Delicious. Lesions on twigs are well defined, conical, shiny black swellings and on the fruit itself they are black, spherical, slightly sunken spots. Severely affected leaves may die within 2 to 3 weeks of infection. Infected branches will grow poorly, lose their leaves early, and die. Black pox can be controlled with the same fungicide sprays that are used to treat scab. = Blossom-end rot = The first symptom of blossom-end rot is soft, wet, and reddish discolorations that appear in the late summer months. As the rot stops growing it will begin to dry out and appear sunken. The affected fruit will often drop prematurely. Fungicide experiments have shown reduced incidence, from 5% to less than 0.5%, with treatment. = Brooks fruit spot = Brooks fruit spot is a minor disease of the apple and is found mostly throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. As the fruit first emerges the disease appears as dark green lesions on the fruit of the apple. As the apple begins to emerge these blemishes grow and change to purple or green. Brooks fruit spot is usually controlled with fungicides applied during the early cover-spray period. One study showed that apple orchards that were not treated with fungicides had 87% of their fruit infected with brooks fruit spot while only 1‚Äì6% of trees that were treated with fungicides showed symptoms of the disease. = Fire blight = Fire blight was first described in New York in the late 18th century, and moved west with settlers, becoming established throughout North American apple production areas by the early 20th century. While fire blight has always been a concern in eastern apple production, severe outbreaks in the west in recent years have caused growers there to adopt more consistent and vigorous monitoring and management programs as well. The disease can affect every part of the tree, from the fruit to the trunk. Infected trees may die within months or can linger for years with severely reduced yields. In addition to the scorched appearance of the plant parts that gives the disease its name, plant tissues infected with the bacteria will exude milky or reddish-brown ooze. Initially copper sprays were used for fire blight control in the 1930s but this method had limited success. In the 1950s streptomycin and oxytetracycline showed high success in controlling fire blight in comparison to copper. Since then streptomycin sprayed two to three times during blooming phase has become the treatment of choice. = Powdery mildew = Powdery mildew is a common fungal infection of apples and can occur in almost any apple growing climate. The spores from fungi preserved over the winter are released from the unfolding leaves of the buds. The spores, carried by the wind, infect leaves, blossoms, and fruit. The fungus spreads until it covers the whole leaf and then grows down twigs, covering them with a gray felt. This results in aborted blossoms, reduced finish quality, and reduced yield. The USDA has estimated that 40% of apple orchards in the East and 50% of apple orchards in the West are infected with powdery mildew. Without control of the fungus yields would drop by 65%. = Quince rust = Quince rust infects the fruit of the apple trees but does not affect the leaves. Quince rust spores infect cedar trees and create cylindrical galls from which emerge spore horns the following spring. These galls may produce spores for up to twenty years. Quince rust is economically important primarily when an extended wetting period with a mean temperature above 10 ¬∞C occurs between the tight cluster and late pink bud stages. Under these conditions, economic losses may occur throughout large geographic areas. Experiments with fungicide sprays have been shown to provide complete control of rust.Palmiter, D.H., Rust Diseases of Apples and Their Control in the Hudson Valley, New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin No. 756, November, 1952. = White rot = White rot gets its name from the soft, watery, and light-colored rotted fruit that is left over after an apple is infected. The fungus survives from season to season in the dead bark and mummified fruit of the apple tree. Spores can survive in the dead bark for up to six years. Growers are advised to treat for white rot once the sugar content of the fruit reaches approximately 10%. USDA estimates that 20% of apple orchards in eastern states are infected with the fungus and that without fungicide use yield losses would be 65%.  Artichokes  California produces 100% of all artichoke crops in the U.S. 84% of this acreage is located near the cool, moist, coastal area of Monterey Bay. The climate there is ideal for artichoke production. = Powdery Mildew = In 1984, artichoke fields were reported to have been infected with powdery mildew for the first time. In the ensuing years the disease continued to reappear with each year the disease becoming more widespread than in the past.Specific Exemption for Use of Myclobutanil for Control of Powdery Mildew on Artichoke in California, California Environmental Protection Agency, Section 18 Emergency Exemption Request, May 27, 1998. The fungus colonizes the underside of leaves and the wind carries spores between fields. Severely infected leaves will discolor, collapse, and dry up prematurely; thus reducing the plant‚Äôs photosynthetic area. Currently, there are no registered fungicides that provide effective control of the disease in the coastal conditions of California. Sulfur is registered but it has been shown to be largely ineffective in controlling powdery mildew. For sulfur to be effective, it is critical that the ambient air temperature be warm. The cool and humid climate of the coastal region means sulfur is ineffective in controlling powdery mildew. As a result, every year since 1987 California has requested the EPA grant emergency registration for fungicides to be used in controlling powdery mildew.  Asparagus  = Crown rot = Crown rot in asparagus was first reported in California in 1938 when Californian growers began to report a slimy, orange-yellow asparagus tissue with soft lesions causing post harvest losses of 20‚Äì30%. As lesions grow they eventually collapse and shrivel. In the 1980s it was shown that fungicidal treatments of metalaxyl increased yields by 80%. Today mefenoxam (metalaxyl-m) is the primary fungicide used to treat crown rot. = Purple spot = Purple spot was first observed in the United States in the 1980s. Yield loss due to this disease is delayed because the damage to fern growth does not affect current yields but instead affects the future crop. Damage results in the defoliation of needles, reducing the flow of carbohydrates to the roots and subsequently lowering the next year's yield by up to 52%. In the spring spores produced from the previous year's infected crops are spread by water and wind to new host plants. The primary control of purple spot was EBDC fungicides until processors began to reject the use of EBDCs. As a result, since 1990 exemptions for chlorothalonil and tebuconazole in Michigan have been granted by the EPA for use on asparagus. The fungicides are applied at the end of the harvest and chlorothalonil has been shown in experiments to reduce purple spot by 99% and increase yields by 36%. This increase in yield as a result of purple spot control has been shown to translate into a net return of $200‚Äì400 per acre for asparagus growers . = Rust = Asparagus rust was first reported in the U.S. in 1896. It began on the asparagus crops of mostly northeastern states and began to move westward across the country- Halsted, Byron D., The Asparagus Rust; Its Treatment and Natural Enemies, New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 129, 1898. For each successive year the disease was discovered in new western areas until in 1902 it was reported in California for the first time. Research to control the disease began with Bordeaux mixture experiments around the start of the 20th century. Copper and sulfur dust were tried as well but their success was very limited. Sulfur was the only one to have much success at all.Smith, Ralph E., Further Experience in Asparagus Rust Control, University of California, College of Agriculture, Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 172, 1906. Rust resistant strains of asparagus were cultivated but by the 1940s and 1950s these strains of asparagus were no longer providing adequate levels of resistance.Kahn, Robert P., et al., An Investigation of Asparagus Rust in Illinois; Its Causal Agent and Its Control, University of Illinois, Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 559, 1952 In the 1950s zineb and mancozeb were developed as the primary means to control rust. Zineb reduced infection by 85% and mancozeb by 97% . By 1989 EBDC fungicides had become the most common fungicidal means to control rust on asparagus. However, after the EPA almost cancelled the use of EBDCs on asparagus many processors decided they would not accept EBDC-treated asparagus despite the EPA allowing its use after review. This meant that many growers were left with no registered fungicide to use on asparagus. Since 1990 the EPA has granted exemptions for tebuconazole, myclobutanil, and triadimefon for use on asparagus.  Bananas  Hawaii is the primary state in the U.S. where bananas are grown. The average yield is 15,000 pounds/acre. Approximately 600-800 plants are grown per acre. Planting occurs year-round. Banana bunches are ready for harvest 12 to 15 months after initial planting. On a banana plantation, plants can be seen at all stages of vegetative growth and fruit maturity year-round. Bananas can be harvested any day of the year. = Black sigatoka = Like yellow sigatoka, black sigatoka, was first documented in the Sigatoka valley of Fiji. It was first recorded in 1964 and being more virulent tended to displace yellow sigatoka in banana crops. Therefore, yellow sigatoka is rarely found in locations where black sigatoka occurs.Ploetz, R.C. et al., ed., Compendium of Tropical Fruit Diseases, APS Press, 1998 Black sigatoka infection appears on the leaves of crops during the unfurling. Sigatoka spores will incubate on the leaves for up to six days before penetrating the leaf. After this the infection will continue to colonize for a week before the plant exhibits symptoms. The initial symptoms are small spots on the undersides of the leaves. These appear 10‚Äì15 days after infection and grow until they appear as black streaks on the leaves. This is what gives black sigatoka its alternate name of black leaf streak. These streaks can dry out and collapse in less than a day. This affects growth and yield of bananas by reducing the total photosynthetic area of the leaf. However the largest effect on yields is through the toxins produced by black sigatoka that causes a premature ripening of the bananas. These prematurely ripened fruit cannot be sold and must be discarded. Under normal conditions in Hawaii it is estimated that without control of black sigatoka yield losses would be 30%. Sigatoka is controlled with a combination of protectant and systemic fungicides in order to prevent resistance from developing. Mancozeb is applied as the primary protectant and fenbuconazole, tebuconazole, and azoxystrobin are applied as systemic fungicides. These fungicides are applied during summer. = Yellow sigatoka = Yellow sigatoka derives its name from the Sigatoka valley in Fiji. This was where the disease was first documented in 1912. Over the course of the first half of the 20th century the disease spread to all major banana- producing countries of the world. It was first seen in Trinidad in 1934 and quickly spread to the mainland and up through Central America . The disease can spread spores over 1,000 miles with wind currents. By 1936 experiments with Bordeaux mixture were developed to control the disease. The disease was first discovered in Hawaii in 1958.  Barley  The major barley producing states of the United States are Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, and North Dakota. These states make up 70% of barley production in America. This barley is principally used in malting and brewing. It is also in some areas used as a feed grain. = Barley scab = Outbreaks of barley scab (also known as fusarium head blight) usually occur when there are high moisture conditions during the flowering stages of barley development. The infected crops become bleached in color, shrunken, and discolored and will grow pink spore masses on the barley heads. The disease has the potential to destroy a crop within weeks. The shrunken kernels can become so light that the wind can blow them away from the rest of the crop. In addition, barley scab produces toxins that severely reduce the value of the harvested barley. This toxin, deoxynivalenol, also known as vomitoxin because of its tendency to induce vomiting at high levels, will pass through the brewing process into the beer. When the beer is opened the toxin will cause the liquid to overflow from the bottle or can. Because this is not commercially desirable, barley producers receive severe price discounts when vomitoxin is present. Currently control of barley scab is seen as a high priority, resulting in the U.S. National Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative. In 2005 alone North Dakota State experts estimated that scab cost the North Dakota farm economy $162 million and in 1993 it cost North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota $1 billion. Fungicide trials in 2004 were promising. Results demonstrated that fungicide use reduced scab by 77‚Äì85%, reduced vomitoxin levels by 49‚Äì69%, and increased yields by 10‚Äì14%. = Stripe rust = Stripe rust is a recent fungus to arrive in North and South America. The disease was first observed in Colombia in 1975 and is believed to have been brought over from Europe.Mathre, D.E., ed., Compendium of Barley Diseases, 2nd Edition, APS Press, 1997 In the U.S. it was first discovered in Texas in 1991 and by the mid-90s it could be found throughout barley crops in the western states. Stripe rust is now established in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington and all other barley areas of the Pacific Northwest are considered highly susceptible.Specific Exemption for Use of Tebuconazole (Folicur 3.6F) for Control of Stripe Rust infesting Barley in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, Idaho Department of Agriculture, Section 18 Emergency Exemption Request, January 16, 1998. Between 1996 and 1998 in Oregon yield losses of 25‚Äì50% were reported and in California between 15 and 30% were recorded.\\"Barley Growers fighting Strip Rust,\\" Capital Press, July 18, 1997\\"Heat, Strip Rust Damage Nw, California Barley Crop,\\" Capital Press, September 18, 1998 The state of Idaho estimates that without fungicide use yield losses would be 40%, as opposed to 5% with fungicide application.  Blueberries  Blueberries are susceptible to a number of fungal diseases. These have been shown by the USDA to reduce yields by 25‚Äì60% if left uncontrolled. = Alternaria leaf spot = Leaf spot was first identified in North Carolina in the early 1970s when it was found to be causing widespread fruit decay in blueberries. The disease is especially harmful to growers because symptoms of the disease do not develop until May, about a month before the June harvest. When the fruit ripens it becomes covered in a greenish fungal growth and can become leaky. Because the fungus develops late in the harvest, it can be effectively controlled by applying fungicides at early bloom and then every two weeks until harvest. = Botrytis blight = Botrytis blight is a grey mold fungus that was first observed on New Jersey blueberries in 1924 and by the 1950s was considered the most dangerous disease of the Northwest. USDA estimates that 95% of Northwestern blueberry crop and 40% of eastern blueberry fields are infected with botrytis blight. Yield losses within these fields with uncontrolled blight are estimated to be 30‚Äì40%. In most cases infections in the blossoms of the plant results in ovary mortality which prevents development of the blueberry itself. = Fusicoccum canker = Fusicoccum canker is a disease of the blueberry that is mostly limited to Michigan blueberry producers. It was first discovered in the 1960s and has been an annual problem of the lower portion of the peninsula. When left uncontrolled the disease has been shown to reduce yields by 30%. Fusicoccum canker is primarily controlled using captan. Research has shown that regular applications can reduce infectious cankers by 82‚Äì95%. = Mummyberry = This fungal infection strikes the blueberry plant in the early spring. Over the winter the mummyberry infection incubates in the mummified blueberry fruit that has fallen on the ground and in the spring cup-shaped structures of the fungus begin to grow. These structures will then eject spores for nine days at an average of sixty thousand spores per day. These spores are carried by the wind to the twigs and flowers of developing blueberry plants. The fungus then infects the young leaves and flowers. This is infection stage 1. The secondary infection stage occurs when the infected leaves and flower grow conidia, these conidia release spores which will actually \\"fertilize\\" healthy blueberry flowers causing the plant to grow a thick fungus sclerotium that helps the fungus to survive the winter. These berries then fall to the ground where they serve as the hosts for the next year's mummberry infection. If the infection were left uncontrolled the USDA estimates that blueberry yields would fall an average of 20 to 50%. without control, the state of Maine estimated their yields would drop 25% and Michigan has reported that they would lose 25‚Äì57% of the crop.Section 18, Specific Exemption, Petition for use of Propiconazole, Orbit Fungicide, EPA Reg. No. 100-702, on wild blueberry fields in Maine to control Mummy berry disease, Maine Department of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Resources, Section 18 Emergency Exemption Request, December 17, 1997.Section 18, Specific Exemption, Petition for use of Fenbuconazole, Indar Fungicide, to control mummy berry disease of blueberries in Michigan in 1999, Michigan Department of Agriculture, Section 18 Emergency Exemption Request, January 28, 1999 Experiments with fungicide applications have reduced the incidence of mummyberry at harvest from 21‚Äì24% to 0.4% and increased yield by up to 34%. = Phytophthora root rot = Phytophthora root rot was first reported in the blueberry plant in 1963. In plants surveyed in North Carolina it was found that 40% of plants were infected. Symptoms of root rot include yellowing or reddening of leaves, heavy defoliation, and stunted plant growth. Today current USDA estimates are that 80% of eastern blueberry acres are infected with root rot and it has the potential to reduce yields by up to 25%. = Pseudomonas blight = Pseudomonas blight is a bacterial disease that invades the blueberry plant early in the season when tissue is damaged by freezing temperatures. The bacteria invade the tissue of the plant and spread throughout the plant as long as it remains cool and damp. As the infection spreads thin strands of ooze appear on the surface of the tissue. When temperatures rise the disease will retreat until fall when the colder weather allows it to return. Copper is primarily used to control the bacteria population. = Ripe rot = Ripe rot, the more common name for anthracnose, is a disease localized mostly to the northern and southern blueberry-growing regions. However has been spreading east and it is now estimated to infect 30% of the eastern blueberry growing regions. Much like leaf spot, ripe rot symptoms appear as the blueberry begins to ripen and mature. Once the blueberry has ripened, it softens and orange spores will be exuded. This disease can be especially costly because if a diseased berry showing no symptoms is put in a container of untainted berries it can very quickly infect the entire container. Control of this disease is achieved with fungicidal applications every 1‚Äì2 weeks. = Septoria leaf spot = Septoria leaf spot infects the blueberry plant through spores ejected from infected leaves and stem lesions left on the ground from the previous harvest season. These spores infect the crop and small white/tan leaf lesions form on the plant and the stem in early May. These lesions continue to develop and multiply through September. Severe infection causes defoliation of the plant. This will lower fruit yield as the nutrient supply is reduced. In weaker infections where defoliation does not occur the loss of photosynthetic area will reduce yields as well. Use of fenbuconazole has been shown to be successful in controlling leaf spot. If applied at harvest it will help prevent leaf spot from forming the next year. It has been shown to average 45% greater yields in the next harvest.Cline, W.O., \\"Blueberry Bud Set and Yield Following the Use of Fungicides for Leaf Spot Control in North Carolina,\\" Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium of Vaccinium, Acta Horticulturae, Vol. 574, 2002  Cabbage  = Alternaria leaf spot = Alternaria leaf spot affects the cabbage plant by causing severe spotting and discoloration to the head of the plant. It is only a superficial effect to the plant but because of the black color of the leaf spots the marketability of a severely infected cabbage crop is low. Without control leaf spot is estimated to be able to reduce yields by up to 50%. Alternaria leaf spot is controlled using the same treatment as downy mildew: applications of azoxystrobin, copper, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and maneb beginning midseason. = Black rot = Due to its ability to spread rapidly and destroy entire fields of crops black rot can be considered the most serious disease of the cabbage plant. Under the right conditions one plant has the ability to spread the disease to an entire field and cause 100% yield loss. The disease thrives in areas with heavy rainfall and warmer temperatures. The bacteria invade the plant through the water the plant absorbs and once inside spreads rapidly. It obtains its name because it will blacken and clog the veins of the plant making it impossible to keep nutrients moving through the plant. Copper is the primary treatment for black rot control. = Clubroot = Clubroot gets its name from its primary symptom: enlargement of the plant roots. The abnormally large roots are unable to properly absorb water and nutrients from the ground and the result is cabbages that are undersized, wilted, and discolored. If left uncontrolled yield losses due to clubroot can be as high as 50%. The only fungicide shown to be effective in treating clubroot is PCNB. = Downy mildew = Downy mildew left uncontrolled has the ability to reduce yields by up to 55% and infest up to 80% of plants. Downy mildew is primarily controlled through the use of several fungicides applied during midseason. The fungicides used include azoxystrobin, copper, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and maneb. Farmers in Florida who regularly use fungicides have been shown to reduce yield losses due to downy mildew to as low as 2%.  Carrots  = Bacterial blight = Uncontrolled bacterial blight has been shown to cause yield losses up to 20%. Symptoms include small, dry, and brittle yellowish-brown spots on the plant and stalks covered in bacterial ooze. The primary treatment of bacterial blight is applications of copper before the crop is fully mature. = Cavity spot = Cavity spot differs from the other diseases of the carrot in that symptoms are only visible on the roots of the plant and therefore it is impossible to tell if a plant is infected from above ground. The primary symptom of cavity spot is small half-inch lesions on the roots of the plant. This disease is treated with metalaxyl which allows for almost complete control of the disease. Without metalaxyl studies have found 50‚Äì60% of the carrot crop will be infected; after metalaxyl application, incidence is under 1%. = Powdery mildew = Powdery mildew is one of the more recent diseases of carrots. It was first discovered in 1975 in the United States in the warmer climates of California and Texas. Powdery mildew will cover the carrot with a film of white fungal growth which does not kill the plant, but stunts the growth of the carrot. These weaker plants are nearly impossible to harvest mechanically.  Collards  There are three major disease of collards: Alternaria, downy mildew, and black rot. Alternaria symptoms are small brown lesions on the surface of the collard leaf. Downy mildew produces small yellow fungal spots on the leaf that cause the plant to wither and die. Finally, black rot gets its name because its primary symptom is the bacteria will infect the veins of the plant and turn them black. Additionally, often a V-shaped lesion coming in from the outside of the leaf is characteristic for black rot. These black veins eventually collapse and the plant dies. All three of these diseases are controlled with copper sprays.  Cotton  = Pythium and Rhizoctonia = Pythium and Rhizoctonia are both seedling diseases of the cotton plant. They can be devastating to cotton plants because they develop when seedlings are unable to overcome the damage being caused by the invading fungus. The diseases often kill seeds before they grow. However, if the seeds do manage to sprout they demonstrate symptoms almost immediately. The stalks of the cotton plant will be weak, brown sunken lesions will appear on the stem, and the plant will often die before producing or will have very poor yields. Growers who plant early are especially susceptible because cooler temperatures and damper weather are conducive to these diseases. Therefore, growers who plant early are advised to use in-furrow fungicides for control: PNCB and iprodione for Rhizoctonia and etridiazole and mefenoxam for pythium. Recently, azoxystrobin has proven effective in controlling both rhizoctonia and pythium. = Rust = Rust primarily attacks plants in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.Hine, Richard, and Jeffery C Silvertooth, Diseases and Production Problems of Cotton in Arizona, University of Arizona Cooperative Extension Service, No. 8927, March, 1990. The disease attacks during the summer months and causes yellow or orange spots to grow on the leaves of the cotton plant. These spots can cause defoliation, premature openings, broken stems, and reduced yield. Crops with severe outbreaks have been known to incur losses of up to 50%. This disease is controlled with applications of mancozeb.  Garlic  = Rust = Early symptoms of garlic rust are small yellow spots on the leaves that soon expand until the leaf tissue shatters and visible pustules emerge. Diseased bulbs lose their protective dry outer skin, preventing photosynthesis and leaving the garlic prone to shattering when mechanically harvested. In trials tebconazole and azoxystrobin have been shown to provide 50% higher yields in treated crops.  Grapes  Noble rot on grapes = Black rot = Black rot is a disease estimated to affect 95% of all eastern grape vineyards. The USDA estimates it could reduce yields by 85% if left untreated. Black rot is spread through spores left in the mummied grapes infected the year before. Upon infection the grapes shrivel up and turn black.Pearson, R.C., Black Rot Grape IPM Disease Identification Sheet No. 4, New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, 1984. These grapes do not fall from the vine but stay attached, and over winter spores grow within the infected grape. When summer comes the rain re-moistens the dried grape and causes it to swell. Spores discharge from the swollen grape into the air and infect the healthy crop. Prior to fungicide development for black rot, in conditions favorable to the disease losses of 70 to 100 percent of the crop were common. Today however applications of fungicides have been able to give almost complete control of the disease. In many vineyards infections can be reduced from 95% down to 1%. = Botrytis bunch rot = Cold and wet climates favor this disease, which is why it is often found in the coastal vineyards of California and New York. In the eastern vineyards this disease is estimated to infect 30% of grapes while in California it can infect up to half. This can reduce yields by 40‚Äì60%. Much like black rot, bunch rot overwinters in the berries and infects the next season's crop through spore ejections in the summer. Originally Bordeaux mixture was used to controlled botrytis bunch rot but the use of synthetic chemicals is now the preferred method. = Phomopsis cane and leaf spot = Cane and leaf spot is a disease found on large areas of the East coast but rarely in California. The USDA estimates it affects 75% of the acres of eastern vineyards, with the potential to reduce yields up to 15%. The disease can result in lesions, defoliation, and berry rot. However the same fungicide sprays used to control black rot done early in the season have been shown to control cane and leaf spot. = Powdery mildew = Powdery mildew was first reported in European grape vineyards in the mid-1850s. It could reduce yields by up to 80%. In France alone it reduced wine production from a billion gallons to only two hundred million gallons. It was as a result of this disease's rapid spread throughout the continent that the first fungicide, sulfur, was discovered. The success of sulfur was so great that the grape industry was sparked in California when it was seen that disease could now be controlled and grapes were easy to grow. Uncontrolled powdery mildew rots the grapes from the inside out. Powdery mildew slows the growth of the grape skin so that the inside pulp grows at a faster rate and bursts through. These split grapes dry up and rot. The grapes that do not split open are of much lower quality than normal grapes. Their acidity is much higher and as a result the wines taste bitter and off to most wine drinkers. In order to control powdery mildew the same treatment that was recommended in the late 19th century is still used today: regular applications of sulfur every 1‚Äì2 weeks.Bioletti, Frederic T., Oidium or Powdery Mildew of the Vine, University of California, Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin No. 186, February, 1907  Green beans  = Alternaria = Alternaria was first reported on green beans in Florida in 1951 after a hundred acres were lost to the disease in one season. By the 1970s it had spread up the coast to New York. The disease causes lesions on the skin of the green bean, killing the tissue and giving the plant a moldy appearance. Trials have shown that applications of chlorothalonil can reduce alternaria by up to 85%. = Bacterial blight = Bacterial blight is endemic to green bean crops grown east of the Rocky Mountains. During ideal conditions (usually humid weather) the disease can inflict losses as high as 60%. Symptoms include lesions resembling burn marks that gradually grow larger. In some states incidence of the disease can be as high as 100%. Trials have shown that properly timed copper sprays can reduce incidence by 90%. = Root rot = Root rot is a common disease of Florida green beans and can reduce crop yields there by up to 75% if untreated. It was not until the 1950s that an effective fungicide was found to control root rot. Trials in Florida in the 1950s showed that applications of PCNB were able to reduce incidence to 3%. PCNB is still the primary treatment today. = Powdery mildew = Powdery mildew appears on the green bean plant as a powdery white mold on the surface of the green bean leaf. This can grow and cover the entire plant. Yield losses occur because the damage makes the crop not commercially viable. Powdery mildew can be controlled with applications of sulfur. The original trials in the 1930s showed that incidence could be reduced from 87% to 2%. = Rust = Bean rust is a disease of the green bean that causes rust-colored pustules on the leaves. These pustules eventually rupture and eject thousands of spores into the air to be carried to other plants. Each individual spore can produce a fresh pustule on a plant within a week; therefore untreated rust can rapidly reach epidemic levels. When leaves become infected with rust they rapidly die causing defoliation. Research in the 1930s showed that sulfur was an effective treatment for rust and since then yield losses in treated fields have been reduced by 60%. = White mold = Before effective fungicides were developed white mold caused significant hardship for green bean growers. White mold is considered a resilient disease. After infecting the plant white mold produces black structures called sclerotia that fall to the soil and can survive for over five years until the conditions are right for infection again. Since white mold affects plants very late in the growing season farmers would often harvest early to avoid losing much of their crop. However this usually resulted in a 30% loss of crop. Research in the 1970s eventually discovered that fungicides applied every 20 days reduced white mold incidence to 0% in treated areas.  Hazelnuts  = Eastern filbert blight = Eastern filbert blight is caused by the fungus Anisogramma anomala and is indigenous to the Northeast United States. The fungus causes a small canker on the Native American Hazelnut, Corylus americana. However, on the introduced and commercially important European Hazelnut, Corylus avellana, it causes a lethal disease. The cankers caused by EFB slowly expand and kill the tree over the course of several years if diseased tree limbs are not removed in time. Research with chlorothalonil and tebuconazole in the 1990s showed that 4‚Äì5 applications of the fungicides on a two-week schedule when vegetative buds are breaking dormancy is ideal for control of EFB. The state of Oregon has estimated that if left uncontrolled EFB could eliminate half of the state's hazelnuts within ten years.Specific Exemption for Use of Tebuconazole (Elite 45 DF Foliar Fungicide) for Control of Eastern Filbert Blight in Hazelnuts in Oregon, Oregon Department of Agriculture, Section 18 Emergency Exemption Request, December 20, 1999  Hot peppers  New Mexico accounts for roughly 65% of all U.S. hot pepper production. = Bacterial spot = Bacterial spot is spread from plant to plant through water, wind, and plant contact. Once infected, the leaves of the plant are targeted by the disease. The disease causes severe spotting of the pepper and kills the leaves. This is a twofold problem because the defoliation results in the pepper being discolored by sunscald. Research for bacterial spot treatment has shown that copper sprays have been able to increase marketable yields by 50% in treated fields. = Powdery mildew = Powdery mildew causes a white powdery growth to cover the leaves of the hot pepper plant. These leaves may drop prematurely and as with bacterial spot can then cause sunscald. This disease has been known to cause yield losses as high as 50‚Äì60% in untreated fields. The prime fungicide used to control powdery mildew is myclobutanil.  Lettuce  = Bottom rot = Bottom rot symptoms consist largely of deep reddish-colored lesions on the leaves that slowly spread from leaf to leaf until the entire head is rotted. Trials with vinclozolin have demonstrated effectiveness in controlling bottom rot. Research indicated that when treated, crop yields rise about 36%. = Downy mildew = Downy mildew is an extremely common disease of the lettuce plant. This is largely due to the disease's quick germination period‚Äîthree hours‚Äîand the lettuce plant being susceptible at all growth stages. One study estimated that in untreated Florida fields 75% of lettuce was infected with downy mildew and considered unsalable. Research with maneb has shown the ability to reduce the number of lesions per 10 plants from 187 to about one.Greathead, Arthur S., et al., \\"Fungicidal Control of Downy Mildew and Anthracnose of Lettuce,\\" Iceberg Lettuce Research Program, 6th Annual Report, University of California, 1980 EBDC and fosetyl-Al have also been shown effective in Florida trials that reduced unmarketable heads to 2%. = Lettuce drop = Lettuce drop is another resilient disease of the lettuce plant. It can be found in all lettuce-growing regions of the U.S. and is able to survive in the soil for up to a decade after infecting a field. The fungus appears on the plant as a white mass on the leaf that slowly turns into a hard black growth. These growths release spores that infect the lettuce plant with pathogens that slowly move up the stalk, killing tissue as they travel. Use of DCNA, iprodione, and vinclozolin about a month before harvest has been shown to significantly reduce lettuce drop in treated fields. In treated California fields fungicides are able to reduce yield losses as low as 5%. = Powdery mildew = Powdery mildew attacks lettuce plants by robbing them of the nutrients within the leaf. The fungus appears as a white growth on the upper surface of the leaf where it uses small tubes to pull nutrients out of the plant. This causes severe discoloration and eventual defoliation of the plant. Applications of sulfur are recommended as the primary way to control powdery mildew on lettuce.  Onions  = Downy mildew = Downy mildew is an extremely fast-developing disease in the onion. Studies have observed up to 40% of a field being infected in less than three days.Onion Downy Mildew, University of California Cooperative Extension Service, March, 1995 The first symptoms of the disease are white and purple growths on the surface of the plant leaves. Eventually these leaves die. This in turn destroys the plant's photosynthetic abilities, stunting growth and sometimes killing the plant. Untreated downy mildew can reduce yields by 65%. Downy mildew is controlled with the same foliar fungicides as leaf blight: azoxystrobin, copper, mancozeb, maneb, and mefenoxam. = Botrytis leaf blight = Leaf blight occurs in areas with hot and humid weather. The spores land on onion leaves, penetrate the skin, and rapidly kill the leaf. This causes a severe reduction in bulb size, as high as 50%, and can happen in less than a week. Applications of foliar fungicides can be used to control leaf blight. These include azoxystrobin, chlorotholonil copper, mancozeb, maneb, and mefenoxam. = Purple blotch = Symptoms of purple blotch are primarily small white lesions that grow larger as they turn purple and brown. From these lesions spores are produced that cause additional lesions and also spread to other plants. However to develop, the disease requires very wet conditions for an extended period of time. Fungicide-treated fields have been found to have yields roughly 20‚Äì35% higher than untreated fields. = Seed rot = Yield loss due to seed rot can be as high as 30% in heavily infected acres. The disease infects the onion seed and will cause the onions roots to be gray and mushy. These roots and plants rapidly decay and decompose, killing the plant. Mefenoxam is recommended as treatment for seed rot. = Smut = Smut is a tough disease of the onion because it can last for years in the soil as spores. When the onion crop is planted the spores germinate and enter the fresh seeds. When the plant grows lesions form on the leaf and any bulbs that form will be covered in black spots. Most of the time infected seeds will die within 3‚Äì5 weeks of planting. Mancozeb is recommended for treatment of smut.  Peanuts  = Cylindrocladium black rot = This disease infects any part of the plant below ground, so it often targets the roots; pegs or pods that are below ground are also vulnerable. Infected parts turn black and die. Often the infection spreads and kills the entire root system, effectively killing the plant. Originally the disease was localized to North Carolina and Virginia, but recently Florida and Georgia have begun experiencing higher incidences of the rot. Recent research has shown tebuconazole to significantly suppress the disease and increase yields by up to 1,500 pounds per acre. =Leaf Spot, Early= (Cercospora arachidicola) Spots first appear on the upper surface of lower leaves as faint brown to black pinpoint dots. As the dots enlarge to become brown to dark-brown circular spots, a yellow \\"halo\\" generally develops as a border around each spot. This disease is frequently seen as early as June 1 in both North Carolina and Virginia. Spots with an irregular shape can also develop on leaf petioles and plant stems. Defoliation and reduced yield at harvest can result if this disease is not controlled by fungicide sprays. Leaves that fall to the soil surface may trigger epidemics of certain soilborne diseases such as Southern stem rot. =Leaf Spot, Late= (Cercosporidium personatum Like early leafspot, this disease can also cause defoliation, reduced yield, and increased incidence of certain soilborne diseases such as Southern stem rot. As the name implies, late leafspot is most prevalent during the later part of the growing season. Spots are generally darker in color than early leafspot and commonly show no yellow halo. = Rust = Peanut rust is unique because it is not a native disease to the U.S. and has not been able to survive beyond a single season when introduced. Airborne spores are annually introduced from other peanut-producing nations. Rust causes reduced peanut pod fill and can potentially defoliate the entire crop if the conditions are right. Originally copper and sulfur were used to control rust, but they were only partially effective. It was not until the development of chlorothalonil and tebuconazole that an effective treatment for peanut rust was found. = Sclerotinia blight = Scletotinia blight was first discovered in Virginia in the early 1970s but soon spread to the peanut producing states of North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas. By 1982 it was considered to be one of the more significant diseases of the peanut. In the late 1990s it was estimated that 70% of Virginia peanut land was infected with sclertotinia blight. The disease attacks the plant by producing a white mold on the stems that slowly consumes the stem, causing pods to detach early and leaving them undersized. Pod loss can be as high as 50% in infected areas. In Virginia a five-year experiment saw yield increase of 35% in fields treated with fluazinam.Phipps, Patrick M., Specific Exemption for Use of Fluazinam (Omega 500) for Control of Sclerotinia Blight on Peanuts in Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Section 18 Emergency Exemption Request, January, 2000 = Stem rot = Stem rot, also known as white mold or southern blight, can be found in just about any peanut producing area in the U.S. The most notable symptom of this disease is the white cottony fungal growth that envelops the entire plant. This mold will appear midseason when the foliage has covered the row middles. This damages the pods and creates a rotted texture. In the 1950s PCNB was found to be somewhat effective at preventing white mold; however it was only able to reduce incidence by 15%. It was not until the 1990s when tebuconazole was introduced that a fungicide was able to provide effective disease control. Tebuconazole is able to reduce incidence of white mold by 80‚Äì90%. = Web blotch = Web blotch is currently found in all major peanut growing states in the south. It can be a highly damaging disease. In ideal conditions web blotch can cause yield loss as high as 50%. The first sign that a plant is infected with web blotch is small tan blotches on plant leaves. The leaf will become brittle and the plant will defoliate. Chlorothalonil and tebuconazole are effective treatments for reducing web blotch incidence.  Pecans  = Pecan scab = Pecan scab is the deadliest disease of the pecan. In the right conditions‚Äîhigh humidity and dampness‚Äîup to 100% crop reduction can occur if left uncontrolled. As a result, fungicides are used on 85‚Äì90% of all pecan acreage in southeastern states annually. Fenbuconazole, propiconazole, and TPTH are the primary fungicides used in the southeast for scab control.Large, John R., \\"Results of Two Years Spraying with DuTer (Tri Phenol Tin Hydroxide) Compared with Other Fungicides for the Control of Pecan Scab,\\" Proceedings Southeast Pecan Growers Association, 1965 In the southwest however fungicides are rarely used because the dry growing conditions are not conducive to growth of pecan scab.  Pistachios  = Panicle and shoot blight = In California, since its discovery, panicle and shoot blight have become major diseases of the pistachio crop. The warm, wet weather in the California pistachio acreage has proven to be optimal for the disease. In 1998 alone total lost production was estimated to be around 20 million pounds. The only areas that have been found resilient to the disease are Kern County and parts of the San Joaquin valley. Symptoms include dark lesions and shoots from the buds that are stunted and black. Eventually the leaves on the shoots wither and die and the fruit clusters subsequently collapse. Currently azoxystrobin and chlorothalonil are used for blight control.  Raspberries  = Botrytis fruit rot = This disease infects plants from berries left mummified from last year's crop. When the flowers open, spores from these mummified berries are expelled and infect the plant. This disease can be very costly because no symptoms are exhibited by the plant until harvest time, and then symptoms appear very rapidly. The infected berries quickly develop a layer of gray mold (gray mold is also an alternate name for botrytis fruit rot), begin to leak fluid, and release more spores to cause additional infections. Since the disease is such a late and rapidly occurring disease preventative fungicidal sprays must be used for control. Recent research has demonstrated an 83% reduction of gray mold in treated harvests. = Phythophthora root rot = If the conditions are right root rot can inflict yield losses up to 75% on a raspberry crop. Symptoms of the disease are destruction of root tissue and wilted primocanes and floricanes. Metalaxyl and fosetyl-al applied once in the fall or early spring have been shown to provide effective control of the disease. = Yellow rust = The primary modes of dispersal of yellow rust are wind and the splashing of raindrops, making wet conditions ideal for its spread. This means the Pacific Northwest is very susceptible to yellow rust. The symptoms of yellow rust are typically yellow pustules of the leaves that cause the leaves to fall from the plant. The fruit will also often die before it ripens. In favorable conditions entire fields can easily incur 100% yield loss. Oregon has estimated that treating fields with fungicides can provide 98‚Äì100% control of yellow rust, whereas uncontrolled yellow rust could reduce yields up to 25%.Specific Exemption for Use of Propiconazole (Orbit Fungicide) for Control of Yellow Rust on Raspberries in Oregon, Oregon Department of Agriculture, Section 18 Emergency Exemption Request, March 20, 2000  Rice  = Sheath blight = Sheath blight, caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, is one of the deadlier diseases of rice. Up to 50% of southern United States rice could be infected with sheath blight each year. Unlike most infections it does not produce spores and instead must be spread from contact through plants, rainwater, or the soil. It is a resilient disease that can survive for years in the soil even when there is no rice crop present. Symptoms include lesions on the sheath of the plant, which feed off the nutrients within the plant. These lesions give rise to brown fungus balls which, if the plant dies from nutrient starvation, fall to the ground. The following season, heavy rains may allow the balls to float to other plants, which they can then infect.Damicone, John, et al., Rice Diseases in Mississippi: A Guide to Identification, Mississippi State University Cooperative Extension Service, Publication 1840, 1992 Primary yield loss is therefore attributable to plant death and lower yields from the surviving plants due to the nutrient loss. Yield losses can be as high as 42%. Research data has demonstrated that one application of azocystrobin at panicle differentiation can control sheath blight for almost the entire season. = Kernel smut = Kernel smut can be found throughout soils in the Mid-South where spores are able to survive up to two years without a crop being planted. When a crop is planted the disease infects the rice kernels during early development and replaces the starch inside with black kernel smut spores. These spores swell the plant until the grain eventually cannot contain the spores and bursts, releasing spores into the air. These spores either infect the current crop or land on the soil to infect the next year's crop. The disease harms the plant because when rice infected with kernel smut is harvested it often breaks during the milling process and is rendered useless. Research in Arkansas has recently shown that yield losses is about 10% when rice is left untreated. Propiconazole has been found to provide the best fungicidal control, offering 85‚Äì95% reduction in kernel smut.\\"Sheath Blight and Blast: New Fungicides Offer More Flexibility in Protecting Yield,\\" Rice Journal, p. 14, April 15, 2003 = False smut = False smut damages the rice plant by infecting the ovaries of the rice kernel in its early development. Once inside the disease takes over the ovary and replaces it with spores that burst, producing a large orange ball between the glumes. These galls not only are covered in spores that spread the disease but when harvested result in rice that must be cleaned before it can be sold. Use of propiconazole can reduce false smut by as much as 75%.  Soybeans  = Anthracnose = Anthracnose tends to develop late in the harvesting season, and is not a common soybean disease. It is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum truncatum. The fungus infects soybean by attaching to the surface of the plant and penetrating the tissue wall. From here anthracnose is able to spread spores throughout the plant, killing branches, pods, and leaves. Once the plant is infected the disease causes defoliation and reduced quality and quantity of soybean seeds. Foliar fungicides applied after blooming control the disease. = Frogeye leaf spot = Frogeye leaf spot can occur on all soybean crops but crops in warm and humid regions are most susceptible. The main symptom is circular, purple or red lesions on the foliage of the plant. As the number of lesions grows the leaves eventually wither and die. The disease can spread rapidly and often infects all the leaves of the plant. Yields from infected crops can be reduced by 15%. Fungicides applied at late flowering and the beginning of seed growth have been shown to protect against frogeye. = Rhizoctonia aerial blight = Rhizoctonia aerial blight attacks the soybean crop by infecting the plant during the flowering phase. It infects the tissue and produces lesions that eventually defoliate and rot the plant. Foliar fungicides have been shown to be effective at combating the disease. = Pod and stem blight = Pod and stem blight attack soybean plants during very wet seasons. It is caused by a number of species of the fungal genera Diaporthe and Phomopsis. They cause small black fruiting bodies to form on plant stems and pods. These fungi cause moldy, cracked, and shriveled seeds which in return produce low-quality oil and meal. Foliar fungicides applied between mid-flowing and late pod provide the best fungicidal control. = Soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) = Soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) is caused by numerous species of the fungus Fusarium. First symptoms show up after flowering, and include interveinal necrosis, with green veins. When the stem is split, the cortical tissue will be a tan to cream color. Eventually the plant will dry out and die. Planting resistant soybean cultivars and rotating out of infected fields will reduce disease. https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/ascomycetes/pages/suddendeath.aspx  Spinach  = Downy mildew = Until the late 1950s the United States spinach industry was not considered highly viable. Cultivars were vulnerable to downy mildew, which caused sharp reductions in quality and in select cases complete crop loss. Control by fungicide use was not practical. The spinach industry began to expand in 1947 when a strain of plant was introduced from Iran that was proven to be resistant to downy mildew. Therefore, it was not until the late 1970s that a new strain of the disease made downy mildew a problem for U.S. growers. The disease manifests as small yellow spots that quickly grow and rot the leaves. On the underside of the leaf blue mold spores grow and are spread to the rest of the spinach crop by wind. Epidemics occur quickly due to the fast-growing nature of the fungus. After the new strain was discovered and began to destroy spinach fields, testing began in the 1980s with fungicides to control the disease. Research showed that metalaxyl was effective, reducing yield loss from 43% to 1% in treated fields. = White rust = White rust was discovered in Texas in 1937 and primarily occurs in spinach crops found in eastern U.S. production areas. It has not been reported outside of the U.S. The main symptom of white rust is lesions on the leaf that grow and eventually release spores that cover and kill the entire leaf. Some cultivars of spinach have partial resistance to white rust but metalaxyl has been shown to be the best way to control the disease. It reduces yield loss from 50% in untreated plots to 1% in treated plots.  Sugarbeets  = Powdery mildew = Powdery mildew on sugarbeets can be found wherever the crop is grown in the U.S. It infects plants in the spring when the weather begins to get warm again. The spores land on the leaves and rapidly grow, forming a white mildew film on the foliage within a week of infection. This mildew penetrates the cell wall and begins to absorb nutrients from the leaves. This eventually turns the leaves yellow and kills them. If it proceeds uncontrolled the infection will spread through an entire field within a month. Tests have shown that when left untreated powdery mildew can reduce yields by 27%. Control is best achieved through the use of sulfur, which has been found to increase yields by 38%. = Cercospora leaf spot = Cercospora leaf spot infects sugarbeets by overwintering in the soil from the year's previous crop. It can survive up to two years without a sugarbeet crop being planted. Once attached to the plant the fungus penetrates the tissue and begins to infect and kill nearby tissue. As the disease progresses these individual rotted spots begin to come together to form massive areas of dead tissue. This causes severely infected leaves to eventually die. The plant responds by attempting to re-grow the leaf and using nutrients within the plant.Coons, G.H., Dewey Stewart, and F.G. Larmer, The Sugar-Beet Leaf-Spot Disease and Its Control by Direct Measures, United States Department of Agriculture, Circular No. 115, April, 1930 This results in lowered sugar content and stunted growth. Losses due to the disease can be as high as 42%. Tetraconazole has been shown to provide the best control. Research demonstrated that treatments with tetraconazole increased the amount of sucrose extracted by 30%.Specific Exemption for Use of Tetraconazole on Sugarbeet in Minnesota and North Dakota, Minnesota and North Dakota Departments of Agriculture, Section 18 Emergency Exemption Request, 2000  Sweet corn  Corn mold = Northern corn leaf blight = As there are many strains, northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) is considered one of the most serious and hard to control diseases of sweet corn. Its multiple strains mean it is nearly impossible to attempt any control of NCLB with plant resistance. The symptoms of the disease include long, thin dead areas on the leaf that slowly grow and coalesce. These lesions produce spores that can infect other plants. However much of the spread and severity of the disease is dependent upon weather conditions. Heavy rains, low temperatures, and relatively high humidity increase the number of life cycles of the fungus, producing additional spores. The most common control practice for NCLB is chlorothalonil, maneb, and mancozeb. = Southern corn leaf blight = Southern corn leaf blight thrives in the southern United States because unlike NCLB it requires warm weather to develop. During favorable conditions the disease has been documented ruining a whole crop within days when left untreated. Treatment is available with the use of chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and maneb but even this is limited. In one study in Florida even when a regular fungicide plan was followed over 25% of the ears were lost. = Rust = Yield losses due to rust in corn can range from 20% to 50% of the crop depending upon when the infection strikes. If the disease attacks the corn early this will result in stunted growth of the ears and dried out kernels. However, this results in the lower end of crop yield loss. The greater damage comes when the infection appears later in the season because, although yield remains the same, extensive cosmetic damage to the corn‚Äîpustules cover the leaves, husks, necks, and tassels of the plant‚Äîrenders much of it becomes unmarketable. This can result in up to 50% loss of yield.

Early life  Edgar Trevor Williams was born on 20 November 1912, the son of a clergyman. He was educated at Tettenhall College, StaffordshireObituary in the Daily Telegraph, 28 June 1995 and then at King Edward VII School in Sheffield from 1928 to 1931. He obtained a Postmastership at Merton College, Oxford, and took a First in History in 1934. After a lectureship at Liverpool University he returned to Merton in 1937 as a junior research fellow.Obituary in the New York Times  World War II  Williams was Chief of Intelligence to General Montgomery in his North African Campaign against the German army under Erwin Rommel in 1942. He first encountered a vehicle of the Afrika Korps at Agheila in Tripoli, Libya in February 1941 (both fired and both missed), though his report that there were now German as well as Italian forces in North Africa was initially doubted. In his memoirs (1958, Da Capo) Montgomery describes how Williams pointed out a crucial weakness in the deployments of the German and Italian troops, exploited in the decisive Second Battle of El Alamein. Williams remained with Montgomery as his Intelligence Chief for the rest of the war. He was mentioned in despatches three times during the war, as well as being awarded the DSO in 1943, appointed CBE in 1944 and CB in 1946.  Later life  Williams was elected a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford in 1945. From 1949 to 1980 he was joint editor (with Helen Palmer and later with Christine Nicholls) of the decennial supplements to the Dictionary of National Biography. He went on to become warden of Rhodes House in 1952, a position which he held until 1980. As secretary to the Rhodes Trustees from 1959, he was also concerned with the selection and subsequent well-being of nearly 200 Rhodes scholars per annum (one of whom was Bill Clinton, 1968-1970). Williams worked for the United Nations Security Council Secretariat in New York from 1946 to 1947. In 1959 he was a member of the Devlin Commission on Nyasaland, and in 1980 an observer at the Rhodesian elections. At Oxford, Williams was a member of the Hebdomadal Council, a Curator of the Chest (or finance committee), and latterly a Pro- Vice-Chancellor. He also served as a Radcliffe Trustee, as a member of the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust, and as chairman of the Academic Advisory Board which planned Warwick University. He served for many years as senior treasurer (and in 1966 to 1968 as president) of the Oxford University Cricket Club. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Oxfordshire in 1964, and was knighted in 1973. Williams was married twice. In 1938, he married Monica Robertson; they had a daughter. In 1946, he married Gillian, younger daughter of Major-General M D Gambier-Parry; they had a son and a daughter. A portrait of Sir Edgar Williams hangs in Rhodes House, Oxford.

Intensity assessments for the event were VIII (Damaging) on the Medvedev‚ÄìSponheuer‚ÄìKarnik scale and VIII (Heavily damaging) on the European Macroseismic Scale. A 1977 assessment of the event that was published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America had the epicenter just north of the city of Safed and the magnitude of 6.25‚Äì6.5, but in 1997 seismologist Nicholas Ambraseys argued that the event may have been more substantial. The event was well-documented by the nineteenth-century missionary, archaeologist, and author William McClure Thomson. The region in which the earthquake occurred was part of the Ottoman empire but at the time it was under control of the Egyptians who were occupying after seizing it during conflict. Preface William McClure Thomson arrived in Beirut in 1833 for missionary work and was in the area at the time of the earthquake. He wrote, in fine detail, of the damage and personal tragedies he witnessed during his travels in the book The Land and the Book, Or, Biblical Illustrations Drawn from the Manners and Customs, the Scenes and Scenery of the Holy Land. The book was published in 1861 and remained a best seller through much of the nineteenth century. In the region, the Egyptians (led by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt), had recently succeeded in overpowering the Ottomans and gained control of Syria during the Egyptian‚ÄìOttoman War (1831‚Äì1833). During his time in the area Thomson was locked up with charges of spying. The Egyptians were ultimately flushed from the region by Turkey. Earthquake The Yammouneh fault in Lebanon The Dead Sea Transform, also known as the Levant Fracture, produces strong but infrequent earthquakes, and all pre- instrumental information regarding the area shows that it was experiencing an inactive period during the twentieth century. Researchers M. Vered and H. L. Striem conducted a study on both the 1927 Jericho earthquake and the January 1837 event, with a close look at damage data to gain a good estimate of Modified Mercalli intensity values. The 1927 event was both macroseismically and instrumentally recorded, and that provided a good opportunity to closely examine the macroseismic and instrumental epicenter location, estimates of its depth, and methods used in the macroseismic investigation. Once validated, the processes of analyzing the macroseismic data were applied to the earlier 1837 event. The meizoseismal areas of both of these Jordan Rift Valley events were along a north‚Äìsouth line near the fault zone. Several other previous events occurred in the same region, and by comparison both the 1202 Syria earthquake and the Near East earthquakes of 1759 had larger magnitudes than the 1837 event and have been associated with the Yammouneh fault in Lebanon. However, no other earthquakes of similar size occurred in the Dead Sea zone after seismometers began being used around the turn of the twentieth century, so Nicholas Ambraseys mapped the intensity values reported from more than 120 locations within the affected area and used the values to create a relationship with a group of 158 earthquakes in nearby Turkey and northern Syria with known intensities and magnitudes to predict the surface wave magnitude for this event. The average radius of the isoseismals in the area helped to estimate a magnitude of 7.0 to 7.1 for the event. The main shock occurred around four in the afternoon, followed by a second strong shock five minutes later, and was felt as far as away. Damascus's maximum perceived intensity was estimated to be VII (Very strong) on the Medvedev‚ÄìSponheuer‚ÄìKarnik scale, while Ramla and Baalbek were at VI (Strong), and cities such as Cairo, Tarsus, and Gaziantep (formerly Aintab) were at III (Weak). =Wave damage= As a result of the earthquake, a strong seiche (standing wave) swept the shores of Tiberias causing additional death. Damage The shock was comparatively slight in Beirut, but many houses were damaged and others completely destroyed. The wintertime slowed communication in the area, and nearly eight days passed before reliable reports came in from Safed regarding the nature of damage there. The letters stated that the town, along with Tiberias and many other villages, had been overthrown. Sidon was damaged considerably, and in Tyre the fallen homes made the streets nearly impassable, with people sleeping in boats and in tents alongside the shore. The village of Rumaish was mostly destroyed, with thirty deaths occurring as people were crushed in their homes, and many more would have suffered the same had they not been at evening prayers at the church there, which was a small building that was not seriously damaged. The types of homes that were built in that time and area, usually one story rubble masonry with heavy flat roofs that were often already damaged, were not resistant to even a small amount of shaking. Public structures like bridges and walls fared better, as they were usually constructed with higher standards. The heavy damage in certain areas occurred for various reasons. Some cities were built on steep hillsides overlooking the plains (done for security reasons), while other sites were located on unstable soil where landslides had occurred previously. These conditions made assessing the intensity of the earthquake difficult, but Ambraseys settled on a maximum value of VII‚ÄìVIII (Very strong‚ÄìDamaging) on the Medvedev‚ÄìSponheuer‚ÄìKarnik scale for the event. That scale was used primarily in Europe and the Soviet Union up until the 1990s. A higher loss of life was probably seen as a result of the earthquake occurring on a winter evening, as most people were likely in their homes preparing dinner. Every house and the local church in the village of Jish was destroyed, and all the parishioners, totaling 135 people, were killed, with only the priest surviving the collapse of the vaulted stone roof there. The priest was protected by an arch over the altar. The American scholar Edward Robinson passed through the village of Lubya, just west of the Sea of Galilee, in 1838 and noted that it had suffered greatly from the earthquake the preceding year, with 143 villagers reported dead. In the town of Safed, the homes on the hill were built in such a way that the roofs of the houses below became the streets for the ones above; the cascading style of construction was many layers deep, and when the earthquake happened, the homes collapsed onto one another from above. Many people were killed immediately and buried under the rubble, and some were fortunate to be alive yet could not extricate themselves quickly from the debris. Some survivors were pulled from the ruins as many as six or seven days after the earthquake. The wounded and dying there were without much relief until January 19 when a temporary hospital was set up and a doctor hired who could distribute medicine and apply bandages. In Tiberias heavy damage was sustained, though not quite as severe as in Safed, and 600 people were killed there, with many homes and the walls of the city being destroyed. The wounded were transported to hot springs in that area for relief, and there may have been changes to the volume of water emanating from them at the time of the earthquake. Aftermath Three large aftershocks occurred several weeks after the main event. On January 16 in the northern end, January 22 near the middle, and in the north again on May 20 near the city of Hasbaya (west of Damascus). The aftershocks were spread over a distance of and that length matches the north‚Äìsouth region of the epicentral area that was mapped by Ambraseys and could indicate that the Roum fault, and its extension south to the Sea of Galilee, were sources of the event. In the months and years following the earthquake, houses and lands lost to their dead owners were settled by new emigrants who had recently come from Russia, Germany, Poland, and elsewhere.C.W.M. van de Velde (1854), p. 409 See also *List of historical earthquakes *List of earthquakes in the Levant References ;Bibliography  1837 Galilee Category:1837 earthquakes Category:History of Safed Category:Natural disasters in Ottoman Syria Category:1837 in Ottoman Syria Category:January 1837 events ","title":"Galilee earthquake of 1837"},{"id":"23063491","text":"Double portrait of John Calcraft and Elizabeth Bride, with whom he had a longstanding affair. John Calcraft the elder (1726 ‚Äì 23 August 1772), of Rempstone in Dorset and Ingress in Kent, was an English army agent and politician. Business career The son of an attorney who was Town Clerk of Grantham, Calcraft set out on a career as an army contractor under the patronage of Grantham's Member of Parliament (MP), the Marquess of Granby, at this period a rising army officer, and of one of the Whig leaders in Parliament, Henry Fox, to whom he was apparently related. (The nature of the relationship was never made clear, and insinuations were made that he was Fox's natural son.) Calcraft was deputy paymaster of the Duke of Cumberland's army at the time of the Jacobite rising of 1745, and subsequently a clerk in the War Office (1747‚Äì56), paymaster of widow's pensions (1757‚Äì62) and deputy- commissary of musters (1756‚Äì63). All of these posts offered lucrative opportunities for enrichment, both legitimate and less so. As well as the functions directly arising from the offices he held, he was involved with the rebuilding of Horse Guards, held contracts for delivering coal to Gibraltar, and became agent to many regiments of the army, a role with both administrative and financial responsibilities and offering considerable opportunity for profit if ably handled. By 1761, he was acting for no less than 49 colonels. Calcraft amassed a considerable fortune. Political career In 1757 Calcraft purchased an estate at Rempstone on the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset, which gave him an interest in three nearby parliamentary boroughs, Corfe Castle, Poole and Wareham. He quickly set out to buy further property which would increase his influence in each borough: he was unsuccessful at Corfe Castle, but acquired sufficient sway at Poole to secure the election of his brother, Thomas Calcraft, in 1761 and 1768, and became landlord to enough of the voters to gain complete control of Wareham, which remained a Calcraft pocket borough until the Reform Act. In 1760 he bought a further estate, at Ingress near Dartford in Kent. Calcraft was by now one of the most influential behind-the-scenes figures in British politics, working hand-in-glove with Fox, and was particularly deeply involved in the discussions to construct a government following the fall of Bute in 1763. But at this point he fell out with Fox, who he believed should give up the Pay Office, and became more closely associated with Shelburne and Pitt, and there was talk that he would be offered an Irish peerage. However, he lost his office as deputy-commissary of musters when the Shelburne group joined the opposition at the end of 1763, and the vindictive Fox considered attempting to have him dismissed also from some of his regimental agencies; but in any case, he soon after retired from the agency business and turned his attention to finding a seat in Parliament. In 1765 he acquired Leeds Abbey in Kent and made considerable improvements and additions to the house and its grounds. On his death on 1772, he devised it with the rest of his estates, to his eldest son, John Calcraft.Parishes: Leeds, The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 5 (1798), pp. 478-502. Date accessed: 07 December 2010 A vacancy arose at Rochester in November 1765, and Calcraft stood on the independent interest but was narrowly defeated by the government candidate; Rochester was generally considered to be a safe government borough, and a less wealthy candidate would have had no chance. In April the following year, however, he was returned as member for Calne, one of Shelburne's boroughs, and supported the Chatham ministry in the House. At the end of the Parliament he secured government support for his second candidacy at Rochester, where he was duly elected. Nevertheless, after Chatham's resignation he consistently spoke and voted with the Opposition. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of Parliamentary Reform. He died in 1772. Family life Calcraft married a wife, Bridget, in 1744, but they soon separated and he seems to have been able to conceal her existence, for in 1762 there was speculation about his intentions to marry a Miss Wriothesley; nevertheless, she survived him and made a successful claim against his estate after his death. They had no children, but he had illegitimate children with at least two other women, Mrs George Anne Bellamy and Mrs Elizabeth Bride, both actresses. He made John Calcraft (the younger), his eldest son by Mrs Bride, his main heir. The younger Calcraft followed his father into Parliament, initially as member for Wareham.

Life He was born in Somerset, matriculated at Oxford in 1591, and graduated B.A. from Balliol College on 31 January 1599. He was elected Fellow of Oriel College in 1600, and received his M.A. 27 March 1604.:s:Rouse, John (DNB00) On 9 May 1620 he was chosen chief librarian of the Bodleian Library, a post he discharged with great vigour and acumen until his death. At that time he occupied 'Cambye's lodgings', also written 'Camby's', once a part of St. Frideswide's Priory as a medieval tenement. He afterwards sold the property to Pembroke College, as a residence for the master. Rouse annotated a collection of Robert Burton's books which were given to the Bodleian Library by testamentary disposition on Burton's death, and two of his inscriptions are cited by Alan H.Nelson as supplying independent confirmation that, for this learned bibliographer, William Shakespeare was identified by a contemporary as the author of Burton's copies of two of Shakespeare's narrative poems. The inscriptions read. * Venus and Adonis by Wm Shakespear Lond. 1602 * The rape of Lucrece by Wm Shakespear Imp{er}fet. About 1635 Rouse formed a friendship with Milton; Barbara Lewalski considers they met in Horton, where Milton was studying.Barbara Lewalski, The Life of John Milton (2003), p. 206. He asked the poet for a complete copy of his works for the library, and Milton in 1647 sent two volumes to Oxford, the prose pamphlets carefully inscribed in his own hand 'to the most excellent judge of books,' and a smaller volume of poems which was stolen or lost on the way. To this circumstance we owe Milton's mock-heroic ode To John Rouse (dated 23 January 1646-7) inserted in a second copy, preserved at the Bodleian. In 1645 he refused to lend King Charles the 'Histoire Universelle du Sieur d'Aubign√©' because the statutes forbade the removal of such a book. Christopher Arnold, professor of history at Nuremberg, and Lambecius both complimented him. He died on 3 April 1652, and was buried in Oriel College Chapel. Rouse wrote a dedicatory preface to a collection of verses addressed to the Danish proconsul, Johan Cirenberg (Oxford, 1631). He also issued an appendix to the Bodleian Catalogue in 1635. His portrait hangs in the Middle Common Room of Oriel College.

Although officially designated as a submarine tender for most of her career, Komahashi very rarely functioned in this role, but was used instead as an oceanographic survey vessel throughout the Pacific, and as a kaibokan escort vessel for convoys of merchant ships during the Pacific War. Background The Imperial Japanese Navy received its first submarines during the Russo-Japanese War, but these vessels were not operational until after the war ended. During the post-war period, submarine warfare was given a low priority for development, as the early submarines were regarded as unsafe, and useful only for short-range coastal point defense.Peatty, Kaigun, p. 114 Design Komahashi was designed and built as the at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal. She was laid down on 7 October 1912 and was launched on 21 May 1913. She was specifically intended for the role of supplying the Imperial Japanese Navy‚Äôs Mako Guard District, located in the Pescadores between Taiwan and China. Her design was that of a standard three island merchant freighter, with two coal-fired Hayabara boilers producing 1825 shp, driving a single shaft, with a design speed of 14 knots. In 1932, she was modernized with two Ikegai diesel engines. She was armed with two QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval guns and one 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval gun.  Operational career  With the start of World War I, from 20 January 1914, Komahashi was based at Sasebo Naval District, and was converted into a submarine tender on 23 May 1914. However, soon after, on 16 August 1914, she was re-classified as a 2nd class kaibokan and assigned to the 4th Torpedo Division. On 1 April 1920, her classification was changed that of a . On 1 December 1924, Komahashi was again classified once again as a submarine tender, however her primary task for the next several years was that of a survey vessel, charting the area around the Pescadores and the China coast. On 1 October 1931, Komahashi was assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District, and was refitted at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in early 1932 with more powerful diesel engines and survey ship facilities, a process that lasted until November 1932. Upon re-launching, she surveyed around the Luzon Strait, the South Pacific Mandate, the Kuril Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula, collecting data on ocean currents, salinity, subsea topography and fisheries resources. One of her discoveries was the Komahashi Seamount, an underwater volcano at the northern end of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge in the Philippine Sea. On 19 August 1937, Komahashi was assigned to the IJN 3rd Fleet and participated in combat operations along the China coast during the Second Sino-Japanese War. On 10 October 1937, she was assigned to the China Area Fleet. From June 1939, Komahashi was once again assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District, and assigned to surveying missions and patrols of the South Pacific Mandate area for the potential development of seaplane bases and naval harbors, and was serving in this capacity at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. At some time during 1941, she was also fitted with depth charge racks and six Type 96 25-mm AA guns. During early 1942, Komahashi remained based at Yokosuka, and provided short-range escort for inbound and outbound convoys. On 7 July 1942, Komahashi participated in the rescue mission for survivors of the SS Haruna Maru, a 10420-ton passenger liner that had run aground off Omaezaki on a transport mission for the Imperial Japanese Army. After the conclusion of the rescue, Komahashi was reassigned to the IJN 5th Fleet for operations in northern waters. During August‚ÄìSeptember 1942 Komahashi surveyed the Aleutian Islands during the Japanese invasion. She was heavily damaged by U.S. aircraft at Kiska on 29 September and was forced to withdraw to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for repairs. On 1 November, she was once again assigned to the Yokosuka Naval District, where she made 38 runs as a convoy escort and transport in waters around the Japanese home islands throughout 1943. On 16 January 1944, Komahashi was declared flagship of the 3rd Escort Group, IJN Escort Fleet and based in Owase, Mie Prefecture, escorting shipping around the Kii Peninsula. Later that year, she received more anti-aircraft guns, including additional Type 96s, two Type 93 13.2 mm AA guns and two Type 92 7.7mm machine guns. On 15 April 1945 Komahashi was assigned to the role of flagship of the 4th Special Attack Division, based at Owase. The division included 60 Shin'y≈ç suicide motorboats, 24 Kairyu midget submarines and four Kaiten human torpedoes. It was in this role that she was attacked by Allied aircraft of Task Force 38 on 27 July of that year and sank in shallow waters at Owase. Komahashi was abandoned until the surrender of Japan and officially struck from the navy list on 30 November 1945. On 20 September 1948, she was refloated and towed to Nagoya, where she was salvaged for scrap in 1949.

However, he is most well known as the popularizer and possible inventor of three- cushion billiards. Soon after McCreery's 1897 appointment as St. Louis' internal revenue collector, he was described as \\"probably the most accomplished officeholder in the service of the government. He has held the college record for the long distance baseball throw, has been a champion amateur billiardist, is choirmaster of Christ Church Cathedral, is a good singer [and] has composed an opera.\\" Playwright Augustus Thomas' wrote of him in 1922: A moving spirit in the McCullough Club‚Äîin its organization, its management, and in its active expression‚Äîwas Wayman McCreery, now dead. I am sure that ten thousand of his surviving contemporaries in the city of St. Louis will remember Wayman McCreery. Few men are so physically and intellectually equipped as he was. There was nothing that an athlete could do with his body that in a notable degree Wayman McCreery could not do. He was boxer, wrestler, fencer, runner, and swimmer, and all-round athlete. In addition to these he was a graceful step dancer. Intellectually he was equipped with a college training and had an interest in everything that interested the intelligent people of his day. He sang well enough to be a leading tenor in a fashionable choir. He wrote music of good quality. He was the author of the opera \\"L'Afrique,\\" which was first done by amateurs in St. Louis and subsequently produced in New York, although with not very great success, by Jesse Williams. McCreery will be remembered by the sporting world as the inventor of the three cushion game of billiards, of which he was at one time the national champion. As Hugh Chalcot in Robertson's comedy \\"Ours\\" it would have taken a professional to equal him. Another part of McCreery's was Captain Hawtree in \\"Caste,\\" by the same author. The very first tournament at three-cushion billiards took place January 14-31, 1878, in C. E. Mussey's Room in St. Louis. McCreery played in the tourney, which was won by New Yorker Leon Magnus. The high run for the tournament was just 6 points, and the high average a .75. McCreery won the Amateur Championship of Missouri four straight times. He posted high runs during competition of 336 at straight rail; 54 at cushion caroms, and 14 at three cushion‚Äîin which his \\"remarkable skill has given him a worldwide reputation.\\" In the estimation of Willie Hoppe, a 51-time world champion in three forms of carom billiards, McCreery was \\"one of the finest performers [at straight rail] in the country.\\" In February 1899, McCreery competed against Martin Mullen and Wilson P. Foss in the American Athletic Union's Class A Amateur Championship of America, at 14-point balkline held at New York City's Knickerbocker Club. They were described by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle as \\"without doubt the best three amateurs in the country\\". There, McCreery set two amateur world records: the first for a of 139 points in one game, and the second for maintaining a point average of 13.33, in the context of a to 400 points. McCreery was secretary of the Security Building Company. McCreery composed a Te Deum Laudamus and the music to the libretto L'Afrique, also known as \\"the Tale of the Dark Continent\\".

Plot Ethan (Christopher Gorham) is a struggling writer who rushes to his girlfriend‚Äôs house only to be told by her roommate that she has left for the airport. There and moments later, they are reunited and embrace. It is revealed to be an excerpt from Ethan‚Äôs latest written work. His agent (Carol Kane), upon finishing the novel, informs him that it is ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù and will not be published. Disappointed and exhausted from his many attempts at being published, Ethan retreats to a local caf√© and while recording his thoughts into his personal journal meets waitress Jesse (Alyssa Milano) and is instantly smitten with her outgoing personality, beauty and charm. He asks for her phone number so they can go on a date together and she cheerfully agrees. Moments after Ethan leaves, a handsome patron named Troy (Michael Landes) enters the caf√© and also asks Jesse on a date to which she also agrees. As Ethan and Jesse begin to date, he learns that she was once married and that her marriage failed because she ‚Äúwas not the right girl‚Äù for her ex-husband. Ethan begins writing a new novel at the time that he and Jesse begin dating. Ethan, who manages the apartment building he lives in in order to live rent free, seems to be the exact opposite of the much more financially successful and suave Troy, an advertising executive. Despite this, Ethan and Jesse‚Äôs relationship blossoms and deepens and he falls in love with her, as does Troy. It is apparent through conversations with her brother (Tom Lenk) and uncle (Beau Bridges) that Jesse is struggling over how to tell Ethan her ‚Äúsecret‚Äù. She knows that Ethan desires a family and is enthralled by his interaction with his sister‚Äôs children. After Ethan proposes marriage to her Jesse becomes emotionally distraught over fear of revealing the truth and decides to end their relationship and leave town with Troy, who had asked her to move to another city with him to expand his business. Heartbroken but determined to fulfill his promise to Jesse to finish his novel, Ethan submits his work and is overjoyed when he receives word from his agent that his novel will be published. As he is on the phone with his agent he receives a missed call from Jesse who is checking in at the airport. He tries to return her call but she has turned off her cell phone in the meantime. Just as in the beginning of the film, Ethan rushes to her apartment to tell her how much he loves her but her brother informs him that she has left for the airport. Ethan then races off to the airport only to find that he has missed Jesse‚Äôs flight. He returns home and is surprised to find Jesse waiting for him in his apartment. She tearfully expresses her wish to be honest with him, but he decides to share his news with her first. He shows her his new novel, Troy Meets Girl. It is revealed at this point that the relationship between Jesse and Troy was fictional; Troy had been created by Ethan as a more wealthy and successful version of himself for his novel to create content. Jesse was not leaving with another man, but rather for a job in another city for a fresh start. Jesse then reveals her secret to Ethan‚Äîshe cannot have children. Ethan quickly responds that this does not matter to him and that they can adopt if need be. He again proposes marriage and this time Jesse accepts. The film ends with Jesse and Ethan getting married and driving off in his car, which stalls and needs to be pushed by the wedding party.

Bus coupler is a breaker used to couple two busbars in order to perform maintenance on other circuit breakers associated with that busbar. It is achieved with the help of a circuit breaker and isolators. Characteristics MIL-STD-1553B specifies the transformer characteristics and turns ratio of 1.4:1 with the higher turns on the isolation resistor side of the stub. The MIL-STD-1553B also specifies the isolation resistors that are placed in series with each connection to the bus. Normally bus couplers are available with 1.4:1 transformer ratios and 59 ohm (2 watt 1%) resistors. For special applications, couplers can be supplied with different transformer ratios (e.g., 1:1) and other resistance values (e.g., 54.9 ohms). Bus coupler configurations are available as non-terminated or internally terminated. If two or more non-terminated couplers are used on a bus, then the couplers at each end of the bus must be terminated externally with 78 ohm terminators on the unused bus connections of the end couplers. Alternately, internally single terminated couplers (with or without the non-functional bus connectors) can be supplied. Even if only one non-terminated coupler acts as the bus because all devices (bus controller, remote terminals, etc.) are connected to the couplers stubs, the external bus connections of the coupler must be terminated. A dual- terminated coupler (with or without non-functional bus connectors) can be employed where the coupler acts as the bus without other couplers. RFI dust caps (with or without safety chains) are recommended for all unused stub ports. Data bus couplers are readily available in 2 through 8 stubs and in various sizes and shapes of boxes and slim inline models. Also a variety of connectors are offered with couplers.

A short history of the family The first known ancestor of the Hauke family was Johann Gaspar Hauck, a registrar at the Imperial Chamber Court of the Holy Roman Empire in Wetzlar, who died in 1722 and was buried in his home town. By his wife Johanna Barbara of an unknown maiden name, he had ten children, of whom two sons, Johann Valentin (1698‚Äì1722) and Ignatz Marianus (1706‚Äì1784), came to important positions: Johann continued the family tradition of employment at the Court of Justice in Wetzlar, while Ignatz became a secretary to the Government of the Electorate of Mainz. Ignatz, too, had many children, nine, with his wife Maria Franziska Riedesel, who was an illegitimate (later acknowledged) daughter of Baron George Riedesel zu Eisenbach, a member of one of the oldest Hessian noble families. One of their sons, Johann Friedrich Michael Hauck (born 1737 in Mainz, died 1810 in Warsaw) moved to Saxony and later to Poland as a secretary of the powerful Count Alois Friedrich von Br√ºhl, Starost of Warsaw, General of the Royal Polish Artillery and son of Heinrich von Br√ºhl, the famous Saxon-Polish minister. In 1782, Count Alois von Br√ºhl sold his Polish dignities and estates and returned to Saxony, but Johann Friedrich stayed in Warsaw with his family of seven children by an Alsatian Protestant preacher's daughter, Maria Salom√© Schweppenh√§user (1755‚Äì1833). Having changed his Christian names to the more Polish sounding Fryderyk Karol Emanuel and his surname to Hauke, Fryderyk Karol Emanuel Hauke had considerable success as owner of a private school and later as teacher of the German language and mathematics at an exclusive Prussian school for boys, called Warsaw Lycaeum. Three of Hauke's sons, John Maurice, Ludwik August (1779‚Äì1851) and Joseph (1790‚Äì1837), entered after 1815 the service of the Czar, who was at the same time King of Congress Poland, achieved very high positions and received titles and rights od Polish nobility in 1826. The coat of arms awarded to them received in accordance to the Polish custom of naming arms the name \\"Bosak\\" (Grappling hook), which one member of the family, Joseph, later used as a pseudonym. John Maurice (in 1829) and Joseph (in 1830), both of them Generals, were elevated to the rank of counts of the Russian Empire. In 1861, the branch of Ludwik August followed, having obtained an Austrian confirmation of the title of Count awarded to General Alexander Hauke (1814‚Äì1868), who married his cousin Sophie (1816‚Äì1861), a daughter of John Maurice and sister to Julia von Battenberg and Catarina Hauke. The branches of John Maurice and Joseph became extinct in male line in 1852 respectively in 1949, the branch of Ludwik and Alexander still flourishes. Its descendants all live in Stockholm except one, who is a Dominican prior in Pozna≈Ñ. They left Poland and settled in Sweden about 1960, aided by their relative, Queen Louise of Sweden. Most of the Haukes living in Warsaw in the first half of the 19th century are buried at the Catholic PowƒÖzki Cemetery in Warsaw, those who were Lutherans or Calvinists (mostly Protestant women who married into the family) repose at the Lutheran and Calvinist Cemeteries of the Polish capital.

He took part in the Spanish War of Succession (1701‚Äì1714) on the side of the young French-born Prince, later King Philip V of Spain against his opponent Charles VI of Austria of the Habsburgs. He fought in the Portuguese campaign during 1704, during which he advanced along the left bank of the river Tagus, conquering Portalegre and consolidating the Alentejo region, while the young Philip and James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick advanced along the right bank of the river. In 1705, there was a conspiracy in which Diego D√°vila Mes√≠a y Guzm√°n, Captain General of Catalonia, sided with Charles of Austria. Alberto Octavio warned the central authorities. For this assistance, Philip V of Spain bestowed upon him in 1706 the title of Grandee of Spain, a title which included the privilege of remaining covered or seated in the presence of royalty. Antonio Octavio served as Viceroy of Navarre in 1706‚Äì1709 and as Captain General of Aragon in 1711‚Äì1714. In 1714, he was appointed Captain General of Catalonia, replacing FitzJames.

In early 2016, Ukraine had 802 universities, but the Ministry intends to lower that number to 317. In 2016-17, the number of students in higher education was 1,586,700. For specific universities, see the List of universities in Ukraine.  Brief historical survey  The first higher education institutions (HEIs) emerged in Ukraine during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The first Ukrainian higher education institution was the Ostrozka School, or Ostrozkiy Greek- Slavic-Latin Collegium, similar to Western European higher education institutions of the time. Established in 1576 in the town of Ostrog, the Collegium was the first higher education institution in the Eastern Slavic territories. The oldest university was the Kyiv Mohyla Academy, first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognized by the government of Imperial Russia as a higher education institution. Among the oldest is also the Lviv University, founded in 1661. More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th century, beginning with universities in Kharkiv (1805), Kyiv (1834), Odessa (1865), and Chernivtsi (1875) and a number of professional higher education institutions, e.g.: Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute (originally established as the Gymnasium of Higher Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a Technological Institute (1885) in Kharkiv, a Polytechnic Institute in Kyiv (1898) and a Higher Mining School (1899) in Katerynoslav. Rapid growth followed in the Soviet period. By 1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over 850,000 students.Higher education in Ukraine; Monographs on higher education, 2006 Most HEIs established after 1990 are those owned by private organizations. The Constitution of Ukraine (1996), Law on Education (1996), the Law on Higher Education (2002) and the major reform legislation Law on Higher Education (2014) constitute the legal framework for Ukrainian higher education. Ukrainian legislation regulating higher education includes also more limited legislation as well as decrees and regulations of the President and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Because of a perceived lack of quality, 76 higher education institutions and their branches were denied licenses in 2015. Ministry of Education will close 10 more schools, Ukrayinska Pravda (1 March 2016) Access and affordability As with most communist Soviet and Eastern European states access to education for the masses was deemed a high priority, this was largely due to the fact that during imperial times mostly only the nobles and the wealthy had access to post secondary institutions. Citizens of the Soviet Union had free access to secondary education and were required to complete at least a junior specialist degree, equivalent to an associate degree in the US. Moreover, the Soviet Union exercised mandatory conscription of its male population, however those studying for a degree were exempt from the draft until the completion of their studies, therefore men would often stay enrolled to reach master's degrees to delay their entry into the military. After gaining independence Ukraine retained the Soviet principle of having a post secondary education system that is affordable to its population. In 2009 Ukraine spent 7.3% of GDP on education compared to the United States' 5.2%. Trade schools (Technikums), which are analogous to community colleges in the US and award the junior specialist degree continued to remain freely accessible by most citizens, students wishing to enroll in a trade school do not need to complete the full 11 grades of school and may enroll in 9th grade. However budget constraints forced tuition charges on University programs. Students wishing to enroll in universities must complete the full secondary education curriculum, during the last year of school they take a placement test which determines their chances of enrolling and whether or not they will have to pay tuition or not. Moreover, students enrolled may receive a monthly stipend which is designed to cover their living and school expenses while they are enrolled in college. In 2012 the minimum monthly stipend was 550 UAH for students enrolled in Technikums and 730 UAH for students enrolled in Universities. In 2016 tuition costs for higher education were averaging less than $1,000 per academic year; but because of corruption students costs were considerably higher.In Ukraine‚Äôs universities, trading bribes for diplomas, Politico Europe (30 January 2016) Students pursuing a doctoral degree beyond Specialist or master's degree are generally treated in a similar manner to graduate students in the US where they are expected to assist the faculty and may receive pay from the university as they perform their own research. Although online education is not predominant in Ukraine students may enroll in extramural college, which is the most common type of long distance education in Ukraine and many other former Soviet nations. During this type of enrollment the student continues to work and is given all of their assignments for the semester ahead of time. The student completes the assignments then returns to the university to explain their reasoning and complete testing. Many businesses in Ukraine subsidize their employees who return to pursue a higher degree using this method.  Higher education qualifications  Higher education qualifications combine both academic and professional qualifications. This is a very important feature of Ukrainian higher education inherited from its Soviet past. The State Diploma serves as both an educational certificate and a professional license. Employment is determined by a match between the state determination of the knowledge and skills required for different occupation levels and the state determination of levels of educational qualification. Hence is the correspondence between classification of educational qualification and that of the occupational structure, leading to the introduction of the term ‚Äòeducational-proficiency‚Äô level. The Law on Higher Education (2002) establishes a three-level structure of higher education: incomplete, basic, and complete educational levels with corresponding educational-proficiency levels of Junior Specialist, Bachelor, Specialist and Master. In 2016 the Ministry of Education transformed this system to the levels of Junior bachelor, bachelor's, master's, Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Sciences. =Junior Specialist= Junior Specialist or Junior bachelor is an educational-proficiency level of higher education of a person who on the basis of complete secondary education has attained incomplete higher education, special skills and knowledge sufficient for discharging productive functions at a certain level of professional activity, stipulated for initial positions in a certain type of economic activity. The normative period of training makes 2.5‚Äì3 years. Persons with basic secondary education may study in the educational and professional programs of junior specialist‚Äôs training, obtaining at the same time complete secondary education. =Bachelor= Bachelor is an educational-proficiency level of higher education of a person who on the basis of complete secondary education has attained basic higher education, fundamental and special skills and knowledge, sufficient to cope with tasks and duties (work) at a certain level of professional activity (in economy, science, engineering, culture, arts, etc.). The normative period of training makes 4 years (240 ECTS credits). Training specialists of the educational-proficiency level of Bachelor may be carried out according to the shortened programme of studies on the basis of the educational- proficiency level of Junior Specialist. =Master= Master is an educational-proficiency level of higher education of a person who has attained complete higher education, special skills and knowledge, sufficient to cope with professional tasks and duties (work) of innovative character at a certain level of professional activity (in engineering, business administration, pedagogy, arts, etc.). Training specialists of the educational-proficiency level of Master may also be carried out on the basis of the educational-proficiency level of Specialist. The period of training makes typically 1‚Äì1.5 year (60-90 ECTS credits). During his/her studies at the Master‚Äôs or Specialist's level, students are required to write his/her final work on a selected subject and make its presentation, to be able to collect, analyse and summarize, synthesize and to communicate study and practical material; often knowledge of a foreign language is required. Training specialists of the educational-proficiency level of Specialist or Master in such fields as medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, teaching is carried out on the basis of complete secondary education within the period of 5‚Äì6 years (301-360 ECTS credits) (as is common in Western Europe for state registered professions). =Former higher education qualifications = Specialist Specialist was an educational-proficiency level of higher education of a person who on the basis of the educational-proficiency level of Bachelor had attained complete higher education, special skills and knowledge, sufficient to cope with tasks and duties (work) at a certain level of professional activity (in economy, science, engineering, culture, arts, etc.). The normative period of training was 1 year (60 ECTS credits). In 2016 the specialist degree was disbanded in Ukraine. Ministry of Education cancels the \\"experts\\" and \\"Ph.D.\\", Ukrayinska Pravda (11 July 2016)  Diplomas and Certificates  Higher education graduates are awarded qualifications of the appropriate educational-proficiency levels and they are granted diplomas of the state format. The Diploma is the State-recognized document which serves as both an educational certificate and a professional licence, confirming the attainment of the appropriate higher educational level and qualification of a certain educational-proficiency level (an academic degree in a field of study and speciality). The Law on Higher Education (2002) establishes the following types of documents that confirm higher education qualifications: *Dyplom Molodshoho Spetsialista (Diploma/ qualification of Junior Specialist) *Dyplom Bakalavra (Diploma/ qualification of Bachelor) *Dyplom Spetsialista (Diploma/ qualification of Specialist) *Dyplom Mahistra (Diploma/ qualification of Master)  Quality assurance  The national system of quality assurance (QA) in Ukraine is realized by means of licensing and accreditation procedures carried out by the Department for Licensing, Accreditation and Nostrification of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, through the State Accreditation Commission, the State Inspectorate of HEIs, and the Higher (Supreme) Attestation Board. = Licensing = The Law on Higher Education (2002) stipulates that educational establishments in Ukraine including those owned privately must be licensed before they can offer tertiary level educational programmes. To be granted a licence a HEI must meet the required standards set by the Ministry of Education and Science for higher education status at a certain level. These standards refer to: physical infrastructure, equipment and facilities, the learning resources (library and other media materials), the logistical, scientific-methodological and information base, and the number and qualification level of its staff, appropriate to the area of education and research in which it intends to offer programmes of study. The licence process assesses the list of subjects, the content of the educational programme of these subjects and the assessment tools used to examine students. Licensed HEIs are listed in the Ministry‚Äôs Public Register of HEIs. = Accreditation= In Ukraine accreditation procedures include both accreditation of the programmes of study in a certain field of study and speciality offered by HEIs, and institutional accreditation of HEIs.  Accreditation of programmes of study To have a study programme accredited in a certain field of study and speciality a HEI must meet the demands of the higher education standards in terms of educational and professional provision offered by it. Programmes of study are accredited in relation to the relevant qualification associated with a certain educational-proficiency level, and thus at a certain level of accreditation.  Institutional accreditation of HEIs  The status of a HEI is determined by the proportion of programmes that it has accredited at particular levels. A higher education institution may receive institutional accreditation at a certain level, if at least two thirds of its specialities (specialisms) have already received accreditation at this level. The Law of Ukraine On Higher Education (2002) establishes four levels of accreditation of higher education institutions. Law on Higher Education (2002) –ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ \\"–ü—Ä–æ –≤–∏—â—É –æ—Å–≤—ñ—Ç—É\\" #Higher education institutions of the first accreditation level train Junior specialists; #Higher education institutions of the second accreditation level train Junior specialists and/or Bachelors; #Higher education institutions of the third accreditation level train Bachelors, Specialists and, in certain professions (specialities), Masters; #Higher education institutions of the fourth accreditation level train Bachelors, Masters and Specialists. Additional criteria for the institutions of the fourth accreditation level include postgraduate and Doctoral courses, high-level research and publications activities.  Level structure of HEIs  There are six types of higher education institutions in Ukraine:Law on Higher Education (2002), Article 25 * Universities: have fourth level of accreditation and may be multi-disciplinary establishments (follow a classical university model) or ‚Äòbranch‚Äô (mono- disciplinary/specialist) establishments (focused on some particular professional field (Technical, Medical, Agricultural, Pedagogical, Economics, etc.)). They act as leading research and methodological centres in both fundamental and applied research. * Academies: have fourth level of accreditation. Their educational provision is concentrated in a specific branch of knowledge in which they also act as leading research and methodological centres in both fundamental and applied research fields; * Institutes: have third and fourth level of accreditation. Their educational provision is concentrated in a specific branch of knowledge in which they also conduct research and methodological research in both fundamental and applied fields. They may be independent or a sub-unit of a university or academy; * Conservatoires: have third and fourth level of accreditation. Their educational provision is concentrated in culture and the arts, specifically music. They also conduct research and act as leading centres in the areas of their activity; * Colleges: have second level of accreditation largely related to the provision of training leading to the acquisition of specific higher education qualifications. They may also constitute sub-units within higher education establishments with third and fourth level accreditation; * Technical Schools: have first level of accreditation. They carry out educational activity leading to specialist areas of knowledge and skills related to specific occupations. They may also constitute sub-units within higher education establishments with third and fourth level accreditation. = Types of Universities (Academies) = The Ministry of Education and Science (Sports and Youth) recognizes the following categories of institutions of the top-level accreditation: * Classical Universities * Technical Universities * Technological (Construction, Transportation) * Pedagogical (Humanitarian, Physical Education and Sports) * Culture (Arts, Design) * Health Care Universities * Agrarian Universities * Economics (Finance, Administration, Entrepreneurship) * Law (Law enforcement, Civil protection and life safety) * Private Universities =National universities= Chernivtsi University Higher education institutions with 4th accreditation level may be bestowed the status of ‚Äònational‚Äô for outstanding performance in research and scientific activity. This status brings with it added powers in relation to immovable property, facilities, enterprises, institutions and other structural sub-units of the HEI; the award of professorial status; and ‚Äòsymbiotic‚Äô and material incentives and rewards for employees of the HEI.Law on Higher Education (2002), Article 26 It also accrues an additional budget for research activities.  Postgraduate education  In Ukraine, postgraduate education is regarded as specialist education and professional training commencing after the Specialist, Master phase.PROJECT: TERTIARY EDUCATION ASSESSMENT UKRAINE. EUROPEAN UNION. DELEGATION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO UKRAINE.- 2007. - P.20. The Law of Higher Education (Article 10) and the Law on Education (Article 47) regard Post-Graduate education as specialised education and professional training on the basis of the previously obtained educational- proficiency level and experience of the practical work. It is defined as retraining, specialisation within a profession; expansion of the professional profile; probation within a profession, i.e. post-qualifying education or continuous professional development. The system of postgraduate training serves as a ground for lifelong learning. = Lifelong learning = There is a long tradition and pride in this kind of educational provision for ‚Äòcontinuing education‚Äô and for ‚Äòsocial inclusion‚Äô, that continues today. Lifelong learning (LLL) is conceptualized on the one hand as the progression through academic qualifications: Bachelor, Specialist, Master, Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science. On the other hand, it also covers a wide range of educational courses designed for: ‚Äòsecond chance‚Äô students; for those who wish to change occupations; for on-the-job training for citizens in employment; for updating professionals; for second diplomas where only the specialist part of the curriculum needs to be followed; and to provide secondary school certificate for those who left school without qualification.  Doctoral degrees  At the doctoral level, Ukraine has a two-degree system. The first qualification is the Candidate of Sciences (scientific degree of Kandydat Nauk) which normally requires at least three years of study after the award of the Specialist or the Master diploma and is achieved by submitting and defending a thesis (dissertation), as well as following post-graduate studies (aspirantura) in the specialist field. The second qualification is the Doctor of Sciences (scientific degree of Doktor Nauk), the highest degree in Ukraine which is achieved by dissertation that must make an original contribution to a given field of learning, and after a period of further studies (doktorantura) following the award of Kandidat Nauk degree. Doctoral study programmes (post- graduate course, aspirantura ‚Äì for Kandydat Nauk degree and doctoral course, doktorantura ‚Äì for Doktor Nauk degree) can be opened in higher education institutions of the third and fourth levels of accreditation or in research institutes and their branches. The two doctoral degrees can be earned in two ways: as a result of studies in aspirantura and doktorantura or independently. The public defense of the dissertation is held in the form of a public presentation and scientific debates. Professors have different ranks within the university system. For example a Dosent (–î–æ—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç) is analogous to an assistant professor in the United States. International study and student exchange According to 2013 figures of the Minister of Education there are 61,000 foreign students in Ukraine.Foreign students bring over UAH 4 b to Ukraine‚Äôs treasury this academic year, says minister, Interfax-Ukraine (14 April 2013) In 2016 International Admission Center with support of Ministry of Education founded the Ukrainian Admission Center for foreign students .With support of Ministry of education founded official Ukrainian Admission Center, Ministry of Education (Ukraine) (01 August 2016) Reputations Ukrainian professor reports that the Ukrainian education provides for a student nothing more than an illusion of training. As a result the majority of the Ukrainian graduates do not possess even a basic level of professional knowledge when they leave their schools. Due to extremely ineffective educational policy of the Ukrainian government and ubiquitous corruption the everyday life of the society has been significantly changed. The new developed qualities of the social transformation include aggression, rudeness, intolerance, boastfulness, reticence etc. According to Frances Cairncross (in April 2010) ‚ÄúThere are too many small universities, the majority of which are ineffectively governed and mired in corruption. They are not able to withstand existing global challenges.‚ÄùEducation problems deeper than language, Kyiv Post (2 April 2010) According to Anders √Öslund (in October 2012) the quality of doctoral education is bad, particularly in management training, economics, law and languages.Outdated educational system translates into lagging economy, Kyiv Post (4 October 2012) He also signaled that the greatest problem in the Ukrainian education system is corruption. 76 higher education institutions and their branches were denied licenses by the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine in 2015 because of a perceived lack of quality (education). In 2017, the highest average scores on the national entrance exam (External Independent Evaluation) were had by students entering the Ukrainian Catholic University, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, and the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. =International rankings= No Ukrainian university has ever been ranked in the Academic Ranking of World UniversitiesRanking per country, Academic Ranking of World Universities nor in the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities.Top Universities by Countries, Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities However, the QS World University Rankings 2013/14 listed four Ukrainian HEIs including Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (ranked 441-450), Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (601-650), Donetsk National University and Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute (both 701+).Rankings Ukraine, QS World University Rankings In the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (838th) is the highest ranked university, Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, Kharkiv National University and Odessa University (1788th) are (also) ranked in the top 2000, and 303 are ranked lower than that (the lowest is Kherson State Maritime Academy at place 20,942).Rankings Ukraine, Webometrics Ranking of World Universities Four Ukrainian Universities were ranked in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for the 2016-2017 school year, Lviv Polytechnic National University, Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, and the Karazin Kharkiv National University, which were all ranked in the 801+ category. In 2012 Ukraine's Higher Education system was ranked as the top in Eastern Europe by Universitas 21, ahead of Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, Russia and Slovakia. The research group cited high Education spending as a proportion of GDP compared to other nations as a likely cause of Ukraine having the best post secondary system in East Europe.http://wnu- ukraine.com/news/culture-lifestyle/?id=1688 According to Global Competitiveness Report in 2008-2014 Ukraine ranked at 41-50th places among 130 countries by pillar ‚Ä≥Higher education and training\\".Ilona Tsarenko (2016).

Synopsis The Enterprise encounters the ancient colony ship 'Hawking'. Due to the relativistic effects of time travel, the crew and passengers have only aged a few decades while two hundred years have passed since they have launched. The crew of the Enterprise find difficulty dealing with these people from the past. The Hawking colonists are distrustful, somewhat paranoid and the ship itself hides a weapon of mass destruction. Inspiration In Voyages of Imagination, George Zebrowski remembered: \\"Across the Universe went well, with the editing again seeking to keep us to the main characters' viewpoints. I don't recall how the idea was developed, but it was more complex and involved than the final book.\\" On the story, Pamela Sargent adds, \\"We'd been discussing what might happen if a group of colonists that had set out from Earth to colonize another world, traveling at relativistic speed and aging only two or three decades while a couple of centuries passed, had been overtaken by a more technologically advanced group‚Äîin this case, the Enterprise and its crew. We actually wanted much of the story to be about the dilemma of these people, how they might acclimate to their encounter with this future civilization and the psychological problems that might cause. I think we were envisioning a darker more complex tale about people who are slowly aging on a one-way journey, who reach their planetary destination only to discover that the world they thought would be theirs was already settled. In the end, at the editor's suggestion, we ended up writing more of an adventure story. Not necessarily a worse story, simply a different story. Some of the dilemmas our invented characters would have to face are still there, even if they had to be incorporated into a story about an unknown planetary threat.\\"  References   External links  * Category:Novels based on Star Trek: The Original Series Category:1999 American novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels set in the 23rd century ","title":"Across the Universe (Star Trek)"},{"id":"23064073","text":"Robert Frank Tinney (born November 22, 1947) is an American contemporary illustrator known for his monthly cover illustrations for the microcomputer publication Byte magazine spanning over a decade.

Context  Nanni Balestrini is associated with the Italian writers' movement Neoavanguardia. He wrote for the magazine Il Verri, founded and co-directed the now-defunct Alfabeta and was one of the Italian writers published in the anthology I Novissimi (1961). Balestrini was born in Milan. During the 1960s, as the group was growing and becoming the Gruppo 63, Balestrini was the editor of their publications. From 1962 to 1972, he was working for Feltrinelli, cooperating with the publishers and editing some issues of the Cooperativa Scrittori. In 1968, Balestrini was co-founder of the Potere Operaio political group and in 1976 was an important supporter of the Autonomia Operaia. In 1979, he was accused of membership in a guerilla group and fled to Paris and later Germany. Balestrini became known by a larger public thanks to his first novel We Want Everything (Vogliamo tutto, 1971). It describes the struggles and conflicts in the car factory of FIAT. In the following years, the social movements of his time continued to be his subject. With the book The Unseen, he created a literary monument for the \\"Generation of 1977\\". It shows the atmosphere of rapid social change during these years, concretising in house occupations, the creation of free radios and more, and also shows the considerable repression by the state of these movements. Other important works by Balestrini include; I Furiosi, dedicated to the football supporters culture of the AC Milan, and The Editor, dealing with Giangiacomo Feltrinelli. Especially in his book The Golden Horde, co-written with Primo Moroni, his proximity to operaismo is obvious. His final novel published while he was still living, Sandokan (2004) deals with the Camorra in Casal di Principe. His experimental \\"novel\\" Tristano, was conceived to be read by each reader differently, since each sentence is randomly shuffled. Originally conceived in 1966, it had to await publication till the age of print-on-demand, but critic Tim Martin found one of its 109 trillion versions \\"drifting, impressionistic and oddly compelling.\\"Best fiction to read 2014 The Telegraph.Nanni Balestrini Verso Books.

The PlasmaCar can be propelled by wiggling the front steering wheel which is attached to two pivoting wheels touching the ground. It harnesses the natural forces of inertia, centrifugal force, gravity, and friction in order to drive the car forward and backward. It does not require a power source such as batteries, fuel, pedals, or gears - it simply runs on the child's ability to wiggle the steering wheel. It can be operated indoors and/or outdoors, though it works best on a smooth, flat surface.PlasmaCar Info History In early December 2002, an Ottawa entrepreneur named Timothy Kimber discovered the unique ride-on toy as he was shopping in an Ottawa shopping center. It was then called the Fun Car, and was on display at the mall, free for children to test drive. Kimber, fascinated with the product, located the Asian distributor and proceeded to ask questions regarding the Fun Car. Kimber discovered that while the Fun Car sold well in China, it had virtually no presence in Canada or the United States. Surprised by the news, Kimber sought out to bring the Fun Car to North America because of its marketing potential. After much conversation with the distributor, Kimber negotiated to assume distribution and marketing rights for the Fun Car in North America.PlaSmart Company Info In 2003, Kimber set out to bring the Fun Car to the North American market. With approximately 1,500 ride-on units, Kimber put together a plan to expose the toy, and started by displaying it at the 2003 Canadian Toy and Hobby Show.Canadian Toy Association Within a month, Kimber had created a company name (PlaSmart - pronounced Play Smart), website, and provided marketing materials for the Fun Car, including a demo video. More importantly, he decided to change the product name from the Fun Car (deemed too generic and dull) to the PlasmaCar, a name he borrowed from the world of consumer electronics where the hottest \\"toy\\" for adults was the Plasma TV. The name change caught the attention of customers and retailers,PlaSmart - About and the PlasmaCar became a popular item at trade shows. It was a big hit among children, and can even support adults weighing upwards of 100 kg.PlasmaCar Info With the popularity of the PlasmaCar rising, Kimber moved the business to an Ottawa office and warehouse unit. Distribution of the PlasmaCar was handed over to a more established supplier with confirmed connections in the toy industry. However, the arrangement was short-lived. Within six months, distribution rights returned to PlaSmart in late 2003. The PlasmaCar is currently sold worldwide. PlasmaCar Physics The PlasmaCar design includes six wheels, but only four touch the ground. The first two wheels located at the front of the vehicle do not touch the ground (a common misconception) or spin: they are merely there for stability and safety in case the rider leans forward or drives into an elevated surface (such as a street curb). The next set of wheels of the PlasmaCar are attached to the steering wheel by a lever, in such a way that they are located behind the axis of rotation of the steering column. The torque applied to the steering wheel causes a lateral friction force by the wheels on the ground, a force parallel to the axle and perpendicular to the direction the wheels are rolling.University of Toronto - The Physics of the PlasmaCar If a component of this force points to the back of the car, the reaction force of the ground on the car (by Newton's \\"action/reaction\\" law) points partly forward and accelerates the car. This is the force that drives the car forward and it ultimately comes from the force exerted on the handlebars.University of Toronto - The Physics of the PlasmaCar In-line skaters make a similar force by repeatedly pulling both skates laterally inward in a criss cross fashion in order to accelerate themselves. Skateboarders do a similar thing by pulling laterally inward while executing a series of alternating, tight turns. The final set of wheels (located at the back of the vehicle) spin normally, but do not pivot. Reception The PlasmaCar has received critical reception from the toy industry, as well as customers. Additionally, it is the most successful product in PlaSmart's product line to date.PlaSmart Info It has received numerous awards (see awards section), as well as favorable customer reviews on websites such as Chapters (4.5 out of 5 stars),PlasmaCar Reviews on Chapters Amazon.com (5 out of 5 stars),PlasmaCar Reviews on Amazon and Fat Brain Toys (5 out of 5 stars).PlasmaCar Reviews on Fat Brain Toys In 2009, the PlasmaCar ranked 7th on DisneyFamily.com's Top Action Figures and Toys for Kids list.DisneyFamily.com Top Action Figures and Toys for Kids Adaptation The plasma car can be modified for heavier adults/teenagers by putting in a metal straight axle where the rear wheels would originally be.

A smartbook was a class of mobile device that combined certain features of both a smartphone and netbook computer, produced between 2009 and 2010. Smartbooks were advertised with features such as always on, all-day battery life, 3G, or Wi-Fi connectivity and GPS (all typically found in smartphones) in a laptop or tablet-style body with a screen size of 5 to 10 inches and a physical or soft touchscreen keyboard.A related smartbook definition is given by Freescale. http://smartmobiledevices.wordpress.com/2009/07/23/smartbook-vs-netbook/ A German company sold laptops under the brand Smartbook and held a trademark for the word in many countries (not including some big markets like United States, China, Japan, or India). It acted to preempt others from using the term smartbook to describe their products. Smartbooks tended to be designed more for entertainment purposes than for productivity and typically targeted to work with online applications. They were projected to be sold subsidized through mobile network operators, like mobile phones, along with a wireless data plan. The advent of much more popular tablets like Android tablets and the iPad, coupled with the prevailing popularity of conventional desktop computers and laptops have displaced the smartbook. History The smartbook concept was mentioned by Qualcomm in May 2009 during marketing for its Snapdragon technology, with products expected later that year. Difficulties in adapting key software (in particular, Adobe's proprietary Flash Player) to the ARM architecture delayed releases until the first quarter of 2010. Smartbooks would have been powered by processors which were more energy-efficient than traditional ones typically found in desktop and laptop computers. The first smartbooks were expected to use variants of the Linux operating system, such as Google's Android or Chrome OS. The ARM processor would have allowed them to achieve longer battery life than many larger devices using x86 processors. In February 2010, ABI Research projected that 163 million smartbooks would ship in 2015. In many countries the word Smartbook was a trademark registered by Smartbook AG.International Mark - (1015854) smartbook In August 2009 a German court ruled Qualcomm must block access from Germany to all its webpages containing the word Smartbook unless Smartbook AG is mentioned. (German) Smartbook AG defended its trademark. A February 2010 ruling prevented Lenovo from using the term. By the end of 2010, Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs admitted that tablet computers such as the iPad already occupied the niche of the smartbook, so the name was dropped. In February 2011 Qualcomm won its legal battle when the German patent office ruled the words \\"smart\\" and \\"book\\" could be used. However, several trademarks have been registered. Designs =Always Innovating Touch Book= In March 2009 the Always Innovating company announced the Touch Book. It was based on the Texas Instruments OMAP 3530 which implemented the ARM Cortex-A8 architecture. It was originally developed from the Texas Instruments Beagle Board. It had a touchscreen and a detachable keyboard which contained a second battery. The device came with a Linux operating system and the company offered to license their hardware designs. =Sharp Netwalker= IFA 2009 Sharp Electronics, introduced their PC-Z1 \\"Netwalker\\" device in August 2009 with a promised ship date of October 2009. It featured a 5.5\\" touchscreen, runs Ubuntu on an ARM Cortex-A8 based Freescale i.MX515 and was packaged in a small clamshell design. Sharp reported the device weighs less than 500 grams and will run 10 hours on one battery charge. The device is said to run 720p video, and have both 2D and 3D graphics acceleration. It comes with Adobe Flash Lite 3.1 installed.Sharp to Launch Ultramobile Device With Arm Chip.PC World =Pegatron prototype= Pegatron, an Asus company, showed a working prototype of a smartbook in August 2009. It consisted of an ARM Cortex-A8 based Freescale i.MX515 supports 2D/3D graphics as well as 720p HD video, 512 MB DDR2 RAM, 1024x600 8.9\\" LCD screen, Bluetooth 2.0, 802.11g and run off a SD card. It also featured one USB and one micro USB port, a VGA port as well as a card reader. The smartbook ran Ubuntu Netbook 9.04 and contained a version of Adobe Flash Player which was out of date. The bill of materials for the Pegatron smartbook prototype was $120. In November 2009 Pegatron said it had received a large number of orders for smartbooks that would launch in early 2010. The devices were rumored to sell for about $200 when subsidized. Asus announced plans to release their own smartbook in the first quarter of 2010. = Lenovo Skylight = Qualcomm was expected to announce a smartbook on November 12, 2009 at an analyst meeting. A Lenovo device concept was shown, and announced in January 2010. In May 2010 the Skylight was cancelled. = Compaq Airlife 100 = In late January 2010 a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) listing featured a device from HP that was referred as smartbook, while a prototype of the same device was already shown earlier. In beginning February on Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, HP announced it will bring this device to market. The specifications will most likely be following:Compaq Airlife 100 se adelanta al MWC - Netbook t√°ctil con SSD y Android * CPU: 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor * Operating system: Android * Display: 10.1 inch touchscreen * Storage: 16 GB SSD * Networking: 3G and Wi-Fi * Battery: up to 12 hours, 10 days in standby mode In the end of March 2010 the smartbook made an appearance at FCC again, this time listing its 3G capabilities. According to FCC, the device will support GSM 850 and 1900, as well as WCDMA II and V bands. These WCDMA bands may indicate the usage in AT&T; network in the United States. Details of the product is now available on the HP website. =Toshiba AC100= In June 2010, a smartbook device from Toshiba was announced. It features Nvidia Tegra processor and is able to remain in stand-by mode for up to 7 days.http://eu.computers.toshiba- europe.com/innovation/generic/b2c-toshiba-ac100 The device was officially available at the Toshiba United Kingdom site. Originally delivered with Android v2.1 (upgradable to v2.2 since 2011 ) it can also be modified to run a customized Linux distribution. In Japan, was sold as \\"Dynabook AZ\\". =Genesi Efika MX= The Genesi company announced an MX Smartbook as part of their Efika line in August 2010. It was originally priced at US$349, and some reviewers questioned if it was small enough to fit this definition. It is ostensibly a derivative of the above-mentioned Pegatron design. =Others= In September 2009, Foxconn announced it is working on smartbook development. In November 2009, a Quanta Computer pre-production Snapdragon powered sample smartbook device that ran Android was unveiled. Companies like Acer Inc. planned to release a smartbook, but due to the popularity of tablets, MacBook Air and Ultrabooks, plans were scrapped.

The consultation included options to move St John‚Äôs School to an educational campus in Biddenham. Another proposal involved merging St John's School with Grange School and Ridgeway School to create one special school for the whole of the Borough of Bedford.

This geographical crossroads in the Eastern Mediterranean were at the time under the rule of the Ottoman Empire (now includes portions of Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Israel and Palestine). The ruins of Baalbek, a settlement in the Beqaa Valley of Lebanon east of the Litani River, were badly damaged. These 1759 events, along with the earlier 1202 Syria earthquake, are likely the strongest historical earthquakes in the region. Tectonic setting The Dead Sea Transform is a long transform fault that runs from the northern end of the Red Sea along the Jordan Rift Valley to the Taurus Mountains complex in southern Turkey. The left-lateral fault zone marks the boundary of the Arabian Plate and the Sinai-Levantine block and has produced pull-apart basins that form the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee. The Levant fault system consists of multiple parallel faults with the dominant features being the Yammouneh and Rachaiya faults. The fault strand that produced these earthquakes is not precisely known and has been the source of much debate, but the Yammouneh fault has usually been cited as the source for the 1202 and 1759 events. Earthquake The sequence of events in 1759 began on October 30, with the smaller of the two severe main shocks that year, causing the deaths of 2000 people in Safed and other settlements. This initial event was estimated at 6.6 on the surface wave magnitude scale and given a rating of VIII (Severe) to IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. This was followed by a more significant earthquake (7.4 and IX) on November 25 that destroyed all the villages in the Beqaa Valley. The areas that experienced damage were roughly the same for both the thirteenth and eighteenth-century earthquakes, with the cities of Nablus, Acre, Tyre, Tripoli and Hama being affected. The village of Ras Baalbek and the city of Damascus were both damaged and the shock was felt as far as Egypt. Damage John Kitto, a writer and biblical scholar, documented details of the earthquakes in his 1841 book Palestine: the Physical Geography and Natural History of the Holy Land and listed first hand details of the events that were provided to him by the Scottish surgeon and naturalist Patrick Russell via his brother (also a doctor) and the Royal Society. Russell had worked as the physician at the British factory in Aleppo for many years, and followed his brother, Dr. Alexander Russel, in that position. The Yammouneh fault in Lebanon The first earthquake occurred at 4 am local time on October 30, and was described by Russell as severe and lasting more than a minute, and was followed ten minutes later by a less violent shock with a duration of no longer than fifteen seconds. Neither of these two events caused damage in Aleppo, which is in the northern region of Syria. Word came in later on that Damascus, in the south, experienced the same earthquakes, along with several others, and was reporting considerable damage, as was Tripoli, Sidon, and Acre, all cities along the coast. The event of November 25 took place in the evening at 7:30 pm. The ground motion was described as: A second slight shock was felt eight minutes later, and the following night at 9 pm there was an undulating aftershock that lasted a few seconds. Many more shocks were recorded during the following days with a 40-second event at 2 pm on the 28th. In Aleppo, people were frightened, but no one was killed and damage was slight, and in Antioch some buildings collapsed with some deaths occurring there. In Damascus however, a third of the city was in ruins, with many thousands having been killed. Many who survived there escaped to the fields to remain safe and did not return out of fear to help those in need. Tripoli sustained more damage than Aleppo; many houses collapsed and the residents took shelter in the open fields. Acre and Ladikiah experienced only minor damage to some of their walls, but the town of Safet, located on a hill, was totally destroyed and many of its inhabitants killed. Several slight aftershocks also occurred in December and January. The large scale temples and courts built in Baalbek during the Roman Empire had deteriorated since their construction nearly two thousand years earlier. During this stretch of time, earthquakes frequently occurred in that area, and these no doubt contributed to its dilapidated condition. Periods of active seismicity came and went, with significant events like the 551 Beirut earthquake damaging much of the Levant and including Baalbek, but other more active periods such as 1156‚Äì57, and 1159‚Äì70 were especially destructive and repairs to the walls there were made after the earthquake of 1170. The region became less active seismically between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, aside from a large event that was damaging to Jerusalem in 1546; the events in 1759 interrupted that relatively silent period. As a result of the multiple earthquakes in 1759, most of the houses and ramparts within Baalbek were completely destroyed, with many of the temples' columns toppled as well. Aftermath Paleoseismic investigation of the area has shown that surface faulting may have occurred during these events. The earlier and much stronger 1202 earthquake left evidence of fault displacement measuring . A more recently dated half-meter slip was also found, but it is unknown whether that movement can be attributed to either of the 1759 events or to the Galilee earthquake of 1837. Further research was done in the Zebadani valley in Syria along the Serghaya fault. A half-meter high scarp was found, and after investigative trenching it was determined that the most recent previous seismic event dated to 1650, and the scarp was interpreted to be the result of one of the 1759 events, but it could not be resolved to either specific earthquake.

Origins of the building √âcole Rose-des-Vents was originally built as an elementary school for children of Canadian Forces Base 14 Wing Greenwood personnel and was named Russell C. Gordon Elementary School. It was designed by the Toronto firm of Craig and MadillCraig and Madill and was completed in 1962. Completed two years after Dwight Ross Elementary School (DRES), both schools were situated in the CFB Greenwood PMQ neighbourhood Clements Park. Both schools, along with A.V.M. Morfee Elementary, which opened in 1949, and √âcole francophone, which opened in 1976, exclusively served children of military personnel until 1988. The schools welcomed children from Kindergarten to Grade 9. Civilian children attended Kingston & District Elementary School and Greenwood District School (now the Greenwood Civic Centre). All children from Grade 10 to Grade 12 attended West Kings District High School. Origins of French-language Education in Greenwood Inside AVM Morfee Annex building, now a daycare for the GMFRC, formally √âcole Francophone In 1971, the Canadian Forces held a survey asking military personnel the language in which they would prefer their children to be instructed, in reaction to the country's new federal policies on official bilingualism. The survey showed that 35 dependents in CFB Greenwood were eligible for French-language education and had parents that were interested in this instruction.http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh- dhp/his/docs/bilingualism_cf_vol2_e.pdf In September 1976, √âcole francophone opened in CFB Greenwood, welcoming 21 students of francophone military families from Kindergarten to Grade 4. Annik Hjelkrum is the first principal of this new school. This homogeneous French-language facility was originally located in two combined PMQ apartments in Clements Park that were refurbished into classrooms. In 1978, √âcole francophone moved to a new building neighbouring A.V.M. Morfee Elementary School, now called the Morfee Annex Building. In the 1980s, √âcole francophone would offer classes up to Grade 8 and welcome between 60 and 90 students. Amalgamation In 1988, all Canadian Forces Bases schools closed, including A.V.M. Elementary Morfee School and √âcole Francophone. Students from those schools were transferred to R.C. Gordon Elementary School and to Dwight Ross Elementary School, with both these buildings and its new students being transferred to the Kings County School Board (now the Annapolis Valley Regional School Board or AVRSB). The Kings County School Board decided to continue administering √âcole Francophone within R.C. Gordon (Kindergarten - Grade 6) and DRES (Grade 7 - Grade 9), where both English- and French-language instruction would continue. It was at this point where non-military francophone families were allowed to enroll their children in French. Andr√© Tessier became the principal of the new √âcole Francophone and R.C. Gordon School. Following pressure from the francophone community to reunite their children from √âcole francophone under one roof, francophone Grade 7 to Grade 9 students from DRES transferred to the R.C. Gordon building in 1992. In this same year, youth from Greenwood participated in the Jeux r√©gionaux de la Nouvelle-√âcosse (Jeux de l'Acadie) for the first time. In 1994, Constance Mary-Ann Zohar-Hiscock became principal of √âcole francophone and R.C. Gordon School. The following year, Andr√© Tessier resumed being principal of both schools. A new school board In 1996, the Conseil scolaire acadien provincial was created and took responsibility of francophone students at R.C. Gordon. From then on, the building would be shared by both the CSAP, which renamed its French stream from √âcole francophone to √âcole R.C. Gordon, and the newly formed AVRSB, which named its English stream R.C. Gordon School. The CSAP also designated five teachers who would become employees of the new francophone school board.https://www.novascotia.ca/just/regulations/regs/eddesemp.htm Constance Mary-Ann Zohar-Hiscock was once again principal of both streams. With the end of Kings County School Board, it was at this point where francophone families from Annapolis County, and consequently from all of the Annapolis Valley, were allowed to enroll their children in French, at √âcole R.C.

Toponym One legend, according to the Etruscans and Romans, was that the Terme di Saturnia were formed by lightning bolts, thrown by Jupiter. During a violent quarrel between the two mythological deities, the bolts thrown towards Saturn had missed, causing the formations. Thermal waters The sulphurous spring water, at a temperature of 37.5 ¬∞C, are well known for their therapeutic properties, offering relaxation and well being through immersion. The main thermal waterfalls are the Mill Falls, located at an old mill as well as the Waterfalls of Gorello. The yield of the source is about 800 liters per second, which guarantees an optimal replacement of water. The chemical make-up is sulfur, carbon, sulfate, bicarbonate-alkaline, earth, with the presence of hydrogen sulfide gas and carbon dioxide. The minerals dissolved in water amount to 2.79 grams per liter.

World of Zoo was released for Microsoft Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS on October 26, 2009. The game was showcased in the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009 on June 1, 2009, held in the Los Angeles Convention Center. The game educates players about animals using facts provided by the National Geographic Society. Gameplay Screenshot of the game's alpha version World of Zoo will simulate a zoo, and players will care for 95 different species of animals, from 11 different families, and place it in one of the 20 exhibits. The goal of the game is to keep the animals in the zoo happy, ways to do this include: feeding the animals, playing with the animals, and improving the animals exhibits. Keeping the animals happy will result in hearts and tokens for the player, who can then redeem their hearts and tokens for food, tools, and new animals. Certain achievements can earn the player certain objects, for example: new species can be unlocked, or in-game awards earned. One example of an in-game award is the player raising in status with one animal family, for the big cat family, awards range from, lowest to highest, \\"Junior Big Cat Handler\\" to \\"Big Cat Whisperer\\". If the player scares the animals too much, they can attack. The game will also feature an \\"Animal Creator\\", a feature that allows players to create and customize animals' personalities and appearances similar to Spore; along with an \\"Animal Adoption Network\\" feature--another way players can add animals. Every animal has unique personalities and behaviors; the player's goal is to earn trust and happiness of each animal, so the player must find a method to gain trust and happiness from each animal. Trust the animal has in the player is measured via a trust meter; after the trust meter gets to rank six, the player can hypnotize animals. Minigames are scattered throughout World of Zoo, and often pose as challenges arising in the care- taking of animals, e.g. grooming or healing. The Wii version of the game can function as single player; but also can also support multiplayer mode up to four players. The Wii Remote is used to control the game in both modes; in multiplayer, player one controls the camera. The PC version includes six animal groups (big cats, giraffes, horses, koalas, pandas, and small monkeys), while the Wii version adds an additional five groups (antelope, bears, crocodiles, elephants, and penguins). The DS version has the same amount of animal groups as the Wii version, but with several differences. The antelope and horse groups are shrunk and merged into a \\"hoofed animals\\" group (which adds the okapi), the addition of a canids group (which includes the spotted hyena), and generally fewer animals. Reception As of 2018, Metacritic declines to award a score due to there only being three reviews (one positive, one negative and one mixed) for the Wii edition and a single positive review for the PC version.

It is a generally fond depiction of army life in the period just after World War II.Fergusson, Bernard. \\"Blow, bugles, blow!\\" (book review) The Sunday Times, Sunday, 13 September 1970 (Issue 7685), pg. 32. (393 words) It was published first during 1970. The stories were based on Fraser's own time as an officer of the Gordon Highlanders in Libya at that time.Farwall, Byron. \\"Regimental Highland Flings\\" (book review) The Washington Post, 25 March 1973./13. The book was followed by two other collections of the same series: McAuslan in the Rough and The Sheikh and the Dustbin. In the epilogue to The Sheikh and the Dustbin, Fraser identified the unnamed battalion and its Colonel, and revealed that the characters and events in the stories were based on real soldiers and incidents. Plot summaries Monsoon Selection Board: Corporal Dand MacNeill seeks to become an officer, and is examined by an officer selection board in India during the final part of World War II. Despite performing every task badly, often trying to answer cleverly and failing miserably, he is approved and commissioned due to his apparent dogged determination to complete the assault course. He perseveres in his futile attempts to cross a mud filled ditch, although the examining officers advise him to 'call it a day' and climb out. In reality he was unwilling to finish or turn back, as he had lost his trousers while floundering in the mud, and had resolved to stay in the water to avoid embarrassment. Silence in the Ranks: Subaltern MacNeill joins an unidentified Highland regiment as a platoon commander, and finds it difficult to conform to the regiment's family atmosphere and to identify with the men he commands. Due to missing a mess meeting he is assigned as Duty Officer and must remain in barracks during Hogmanay (New Year's Eve), while the other officers celebrate by invitation in the Sergeants Mess. To his surprise, he is joined in his quarters by some soldiers of his platoon for drinks, song, and conversation. At the close of the evening, he learns that 'Darkie', of whom he has heard his men talk, is in fact his own affectionate nickname. Play Up, Play Up, and Get Tore In: Dand, in his capacity as Battalion Sports Officer, takes the excellent battalion football team on tour on to various British bases in the Mediterranean ending at an island that is presumably Malta. The team wins every match they play, even against 'The Fleet' (meaning the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet) in a match organised by the over-enthusiastic Governor, who fails to recognise the disparity in resources between one infantry battalion and an entire armed service. Lieutenant Samuels, the opportunistic captain of their transport ship, tries to pass off the soldiers as a scratch team drawn from his crew and win bets on them; he almost gambles away the team's and his ship's paychest on the big match, but the money is saved by an unwitting Private McAuslan. Wee Wullie: A long-serving, tall, incredibly strong soldier is known only as 'Wee Wullie', when off duty is frequently drunk and violent, and often ends a pass arrested by the military police. The Colonel is strangely tolerant of Wullie, however, managing to keep Wullie's breaches of discipline within the battalion where he can deal with him; and it is learned that during the war Wee Wullie showed great heroism, carrying a wounded German for days across the desert until they were both rescued. He did not receive any accolades for this act of heroism, though, as while in hospital recuperating he got drunk, climbed onto the hospital roof, and sang \\"The Ball of Kirriemuir\\" in its entirety, after which he was arrested yet again by the redcaps. (In The Light's on at Signpost Fraser revealed that \\"Wullie\\" was based on a real soldier, whose act of heroism was not a solo march through the desert, but protecting the colonel by defying the Japanese in a POW camp.)Epilogue, The Light's on at Signpost. The General Danced at Dawn: The Colonel is soon to retire, and the battalion is determined to make a good show at an upcoming inspection before he does. In the event, the inspection goes badly and 'anything that could go wrong, seemed to go wrong,' from upsetting a swill tub, to the kitchen in the enlisted men's mess catching fire, to the junior subaltern passing the port the wrong way at the dining-in. The inspecting General MacCrimmon is unimpressed with the Battalion until he watches a display of the regiment's officers performing Highland dancing. He joins in, becoming more and more enthusiastic and recruiting more and more soldiers and passers-by to join, until by dawn the next morning, a crowd of Highlanders, Fusiliers who share the base with the Highlanders, some military policemen, members of the local populace, an Italian cafe proprietor, a few Senussi Arabs in burnouses, and three German prisoners of war make history by dancing 'a one hundred and twenty-eightsome reel'. The General's inspection report \\"congratulated the battalion, and highly commended the pipe-sergeant on the standard of the officers' dancing.\\" The pipey's opinion was that as a dancer, the General was \\"no' bad ... for a Campbell.\\" Night Run to Palestine: MacNeill, on detached service in Egypt, misses his flight to return to the battalion. While he waits for the next one, he is made commander of an overnight troop train to Jerusalem. As well as keeping watch for Zionist saboteurs and snipers, he has to deal with an interfering lieutenant colonel, a group of innocent young ATS women, a chaplain concerned for their moral safety, and a soldier of the Arab Legion who locks himself in a lavatory, among other things. He gets his train to Jerusalem in one piece, despite the interference of the colonel, before returning to Egypt and a farcical court of inquiry which at great length determines that he missed his original flight back from Egypt, hence his presence there; and that he must therefore catch the next flight out. The Whisky and the Music: Invited as a guest to the Sergeants Mess by the battalion's Signals Sergeant, Dand MacNeill learns a little something of his own past - specifically, that his great-uncle, who had been with the Regiment at the beginning of the 20th century, had once been pipe-sergeant of the battalion. He also learns some regimental lore concerning the legendary Piper George Findlater, VC. At the Battle of Dargai in Afghanistan, Findlater played the regimental march \\"Cock o' the North\\" while the bullets whistled around him, inspiring the Regiment to capture the Dargai Heights ... or was it a different march? Guard at the Castle: MacNeill's battalion has been transferred home to Scotland, to Edinburgh to be exact. Royalty is coming to town and it has been decided to have a Scottish outfit provide the ceremonial guard for Edinburgh Castle. The Colonel selects MacNeill to command this ceremonial guard mount. MacNeill and the Regimental Sergeant Major select the five members of the guard detail; rehearse them to perfection; ensure they are well-equipped -- and then, due to a last minute accident with a bucket of paint, are forced to replace one of the spiffy guards with the scruffy Private McAuslan, the dirtiest soldier in the world. McAuslan's Court-Martial: While Lieutenant MacNeill is acting company commander, Private McAuslan is charged with disobedience of a direct order by a newly promoted, officious corporal. A man of principle, McAuslan believes that being ordered to enter the pillow fight at the Army's Highland Division Games is an illegal order. The pillow fight is fought while astride greased poles over a canvas water tank until one combatant is knocked into the water. Corporal Baxter had told McAuslan that he \\"needed a damned good wash, and this way [he'd] get one.\\" Refusing company punishment, McAuslan demanded, as was his right, to be \\"marched\\" -- taken before the battalion's newly assigned Commanding Officer, because he believed he was not being punished justly. Refusing to accept the new Colonel's award of punishment, in accordance with the formula, \\"Will you accept my award or go before a court-martial?\\" McAuslan chooses the latter. It looks grim for The Dirtiest Soldier in the World, but Captain Einstein, the \\"prisoner's friend\\" assigned to defend him, is a resourceful man. Adaptations During the early 1970s, Fraser adapted the stories into a screenplay \\"at the request of a rather eccentric Scots-American entrepreneur\\" but the project \\"died some distance short of pre-production.\\"George MacDonald Fraser, The Light's on at Signpost, HarperCollins 2002 p. 2 =The Dirtiest Soldier in the World= Guard at the Castle was adapted by David Climie into a 30-minute television special for Comedy Playhouse, named The Dirtiest Soldier in the World, which was broadcast in 1972 by BBC1.

KG is a producer of advocaat (egg liqueur). Eugen Verpoorten founded the company in 1876 in Heinsberg, Germany. The distiller from Antwerp opened the \\"Liquor Factory & Colonial Goods of H. Verpoorten\\", where he invented advocaat, on Heinsberg's High Street, next to the noblewomen's collegiate foundation. The strictly guarded recipe for the egg liquor has remained unchanged since the company was founded. His son Hubert Verpoorten continued the business successfully, and William Verpoorten, born in 1890, then headed the operation in the third generation. In 1920, he relocated the site to Berlin because he saw no promising prospects of a new start in the French-occupied Rhineland after his return from the First World War. The building was later destroyed by a direct hit during the Second World War in 1944. Once production had been resumed after the Second World War, initially at an existing branch in Straubing, construction of today‚Äôs headquarters in Bonn commenced in 1952. Viktor Verpoorten was now head of the business and placed an enormous focus on advertising for the first time in the 1960s, when he created the slogan \\"Ei, ei, ei [egg, egg, egg] ‚Äì Verpoorten\\" derived from the popular hit \\"Ay ay ay Maria ‚Äì Maria aus Bahia\\" in 1961. The previous advertising message had run: \\"revitalises the palate, refreshes and strengthens, gladdens and cheers, at home and in all places: Verpoorten\\". In 1960, a 1-litre bottle cost 9.25 German Marks retail. For comparison in 2007: approx. 15 euros. Verpoorten has been family-owned for five generations. Today's managing director is William Verpoorten. Verpoorten employs a staff of around 100 and up to 130,000 bottles are filled and exported to 30 countries every day.

After finishing primary and secondary school in Sisak, he received a degree in Slavic studies at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Zagreb. He received his Ph.D. in 1970 with the thesis Jezik glagolja≈°ke neliturgijske knji≈æevnosti 15. stoljeƒáa i Petrisov zbornik ('Language of the Glagolitic non-liturgical literature and Petris' miscellany'). He was elected as a docent in 1970, as an associate professor in 1974, becoming a full professor in 1977. Since 1968 he has served as a head of the Chair for the Old Church Slavonic language at the Department for Croatian Studies. Since 1977 he has been an associate, and since 1986 a full member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Work Hercoginja's research interest focuses on Croatian Middle Ages. His Srednjovjekovna knji≈æevnost ('Medieval literature') in ¬ªLiber's¬´ edition Povijest hrvatske knji≈æevnosti ('The history of Croatian literature'; Volume II, Zagreb 1975), based on extensive textological, linguistic and historical research of Glagolitic heritage, has managed to paint a different picture of medieval Croatian texts as what used to be called a 'precursor of literature' (A. Cronia). In a series of analytical papers he warns of ƒåakavian-Kajkavian (and also Old Church Slavonic) interference in Glagolitic manuscripts as a result of conscious and deliberate effort of medieval writers to expand the area of influence of their works. Some of the papers, as well as discussions on stylemastics, orthography, language, education, socio-economic situation and the potentials of Croatian Glagolites and their treatment in the historical accounts of Croatian literature, have been compiled in a book Nad iskonom hrvatske knjige (1986). As a researcher he always advocated a theory of the unity of Croatian medieval literature, despite its polyscriptal nature and dialectal diversity. This way he helped to provide a different perspective at the relationship of the Croatian Latinate literature, and that written in Croatian idioms. In the catalog of the exhibition Pisana rijeƒç u Hrvatskoj (Muzejski prostor, Zagreb 1986) he published a study of three-script and three-lingual culture of the Croatian Middle Ages, which served as a basis of the book by the same name. In 1994 Matica hrvatska published his Tropismena i trojeziƒçna kultura hrvatskoga srednjovjekovlja conceived as an account of the most relevant facts from the 9th century Trpimir's inscription up to the 15th century first printed Croatian book (Missale Romanum Glagolitice). His 2004 book Na temeljima hrvatske knji≈æevne kulture: filolo≈°ko medievistiƒçke rasprave, also published by Matica, represents a compilation of author's 50 years of scientific work and study of Croatian literature since the Middle Ages till the 18th century. For his work he received state awards (1975 and 1983), and the Zagreb City Award (1975). He's an honorary scientific adviser of the University of Osijek.

A. Leonard Barn, Old Moscow Highway, Pullman, Whitman County, WA HABS WASH,38-PULL.V,1-5 A Heritage Barn or \\"Historic Barn\\" is a barn in the United States that is deemed a cultural landmark due to its unique historic character. The determination of \\"heritage barn\\" status is a generalized term that some have used to describe historic barns and historic farm properties that are listed on the National Register for Historic Places using the criteria set forth by the Secretary of the Interior. As with all Historic Preservation efforts, heritage barns are encouraged, but not required, to be working buildings. Definition Because barns vary widely in style, size, materials, purpose and architecture, most legal definitions remain open ended. A few U.S. states have legislation defining heritage barns. One legal definition of Heritage Barns comes from Washington state. The Substitute House Bill 2115 from the 2007 Regular Legislative Session defined Heritage Barns as: > any large agricultural outbuilding used to house animals, crops, or farm > equipment, that is over fifty years old and has been determined by the > department to: > (a) Be eligible for listing on the Washington heritage register or the > national register of historic places; or > (b) have been listed on a local historic register and approved by the > advisory council. > In addition to barns, \\"heritage barn\\" includes agricultural resources such > as milk houses, sheds, silos, or other outbuildings, that are historically > associated with the working life of the farm or ranch, if these outbuildings > are on the same property as a heritage barn. The purpose of this bill was to establish a Heritage Barn Preservation Grant Program, administered through the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation. American standards of preservation generally require that a building, structure, or object be 50 years or older before it may be considered historic; however, resources that have earned cultural significance within the last 50 years may also be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Preservation Status =Registers= In the United States, historic barns are often part of a larger preservation effort, and each state deals with them as they do other historic properties like bridges, courthouses, and various sites of cultural significance - through their State Historic Preservation Office and various historic preservation programs at both the state and local levels. However, there are cases of concentrated preservation efforts aimed at protecting historic agricultural resources. The National Barn Alliance, a non-profit group that aims to preserve and protect America's historic barns and rural heritage, maintains a state-by-state guide that details many such efforts. One specific example of a statewide register specifically for heritage barns is found in Washington State Heritage Barn Register through the state Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation, created by their legislature in 2007. The Heritage Barn Register was a response to the preliminary findings of a Heritage Barn Survey conducted in 2007, which found an enormous inventory of historic barns, including many with physical needs.Heritage Barn Report In 2007 alone, 292 Heritage Barns were listed on this special register. =Preservation Grants= In some states, funding is available to heritage barns through Preservation grant programs administered through State Historic Preservation Offices, including the Preserve America grants program, the Save America's Treasures grants program, as well as individual state preservation grants. Increasingly, state's provide or have provided funding specifically for heritage barns; however, funding assistance for privately owned historic barns remains primarily the responsibility of the property owner. Currently, Washington, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Iowa, Montana, Maryland and Michigan provide grants in various forms. Some state and local barn preservation groups, like the Iowa Barn Foundation, Kansas Barn Alliance, Michigan Barn Preservation Network, and the Preservation Trust of Vermont have distributed small grants to assist in obtaining skilled and experienced barn contractors to aid in barn preservation.

The agency was created as the single focus for base conversion matters and the execution of environmental programs and real property disposal for major Air Force bases in the United States being closed or realigned under the authorities of the Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1988 and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. In 1993, the agency was renamed the Air Force Base Conversion Agency, a name that clearly identified its role in assisting BRAC communities through the process of closing and realigning bases from military to civilian reuse. AFBCA ensured that property at these Air Force installations was made available for reuse. The agency provided civilian reuse transition planning caretaker services to include installation protection, maintenance, and operations.

Special education In December 2015, the District administration reported that 421 pupils or 16.3% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 41.8% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2012, the District administration reported that 427 pupils or 16.1% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 48.5% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2010, Ambridge Area School District administration reported that 480 pupils or 17% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In December 2009, the administration reported that 477 pupils or 16.8% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 51% identified as having a specific learning disability. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Ambridge Area School District has provided full day kindergarten since 2011. The District has seen a slight decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, but this has yielding no savings. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the Ambridge Area School District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are expected to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, Ambridge Area School District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Ambridge Area School District received a $1,920,862 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. In 2009, Ambridge Area School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008-09. The district received an alert letter from the PDE - Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The district was placed in Tier 3 due to students spending more than 60% of the school day, outside of regular education. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist. In 2010, Ambridge Area School District was assigned to the Tier 3 monitoring list, due to students spending less than 40% of their day in a regular education classroom. The district received an \\"Alert‚Äù letter from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The letter identifies the data that indicated a need for LRE improvement and described resources available to the district to assist in improvement. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 112 or 3.80% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE).

This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $427,691 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The District used the funding to provide a longer school day/year, student tutoring after school and for implementing research-based instruction improvement strategies. Classrooms for the Future Grant Ambridge participated in Pennsylvania's Classrooms for the Future Grant initiative during the 2008/2009 school year receiving $107,792. The board did not apply for the first two years.

Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the Tax Board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts. *2015-16 - 75.8610 mills *2014-15 - 73.9390 mills *2013-14 - 73.9390 mills *2012-13 - 72.9390 mills Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 69.8390 mills.Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. 2011 *2010-11 - 63.3387 mills *2009-10 - 61.0200 mills. *2008-09 - 61.0200 mills. *2007-08 - 58.5200 mills. *2006-07 - 56.0000 mills. *2005-06 - 56.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Beaver County residents amounts to about 3.49% of their yearly income.

The tax burden was above the national average of 9.8%. Pennsylvania's taxpayers paid $4,374 per capita in state and local taxes, including school taxes.Tax Foundation, The facts on Pennsylvania‚Äôs Tax Climate, January 2015 Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index.

Jim McCauley, (born 1967 or 1968) is a former junior ice hockey coach and NHL Players' Association sports agent, best known as the alleged target of a murder-for-hire plot by one of his clients, former St. Louis Blues forward Mike Danton. Frost currently operates a sports consulting service and travels across North America providing this service on a contract basis. Frost also wrote his hockey autobiography: hockey book titled Frosty: The Good The Bad The Ugly Going Up The Ranks To The NHL. He at one time worked in Laguna Niguel, California under the alias Jim McCauley working out at the Laguna Niguel Hockey Academy.The Hockey News, September 29, 2010: David Frost resurfaces as Jim McCauley at California hockey academy On August 22, 2006 Frost was charged with 12 counts of sexual exploitation by the Ontario Provincial Police for crimes alleged during 1995‚Äì2001. The charges relate to his time as coach of the Quinte Hawks Junior hockey team and involve acts on three females between the ages of 16 to 18 yrs. Frost spent around $200,000 to hire Marie Henein as his defence lawyer. Frost was found not guilty on those charges on November 29, 2008 after the judge in the case found \\"some testimony by government witnesses was simply not believable and he feared some of it had been tainted by collusion\\". Steve Simmons, writing in The Toronto Sun, criticized the poor performance by the Crown prosecutors, who neglected to call several witnesses who would have likely bolstered the case against Frost.The Toronto Sun, November 29, 2008. \\"Brampton Boys\\" regime Frost got his start as a coach with the Toronto Young Nationals, a PeeWee club where he coached, among others, Mike Jefferson (later Mike Danton), Sheldon Keefe, and Joe Goodenow (son of then NHLPA Head Bob Goodenow). He was suspended from the Metro Toronto Hockey League following allegations he forged the signature of the club's general manager. He then took his \\"Brampton Boys\\", a reference to the Toronto suburban city of Brampton, to the Quinte Hawks Metro Junior A Club in Deseronto. He was suspended from the Hawks after he pleaded guilty to a charge he assaulted (punched) a 21yr old Hawks player. Frost's proteges were drafted the following season by Ontario Hockey League (OHL) teams; he was known to frequently attend Sarnia Sting games to monitor the progress of Jefferson, who would eventually be dealt to the Toronto St. Michael's Majors to play with Sheldon Keefe, Ryan Barnes and Shawn Cation, who rounded out the rest of Frost's \\"Brampton Boys\\". Frost, not officially associated with the team, created so many conflicts with the St. Mike's front office that all four of his \\"Brampton Boys\\" were traded to the Barrie Colts. The Brampton Boys tenure in Barrie, while productive on the ice, was accompanied by bizarre behavior, especially compared to the traditional deference shown by junior players. Ryan Barnes was suspended for 25 games for a stick-swinging incident, while Shawn Cation was suspended for 15 games for instigating a line brawl.Sapurji: Barrie Colts -- my decade's most memorable During the 2000 OHL playoffs, team captain Sheldon Keefe visibly refused to shake OHL commissioner David Branch's hand during the presentation of the J. Ross Robertson Cup. While playing at the 2000 Memorial Cup in Halifax, Frost's players led a walkout during a customary banquet and refused to shake hands with CHL commissioner David Branch during ceremonial face-offs. The players would later refuse to stand for the national anthem.Further Adventures of the Hamburg Freezers ‚Äî Wild Bill Stewart Jefferson would later taunt Rimouski Oc√©anic forward and CHL Player of the Year winner Brad Richards, stating that he wouldn't last five games in the OHL. (The four \\"Brampton Boys\\" had all finished their NHL careers by 2004 with a combined 219 games played and 39 points, while Richards retired in 2016 with over 1000 NHL regular season and playoff games, over 1000 points, and two Stanley Cups.) The Colts reached the Memorial Cup championship game, where they were defeated 6-2 by the Oceanic. Jefferson refused to shake Richards' hand after he had been named tournament MVP. Jefferson, Keefe and head coach Bill Stewart also walked out of the Halifax Metro Centre without conducting any interviews. Frost vs the Jeffersons David Frost first approached Danton's parents, Steve and Sue Jefferson, in 1991, successfully recruiting Mike for the Young Nationals. The Jeffersons indicate that their son's recruiter, who later became his agent, wielded a growing influence over their son in the years that followed. As time passed, Frost's influence grew beyond the business of hockey. Jefferson changed his name to Michael Sage Danton in 2002, a decision Frost said was made by the young player to separate himself from his family. Danton subsequently claimed that the Jefferson family had abused Mike, that they lived in squalor and had abused drugs and alcohol. Though Danton made the National Hockey League (NHL), playing 87 games for the New Jersey Devils and St. Louis Blues, Frost retained almost complete control over the player. Frost required his permission for Danton to conduct interviews, and the player frequently asked Frost's opinion on many issues. Following the 2003‚Äì04 NHL season, Danton was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after it was alleged he tried to hire a hit man to kill Frost. Danton pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 7¬Ω years in prison, though he later alleged that it was his father he intended to kill, not Frost. Danton's claims were disputed by the FBI and the alleged hitman, both of whom agreed that Frost was the target. Resignation On 6 December 2005, the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) announced that Frost has resigned as an NHL player agent. Frost no longer represented players and started a sports consulting company with his wife. Frost once worked with former Vancouver Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis when he was an NHLPA agent. 2007 On March 23, 2007 Frost was also charged with fraud, impersonation and breach of probation for allegedly trying to purchase nearly $90 in gasoline by using a credit card registered to Mike Danton. He was acquitted of all charges on February 14, 2009; Danton informed the court that Frost had permission to use his credit cards.Frost Acquitted of Impersonating Player National Post, February 14, 2009 2008 While out on bail awaiting trial on sexual exploitation charges, Frost had his bail conditions amended to allow him to leave Canada. He had intended to attend the Phoenix Coyotes training camp to monitor the progress of a minor-league prospect. However, the Coyotes General Manager indicated that Frost would not be allowed to attend. Since being acquitted on sexual exploitation charges in November, Frost has launched a website designed to unleash secret stories about the NHL, closely guarded playbooks and advice for young players trying to make the big league. Subsequently, Frost's website shut down.

He was also reported to have asked Fujimoto in 1989 what he thought about nuclear weapons. Escape from North Korea Fujimoto has stated that he thought about leaving for Japan on several occasions while in North Korea. On a visit to Japan in 1996, he was arrested after carrying a fake Dominican Republic passport. In March 2001, shortly before he escaped via China to Japan for fear he was being spied upon, he said he presented a videotape to Kim Jong-il of a sea urchin dish from a Japanese television show which he promised he would cook for him.

Born in Tiffin, Ohio, he attended Denison University and then the University of Chicago, where he received a PhD in geology. After receiving his degree, he taught at University of Shanghai and traveled widely in China. Upon his return to the United States in 1929, he completed a pioneering book on the country, China's Geographic Foundations. In 1931, Cressey received a second PhD from Clark University in geography. He then joined the faculty of Syracuse University, where he remained for the rest of his professional career. At Syracuse, Cressey wrote on a variety of subjects, but focused on \\"population problems as related to the worldwide distribution of land and arable resources,\\" and primarily studied Asia, though he traveled to 75 countries on six continents (all but Australia), over the course of his career.James, p. 254 Cressey also served as chair of the department and helped to develop the geography graduate program at Syracuse into one of the best in the country. In addition to his academic work, Cressey consulted for the US Department of State, the Board of Economic Warfare, and the Military Intelligence Corps during World War II. After the war, he was also an outspoken advocate of better relations with Communist China and traveled widely in East Asia and the Middle East with a variety of fellowships. Cressey was also highly involved in a number of professional organizations, serving as President of the International Geographical Union, the Association for Asian Studies, and the Association of American Geographers. Early life Cressey was born in Tiffin, Ohio, on December 15, 1896. His father, Frank G. Cressey, was a Baptist minister and his mother, Frances Babcock, the first woman to graduate from the University of Chicago, taught Latin at Denison University. After high school, Cressey attended Denison University, graduating in 1919 with a B.S. He then entered the University of Chicago, where he studied under the noted geologist Rollin D. Salisbury, receiving a Master's degree in 1921 and a PhD in 1923, both in geology.Herman, p.360 His dissertation was entitled \\"A Study of Indiana Sand Dunes.\\" After receiving his degree, Cressey went to China with the American Baptist Missionary Union and took a position at University of Shanghai in Shanghai, China, teaching both geology and geography. While in China, he met Marion Chatfield, an American missionary, whom he married in 1925. The two went on to have one son and three daughters. Cressey also used his time in China to travel in East Asia, visiting Mongolia and the Ordos Desert with particular frequency. His trips were often dangerous and took him far from other Westerners; during one of his trips, in Hebei, he was beaten and robbed by a group of bandits. His travels in China covered more than 30,000 miles, and formed the basis of a book he began writing, China's Geographic Foundations: A Survey of the Land and its Peoples. Cressey finished the book shortly before leaving China and gave the manuscript to the Commercial Press in Shanghai to prepare for publication. In 1932, however, the press was bombed by the Japanese and the manuscript was lost in the ensuing fire. Second PhD and academic career In 1929, Cressey left China, returning to the United States for a year of study at Harvard University. In 1931, he earned a second PhD, in geography, from Clark University, writing his dissertation on the Ordos Desert. The same year, Cressey joined the faculty of Syracuse University as a professor of geography and geology, and soon became chairman of the department. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in September 1931, Cressey's travels in Asia made him a sought-after expert and lecturer on China, and he traveled frequently, giving lectures to academic audiences and the general public. Cressey also began to reconstruct his book, China's Geographic Foundations, from his original notes, finishing it in 1934.James, p. 255 In China's Geographic Foundations, Cressey focused on describing the 15 geographic regions of China, but he also devoted chapters to \\"history, topography, climate, agriculture, and foreign trade.\\" Writing in Political Science Quarterly, Grover Clark called the book \\"a clear, comprehensive and yet comprehensible description of the land and the people's relation to it.\\" The book went on to become \\"the standard work in its field.\\" Although welcomed by the Kuomintang, the book was \\"strongly criticized\\" by the Communist Party of China because of Cressey's judgment that China lacked the resources to quickly become a great industrial power.Herman, p. 361 While teaching at Syracuse, Cressey continued his travels, and in 1937, he visited Moscow, where he was invited to consult on the production of the Great Soviet World Atlas. After his trip to Moscow, Cressey traveled widely in the Soviet Union, and after returning to the United States he spoke of the great economic potential of the country, despite anti-Soviet sentiment. As a result, he earned \\"the trust and gratitude of his Soviet colleagues,\\" allowing him access to their knowledge and resources. Cressey also spent the 1930s developing the academic offerings at Syracuse, building \\"one of the best Master of Arts programs in geography available in the United States.\\"James, pp. 255‚Äì256 World War II After the US entry into World War II, Cressey became a consultant to several government bodies, including the US Department of State, the Board of Economic Warfare, and the Military Intelligence Corps. Cressey also taught and lectured on Asia, for the Army's training program at Syracuse University, and lectured publicly on East Asia throughout the country. In 1943 and 1944, he served as a special representative in China through the State Department's cultural exchange program. In that capacity, Cressey worked with the National Academy of Sciences to help establish Chinese universities, and promote better relations with China. During the war, Cressey also wrote his second book: Asia's Lands and Peoples: A Geography of One-Third the Earth and Two-Thirds its People, published in 1944. The book was aimed at the ordinary American as a general overview of Asia in light of rising American interest in the region due to the war. In the book, Cressey also entered into the debate on how to divide Asia from Europe by arguing that Europe was really only one of the six regions of Eurasia, the other five being the Soviet Union, East Asia, Southeast Asia, India, and Southwest Asia. Cressey also made the controversial argument in the book that \\"the key to enduring peace in eastern Asia is a strong China.\\" The book was well received, and Dudley Stamp wrote that it had \\"the sure touch of the man who has been to see for himself.\\" Post-war career After the war, Cressey became chair of the newly independent Department of Geography at Syracuse, and worked to make Syracuse a top institution for the study of Asia. He brought Asian scholars and graduate students to Syracuse, and used his department's funds to send maps and books to the geography departments within Asian universities. During the years following the war, he was also active within the Association of American Geographers, International Geographical Union and the Association for Asian Studies. During the 1950s period of McCarthyism, Cressey's interest in China and his \\"outspoken comments on the shortcomings of American foreign policy\\" led to his inclusion on various \\"lists of scholars suspected of sympathy with the Communists,\\" but the accusations were baseless and Syracuse University continued to fully support him. Ironically, at the same time that Cressey was accused of communist sympathies, the Chinese government included him on its list of its capitalist enemies.James, p. 256 In 1951, Cressey retired as chairman of the geography department at Syracuse and became Maxwell Distinguished Professor of Geography, a newly created position.Herman, p. 362 Over the next ten years, he traveled frequently and published prolifically. He also received several honors. From 1949 to 1952, he served as President of the International Geographical Union and in 1952 he was elected as a Vice President, a position he held until 1956. That same year, he received the George Davidson Medal of the American Geographical Society and in 1958 he received a distinguished service award from the National Council for Geographic Education. In 1961‚Äì1962, he was a Phi Beta Kappa National Visiting Scholar and in 1962‚Äì1963 he was served as a Department of State Visiting Professor in Asia. Cressey also served as Honorary President of the Association of American Geographers in 1957 and President of the Association for Asian Studies in 1959 and 1960. In 1955 and 1956, Cressey held a Fulbright Fellowship in Iraq and in 1957 and 1958 he served as a Smith-Mundt Professor in Lebanon. From his research and travel during these fellowships, Cressey wrote the book Crossroads: Land and Life in Southwest Asia, which was published in 1960. In the first section of the book, Cressey dealt with the general geographical features of the Middle East. The next eight chapters dealt with the specific countries of the region from Egypt to Afghanistan, creating a picture of the whole region. Cressey focused in detail on the role of natural resources for the countries of the region, concentrating particular attention on the role of water and water shortages. W.B. Fisher, writing in Geographical Review, called the book \\"an authoritative and compelling study,\\" and Leonard Kasdan wrote in the American Anthropologist that the book was the \\"most useful single compendium of the aspects covered that exists in the literature to date.\\" Although he broadened his regional interests in the 1950s, Cressey remained interested in China and his \\"enduring concern was to restore contact between China and the United States,\\" after the break in their relations following the Communist victory. He also promoted the study of China, hoping to educate a new generation of geographers with knowledge of China and East Asia. Cressey died of cancer on October 21, 1963 at his home in Syracuse, New York.

This could greatly benefit customers by making their funds available even sooner than visiting a branch teller window. = Location Convenience = Video banking can provide professional banking services in nontraditional banking locations such as after hours banking branch vestibules, grocery stores, office buildings, factories, or educational campuses.Credit Union Center (2008): \\"As A Recession Looms, Innovation Could Be Your Competitive Key\\", The Blue Paper. = Technology Branches = Video banking can enable banks to expand real-time availability of high-value banking consultative services in branches that might not otherwise have access to the banking expertise.Tandberg (2005): \\"Transforming Branch Banking: Real-Time Advice in the 21st Century\\", Bank Tech Digital Library. Tandberg (2005) = Video Banking from anywhere= Video Banking has now been taken to another level of convenience. IndusInd Bank from India, has recently launched an innovative functionality called Video Branch. Video Branch empowers the customer to do a Virtual yet Face- to-Face banking with his bank branch Manager or a Central video branch. This concept has brought banking virtually in the hands of the customer. The customer can engage with the bank for services and financial transactions by ‚Äòmeeting‚Äô his bank Anytime, Anywhere. Customer can simply connect to the bank through an App on Android and Apple devices as well as through an application on the laptop/Desktop. So whether the customer is at his home or office or even travelling he will be able to set up a Video conference and experience instant banking services. This facility is available to IndusInd Bank customers only  Technology of Video Banking  Graphical Depiction of a Video Banking Transaction System Example of an uGenius Technology video banking system that has been customized for a production deployment. Example of a video banking solution that Tumsas Company launches Although video banking has many different forms, they all have similar basic components. = Video Connection = Although termed video banking, the video connection is always accompanied by an audio link which ensures the customer and bank representative can communicate clearly with one another. The communication link for that video and audio typically requires a high-speed data connection for applications where the tellers are not in the same physical location. Various technologies are employed by the vendors of video banking, but recent advances in audio and video compression make the use of these technologies much more affordable.W&WComms; (2008): \\"Video Communications - The Missing Link\\" , W&W; Communications company website. For an in depth discussion on videoconferencing technologies see wiki videoconferencing article. = Transaction Equipment = Other than the deployment location, one of the major differences between video banking and videoconferencing is the ability to conduct banking transactions and exchange viable medias such as checks, cash, and coins. Purpose built machines, such as a Personal Teller Machine (PTM), enable both the video / audio link to the customer plus the ability to accept and dispense viable medias.uGenius (2009): \\"What is a uGenius PTM?\\", uGenius Technology company website. The system typically allows the bank teller to manipulate the PTM machine to accept or dispense the cash and checks. Purpose- built transaction equipment is currently available, but in the future these video banking systems will likely leverage existing automated teller machines which will be modified to enable the audio and video communication.  Video Banking Services  Depending on the type of video banking solution deployed there are numerous types of services that can be offered. In conjunction with transaction hardware video banking can include all of the following types of services. *Customer authentication *Cash Deposits *Check Deposits *Cash Withdrawal *Coin Withdrawals *Check Print *Account Transfers *Bill Payments *Account inquiries *Process New Accounts With all types of video banking the following services are enabled: *Process New Loans *Consult with banking professionals *Process New Accounts *Inquire about banking services  References  Category:Banking technology Category:Banking terms Banking ","title":"Video banking"},{"id":"23065815","text":"Evans Lake is a private lake in southeastern Mahoning County, Ohio, owned by Aqua Ohio, a subsidiary of Aqua America (formerly Consumers Ohio Water Company).

A follow-up to the 2006 Nintendo DS game New Super Mario Bros., it was first released in Australia, North America, and Europe in November 2009, followed by Japan a month later. Like other side-scrolling Super Mario games, the player controls Mario as he travels eight worlds and fights Bowser's henchmen to rescue Princess Peach. Up to four people can play in cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes, taking control of Mario as well as Luigi and one of two multicolored Toads. The game also introduces \\"Super Guide\\", which allows the player to watch a computer-controlled character complete a level. Shigeru Miyamoto had held desires to create a Super Mario game with cooperative multiplayer since the series' synthesis. After failed attempts to integrate it into Super Mario 64 due to hardware limitations, he was able to fully explore the concept with the advent of the Wii and its more advanced hardware capabilities. Having developed New Super Mario Bros. and feeling that it was not as challenging as he hoped, Miyamoto designed New Super Mario Bros. Wii with the intent of accessibility for players of all skill levels. Features such as Super Guide and the ability to enter a floating bubble on command and opt out of doing a certain part of a level was added to cater to beginners, whereas other details, such as an award for not prompting the Super Guide block to appear in any level, were added to provide a layer of difficulty. Shiho Fujii and Ryo Nagamatsu composed the game's soundtrack, whereas Koji Kondo, the series' regular composer, served as sound adviser. The game was announced following a slight drop in profits, with Nintendo hoping its release would help to rejuvenate sales of the Wii. New Super Mario Bros. Wii was both critically and commercially successful, receiving particular praise for its multiplayer aspect, although some critics were disappointed by the lack of innovation compared to previous Super Mario titles. It received several honors, including the Best Wii Game award from the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, IGN, and GameTrailers, and is the fourth best-selling game for the Wii as of March 2020, having sold 30.30 million copies worldwide. It was followed by a follow-up New Super Mario Bros. 2 (which is a sequel to the DS game) for the Nintendo 3DS in July 2012 and a sequel New Super Mario Bros. U (which is a follow-up to the 3DS game) for the Wii U in November 2012, and was remastered in high-definition for the Nvidia Shield TV in China in 2017. Gameplay New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer; although it plays out in 2D, most of the in-game characters and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds. In single-player mode, the player controls Mario and must complete various levels, which are filled with both helpful items and harmful obstacles. The player must maneuver him to a large flag pole at the end of each stage to progress.\\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii 'Here We Go'\\" Instruction Booklet, p.10 The game can be played with the Wii Remote held horizontally, or vertically with the Wii Nunchuk attached. Mario can run, jump, and perform additional moves returning from New Super Mario Bros. such as wall kicks, ground pounds and double and triple jumps.\\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii 'Here We Go'\\" Instruction Booklet, p.13 New Super Mario Bros. Wii frequently makes use of the Wii Remote's motion control features; the player can shake the controller in order to perform various different actions, such as a short spin jump which kills enemies, a mid-air twirl that can be used to sustain air time, and the ability to pick up, carry and throw certain objects. Another advantage of the mid-air twirl is the ability to wall-jump off of a singular wall as long as the mini-mushroom or Ice Flower is equipped. Mario has to wall-jump before mid-air twirling back to the wall to repeat the action. Certain areas within levels, such as specific platforms, can be manipulated by standing over them and tilting the Wii Remote. Certain levels are set underwater, where the player must swim to traverse the level.\\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii 'Here We Go'\\" Instruction Booklet, p.14 In addition to gold coins, which the player can collect to earn extra lives, levels contain power-ups encased in floating blocks which aid Mario in his quest. For instance, the Super Mushroom makes Mario increase in size and allows him to take one extra hit; the Fire Flower lets Mario shoot fireballs at enemies; and the Super Star gives the player temporary invincibility, increases his running speed, and provides light in any dark level. The Mini Mushroom, which reappears from New Super Mario Bros., causes Mario to shrink in size, letting him jump higher, run on water and fit through small spaces, albeit while making him vulnerable to enemies and other obstacles.\\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii 'Here We Go'\\" Instruction Booklet, p.16 New power-ups include the Propeller Suit, which allows Mario to fly for a short time by shaking the Wii Remote; the Ice Flower, which gives Mario the ability to shoot balls of ice which freeze enemies into large ice blocks that can be lifted and thrown; and the Penguin Suit, which also gives Mario the ability to shoot ice balls, but additionally allows the player to slide along the ground and across water, as well as giving them tighter control on ice and in water. Yoshi appears in certain levels and is able to eat, swallow and spit enemies and objects, and flutter for a period of time. The game consists of eight worlds, with a secret ninth world which appears once the main game has been beaten. There are 77 levels in the game, 8 in World 9, which are all initially locked. They can be unlocked by collecting all three hidden Star Coins in each level of their respective worlds. Levels are accessed via a 3D world map; completing a stage unlocks the next one, with multiple paths sometimes available after completing a stage. Some stages have an extra secret goal, which, when reached, unlocks an alternative path for a player, such as a cannon leading to a later world. Each world contains two boss levels ‚Äî a midway fortress and a castle at the end of the world ‚Äî where the player battles one of the seven Koopalings. World 4 and World 6 also have a third Airship boss levels, where the player must battle Bowser Jr. to progress to the next world.\\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii 'Here We Go'\\" Instruction Booklet, p.7-8 In addition to levels, there are also \\"Toad Houses\\" scattered across the map in which the player can play a short minigame to earn extra lives or items that can be equipped from the map screen. Map screens often have enemies roaming them in certain dedicated areas which, when encountered, initiate a \\"mini-boss\\" fight that awards the player with power-ups after being won. At certain points, a Toad will appear trapped in one of the previously completed levels, and the player can choose to rescue him from a block and carry him safely to the end of the stage in order to unlock an extra Toad House.\\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii 'Here We Go'\\" Instruction Booklet, p.21-22 Every course contains three Star Coins which are hidden in hard-to-reach areas. These can be spent on hint movies which show off tips and tricks for the game, including the locations of secrets and methods for finding more Star Coins and collecting lives. The player begins the game with five lives, but more can be obtained through collecting coins, picking up 1-Up Mushrooms, performing combos, and playing minigames. Losing a life will return the player to the map, and losing all lives results in a game over, forcing the player to return from their last save point. Most levels contain a midway flag which allows the player to return to that point when returning to the level. New Super Mario Bros. Wii features \\"Super Guide\\", a concept meant to help players that are having difficulty completing a certain level, and the first Nintendo game to include the concept. During single- player mode, if a player dies eight times in a row in any level, a green \\"!\\" Block appears, which can be hit to allow a computer-controlled Luigi to show the player a safe path through the level without revealing any Star Coin locations or secret exits. The player may interrupt the guide at any time and take control of Luigi from that point. After Luigi completes the course, the player has the option to try the level again, or skip it completely. =Multiplayer= E3 2009, players are able to pick up and carry each other, as Luigi is doing with Blue Toad. New Super Mario Bros. Wii is the first Super Mario game to feature simultaneous cooperative multiplayer gameplay. Up to four players, as either Mario, his brother Luigi, or one of two different colored Toads, can play through levels together. Stages are completed when one player touches the flag pole; other players have a limited amount of time to grab it in pursuit before they automatically enter a bubble and the stage is completed. A bonus is awarded if all players grab hold of the flag within three seconds of the first player grabbing it. Players are ranked after each level based on points, coins, and enemy kills they achieve. Players are able to interact with each other in several ways, which can be used to either help or compete with each other; for instance, players can jump on each other's heads in order to reach higher places. They can also pick up and throw each other, and eat and spit each other out while riding Yoshi. If a large distance forms between two or more characters, the game's camera will compensate by panning out to show all of them at once. If the players still do not catch up, they are then dragged by the edge of the screen until they move forward faster or lose a life via a passing obstacle. If one player enters a different area of a level, such as one enclosed via a warp pipe or a door, without the other players, they will warp to the same place after a short period of time.\\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii 'Here We Go'\\" Instruction Booklet, p.18 The first player navigates the world map and selects stages.\\"New Super Mario Bros. Wii 'Here We Go'\\" Instruction Booklet, p.7 Players return to the map screen if they all die before anybody respawns in the stage. If all players run out of lives and get a game over, they must restart from their last save point. If a player dies, they re-emerge in the level encased in a bubble. They can resume play when another player breaks the bubble. A player can break the bubble by touching it, or by hitting it with a fireball, ice ball or Koopa shell. Players can also voluntarily encase themselves inside the bubble while a more skilled player traverses a difficult segment. If every character in a co-op session enters a bubble at the same time (whether through death or voluntarily), they will lose the level and must restart. In addition to the main story mode, which can be played in either single-player or multiplayer modes, there are two dedicated multiplayer modes; \\"Free-for-All Mode\\", in which players complete courses together and compete to get the highest rank, and \\"Coin Battle\\", where they compete to collect the highest number of coins. Plot When Mario, Luigi, Yellow Toad, and Blue Toad are celebrating Princess Peach's birthday in her castle, a large cake appears. Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings emerge from the cake and trap Peach inside. The cake is loaded onto Bowser's airship and it takes off, with Mario, Luigi, and the two Toads giving chase. The Toads in the castle grant them access to the new items, the Propeller Mushrooms and Penguin Suits. After traveling through several worlds fighting the Koopalings, Bowser Jr., and Kamek the Magikoopa, the Mario Bros. and the Toads arrive at Bowser's castle. Bowser is defeated but is revived by Kamek, who casts a magical spell that transforms him into a giant. Bowser chases after Mario and the others, destroying everything in his path, until Mario finds a large switch and triggers it, causing Bowser to fall through the ground and releasing Peach from her cage. Peach and Mario depart from the castle in a hot-air balloon, with Luigi and the Toads following behind. The credits are shown as a minigame where the letters in the credits are written on blocks, which can be broken by the playable characters to get coins (all four characters appear, but only the ones controlled by players can get coins). After the credits, Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings help Bowser out of his unstable castle, which falls over and breaks. Development New Super Mario Bros. Wii was created out of a desire to recreate the Super Mario series' single-player gameplay experience for multiple players. Shigeru Miyamoto, the head game developer at Nintendo, had been interested in creating a Super Mario game with multiplayer features since the series' beginnings with the 1983 arcade game, Mario Bros. Attempts to integrate cooperative multiplayer into Super Mario 64, the first 3D game in the series, ultimately failed due to the hardware limitations of the Nintendo 64. With the faster CPU and enhanced graphical and memory capabilities of the Wii, Miyamoto and the rest of the development team were able to revisit this idea, as the hardware allowed the smooth display of enough enemies and items on the screen at once, and allowed a camera that could dynamically adapt to the players' movements, ensuring they constantly know what is the situation of their character. Miyamoto said that Princess Peach was not a playable character because of her dress, since making her skirt realistically move would require complex dedicated programming. Miyamoto wanted the game to be accessible to all players, and thus tried to balance its difficulty via features catering both to casual and hardcore Super Mario fans. After the release of New Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo DS, which Miyamoto felt had not been hard enough in retrospect, he wanted to create a new Super Mario game which would provide a higher level of challenge for players who desired one. Simultaneously, the Super Guide feature, which would allow a player to watch a level get completed before trying again after failing a certain number of times, was included with the game in order to make the game accessible to unfamiliar players as well. The development team decided to include the feature as an option that would appear in a level after failing a certain number of times to prevent hindering the experience for more experienced players. As an extra incentive for advanced players, the team also added achievements that could be earned by completing the game without making the green block appear in any levels. The ability for a player to put themselves into a bubble and opt out of doing a level was devised so that both novice players and more experienced ones could play without interfering with each other. Miyamoto also hoped for the game to turn into a staple game for the Wii and achieve levels of success similar to that of New Super Mario Bros.. New Super Mario Bros. Wii was worked on by several developers, some of whom had varying understandings of the design principalities of Super Mario games. Miyamoto, who served as the game's producer, helped the directors out with creating a general understanding of the ground rules for the game's design, writing out specification documents explaining the \\"rules\\" of how the game would work. This led to discussions and decisions over what was considered \\"natural\\" and \\"unnatural\\" for a Mario game; for instance, with the advent of the Ice Flower's ability to freeze enemies, the developers decided that it would be logical for the ice blocks to melt when shot with fireballs, and to float to the surface when submerged in water. The music for New Super Mario Bros. Wii was composed and arranged by Shiho Fujii and Ryo Nagamatsu, with additional work provided by sound director Kenta Nagata. C0073 Series regular Koji Kondo was the sound advisor and did not write any new compositions, though some of his creations were re-arranged for the game. Charles Martinet returned to voice Mario and Luigi, along with Samantha Kelly as the Toads and Princess Peach, Kenny James as Bowser, and Caety Sagoian as Bowser Jr. Release On May 30, 2009, the online version of the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that two new sequels would be released for the Wii: a sequel to Wii Fit titled Wii Fit Plus, and a sequel to New Super Mario Bros. tentatively called New Super Mario Bros. Wii. The latter game was announced at E3 2009 and further shown off at Gamescom. To highlight the uniqueness of the game, Nintendo released the game in a red case instead of the traditional white box color that Wii games generally have. The game's announcement came following a standstill in Wii sales, which had led to a 52% drop in Nintendo's first-half earnings for 2009. Nintendo hoped that the game would help to increase sales of the Wii in the coming holiday season. In a Japanese retail briefing event prior to its release, Miyamoto expressed his faith that the game would retain strong sales stretching beyond its first year on the market. New Super Mario Bros. Wii was released in Australia on November 12, 2009, and in North America on November 15. It was later released in Europe and Japan on November 20 and December 3, respectively. On October 29, 2010, it was released as a pack-in game with a red Wii console, alongside Wii Sports and a built-in download of Donkey Kong, which was released to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. It was also included as part of a bundle release with a black Wii alongside a soundtrack CD for Super Mario Galaxy on October 23, 2011. At E3 2011, a variation of New Super Mario Bros. Wii, dubbed New Super Mario Bros. Mii, was showcased as a playable demo for Nintendo's then new console, the Wii U, allowing players to play as their Mii characters. It was a prototype designed to showcase the technology of the system. An enhanced port of the game was released in China for the Nvidia Shield TV on December 5, 2017, alongside other Wii and GameCube ports such as The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. This updated version of the game features high definition graphics in 1080p and a reworked UI. =Piracy lawsuit= In November 2009, 24-year-old Australian James Burt purchased a copy of New Super Mario Bros. Wii several days before its release, as the store had mistakenly put it up for sale early, and ripped and uploaded the game disk online. Nintendo took down the game and sued Burt shortly afterwards, accusing him of violating copyright laws and depriving Nintendo of potential sales. The case was ultimately settled in January 2010, with Burt receiving a fine of AU$1.3 million as compensation for lost sales, as well as an additional fine of AU$100,000 as a part of Nintendo's legal fine. Burt was also forced to disclose the locations of all of his computers and electronic storage devices, as well as give access to his email, social networking and website accounts. Nintendo of Australia managing director Rose Lappin called the incident \\"a global issue\\", noting that thousands of copies of the game had been downloaded across the world before it was taken down. Burt later commented on the incident, calling his actions \\"very stupid\\" and asserting that the crime's repercussions were something that he would have to deal with for the rest of his life. Reception =Pre-release= The game received praise for its multiplayer features following its showcase at E3, with critics praising its competitive aspects as well as its cooperative aspects, though the game's lack of online play was criticized as a missed opportunity. Many favorably compared the game to The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventure, which similarly took its respective series' traditional gameplay and interlaced it with cooperative multiplayer. Chad Concelmo of Destructoid praised the game's \\"creative and giggle-inducing\\" levels and tighter control compared to New Super Mario Bros., while calling the multiplayer gameplay \\"unique, addictive, and gloriously entertaining\\" and giving the game a 9.5 score based on his initial impressions. Engadget's Andrew Yoon called the game \\"playable, addictive and fresh\\", and commended the game's camera system that could zoom out automatically to show off-screen players. Ars Technica praised the game as \\"insidiously fun\\" despite noting the simplicity of the game's graphics. Sophia Tong of GameSpot compared the game to Super Mario Bros. 3 and called the new multiplayer feature \\"a blast to play and hilarious to watch\\". Eurogamer's Oli Welsh called the multiplayer \\"a simple stroke of genius\\". Chris Kohler of Wired praised the difficulty behind the multiplayer mode. The game's presentation was another point of praise for some critics. CNET's Jeff Balakar called seeing a Super Mario game in 480p \\"an eye-opening experience\\", and praised the worlds' attentions to detail. IGN's Craig Harris also praised the widescreen graphics, noting that the game looked smooth in progressive widescreen mode despite the version of the game being displayed being an incomplete build, while Matt Cassamassina said that it looked \\"crisp, clean [and] colorful\\". Some reviewers were slightly critical of the game's multiplayer. Although CNET's three reviewers enjoyed the game, Balakar mused that the multiplayer gameplay was occasionally frustrating due to the chaos and tight screen space. CNET's Dan Ackerman, whilst praising New Super Mario Bros. Wiis overall enjoyability, noted its strong similarity to its side- scrolling predecessors, musing that it felt \\"firmly planted in the 2D era.\\" MTV writer Russ Frushtick commented on the game's difficulty, comparing it to that of the NES game Contra. =Post-release= The game received positive reviews. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu called it a \\"masterpiece of 2D action\\" and gave it a perfect 40/40, making it only the 13th game and the fourth Wii game to receive this score in the publication's 23-year history. Kotaku highly praised the game, calling it a reason to buy a Wii. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com regarded it as the true spiritual successor to 1991's Super Mario World. Critics continued to praise the game's multiplayer features, with several singling it out as one of the game's most potent and worthwhile features. Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia called it the funnest 4-player experience since Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and stated that it exceeded their initial expectations despite strong suspicions. Matt Wales of IGN UK lamented that the game worked as both a single-player and a multiplayer experience, but stated that it was at its best when played with multiple people. Nick Chester of Destructoid called the cooperative mode fun despite occasional frustrations, and stated that players would likely have more fun playing alongside other friends. GameSpot's Randolph Ramsay called the multiplayer \\"initially great fun\\", but also admitted that they found it tedious at times due to the sheer chaos that it led to. Craig Harris of IGN US praised the bubble system, calling it a smart design choice; however, he criticized the game's lack of any online multiplayer features, highlighting it as a particular point of dissatisfaction. Kolan also saw this as a shortcoming, criticizing a lack of online leaderboard features for the competitive multiplayer modes. Conversely, Wales did not see this omission as a major issue, arguing that sociality was a primary aspect that made the multiplayer enjoyable and that it was wise not to include the feature because of Nintendo's poor-quality online service, though they noted that a leaderboard would have been an admirable addition. GameSpy also gave the game leeway for its lack of online play, arguing that the medium is a primarily competitive experience whereas New Super Mario Bros. Wii required a cooperative experience in order to be thoroughly enjoyed. Brett Elston of GamesRadar+, highly critical of the four-player multiplayer, called it frustrating and stated that it felt cramped due to the several characters and small screen size, while advising that the game was best experienced with only two players. Gameplay and controls were praised for their reminiscence of older 2D Super Mario titles; many singled out the use of the Wii Remote held sideways as the best way to play the game and praised it for calling back to the layout of the rectangular-shaped controller of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Ramsay lamented that the game's lack of support for the Wii's Classic Controller was disappointing. Thoughts on the game's integration of motion controls were varied. Kolan praised them as being \\"easy, intuitive and unobtrusive ‚Äì the three most critical aspects in any motion-controlled game\\", while Ramsay stated that they were occasionally intrusive on general gameplay. Chester mostly praised the motion controls for being natural, taking exception with the need to hold a button and shake in order to carry items. Elston stated that the game's handling was \\"compromised\\" by the motion-controlled spin jump, which they stated the review team kept repeatedly activating by accident while trying to play the game. Some writers criticized New Super Mario Bros. Wii for feeling streamlined and banking off of the gameplay of its predecessors. Although Harris awarded the game an 8.9 out of 10 and deemed it a fun experience overall, he also was highly critical of it for \\"playing it safe\\", and, comparing it to Super Mario Galaxy, called it a \\"missed opportunity\\" for Nintendo in terms of content. Edge, while giving the game a positive score of 7/10, criticized it for having a lack of traditional Mario charm and low difficulty level.Edge, Dec 2009, p.86 Elston argued that the game lacked the creativity of others in the series. The A.V. Club called the game \\"the least essential Mario title to date\\", stating that it lacks a strong concept and shows an underlying repetitiveness in Mario games. Conversely, Nintendo Power argued that the game works as a sequel because it maintains what made the original Mario games great while adding new features.Nintendo Power Vol. 249 Corbie Dillard of Nintendo Life pointed out the game's visual polish and smooth animations, but also stated that it did not hold the same level of splendor as other first party Wii releases. Ramsay also compared the game's graphics to other Nintendo-developed titles, stating that it lacked the level of polish that the previously-released Super Mario Galaxy had despite utilizing a bright and varied array of colors. Kolan praised the game's music as one of the best in the series, and lauded the game's sound design for calling back to previous Super Mario entries. Elston also shed praise on the game's soundtrack, as well as the enemy interaction with the in-game music. New Super Mario Bros. Wii received the Best Wii Game award at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards. IGN gave it the 2009 Wii Game of the Year Award. GameTrailers awarded it Best Wii Game of 2009. It also received the Best Family Game of the Year award in Yahoo's 2009 Game Awards, and the Nintendo Power Award for 2009's \\"Wii Game of the Year\\". GamesRadar named the game the 13th best on the Wii in 2016. IGN listed it as #8 on their list of the top 25 Wii games in 2012, and also as #103 on their list of the top 125 Nintendo games of all time in 2014. Polygon placed it at the #10 spot in their ranking of every Super Mario game, stating that the game's single-player was \\"standard Mario fare\\" while singling out the multiplayer experience as an incredible inclusion. =Sales= New Super Mario Bros. Wii was a commercial success, selling 936,734 units within four days of its release in Japan, the biggest debut for a Wii game in the region; its sales increased to 1,401,558 in the following week. Upon the game's release, sales for the Wii console increased by 128%, following a recent slowing in hardware sales for the system. New Super Mario Bros. Wii sold 3,002,753 units within seven weeks of its release in Japan, making it the fastest game in that country to sell 3 million. In North America, New Super Mario Bros. Wii sold 1,390,000 units in November 2009, making it the third best-selling game of the month behind the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Within 45 days, the game had sold 4.2 million copies in the US, surpassing Super Mario Galaxys 4.1 million sales. In December 2009, the game sold a total of 2.82 units. By the beginning of 2010, New Super Mario Bros. Wii had sold nearly 10.5 million units, making it the fastest selling single-system game in history, with 4.5 million units sold in the U.S., 3 million in Japan, and nearly 3 million in Europe. In its first year of sales, New Super Mario Bros. Wii sold 4,001,276 units in Japan, making it the first Wii title with 4 million sales in the country. On November 19, 2014, Nintendo of America announced via Twitter that the game had surpassed sales of 10 million units in the United States alone. As of March 31, 2020, the game has sold 30.30 million copies worldwide, making it the fourth best-selling Wii game as well as the second best-selling Mario game on the Wii console (behind Mario Kart Wii).

The forest floor, also called detritus, duff and the O horizon, is one of the most distinctive features of a forest ecosystem. It mainly consists of shed vegetative parts, such as leaves, branches, bark, and stems, existing in various stages of decomposition above the soil surface. Although principally composed of non-living organic material, the forest floor also teems with a wide variety of fauna and flora. It is one of the richest components of the ecosystem from the standpoint of biodiversity because of the large number of decomposers and predators present, mostly belonging to invertebrates, fungi, algae, bacteria, and archaea. Certain (adapted) plants may be more apparent in tropical forests, where rates of metabolism and species diversity are much higher than in colder climates. The major compartments for the storage of organic matter and nutrients within systems are the living vegetation, forest floor, and soil. The forest floor serves as a bridge between the above ground living vegetation and the soil, and it is a crucial component in nutrient transfer through the biogeochemical cycle. Much of the energy and carbon fixed by forests is periodically added to the forest floor through litterfall, and a substantial portion of the nutrient requirements of forest ecosystems is supplied by decomposition of organic matter in the forest floor and soil surface. The sustained productivity of forests is closely linked with the decomposition of shed plant parts, particularly the nutrient-rich foliage. The forest floor is also an important fuel source in forest fires. Boreal Forest Floor in the Okanagan, British Columbia  Composition  The amount of material in the forest floor depends on the balance between inputs from litter production and outputs from decomposition, and amounts also reflect the site's disturbance history. Both litter production and decomposition are functions of the site (e.g., wet versus dry; cold versus warm; nutrient rich versus nutrient poor) and the vegetation that occupies the site (e.g., conifer versus broadleaf). A site's forest floor is determined by its areal weight, depth, and nutrient content. Typically, forest floors are heaviest and deepest in boreal forests and mountain forests where decomposition rates are slow. In contrast, the lightest and thinnest forest floors usually occur in tropical forests where decomposition rates are rapid, except on white sands where nutrients could not be supplied from mineral weathering. =Temperate forests= Bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta, Pryor's Wood, Stevenage) The organic layer is divided into three layers: on the surface is the leaf litter formed by undecomposed vegetable matter; underneath is humus which is the product of decomposed vegetable matter. Between litter and humus is a partially decomposed layer of organic matter (\\"F: fragmented organic materials\\") . Some specialists consider this zone to be equivalent to the soil horizon (O) whereas for others, this only includes the humus and the intermediate layer, excluding the litter. Woodland plants that inhabit this zone often have bulbs or rhizomes and include ferns such as bracken, monocots such as bluebells and dog's mercury. Sarcodes sanguinea: a parasitic plant obtaining nutrients from mycorrhizal fungi of tree roots (N. America). =Tropical forests= Cloud forest (Ecuador) Because of the action of termites, millipedes and other organisms, the leaf litter layer of tropical forests may be considerably less apparent, or virtually absent at certain times of the year. With up to three defined canopy layers above, relatively low levels of sunlight (as little as 2%) reach here. Examples of the wide range of plants adapted to this zone include: spike mosses, gingers and the parasitic Rafflesia spp. See also * Coarse woody debris * Plant litter References External links  Encyclopedia Network: Soil Quality. * American Museum of Natural History: Forest Floor Diodrama. * Taltree:Arboretum & Garden: The Forest Floor.

In a three-day battle, Br√©z√© defeated the Spanish fleet, which was attempting to relieve some Spanish garrisons isolated along the Catalan coast, and forced the Duke of Ciudad Real to retreat to Majorca for repairs. As usual in most of the battles involving Maill√©-Br√©z√©, the French fleet made an extensive use of her fireships. This time, however, a large French vice-flagship, the Galion de Guise, fell victim to one of his own fireships and went down enveloped in flames. The victory, in any case, was for the French fleet, and its main long- term effect was the fall of Perpignan into the hands of the Franco-Catalan army. Background The outbreak in 1640 of the Reapers' War, or the Catalan Uprising against the Spanish Monarchy, left most of the Principality in hands of the rebels and their French allies by mid-1641. The Spanish forces were restricted to the area around Tarragona and Tortosa in the south and the County of Roussillon in the north, besides a series of isolated ports along the coast. The French viceroy of Catalonia, Philippe de La Mothe-Houdancourt, attempted to conquer Tarragona between May and August, but failed, as a French blockading fleet under Henri d'Escoubleau de Sourdis was not big enough to prevent the entrance into Tarragona of a large Spanish relief convoy. Sourdis had been never very enthusiastic of blockading Tarragona and preferred to focus all the efforts in capturing Collioure to starve the Spanish army in Perpignan. Cardinal Richelieu replaced him with his nephew Jean Armand de Maill√©-Br√©z√©, but for the 1642 campaign he followed his plans and committed most of his forces to conquer Rousillon.  French preparations  Marshall Charles de La Porte gained Collioure on 13 April and, together with Frederick Schomberg, laid siege to Perpignan. The French fleet would blockade the coast between Tarragona and Collioure, and battle with the Spanish fleet if necessary. The fleets of Ponant and Levant were concentrated at Barcelona. The squadron of Brest, composed of 21 sailing vessels, 2 fluyts and 6 fireships, doubled the Cabo de Gata on 10 June. The Toulon squadron, of 19 sailing vessels, 4 fluyts and 6 fireships under the Chevalier de Cang√©, arrived to Barcelona on 8 May. The flotte des gal√®res led by the bailli de Forbin, composed of 25 units, arrived on 21 June. The fleet was completed with a small squadron under Abraham Duquesne which had been left to cruise off the Catalan coast, and ten English and Dutch chartered vessels, thus increasing its strength to nearly 60 ships. After a war council was held aboard the fleet on 22 June, Maill√©-Br√©z√© put his ships on sail in order to intercept a Spanish fleet reportedly seen at the height of Tarragona.  Spanish preparations  Spanish naval officials tried to have ready on time the Spanish fleet to avoid the conjunction of the French Levant and Ponant fleets, but failed, and therefore focused on collecting as many ships as possible for a relief fleet that was supposed to relieve the maritime garrisons isolated along the coast, and specifically the much tightened Rousillon. The maritime relief was the only way, as a land army organized to cross the country till Perpignan had been defeated by La Mothe-Houdancourt at the Battle of Montmel√≥ and the subsequent Battle of La Granada, in which Count Pedro Antonio de Arag√≥n, his lieutenant Gerolamo Caracciolo and the entire force, of some 3,500 men, were made prisoners. In view of the defeat, the whole Castile was put on the warpath. Foreign and private ships were seized, silver from individuals was melted to mint coins to pay troops, and soon C√°diz was full of soldiers and seamen come from all over the country. The Duke of Ciudad Real, a man devoid of experience in naval fighting, was the chief of the fleet. He was seconded by Admiral General Sancho de Urdanivia. The force consisted of 31 galleons or large sailing vessels, 2 frigates, 3 pataches, 6 fireships, a convoy of tartanes, and 35 barcos longos, a newly invented sort of counter-fireship. The battle The Spanish fleet arrived off Barcelona on June 29 around 15:00h, and despite the late hour, the rough seas and not being complete, they immediately attacked the French. The battle raged until sunset. The Spanish tried to board some French ships, but without success. The French launched one fireship and the Spanish three, but also without any effect. The next day, the slower Spanish galleys had reached Barcelona, and the complete Spanish fleet attacked again. Now the Magdalena and some smaller Spanish ships were able to isolate the large French Galion de Guise, and threatened to board the ship. The French launched a fireship against the Magdalena, but the Spanish crew was able to deviate the fireship towards the Galion de Guise which caught fire and went up in flames, together with its commander Vice Admiral Hercule de Conigan de Cang√©, 500 French out of a total crew of 540, and 30 Spaniards. On July 3, the battle resumed, but now the French artillery prevailed and several Spanish ships were seriously damaged. The Duke of Ciudad Real was forced to retreat and the victory was for the French.

(born 21 August 1840 in Nijmegen, Netherlands, died 23 July 1900 in To Tsjeng, Inner Mongolia, China) was a Catholic missionary to China and bishop who was killed in the Boxer rebellion in China. Biography Father Ferdinand Hamer was one of the first group of five missionary priests and brother from the congregation of Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae who went to Inner Mongolia in China from Belgium in 1865. His three colleagues, among them the congregation's leader, Father Theophiel Verbist, died quickly, and then Father Hamer was left to return alone, although he had some lay workers to help him. Later, he became better with the language and the missionary work. In 1878, he was the first bishop to have responsibility for the apostolic vicariate of Gansu. In 1889 he was sent by the Pope to the apostolic vicariate of Southwest-Mongolia. Although he had problems again with language, the Chinese noted his extraordinary helpfulness and devotion. In 1899, he was caught up in the anti-Christian Boxer rebellion. In July and August 1900 the Boxers reached the area where Bishop Hamer was working. The Boxers took him to jail on 19 July, and four days later they subjected him to beatings, mockery, questioning, and torture. That same day, 23 July, he was killed; three sticks were put together into a tripod, and an iron hook was placed at the top. The bishop was stripped and wrapped in a cotton cloth, and dunked in oil. He was then hanged by his feet from the hook with his head hanging down. The cloth was then set on fire. A loud scream was heard, and he died.

The incident occurred on 12 April 1990 at 14:44, killing all five people on board. The cause of the accident were strong winds that exceeded the structure's tolerance, causing the tail rudder and tailplane to crack so the plane became uncontrollable. Impact occurred 63 seconds after take-off and 8 seconds after the crack. The aircraft crashed into the water, and a search was conducted for several days to find the wreck. Uneven and strong winds had given the airport low regularity, and prior to take-off, wind speeds of had been recorded. The accident caused the airport to be permanently closed, and replaced by V√¶r√∏y Heliport. The incident was investigated by the Accident Investigation Board Norway, which published its conclusions in 1991. Three years later, a new investigation was conducted, after an engineer had stated that the cause of the accident could instead have been fatigue. The second investigation came to the same conclusion as the first and all involved parties have since supported the causes made in the initial report. Accident Wider√∏e Flight 839 was a scheduled flight from V√¶r√∏y Airport to Bod√∏ Airport operated with a de Havilland Canada DHC-6-300 Twin Otter. The aircraft had registration LN-BNS and serial number 536, and was delivered to Wider√∏e on 27 April 1977.Arnesen, 1984: 132 It was insured with Norsk Flyforsikringspool.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 10‚Äì11 The aircraft left Bod√∏ Airport at 13:36 as Flight 838 to R√∏st Airport, where it landed at 14:04. It continued to V√¶r√∏y as Flight 839, leaving R√∏st at 14:14. During this flight the crew received information that the wind at the east end of the runway was from 270¬∞, varying from ‚Äîa moderate gale. When the plane landed at 14:30, the tower had stated that the wind was from 270¬∞ and max . The crew commented on the wind after landing, and stated that the wind blew from all directions. At V√¶r√∏y Airport, three passengers disembarked, two passengers boarded and the plane fueled. There was also a passenger in transit from R√∏st to Bod√∏, so the total ridership was three passengers, plus the two pilots.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 5‚Äì6 Take-off weight was , including of fuel.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 11 The aircraft taxied to runway 25. During the departure briefing, the captain decided not to follow the company's standard procedure and have a climb at 320¬∞ instead of 280¬∞. Maximum measured wind had been recorded at while the aircraft had been parked. The aircraft asked for clearance at 14:42:10; this was granted, and the air control informed that the wind at the west end was between 210¬∞ and 290¬∞, varying from . The eastern wind was not communicated to the aircraft, but was 270¬∞, varying from . The take-off started at 14:42:43 and the aircraft was airborne after having passed half the runway. Witnesses described that the aircraft after take-off climbed quickly, but then started falling, and then climbed quickly again. It then entered clouds west of the airport. During climb, the captain wanted to keep the flaps at 10¬∞, contradictory to standard procedure that involved decreasing the flaps. At 14:43:09, a rattling sound was registered on the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). Thirty-five seconds later, sounds from unsynchronized propellers were registered. The co-pilot indicates that the flight was in difficulty. Eight seconds later, at 14:43:52, the CVR stopped recording. At 14:43:54, the control tower at V√¶r√∏y registered a distress signal, that lasted four seconds, followed by a loud bang. The aircraft was then repeatedly called by radio. At 14:50, Bod√∏ Air Traffic Control Center was contacted.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 7‚Äì8 The Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway in Bod√∏ dispatched two helicopters and two ships, but one helicopter and one ship had to return due to the bad weather that soon had increased to a hurricane. At 16:45, parts of the aircraft were found northwest of V√¶r√∏y Airport. After the weather improved, one rescue ship, four fishing vessels and one Westland Sea King were used to find the wreck. On 13 April, twelve ships and two helicopters were being used, and several parts from the wreck were found. This allowed the search crew to use divers to search for the wreck. The aircraft was found on 15 April, from the airport. Eighty percent of the wreck was found within an area of and at about depth.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 16 The deceased were Captain Idar Nils Persen (40), Co-pilot Arnt Vidar Gr√∏nnefl√•ta (31), and passengers Stig Myrvoll (25), Frank Bakkeli (27) and Runa Dagny S√∏raa (23). All passengers died immediately upon impact,Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 20 but the Captain's body was never found. Cause V√¶r√∏y Airport was closed following the accident The runway at V√¶r√∏y Airport, that runs east‚Äìwest, ran parallel to a mountain to the south that is about tall. Prior to construction, Wider√∏e had performed test flights in the area, and these had concluded with unacceptable wind conditions, particularly from the south over the mountain. From 31 October 1988, Wider√∏e introduced self-imposed restrictions on landing at V√¶r√∏y. Aircraft were not allowed to land or take off if the wind came from 090¬∞‚Äì240¬∞ (though south) if the wind speed exceeded , including gusts. Additional restrictions were introduced following an incident on 18 January 1989; these were again modified on 1 November 1989.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 36‚Äì38 Flight 839 took off within the permitted limits of these restrictions. However, Twin Otters were not to operate on the ground during winds that exceeded , and since the aircraft started taxiing following a report of wind speeds of , this was a breach of procedure. The wind also changed direction immediately after take- off.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 44‚Äì47 The aircraft had not had any mechanical or technical errors or problems prior to take-off. The turbulence and wind shear caused a crack in either the tail rudder, the tailplane, or both. This was caused by strong winds acting on both sides of the structure, due to shifting winds. These structural failures caused the aircraft to crash. Out of the 63 seconds from take-off to impact, the aircraft was under control for the first 55 seconds; only during the last 8 seconds did the crew not have control over the aircraft.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 49‚Äì50 The Accident Investigation Board Norway stated in its report that the crew should not have landed with the amounts of wind that were reported, and that they definitively should not have taken off. However, since the wind came from the west, which by pilots was reported to cause fewer problems than from other directions, they may have decided to ignore the wind exceeding the permitted values. In particular, the Accident Investigation Board criticized the choice of taxiing in , above the permitted wind speed for ground operation and far over the permitted levels for take-off from the airport. The board commented that although it was common to cancel flights to V√¶r√∏y, no flights had been canceled after the plane had landed, instead being canceled prior to landing. The board commented that the flight being the last before Easter, it may have influenced the pilots' sense of duty towards getting the passengers to their destinations. This may have been aggravated by the very low regularity that was at V√¶r√∏y. The board also commented that pilots did not trust the wind data they received, since they often experienced it to be incorrect and that the wind could vary considerably within the airport. While the plane was at the ground, it had been raining. Pilots at V√¶r√∏y often experienced that weather was better between rain showers, and there were indications that the captain wanted to take-off before the next rain shower hit.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 50‚Äì53 The Accident Investigation Board concluded: > The cause of the accident is that the plane during climb was subject to wind > that exceeded the plane's construction criteria. This caused a crack in the > tail rudder/tailplane causing the plane to become uncontrollable.\\"Accident > Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 59 Aftermath =New airport= V√¶r√∏y Airport had opened on 1 July 1986 as part of the regional airport network in Northern Norway.Accident Investigation Board Norway, 1991: 36 Prior to this, V√¶r√∏y and R√∏st had been served by helicopters using a heliport; that had replaced previous services with seaplanes.Arnesen, 1984: 140 All services to the airport were suspended immediately after the incident. On 7 May, Wider√∏e stated that they would not use V√¶r√∏y Airport, and that they would decline the concession to operate to V√¶r√∏y if the island community did not receive a new airport. They commented that the restrictions caused by the wind forced the airline to terminate up to half the departures. The chairman of the Wider√∏e's Pilots' Union, Cpt. Helge H√∏vik, stated the same day that the airline might have to lower the number of calls at some other regional airports, namely Mosj√∏en Airport, Kj√¶rstad, Mo i Rana Airport, R√∏ssvold, Sandnessj√∏en Airport, Stokka and Sandane Airport, Anda. H√∏vik stated that he felt that many of the airports were located in the wrong place, for instance at the bottom of valleys, on top of hills and between mountains. Wider√∏e stated that there was not a safety problem at any other regional airports. The report from the Accident Investigation Board was highly critical to the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, stating that the airport should never have been built where it was and that it was \\"clearly unsuitable for regular traffic\\". It stated that the administration had overlooked comments from meteorologists and test flights in the area that had concluded that the wind conditions in the area were not suitable for an airport. The commission that wrote the report and conducted the investigation, stated that the Civil Aviation Administration had not proceeded correctly while planning the airport‚Äîthey had chosen Nordlandet early as a location and ignored negative comments. After the Norwegian Meteorological Institute had made a favorable report about the weather in the area, the administration had failed to conduct the necessary test flights to test the wind conditions, since this was not determined in the initial recommendation. The commission also commented that the safety division had been critical to the localization of the airport, but had withdrawn their disputes following pressure from higher ranks in the administration. The commission also criticized the Civil Aviation Administration for not conducting investigations following the reports of low regularity and the incidents in 1988 and 1989. No aircraft has ever taken off from V√¶r√∏y Airport after the accident, except in June 1992, when a Cessna 172 brought 3 skydivers from Bod√∏ Skydiving Club (Bod√∏ Fallskjermklubb) to the island, accompanied by a Piper Cherokee 140 from Bod√∏ Flyklubb and an experimental plane. The Cessna made 2 landings and take-offs, and dropped the skydivers over the runway at approx. 8000 feet. The Piper and experimental craft made at least one landing and take-off each, during a public show held close to the airport. In 1992, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications decided to permanently close the airport, after it had been temporarily closed since the accident. In 1995, V√¶r√∏y Heliport was opened further south on the island, and Helikopter Service was awarded the public service obligation to operate the route. The helicopter service sometimes uses the closed airport as a reserve airport during bad weather. =Second investigation= In an article published in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Wider√∏e had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece to be part of the cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Wider√∏e stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board. Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and president of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt. Peter Helland, both stated that the Accident Investigation Board should make a new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and tail plane or the end piece had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate the tape of cockpit sound with new technology. The Accident Investigation Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the end pieces. The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in the commissions report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Wider√∏e was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its critical comments concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.

Chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1949 to 1951, he was a friend of President Harry S. Truman and is credited with engineering Truman's upset victory over Governor Thomas Dewey in the 1948 Presidential election. He was forced to resign as chairman of the Democratic National Committee after being charged with financial corruption. Boyle was born in Leavenworth, Kansas in 1902; he became politically active as a Young Democrat at age 16, thereby attracting the attention of Kansas City, Missouri political boss Thomas Pendergast, who made Boyle a precinct captain before his 21st birthday. Boyle's parents were friends of Harry Truman and the future president took him under his wing. Boyle took a law degree, practiced law and was active in Democratic politics in Kansas City. He played an active role in Truman's successful run for the U.S. Senate in 1934. He became police director of Kansas City in 1939. In 1941, he moved to Washington to take a job as counsel to the Truman Committee and personal assistant to Truman in 1942. In 1944, Boyle joined the Democratic National Committee, where he helped steer Truman's 1944 Vice-presidential campaign. Boyle opened an office in Washington. In the 1948 campaign, he persuaded Truman, at the time an underdog, to launch a whistle stop tour of the Midwest. In 1949, Truman made Boyle the executive vice chairman and then chairman, of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). In 1951, a Senate subcommittee under Senator J. William Fulbright opened a probe of loan decisions by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC). The subcommittee report charged Boyle with exerting political pressure on the RFC to provide loans to political allies. Truman said the allegations were \\"asinine.\\" However another Senate subcommittee opened a probe that revealed Boyle used his influence to obtain a $565,000 loan for an $8000 fee. Boyle admitting accepting fees, but denied pressing for the loan He resigned from the DNC, citing poor health.Eleonora W. Schoenebaum, ed. Political Profiles: The Truman Years (1978) pp 48-49 Early life Boyle was born in Leavenworth, Kansas in 1903, though his family moved across the state line. He attended Westport High School, where he soon organized a \\"Young Democrats Club\\" in the prosperous Fourth Ward of Kansas City. He then attended Kansas City Junior College. Boyle's political activities came to the attention of Kansas City political boss Tom Pendergast, who made him a precinct captain‚Äîthough Boyle was still too young to vote himself. Boyle left Kansas City for two years beginning in 1922 to attend Georgetown University Law Center, though he returned home to secure his law degree at the Kansas City School of Law. He joined the Missouri Bar in 1926. (fee for article) Political involvement Boyle's parents were friends of the Trumans, and Harry Truman, also a member of the Pendergast machine, took young Boyle under his wing. Boyle was promoted to Democratic leader of the Eighth Ward, and also practiced law. He also became secretary to the Kansas City director of police. When an income tax investigation wrecked the Pendergast machine in 1939, Boyle survived the crash, becoming acting director of police, winning praise for his work there, and working for a time in the prosecutor's office. Truman had been elected senator in 1934. In 1941, Boyle followed him to Washington as assistant counsel to the Truman Committee. When Truman's secretary (or assistant) left to return to the Army, Boyle replaced him. In 1944, Boyle helped manage Truman's successful run for Vice President on Franklin D. Roosevelt's ticket. After Truman became President, and sought reelection in 1948, Boyle helped manage his campaign. He worked towards a high voter turnout, reckoning that since there were more Democrats than Republicans, a high turnout would favor his candidate. He persuaded Truman to embark on a \\"whistle stop\\" train tour of Southern Illinois and Ohio, which The New York Times credited with turning the election for Truman. =Investigation= In 1949, Boyle became the salaried assistant executive director of the DNC, and then was elected chairman in August 1949. However, in 1951, he was implicated in an influence peddling scandal involving loans made by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. While a Senate investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by Boyle, he resigned later that year due to \\"ill health\\". He returned to the practice of law in Washington, remaining there until he died in his sleep in 1961 at the age of 58. Boyle appeared on cover of the October 9, 1951 issue of Time magazine.

The Centre aims to use intelligence on drug smuggling operations, by air or sea, to apply the most suitable military and/or law enforcement teams to respond to situations that arise. Its area of operations is the eastern Atlantic, from the Cape of Good Hope in Southern Africa to the Norwegian Sea.The Lisbon headquarters is staffed by Country Liaison Officers (CLOs) representing the police, customs, military and maritime authorities of the participating European nations, as well as by permanent observer from the United States through the Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATFS). The European Commission, Europol, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) are observers of the MAOC (N), as well as Canada, Cape Verde, Germany, Greece, and Morocco. MAOC (N) is headed by an Executive Director and guided by an Executive Board. The United Kingdom has allocated a team of three from its Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA); a SOCA officer serves as the Centre's first Director until October 2009. For the British, this was expected to build on the existing strong relationship between SOCA and the Royal Navy. Ireland's representation is a combined one from the Irish Drugs Joint Task Force of the Garda S√≠och√°na (Irish police), the Irish Customs Service and the Irish Naval Service. Personnel from Europol (on behalf of the European Union) and the US Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF) are also present at the Centre to offer liaison and technical expertise. Funding The costs of the MAOC are shared between the participating states (aggregate 30% of total) and an EC Action Grant which covers the remaining 70% (‚Ç¨661,000 ). In 2007-8, each state contributed an initial ‚Ç¨35,000 followed a year later by a further ‚Ç¨5,800 (approx) to cover a shortfall. Operations About twenty operations were executed in MAOC's first six months, resulting in 10 seizures totalling more than 10 tonnes of cocaine. In an operation in June, 2007, 840 kilograms of cocaine were seized aboard a Brazilian flagged vessel which was intercepted by the French Navy, acting on UK intelligence. The vessel, drugs and prisoners were returned to Brazil for prosecution. On 3 September 2010 British police acting on intelligence from the French Central Office against Illegal Narcotics Trafficking (OCRTIS) and supported by the Royal Navy's HMS Gloucester recovered around 30 kilos of cocaine which had been concealed inside the rudder of the yacht ‚ÄòTortuga‚Äô.http://www.soca.gov.uk/news/270-soca- welcomes-milestone-in-west-africas-fight-against-drugs The Irish Joint Task Force on Drug Interdiction co-operated with MAOC and SOCA in Operation Sea Bight which intercepted a large consignment of cocaine off the Irish coast. In its first 4 years of operations MAOC (N) supported the seizure of over 50 tonnes of cocaine and over 40 tonnes of cannabis.

Such campaigns date mostly from the late 20th century, although occasional voices in opposition to corporal punishment existed from ancient times through to the modern era. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child defines \\"corporal punishment\\" as: > any punishment in which physical force is used and intended to cause some > degree of pain or discomfort, however light. Most involves hitting > (\\"smacking\\", \\"slapping\\", \\"spanking\\") children, with the hand or with an > implement ‚Äì whip, stick, belt, shoe, wooden spoon, etc. But it can also > involve, for example, kicking, shaking or throwing children, scratching, > pinching, biting, pulling hair or boxing ears, forcing children to stay in > uncomfortable positions, burning, scalding or forced ingestion.  History  Quintilian and Plutarch, both writing in the 1st century A.D., expressed the opinion that corporal punishment was demeaning to those who were not slaves, meaning the children of the freeborn. In contrast, according to the classicist Otto Kiefer, Seneca remarked to his friend Lucilius, \\"Fear and love cannot live together. You seem to me to do right in refusing to be feared by your slaves and chastising them with words alone. Blows are used to correct brute beasts\\". However, according to Robert McCole Wilson, \\"it is only in the last two hundred years that there has been a growing body of opinion\\" opposed to corporal punishment.Wilson, Robert M., 2.3 Australia Jordan Riak began working against corporal punishment when he was residing with his children in Sydney, Australia. Corporal punishment was eventually banned in the public schools of all Australian states, and the private schools of all states except Queensland. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, one of the earliest organised campaigns was that of the Humanitarian League, with its regular magazine The Humanitarian, which campaigned for several years for the abolition of the chastisement of young seamen in the Royal Navy, a goal partially achieved in 1906 when naval birching was abandoned as a summary punishment.Gibson, Ian. The English Vice, Duckworth, London, 1978, pp.171-176. However, it did not manage to get the Navy to abolish caning as a punishment, which continued at Naval training establishments until 1967.Roxan, David. \\"Storm over canings for Navy boys\\", News of the World, London, 23 April 1967. The Howard League for Penal Reform campaigned in the 1930s for, among many other things, the abolition of judicial corporal punishment by cat-o'-nine- tails or birching.Benson, G. Flogging: The Law and Practice in England, Howard League for Penal Reform, London, 1937. This was eventually achieved in the U.K. in 1948.\\"Power to order flogging: Abolition approved in Committee\\", The Times, London, 12 December 1947. The Society of Teachers Opposed to Physical Punishment (STOPP) was set up in the U.K. in 1968 to campaign for the abolition of corporal punishment in UK schools.Jessel, Stephen. \\"The high cost of cutting out the cane\\". The Times, London, 28 September 1972. STOPP was a very small pressure group that lobbied government, local authorities and other official institutions. It also investigated individual cases of corporal punishment and aided families wishing to pursue their cases through the UK and European courts.Hodges, Lucy. \\"Caned schoolgirl awarded ¬£1,200\\". The Times, London, 27 February 1982. The UK Parliament abolished corporal punishment in state schools in 1986.Gould, Mark. \\"Sparing the rod\\". The Guardian, London, 9 January 2007. STOPP then wound itself up and ceased to exist, though some of the same individuals went on to form EPOCH to campaign to outlaw spanking, and spanking in the domestic setting. A campaign by the name of Children Are Unbeatable! involves more than 350 separate groups, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Barnardo's, Save the Children, Action for Children (formerly NCH), and the National Children's Bureau.Press Association (19 May 2004). \\"71% support parental smacking ban, survey finds\\", The Guardian, London. United States An early U.S. activist against corporal punishment was Horace Mann, who in the 19th century unsuccessfully opposed its use in schools. Several organizations have been formed in the United States to advocate abolishing corporal punishment in homes and/or schools, including: * Parents and Teachers Against Violence in Education (PTAVE), based in California * The Center for Effective Discipline, now part of the Gundersen National Child Protection Training Center (NCPTC) of Winona (MN) State University * The U.S. Alliance to End the Hitting of Children * People Opposed to Paddling Students (POPS), based in Texas * Floridians Against Corporal Punishment in Public School, based in Florida * The Alliance Against Corporal Punishment * The National Youth Rights Association * We the Children Foundationhttp://wethechildrenfoundation.com/ Individuals who have directly advocated against corporal punishment include, but are not limited to: *Kirstie Alley (b. 1955) - Actress - has stated her opposition to corporal punishment on numerous occasions, most notably on the Howard Stern Show *Nadine Block - wrote the bill which banned corporal punishment from public schools in Ohio in 2009 *Blythe and David Daniel - Professors - advocate and teach children's rights and work for laws against corporal punishmenthttps://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/24/news/mn-1269 *Blake Hutchison (b. 1980) - writer of Nobody's Property, independent filmmaker and videographer from Ohio who has made several often-controversial children's rights and anti-spanking videos on his YouTube channel. including one titled \\"Children's Rights Pyrotechnic Practice\\" where he sets fire to a copy of Michael Pearl's book To Train Up A Child. *Horace Mann - campaigned to ban corporal punishment from schools during the 19th century *Dr. Phil McGraw (b. 1950) - Television Show Host has had episodes on his show dedicated to showing the harm and/or ineffectiveness of corporal punishment. *Marcus Lawrence Ward (1812-1884) - governor of New Jersey from 1866 to 1869, who signed into law the public and private school corporal punishment ban during his time in office, which is still in effect today. *Jordan Riak (1935-2016) - drafted the bill which banned corporal punishment from public schools in California in the 1980s *Daniel Vander Ley (b. 1982) - using the BeatYourChildren.com campaign and the \\"Fundamentalism - America's Premier Child Abuse Brand\\" campaign, Vander Ley communicates directly with governments around the world offering their constituents research about the negative effects of corporal punishment and religious extremism. Worldwide An organisation called \\"Global Initiative To End All Corporal Punishment Of Children\\" was formed in 2001 to campaign for the worldwide prohibition by law of all corporal punishment of children, in homes, schools, penal institutions, and other settings. It seeks to monitor the legal situation in every country of the world. The Global Initiative has received endorsement from UNICEF, UNESCO, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the European Network of Ombudsmen for Children. In 2008, the UN Study on Violence against Children set a target date of 2009 for universal prohibition, including in the home, an aim described by The Economist the same year as \\"wildly unrealistic\\". The Society for Prevention of Injuries & Corporal Punishment [SPIC] is an Indian organization advocating measures to stop corporal punishment in schools by making teachers and students aware of its dangers.

It was first announced at E3 2009 and is the sequel to the original 2007 game. It was released worldwide in 2010. The story follows Mario as he pursues the Koopa King, Bowser, into outer space, where he has imprisoned Princess Peach and taken control of the universe using Power Stars and Grand Stars. Mario must travel across various galaxies to recover the Power Stars in order to travel to the center of the universe and rescue Princess Peach. The game was originally planned as an updated version of Super Mario Galaxy; this version would have been called Super Mario Galaxy More. It was later decided that the game was to be developed as a fleshed-out sequel when the development staff continued to build upon the game with dozens of new ideas, and so development time expanded to two and a half years. Among the additions are dynamic environments, new power-ups, and the ability to ride Yoshi. Upon release, Super Mario Galaxy 2 was met with widespread critical acclaim, and was considered an improvement over its predecessor, with its creativity and technological improvements over the original receiving praise, although its sharp increase in difficulty received criticism. It is frequently considered by critics to be one of the greatest video games of all time. It is one of the best-selling games on the Wii with over seven million copies sold worldwide. Gameplay The gameplay of Super Mario Galaxy 2 is similar to Super Mario Galaxy, with a focus on platforming based on and around 3D planets, grouped into levels known as galaxies. Planets and galaxies each have varying themes, sizes, landscapes, and climates. The player controls Mario (or later in the game, his brother Luigi, though using him is optional), who has special abilities such as the \\"Spin\\" attack, long jump, wall jumps, and a variety of somersaults. As in the original, the objective of the game is to travel to the various galaxies and collect Power Stars, which are awarded by completing levels and accomplishing tasks and are used to gain access to later levels. The game retains some gameplay mechanics introduced in the original, such as the blue Star Pointer that allows the player to collect Star Bits and shoot them at enemies, levels that restrict movement to a 2D plane, balance ball levels, and gravity-reversing background arrows. =Setting and level design= The game provides the player access to the game's galaxies through means of a map system similar to that in previous Mario games such as Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros. Wii. This is navigated via a mobile planet called Starship Mario that serves as a hub world, which can be visited anytime and is expanded when new abilities or levels are unlocked. The game contains forty-nine galaxies allotted among seven different regions in the universe (called \\"worlds\\"), the general difficulty progressively increasing in each world. The first six worlds end with a boss level in which the object is to defeat Bowser or Bowser Jr.(the former being in even-numbered worlds, and the latter being in odd-numbered worlds), which then allows the player to access the next world. When the player collects all 120 Power Stars, 120 Green Star levels are unlocked. These levels, containing Green Stars that are hidden or placed in hard-to-reach areas, require intense exploration and precision and may cause instant death if the player fails. Super Mario Galaxy 2 contains 242 unique Power Stars to collect overall. Most of the levels in Super Mario Galaxy 2 offer a unique task based around its theme, and many focus on dynamic environments that change or alternate between various states. For example, some environments change to the beat of the background music, such as sudden shifts in the direction of gravity or the appearance or disappearance of platforms; and others feature a special switch that temporarily slows down time. Prankster Comets, which were featured in the original game and cause variation and tougher challenges in levels, no longer appear randomly in visited galaxies but instead require the collection of a Comet Medal in that galaxy in order for it to appear. In addition, Prankster Comets have become more general and offer any number of variations: while Super Mario Galaxy offered only five mutually exclusive variations, the Prankster Comets in Super Mario Galaxy 2 range to any number of challenges that often mix or overlap. These include: defeating all the enemies, collecting 100 Purple Coins, completing the level within a time limit, completing the level with only one maximum health unit, or avoiding Cosmic Clones (doppelg√§ngers of Mario that imitate the player's actions). As a result, both the dynamic environments and the Prankster Comets often create challenges with puzzle elements, requiring precision and strategy in order to overcome them. =Power-ups= Cloud Mario is one of the new power-ups in the game. Mario is using the power-up, creating temporary platforms in midair to get to out-of-reach places. All the original transformations in Super Mario Galaxy return except for Ice Mario and Flying Mario, along with some new power-ups and items. These include the Spin Drill, which allows the player to burrow through planets and emerge out the other side; Rock Mario, which allows the player to smash through obstacles, such as boulders and enemies; and Cloud Mario, which allows the player to create temporary platforms in midair. Mario is able to ride the dinosaur Yoshi in certain levels. When riding Yoshi, the player's blue Star Pointer is replaced by a red dot, which allows the player to point at various objects and manipulate them with Yoshi's tongue. Yoshi can also use his tongue to swing across gaps, pull levers, and swallow enemies (with the option to spit them back out as projectiles). In addition, Yoshi allows the player to double jump. There are also three different power-up fruits available for Yoshi to eat that grant him temporary abilities. These are the Dash Pepper, the Blimp Fruit and the Bulb Berry. The Dash Pepper allows Yoshi to run quickly, giving him the ability to run up walls and run on water; the Blimp Fruit allows Yoshi to float in the air; and the Bulb Berry allows Yoshi to reveal secret pathways. If the player takes damage while riding Yoshi, the player will fall off and Yoshi will run away until the player gets back on him. If the player does not get back on, Yoshi will retreat into his egg and to different nests which can only be found in certain areas of the level. =Guides and multiplayer= Because of the game's increased difficulty over the original, Super Mario Galaxy 2 offers some features that assist inexperienced or frustrated players. The most notable is the Cosmic Guide, similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii's \\"Super Guide\\" feature, who takes the form of Rosalina. The Cosmic Guide appears if the player has failed during a particular level a certain number of times, and allows the player to give computer control over Mario to complete the level. The drawback is that the player is awarded a Bronze Star, requiring the player to complete the level without using the Cosmic Guide to earn a golden Power Star. There are also monitors called \\"Hint TVs\\" that will demonstrate how to perform a specific move or optimal ways of using a power- up. Multiplayer gameplay has also been expanded upon over the original. In Super Mario Galaxy, another player could use a second Wii Remote to control a second Star Pointer and assist Mario by grabbing enemies or collecting and shooting Star Bits. In Super Mario Galaxy 2, the second player now controls an orange Luma who retains all the original abilities, but can also physically attack enemies and collect items, power-ups and 1-ups, making the player's involvement more useful. Plot Princess Peach invites Mario to share cake at the Star Festival, a time when Star Bits rain down from the skies over the Mushroom Kingdom. On his way, Mario finds a lost Baby Luma, who immediately befriends him and grants him the ability to spin. Shortly thereafter, Mario's nemesis Bowser, who has grown to an immense size after swallowing Grand Stars, attacks Princess Peach's Castle. Kidnapping the princess, Bowser escapes into outer space to recreate his empire at the center of the universe. After launching into outer space, Mario is given control of Starship Mario, a mobile planetoid in the shape of his head, made by a crafty Luma mechanic called Lubba, powered by Power Stars, and piloted by other Lumas; his mission is to fly across the universe in pursuit of Bowser and the Princess. Along the way Mario meets new Lumas and joins up with his companion Yoshi, the Toad Brigade from the original Super Mario Galaxy, and his brother Luigi. Upon collecting enough Power Stars, Mario reaches Bowser's giant starship generator, draining energy from what appears to be a comet. Mario infiltrates the starship and battles Bowser. Just as he falls, the last Grand Star appears. Before Mario can grab it, Bowser emerges having survived and consumes the Grand Star, making him more powerful, but Mario manages to defeat him ground pounding meteorites on Bowser. Mario grabs the last Grand Star and saves Peach. Rosalina and her Comet Observatory from the first Super Mario Galaxy appear before Mario and Peach. Rosalina thanks Mario for watching over Baby Luma that he had found, and Baby Luma returns to the Comet Observatory, taking Mario's hat with him. Mario and his friends return to the Mushroom Kingdom and celebrate their victory. The game ends with Starship Mario sitting above Princess Peach's Castle, with the Comet Observatory streaking across the sky. Development After Nintendo completed Super Mario Galaxy, Shigeru Miyamoto approached the development team and suggested that a follow-up be produced. The game was originally planned to just do variations on the original game's planets and call the game \\"Super Mario Galaxy More\\", and was dubbed \\"Super Mario Galaxy 1.5\\" during early development, with a projected development time of approximately a year. The first elements that were implemented were anything that was scrapped from the original game, either to ensure game balance or simply because of time constraints, such as Yoshi and the concept of a planet shaped like Mario's head. Over time, more and more new elements and ideas were brought into the game, and it was decided that the game would be a fleshed-out sequel rather than a slightly modified follow-up. Thus, development took two and a half years. Takeshi Hayakawa, the lead programmer for Super Mario Galaxy 2, created a development tool that allowed different staff members, including visual and sound designers, to easily design and create stages without waiting for programmers, many of which were incorporated into the final game. In order to help distinguish Super Mario Galaxy 2 from its predecessor, the staff originally wanted the whole game to revolve around the concept of \\"switching\\", in which the game's environments would dramatically change under certain conditions. This concept ended up being particularly difficult to implement full-scale, so was relegated to only certain levels. Another idea that came up early on were cameo inclusions by other Nintendo characters (specifically Donkey Kong and Pikmin). The idea however was nixed by Miyamoto who stated that Pikmin characters wouldn't work within the Mario universe, and that there was no reason for other such cameos. Game tutorials were confined to an optional system called the \\"Tip Network\\" in order to benefit players already familiar with the original game. Miyamoto compared Super Mario Galaxy 2 to The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, in that both games use the same engines as their predecessors, yet build upon their foundations. The game was revealed at E3 2009 on June 2. In Miyamoto's private conference, it was stated that the game was very far along in development, but its release was held back to mid-2010 because of New Super Mario Bros. Wiis release in late 2009. Miyamoto also stated that the game has 95‚Äì99% new features, with the rest being previous features introduced in Super Mario Galaxy. With regard to the original game, Nintendo of America President and CEO Reggie Fils-Aime stated in an interview that the sequel would be more challenging, and Miyamoto said in a Wired interview that the game would have less focus on plot. Miyamoto initially hinted that the game might utilize the \\"Super Guide\\" feature, introduced in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, into the game, and this was confirmed by Nintendo's Senior Manager of Product Managing, Bill Trinen, who claimed that the feature was implemented differently compared to what New Super Mario Bros. Wii offered. The feature is called Cosmic Guide, where the Cosmic Spirit (Rosalina) takes control of Mario. The game made its playable debut at the Nintendo Media Summit 2010 on February 24, 2010, when a second trailer for the game was released, and its North American release date on May 23, 2010 was finally announced. The Japanese, European and Australian versions of the game came packaged with an instructional DVD manual, explaining the basic controls, as well as showing advanced play. The voice actors from Super Mario Galaxy reprise their roles for its sequel including Scott Burns (who voiced Bowser in previous games) and Dex Manley who played Lubba and Lakitu. In January 2015, late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata announced at a Nintendo Direct presentation that Super Mario Galaxy 2, alongside other Wii games such as Punch-Out!! and Metroid Prime: Trilogy, would be re-released for download on the Wii U's Nintendo eShop. It was released on January 14, 2015. =Music= As with the original Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2 features a musical score written for and performed by a symphony orchestra (known as the Mario Galaxy Orchestra in the credits).Super Mario Galaxy 2 staff roll Early in the development process, when the concept of \\"Super Mario Galaxy 1.5\\" was being considered, there were no plans to use different music from the first Super Mario Galaxy. However, as the game evolved, the sound team, headed by Mahito Yokota, realized they needed new music that fit with the new gameplay mechanics that were being added. Although they were hesitant to use a symphony orchestra again because of recording difficulties, general producer Shigeru Miyamoto gave permission immediately ‚Äì according to Yokota, Miyamoto felt that players would be expecting an orchestral soundtrack. Miyamoto also apparently suggested that players would want to hear arrangements from Super Mario Galaxy, which is why the soundtrack is a mixture of brand new pieces and arrangements of themes from the original Galaxy as well as many past installments in the Mario series, such as Super Mario World and Super Mario 64. Ryo Nagamatsu, who worked previously on Mario Kart Wii, Wii Sports Resort, and New Super Mario Bros. Wii, contributed nine pieces to the soundtrack. Koji Kondo recruited sixty musicians for the orchestra, ten more than the number of musicians used for the original game's score, with an additional ten musicians providing a big band style of music with trumpets, trombones, saxophones and drums for a grand total of seventy players. The orchestral performances were conducted by Taizo Takemoto, renowned for his work with the Super Smash Bros. Concert in 2002, while Kondo served as a supervisor, while also contributing five pieces to the soundtrack. The soundtrack was available as a 2-disc set to Japanese Club Nintendo members with seventy songs taken from the game. Reception and legacy =Reviews= Like its predecessor, Super Mario Galaxy 2 was widely praised by major video game critics with numerous reviews praising the game for its creativity and technical improvements over the original. Most reviewers agreed that the game either lived up to or surpassed the original Super Mario Galaxy. It has an average critic score of 97% at GameRankings and 97/100 at Metacritic, making it one of the highest rated games on the sites. Tom McShea from GameSpot called it a \\"new standard for platformers\\", giving it a perfect 10.0, making it the seventh game in the site's history to earn that score. Other perfect scores came from Edge, stating \\"This isn't a game that redefines the genre: this is one that rolls it up and locks it away,\\" and IGN Craig Harris, who felt that the game \\"perfectly captures that classic videogame charm, the reason why most of us got into gaming from the start\\". IGN later placed Super Mario Galaxy 2 fourth on their \\"Top Modern Games\\" list and listed it as the greatest Wii game of all time. The Escapist editor Susan Arendt echoed this view by stating it \\"doesn't tinker with the established formula very much, but we didn't really want it to\\", while GameTrailers commented that \\"there's something tremendous for just about everyone and games that we can truly recommend to almost everyone are rare\\". Ryan Scott at GameSpy regards it a much better game than the first Super Mario Galaxy, stating, \\"For a series that's explored every conceivable angle of its genre, the Mario games keep coming up with ways to challenge our notions of what a platformer can and should do.\\" Giant Bomb Ryan Davis particularly praised the improved level designs, commenting that the designers were \\"bolder\\" and \\"more willing to take some weird risks with the planetoids and abstract platforming that set the tone in the original Galaxy\\", while Chris Kohler from Wired commented that the level concepts alone \\"could be made into full games on their own\\". Additionally, 1UP.com Justin Haywald noted the expanded soundtrack as \\"sweeping\\". X-Play editor Andrew Pfister awarded Super Mario Galaxy 2 a 5/5, calling it \\"the culmination of 20 years of Mario gaming into one fantastically-designed and creative platformer\\". Despite this praise, some critics raised complaints over increased difficulty and the game's similarity to the original Super Mario Galaxy. Chris Scullion from Official Nintendo Magazine called it the \\"new best game on Wii\\", but said it lacked the original's impact (though they admitted the extreme difficulty of this, due to the quality of the original). Game Informer editor Matt Helgeson was concerned with some of the challenges being potentially \\"frustrating\\", particularly towards the end of the game; similarly, Ben PerLee from GamePro remarked that the \\"increased difficulty and high proficiency requirement may turn new fans off\\". However, Worthplaying editor Chris DeAngelus praised the game's difficulty, stating that \\"there are very few sequences where death will feel like a result of bad design instead of player error, which helps keep the frustration down\\". =Sales= In Japan, Super Mario Galaxy 2 sold 143,000 copies on its first day of release and 340,000 copies in its first week, about 90,000 more than the first Super Mario Galaxy sold in the same amount of time. In North America, the game sold 650,000 copies during the month of May 2010. In the United Kingdom, Super Mario Galaxy 2 was the third best-selling game among multiplatform releases and the best-selling single platform release for the week ending June 26, 2010. As of July 16, 2010, the game has sold 1 million copies within the USA. As of April 2011, Super Mario Galaxy 2 has sold 6.36 million copies worldwide. =Awards= Super Mario Galaxy 2 received Game of the Year 2010 awards from Nintendo Power, GamesMaster, Official Nintendo Magazine, Edge, GamesTM, Destructoid and Metacritic. It was named best \\"Wii Game of the Year\\" by IGN, GameTrailers, GameSpot, 1UP.com, and many other media outlets. As of December 2010, IGN awarded Super Mario Galaxy 2 the number 1 Wii game, overtaking its predecessor. In the March 2012 issue of Official Nintendo Magazine, the publication named Super Mario Galaxy 2 the 'Greatest Nintendo Game Ever Made' ranking at #1 out of 100.

Inquiry proceedings The Inquiry was announced by Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill in March 2008. An Initial Hearing was held in October 2008, followed by a Procedural Hearing in November 2008. Chairman, Sir Anthony Campbell, opened the evidence hearings on Tuesday 2 June 2009 at Maryhill Community Central Hall, Glasgow. Following Sir Anthony's introductory statement, Senior Counsel to the Inquiry made an opening statement which included a public presentation of all the material that the Inquiry has collected. Thereafter, legal representatives for the core participants were given an opportunity to make their opening statements, followed by any submissions. The Inquiry began taking oral evidence on Tuesday 9 June. The core participants were: *The Lord Advocate *Stephen House, Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police *Scottish Police Services Authority *Alan Dunbar *Terence Foley *Alister Geddes *David Halliday *Fiona McBride *Anthony McKenna *Robert Mackenzie *Hugh Macpherson *Malcolm Ross *Charles Stewart *Peter Swann *Pat Wertheim *David Asbury (whose murder conviction was quashed on appeal) *Shirley McKie *Iain McKie (Ms McKie's father) Issues In 2009 it was reported that Gerry Moynihan QC, Senior Counsel to the Inquiry, has a potential conflict of interest relating to the Shirley McKie case. Sir Anthony Campbell had considered this issue in March 2009 and decided that Mr Moynihan should continue to act as Senior Counsel to the Inquiry. His decision was communicated to core participants on 16 March 2009 and published on the Inquiry website. In 2007, the media reported that there may have been a link between the McKie fingerprint case and the Lockerbie bombing. However, evidence of this alleged link has yet to be substantiated. Report The Inquiry Report was published on 11 December 2011. The Inquiry's findings, summarised by the Chairman, were: #There is no evidence other than the mark Y7 to suggest that Ms McKie at any time entered Miss Ross‚Äôs house beyond the area of the porch. #The mark Y7 on the door-frame of the bathroom in Miss Ross‚Äôs house was misidentified as the fingerprint of Ms McKie. #Ms McKie did not make the mark Y7. #There was no conspiracy against Ms McKie in Strathclyde Police and all reasonable steps were taken by that force to seek from the Scottish Criminal Record Office fingerprint bureau confirmation of the identification of Y7. #The mark QI2 Ross (on the tin) was misidentified as the fingerprint of Miss Ross. #There was no impropriety on the part of any of the Scottish Criminal Record Office fingerprint examiners who misidentified the mark Y7 as having been made by Ms McKie or the mark QI2 Ross as having been made by Miss Ross. These were opinions that they genuinely held. #The marks Y7 and QI2 Ross were both misidentified by the Scottish Criminal Record Office fingerprint examiners due to human error and there is nothing sinister about the fact that these two errors occurred in the same case. #The misidentifications of Y7 and QI2 Ross expose weaknesses in the methodology of fingerprint comparison and in particular where it involves complex marks. #Fingerprint examiners are presently ill-equipped to reason their conclusions as they are accustomed to regarding their conclusions as a matter of certainty and seldom challenged. #There is no reason to suggest that fingerprint comparison in general is an inherently unreliable form of evidence but practitioners and fact-finders alike require to give due consideration to the limits of the discipline. The Inquiry made 86 recommendations for future action.

The organization provided command and control over several aircraft and radar squadrons. On 15 November 1959, the new Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Direction Center (DC-10) became operational. DC-10 was equipped with dual AN/FSQ-7 Computers. The day-to-day operations of the command was to train and maintain tactical flying units flying jet interceptor aircraft (F-94 Starfire; F-102 Delta Dagger; F-106 Delta Dart) in a state of readiness with training missions and series of exercises with SAC and other units simulating interceptions of incoming enemy aircraft. Inactivated 1 April 1966 as part of ADC reorganization and consolidation, the command being redesignated as the 29th Air Division.

Though their work includes a football stand (for Chelsea Football Club, London, 1972‚Äì4), laboratories and offices, and the landscaping (1976‚Äì7) of much of Heathrow Airport, London, the firm's most notable output was in the realm of public housing. The firm was founded to design the Lillington Gardens estate in the Pimlico area of Westminster, London. Having won the competition, John Darbourne returned to Britain, and with Geoffrey Darke opened a practice from an office in the nearby Churchill Gardens estate.John Gold, 'The Practice of Modernism: Modern Architects and Urban Transformation, 1954‚Äì72'. Routledge, 2007 Lillington Gardens, constructed in phases between 1961 and 1972, was a resounding success, breaking with the then current use of standard units in high-rise blocks. Instead, it emphasised individuality in the grouping of dwellings, provided for private gardens at ground and roof levels, and achieved high densities with blocks of only eight stories. The firm's later (1966‚Äì67) project at Marquess Road, Islington, London, developed an equally difficult urban site on similar stylistic lines, with family maisonettes with gardens at ground level and smaller flats above, fronted by wide 'roof streets' with space for planting. Simons House, a retirement home on Histon Road in the north of Cambridge, was designed by the firm and built in 1977.Histon Road: Simons House, 132‚Äì160, Cambridge 2000. The work of Darbourne & Darke was the subject of an exhibition at the Royal Institute of British Architects Heinz Gallery in the summer of 1977.Darbourne & Darke, An interim report on the work of Darbourne & Darke, London: RIBA Publications, 1977. Darbourne and Darke went on to undertake work in both the UK and abroad - notably several schemes in Germany and Italy, through competition wins (Hanover, Stuttgart and Gifhorn, in Germany, and Bolzano in Italy). Although their main work was in public housing they undertook many public and commercial buildings, winning a number of Civic Trust and RIBA awards, culminating in the prestigious Fritz Schumacher international award for \\"Services to Architecture\\" (1972) an award usually given to statesmen, scientists, writers, artists and musicians. They designed the Lord High Admiral, a Grade II* listed former public house at 43 Vauxhall Bridge Road, Pimlico, London. It is attached to Charlwood House (also Grade II* listed). The structure was built in 1964-67 as part of Lillington Gardens, and the interior fitted out 1968-9. The partnership was dissolved in October 1987, with both Darbourne and Darke setting up separate practices.

Carl Johan Jacob Forsell (6 November 1868 - 30 May 1941), known as John Forsell, was a prominent Swedish baritone, opera administrator and teacher of voice. He was the leading baritone of the Royal Swedish Opera (RSO) from 1896‚Äì1918, and thereafter sang roles periodically with the company until his last stage performance in 1938. From 1923-1939 he served as the director of the RSO. He also sang leading roles as a guest artist with opera companies internationally, drawing particular acclaim for his portrayal of the title character in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Don Giovanni. In 1899, Forsell was awarded the Litteris et Artibus and, a decade later, he was named a Hovs√•ngare. The Royal Swedish Academy of Music awarded him membership in 1906.Rosenthal, H. and Warrack, J. (1979), \\"Forsell, John\\", The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press. p. 175. Early life and education Born in Stockholm, Forsell was the son of Carl August Forsell, a sea captain, and Axeline Forsell (n√©e √Öberg). Before his singing career, he served in the Swedish Army; becoming a second lieutenant in 1890 and lieutenant in 1896. In 1897 he requested and was granted an honorable dismissal from the army, but continue to serve as a member of the Uppland Regiment reserves through 1901. While serving in the army, he pursued voice studies with Julius G√ºnther (1818‚Äì1904) at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm from 1892-1894. After graduating from college he studied singing further in Paris in 1895-1896 and later in Stockholm with Hedvig Willman (1841‚Äì1887) and Signe Hebbe (1837‚Äì1925). Singing career Forsell made his operatic debut at the Royal Swedish Opera, Stockholm, in 1896 as Figaro in The Barber of Seville. He would remain that opera house's premier baritone through 1918, and thereafter appeared only periodically at that theatre up until his retirement from the stage in 1938. He sang in several world premieres with the company, including Wilhelm Stenhammar's Tirfing (1898) and Andreas Hall√©n's Valdemarskatten (1899, the title role of Valdemar IV of Denmark). He also appeared in the Swedish premieres of Eugene Onegin (1903, title role), Tosca (1904, Scarpia), and Salome (1909, Jochanaan). Forsell also established an international career. From 1902-1906 he sang regularly at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen. In 1909-1910 he appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, performing such parts as Tonio in Pagliacci, Amfortas in Parsifal, Figaro in The Barber of Seville, Telramund in Lohengrin, Germont in La traviata and Yeletsky in the United States premiere of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades. The title role in Mozart's Don Giovanni was probably his most famous interpretation. He sang the part numerous times, including during the 1909 season at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, and at the 1930 Salzburg Festival. Other major opera houses in which Forsell sang the Don and various leading parts were the Berlin State Opera, the Dutch National Opera, and the Vienna State Opera. In 1915 he portrayed the role of the Foreigner/Francesco del Giocondo in the world premiere of Max von Schillings's Mona Lisa at the Staatsoper Stuttgart.  Opera director, teacher, and later life Forsell become the Director (Intendant) of the Royal Swedish Opera at the start of the 1923-1924 season, and performed less frequently on stage as a consequence. His voice, however, remained in fine condition. His final opera performance was on his 70th birthday when he sang the role of Count Almaviva in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro at the RSO. He retired from his director's position in May 1939 and died in Stockholm two years later. His wife, soprano Gurli Carlstr√∂m (married 1901), pre-deceased him in 1935. Their son, Bj√∂rn Forsell, was also a successful opera singer. In addition to his administrative duties at Stockholm's opera house during the 1920s and '30s, Forsell taught voice as a professor of singing at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm. His pupils included Joel Berglund, Jussi Bj√∂rling, Magna Lykseth-Scherfven, Aksel Schi√∏tz, Hj√∂rdis Schymberg, Set Svanholm, and Inez Wassner.  Recordings Forsell's gramophone legacy consists of several batches of acoustic 78-rpm discs of arias and songs (made initially by the Gramophone & Typewriter Company prior to World War I) and some subsequent electrical recordings of live stage performances. Many of these recordings are available on modern CD reissues, most notably a four-disc anthology produced in 1994 by Caprice Records (CAP 21586). When discussing Forsell's impressive legacy on disc, the British audio restoration engineer Keith Hardwick has this to say: \\"His voice was a dark, warm, expressive baritone, very well produced and equalized.\\"\\"Biographical Notes\\" for A Record of Singers Supplement 1902-1912, OCLC 9078336, published London, 1982, by EMI Records Ltd.

The SDK single-board computers allowed the user to enter object code from a keyboard or upload it through a communication port, and then test run the code. The SDK boards provided a system monitor ROM to operate the keyboard and other interfaces. Kits varied in their specific features but generally offered optional memory and interface configurations, a serial terminal link, audio cassette storage, and EPROM program memory. Intel's Intellec development system could download code to the SDK boards. In addition, Intel sold a range of larger-scale development systems which ran their proprietary operating systems and hosted development tools assemblers and later compilers targeting their processors. These included the Microcomputer Development System (MDS), Personal Development System (PDS), In-Circuit Emulators (ICE), device programmers and so on. Most of these were rendered obsolete when the IBM PC became a de facto standard, and by other standardised technologies such as JTAG.

It followed various traffic officers from the Garda S√≠och√°na. The first series followed the Garda Traffic Corps in a six-part series. The series was filmed over six months, putting the Dublin Metropolitan division based in Dublin Castle, the Louth division taking in stations in Drogheda and Dundalk and the Donegal division focusing on Burnfoot and Letterkenny areas in the centre of attention. It was similar in format to the British programmes Traffic Cops or Road Wars. Six episodes were made for the series, which aired on Sundays at 20:30. Series two A second series of Traffic Blues returned on 3 July 2011 on RT√â One. It featured numerous traffic offences such as a speeding Audi A4 on Dublin's M50 and vehicle's seizures on the Naas dual-carriageway. It also featured a drunk driver in County Cork as well as a high speed pursuit involving a Ford Mondeo. The main differences between Series One and Series Two are a change in music used and footage from Cork and the N7 in Kildare. Reception After the broadcast of the programme on 21 June 2009, concerns were raised when members of the force had stopped a school bus on the M4 motorway. The bus had a broken seat belt, there were unrestrained children and a worn tyre. Following the programme the National Parents Council, asked for supervisors to accompany children on buses.

The transforming growth factor Œ≤s. In: Sporn, M.B. and Roberts, A.B., Editors, 1990. Peptides, Growth Factors and Their Receptors Part I, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 419‚Äì472, It is a multifunctional signaling molecule with more than 40 related family members. TGF-Œ≤ plays a role in a wide array of cellular processes including early embryonic development, cell growth, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis. TGF-Œ≤ activation Although TGF-Œ≤ is important in regulating crucial cellular activities, only few TGF beta signaling pathway activations are currently known, and yet, the full mechanism behind the suggested activation pathways is not well understood. Some of the known activating pathways are cell or tissue specific, while some are seen in multiple cell types and tissues.P. ten Dijke and C.S. Hill, New insights into TGF-Œ≤-Smad signalling, Trends Biochem Sci 29 (2004), pp. 265‚Äì273 Proteases, integrins, pH, and reactive oxygen species are just few of the currently known factors that can activate TGF-Œ≤. It is well known that perturbations of these activating factors can lead to unregulated TGF-Œ≤ signaling levels that may cause several complications including inflammation, autoimmune disorders, fibrosis, cancer and cataracts. In most cases an activated TGF-Œ≤ ligand will initiate the TGF-Œ≤ signaling cascade as long as TGF-Œ≤ receptors I and II are within reach, this is due to high affinity between TGF-Œ≤ and its receptors, suggesting why the TGF-Œ≤ signaling recruits a latency system to mediates its signaling. TGF-Œ≤ latency (latent TGF-Œ≤ complex) All three TGFŒ≤1, TGFŒ≤2 and TGFŒ≤3. are synthesized as precursor molecules containing a propeptide region in addition to the TGF-Œ≤ homodimer. After it is synthesized, the TGF-Œ≤ homodimer interact with a Latency Associated Peptide (LAP)[a protein derived from the N-terminal region of the TGF beta gene product] forming a complex called Small Latent Complex (SLC). This complex remains in the cell until it is bound by another protein called Latent TGF-Œ≤-Binding Protein (LTBP), forming a larger complex called Large Latent Complex (LLC). It is LLC that gets secreted to the ECM. In most cases, before the LLC is secreted, the TGF-Œ≤ precursor is cleaved from the propeptide but remains attached to it by noncovalent bonds. After its secretion, it remains in the extracellular matrix as an inactivated complex containing both the LTBP and the LAP which need to be further processed in order to release active TGF-Œ≤. The attachment of TGF-Œ≤ to the LTBP is by disulfide bond which allows it to remain inactive by preventing it from binding to its receptors. Because different cellular mechanisms require distinct levels of TGF-Œ≤ signaling, the inactive complex of this cytokine gives opportunity for a proper mediation of TGF-Œ≤ signaling. There are four different LTBP isoforms known, LTBP-1, LTBP-2, LTBP-3 and LTBP-4. Mutation or alteration of LAP or LTBP can result in improper TGF-Œ≤ signaling. Mice lacking LTBP-3 or LTBP-4 demonstrate phenotypes consistent with phenotypes seen in mice with altered TGF-Œ≤ signaling. Furthermore, specific LTBP isoforms have a propensity to associate with specific TGF-Œ≤ isoforms. For example, LTBP-4 is reported to bind only to TGF-Œ≤1, thus, mutation in LTBP-4 can lead to TGF-Œ≤ associated complications which are specific to tissues that predominantly involves TGF-Œ≤1. Moreover, the structural differences within the LTBP‚Äôs provide different latent TGF-Œ≤ complexes which are selective but to specific stimuli generated by specific activators. Integrin-independent TGF-Œ≤ activation *Activation by protease and metalloprotease Plasmin and a number of Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) play a key role in promoting tumor invasion and tissue remodeling by inducing proteolysis of several ECM components. The TGF-Œ≤ activation process involves the release of the LLC from the matrix, followed by further proteolysis of the LAP to release TGF-Œ≤ to its receptors. MMP-9 and MMP-2 are known to cleave latent TGF-Œ≤. The LAP complex contains a protease-sensitive hinge region which can be the potential target for this liberation of TGF-Œ≤. Despite the fact that MMPs have been proven to play a key role in activating TGF-Œ≤, mice with mutations in MMP-9 and MMP-2 genes can still activate TGF-Œ≤ and do not show any TGF-Œ≤ deficiency phenotypes, this may reflect redundancy among the activating enzymes suggesting that other unknown proteases might be involved. *Activation by pH Acidic conditions can denature the LAP. Treatment of the medium with extremes of pH (1.5 or 12) resulted in significant activation of TGF beta as shown by radio-receptor assays, while mild acid treatment (pH 4.5) yielded only 20-30% of the competition achieved by pH 1.5. *Activation reactive oxygen species (ROS) The LAP structure is important to maintain its function. Structure modification of the LAP can lead to disturbing the interaction between LAP and TGF-Œ≤ and thus activating it. Factors that may cause such modification may include hydroxyl radicals from reactive oxygen species (ROS). TGF-Œ≤ was rapidly activated after in vivo radiation exposure ROS. *Activation by thrombospondin-1 Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a matricellular glycoprotein found in plasma of healthy patients with levels in the range of 50‚Äì250 ng/ml. TSP-1 levels are known to increase in response to injury and during development. TSP-1 activates latent TGF-beta by forming direct interactions with the latent TGF-Œ≤ complex and induces a conformational rearrangement preventing it from binding to the matured TGF-Œ≤. Activation by Alpha(V) containing integrins The general theme of integrins to participate in latent TGF-Œ≤1 activation, arose from studies that examined mutations/knockouts of Œ≤6 integrin, Œ±V integrin, Œ≤8 integrin and in LAP. These mutations produced phenotypes that were similar to phenotypes seen in TGF-Œ≤1 knockout mice. Currently there are two proposed models of how Œ±V containing integrins can activate latent TGF-Œ≤1; the first proposed model is by inducing conformational change to the latent TGF-Œ≤1 complex and hence releasing the active TGF-Œ≤1 and the second model is by a protease-dependent mechanism. *Conformation change mechanism pathway (without proteolysis) Œ±VŒ≤6 integrin was the first integrin to be identified as TGF-Œ≤1 activator. LAPs contain an RGD motif which is recognized by vast majority of Œ±V containing integrins, and Œ±VŒ≤6 integrin can activate TGF-Œ≤1 by binding to the RGD motif present in LAP-Œ≤1 and LAP-Œ≤ 3. Upon binding, it induces adhesion-mediated cell forces that are translated into biochemical signals which can lead to liberation/activation of TGFb from its latent complex.Kulkarni, A. B., Huh, C. G., Becker, D., Geiser, A., Lyght, M., Flanders, K. C., Roberts, A. B., Sporn, M. B., Ward, J. M., Karlsson, S. (1993) Transforming growth factor Œ≤ 1 null mutation in mice causes This pathway has been demonstrated for activation of TGF-Œ≤ in epithelial cells and does not associate MMPs. *Integrin protease- dependent activation mechanism Because MMP-2 and MMP-9 can activate TGF-Œ≤ through proteolytic degradation of the latent TGF beta complex, Œ±V containing integrins activates TGF-Œ≤1 by creating a close connection between the latent TGF-Œ≤ complex and MMPs. Integrins Œ±VŒ≤6 and Œ±VŒ≤3 are suggested to simultaneously bind the latent TGF-Œ≤1 complex and proteinases, simultaneous inducing conformation changes of the LAP and sequestering proteases to close proximity. Regardless of involving MMPs, this mechanism still necessitate the association of intergrins and that makes it a non protolylic pathway.

The name originates from the legendary alligator having lost all but two toes on one or more feet to a steel trap.  Origins  The story of Two-Toed Tom originated in the 1920s, at least as early as 1922, according to an anecdote by Esto, Florida councilman Ralph Dupree, born in 1912, who said that he had heard the story \\"since he was 10 years old\\". One of the earliest written accounts can be traced to the 1934 book Stars Fell on Alabama, by Carl Carmer. In the book, the story of Two-Toed Tom, often referred to simply as Two-Toe or Red-Eye, refers to a red-eyed, 14-foot alligator who would regularly eat farmers livestock as well as men and women, the latter of which he was also said to have raped before eating. The story continues to tell of multiple failed attempts to kill the alligator, including an ex-military sharpshooter who spent over a week in a hunting blind, waiting for the creature, and another incident where the alligator was chased into a pond by farmer Pap Haines, into which 15 syrup buckets of dynamite were lit and thrown into, in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Two-Toe. The story ends with it being mentioned the gator was said to have made his way down to Florida, though the narrator, an old man named Gilmore, believed he'd be back to Alabama eventually. Other sources attest that Two-Toed Tom, after leaving Alabama, took up residence in the Sand Hammock Lake, between Esto, Florida and Noma, Florida. In a chapter dedicated to the legend in the book Holmesteading by E.W. Carswell, it's described that the creature continued to frequently eat livestock, and would also bellow in response to the whistle at the Alabama-Florida Lumber Company mill in Noma. Further failed attempts at killing Two-Toed Tom are described here as well, with a group of local boys shooting at it with .22 caliber rifles and shotguns, to no effect. Two-Toed Tom arises again in 1972, when an article in the Pensacola News Journal reported that two-toed tracks had been found on Boynton Island, near the community of Red Head, Florida.  Two-Toed Tom Festival  Starting in 1987, a festival has been held in Esto, Florida dedicated to Two-Toed Tom, however as of 2019, its future has been called into question, due to a lack of support.

Bowker Company, 1998, p. 10931 It has a circulation of 18,799.Mondo Newspapers circulation  History  Though not founded until 1896, the Yuma Sun can trace its history back to the Arizona Sentinel, the first newspaper in what is now the Yuma area. The Yuma Sun would eventually be formed by a merger of the Arizona Sentinel and the Yuma Sun's predecessor, the Yuma Morning Sun. = The Arizona Sentinel = The Sentinel was founded in 1871 by David A. Gordon and C. L. Minor when Yuma was still known as Arizona City. The paper, originally called the Arizona Free Press, was renamed the Arizona Sentinel after one year of publication. Two years later, the paper's name was shortened to just the Sentinel. In 1911, the paper merged with the Yuma Examiner to become the Arizona Sentinel and Yuma Weekly Examiner. Then, in 1915, the paper merged with the Yuma Southwest to become the Arizona Sentinel Yuma Southwest. A little over a year later, the paper switched its masthead back to the Arizona Sentinel. Finally, in 1918 it was again renamed the Yuma Examiner and Arizona Sentinel. The paper moved from a daily to semiweekly in 1920, then became a daily once again later that same year. In 1924, the paper merged again with Yuma Valley News and became the Examiner Sentinel News. In 1925 it shortened its name to the Yuma Examiner. By 1928 the Sentinel and the Examiner had become separate newspapers again. Sometime after, the Sentinel became daily. = The Yuma Morning Sun = The Yuma Morning Sun first saw the light of day on April 10, 1896. The Sun was founded by Mulford Winsor, the son of a newspaper editor. This rendition of the paper would be printed off and on for a period of nine years. Then, on November 15, 1905, the paper was renamed The Morning Sun, becoming a daily newspaper. In 1916 the paper was met with disaster, when a flood caused the collapse of the Morning Sun's offices, destroying all of the files of paper for the previous 20 years. The disaster was a total loss for the paper. However, the paper was able to receive financial backing and shortly resumed publication. = Merger = In the midst of the Great Depression, it was soon realized that Yuma, a city of only 5,000, could not support two daily newspapers. In 1935, F.F. McNaughton and R.E. \\"Doc\\" Osborn purchased both struggling newspapers and combined them. While The Sun had been a morning newspaper, the new owners decided instead to publish the merged daily paper in the early afternoon as The Yuma Daily Sun. The owners reasoned that the main sources of national and world news ‚Äî Washington, D.C., and New York ‚Äî were two hours to three hours ahead of Yuma and so an afternoon newspaper would be able to carry the latest news of the outside world. In 2001, the newspaper went back to its roots, changing its name to The Sun and returning to morning delivery seven days a week. In 2009 the name of the newspaper was again changed. It became the Yuma Sun, reflecting its growing role as not only a printed newspaper but also as a digital source of information on the Internet. = Ownership = 1896 - Mulford Windsor 1909 - J.H.

In 1996, Cox went on to sell its Arizona papers to Thomson Newspapers. In 2000, Thomson sold the Arizona papers to Freedom Communications.

The milk will need to be transferred to bags and frozen for donation. Frozen bags of pumped breast milk. These are ready to be donated. A human milk bank or breast milk bank is a service which collects, screens, processes, and dispenses by prescription human milk donated by nursing mothers who are not biologically related to the recipient infant. The optimum nutrition for newborn infants is breastfeeding, if possible, for the first year. Human milk banks offer a solution to the mothers that cannot supply their own breast milk to their child, for reasons such as a baby being at risk of getting diseases and infections from a mother with certain diseases,When Not to Breastfeed: Safety Issues for You and Baby or when a child is hospitalized at birth due to very low birth weight (and thus at risk for conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis), and the mother cannot provide her own milk during the extended stay for reasons such as living far from the hospital. Human milk banks had an increase in the amount of milk collected in 2012 compared to 2007, in addition the amount of milk donated by each donor had also increased. Mothers' Milk Bank (MMB) says, this service provides mothers with an alternative to infant formula and allows the mother to give their newborn the nutrition it needs for healthy growth. The International Milk Banking Initiative (IMBI), was founded at the International HMBANA Congress in 2005. It lists 33 countries with milk bank programs. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the first alternative to a biological mother not being able to breast feed is the use of human milk from other sources. The primary and by far the largest group of consumers of human breast milk are premature babies. Infants with gastrointestinal disorders or metabolic disorders may also consume this form of milk as well. Human breast milk acts as a substitute, instead of formula, when a mother cannot provide her own milk. Human breast milk can also be fed to toddlers and children with medical conditions that include but are not limited to chemotherapy for cancer and growth failure while on formula.  History  Donating breast milk can be traced back to the practice of wet nursing. The first record of regulations regarding the sharing of breastmilk are found in the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi (1800 BC). These regulations were motivated by the long-held belief that infants inherit the nurse's traits through their breast milk. By the 11th century European culture considered breastfeeding indecent, which led wet nursing to become common practice among royalty and aristocracy of Europe. The practice of wet nursing declined by the 19th century due to concerns regarding unhealthy lifestyles among nurses. Consequently, the medical community began researching the effects of alternative nutrition on neonates. Theodor Escherich of the University of Vienna conducted studies from 1902 to 1911 investigating different sources of nutrition and their effect on neonates. His studies demonstrated that breastfed neonate's intestinal bacteria was significantly different compared to neonates fed by other means. In 1909, Escherich opened the first human milk bank . The following year, another milk bank opened in the Boston Floating Hospital, the first milk bank in the US. The 1960s saw a decline in milk banking because of recent advances in neonatal care and baby formula. Despite these new advancements, in 1980 the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's fund maintained their position that donor breast milk is the best alternative to the mother's breast milk. The practice of milk banking declined further with the HIV epidemic. The need for stringent screening increased the cost of operating milk banks, forcing them to close doors. Improved screening methods and standardization of procedure have made donated milk a viable alternative to mother's breast milk. The ability to pasteurize and store breast milk for up to 8 months means milk banking could become a global enterprise. Donor Requirement A donor must: * Be healthy * Be in the process of lactation * Undertake a chest x-ray or Tyne test * Have a negative VDRL * Have no evidence of hepatitis * Be HIV negative More requirements may apply. For example, the requirements in Australia can be found at: http://jhl.sagepub.com/content/2/1/20.full.pdf Concerns Some concerns that surround human milk bank include: * Cost * Availability * Lack of health care provider interest * Concern about the type of women who might donate Consumers After the milk has been donated the primary consumer of the milk are premature babies; other consumers include adults with medical complications or conditions. The main reason why premature babies consume donor milk is that the mother cannot provide milk for the baby. The donor milk therefore acts as a substitute.Heiman, H., Schanler, R.J. (2006).

Human milk banks are needed as they offer milk which mostly is consumed by children whose mothers are not able to provide them with reliable milk. Human Milk Banks Around the World = Brazil and Latin America = Brazil has an extensive network of 217 milk banks, and is considered to have the most cost efficient system of milk banking in the world. Since the inception of the first milk bank in 1985, the infant mortality rate in Brazil has dropped 73% due, in part, to the popularization of milk banks. In 2011, 165,000 liters (5,580,000 fl oz) of breast milk were donated by some 166,000 mothers, and provided to nearly 170,000 babies. The Brazilian and Ibero- American Network of Human Milk Banks coordinates these efforts. All donors are screened: in general, they must be healthy and not be taking any medication. The Brazilian system is defined by its inexpensive pasteurization of milk and has spread to other countries such as Spain, Portugal, the Cape Verde Islands, and portions of the rest of Latin America. =Europe= There are 223 active human milk banks in 28 countries within Europe, with 14 more planned as of November 2018. Currently, Italy has the most milk banks, at 37, while Turkey has the least, having no milk banks. =North America= The Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA) has a \\"Guidelines for the Establishment and Operation of a Donor Human Milk Bank\\" that establishes exhaustive guidelines for safe milk collection and usage in North America. There are 16 milk banks in North America as of 2014. They collect about 3,000,000 oz per year as of 2013. =South Africa= South Africa has a breast milk collection and distribution program, Milk Matters, based in Cape Town.Milk Matters =Singapore= Singapore launched a three-year pilot donor breast milk bank on Thursday 17 August 2017. It is a collaboration between KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and Temasek Foundation Cares. The foundation has set aside S$1.37 million (US$1 million) for the milk bank, which will collect, screen, process and store breast milk from donor mothers. =Australia= As of 2014 Australia has a total of 5 Human Milk Banks in operation: * PREM bank (based at King Edward Memorial Hospital, WA and also supplying Princess Margaret Hospital); * Royal Prince Alfred (RPA) Hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NSW); * Mothers Milk Bank Pty Ltd (a private charity, previously located on the Gold Coast, now at Tweed Heads NSW and supplying the Brisbane Mater Children's Hospital as well as some babies in the community); * Mercy Health Breastmilk Bank (commenced 2011 at Mercy Hospital for Women, Heidelberg VIC); and * Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) Milk bank (commenced November 2012 at the RBWH Grantley Stable Neonatal Unit).Donor Human Milk Banking in Australia *Mother's milk bank. =India= *Asia's first milk bank was established in 1989 at Sion Hospital, Mumbai, India under the leadership of Dr Armida Fernandez, and is presently run by Dr Jayashree Mondkar, a neo-natologist.Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital and Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College, Sion, Mumbai *In 2017, the first milk bank, called the Vatsalya ‚Äî Maatri Amrit Kosh, was established at Lady Hardinge Medical College.

The Society is an independent not-for-profit corporation, not a unit of government. Today, the Schenectady County Historical Society brings to life the region‚Äôs history through exhibits, talks, workshops, concerts, programs and community events at their three sites: Mabee Farm Historic Site, the Grems-Doolittle Library and the Schenectady History Museum, and the historic Brouwer House Creative. The Society's stated mission is to \\"share stories, inspire dialogue, and encourage understanding of the history, people, and cultures of Schenectady County.\\" The Society's vision is to \\"strengthen our community as an increasingly vital destination and resource for exploring history.\\" History Its stated mission as embodied in its original constitution was ‚Äúto promote and encourage original historical research; to disseminate a greater knowledge of the history of the State of New York and particularly of Schenectady County; to gather, preserve, display, and make available for study artifacts, books, manuscripts, papers, photographs and other records and materials relating to the early and current history of Schenectady County, New York and of the surrounding area; to encourage the suitable marking of places of historic interest; to acquire by purchase, gifts, devise, or otherwise the title to or the custody and control of historic sites and structures.‚Äù For seven years, the Society had no headquarters of its own, but was given space for exhibits in the Schenectady County Public Library. In December 1912, a committee responsible for finding a home for the Society succeeded in negotiating a three-year lease for the building at 11-13-15 Union Street that had been erected a half-century earlier to accommodate the offices of the County Clerk and the Surrogate Court and was no longer needed for that purpose. The exhibits were moved from the Library to the new home, and this became the location for monthly meetings for the next 46 years. In April 1958, the General Electric Company deeded to the Society the former G.E. Women's Club building at 32 Washington Avenue ‚Äúas tangible evidence of its interest and desire to associate itself with those who are working to advance the city's cultural and educational activities.\\" The c. 1895 Georgian style building, whose grounds are adjacent to the waters of the Binnekill and the Mohawk River, displays aspects of Federal and Greek Revival throughout the house. It is located in the Stockade Historic District, declared a national historic site in 1973. To house an expanding collection of books and documents, a second major addition was added to the rear of the house in 1991. Called the Grems-Doolittle Library in honor of its major benefactor, Mandalay Grems, the Library and the Schenectady History Museum in the original house form the core of the Society‚Äôs downtown Schenectady operations. In little over a decade, the 1990s, the Society grew from a modest house museum called the Dora Jackson House with one room jammed with local history and genealogy, to the expansive Schenectady History Museum; the adjoining Grems-Doolittle historical and genealogical library housing over 2,000 local family files. The Mabee Farm Historic Site‚Äîthree 17th century farm buildings on in Rotterdam Junction, seven miles (11 km) west of the City of Schenectady was donated to the Society in the 1993. The Mabee House had been passed from generation to generation for 287 years before being deeded to the Society by George Franchere. Franchere also gave the Society 583 family papers including the deed passed by Daniel Janse Van Antwerpen to Jan Pieterse Mabee on January 29, 1705, and he provided generous financial support for Farm operations for several years after his initial gift. Mr. Franchere, the last in that particular line of Mabees, died in Florida in November 2004, and is buried in Vale Cemetery. In accord with the Franchere will, part of that income was used in 2008 to purchase of adjacent land from Schenectady County, effectively quadrupling the size of the Farm. The George E. Franchere Educational Center, was completed in October 2011 on part of the newly acquired land, and provides car and bus parking; space for receptions, presentations, and artifact storage; refreshment facilities; classrooms; and offices for Site management. Additionally, in 2009 it acquired plus from the NY State Canal Corp on the north side of the Mohawk River, to protect the historic viewshed. In the early 2000s, the c. 1760s Nielsen Dutch barn was moved to the site, and is used for programming. Today, the Mabee Farm's collection of 18th century buildings and ongoing farming practices are demonstrative of life in early rural Schenectady. In 2017 the Kindl Family of Schenectady donated a property at 14 N Church Street, Schenectady to the Society. The historic Brouwer House dates to 1735, and is among the oldest houses in the Stockade neighborhood. The Society adapted the historic space into creative studios. In residence at any given point are artists, crafters, musicians, theatre companies, or other local non-profits. Behind Brouwer House Creative is an extensive shade garden.

Despite experienced and talented backs, including Billy Bancroft, Tom Pearson and captain Arthur Gould, the weak forward play from Wales left the backs hamstrung, and the team lost 6-14.Griffiths (1987), 4:7. The next game of the Championship saw the selectors retain Biggs, but Davies was replaced by a returning Fred Parfitt. Despite playing no further part in the 1895 tournament, Davies was given another international cap the next year, again in the opening game of the tournament against England. This time Davies' half-back partner was Llanelli team mate David Morgan. The Welsh selectors often favoured less able half-back pairing which came from the same club team, giving a level of continuity to the back play. Morgan was first capped in the last game of the 1895 tournament, a home win over Ireland. Morgan was retained, while his partner Ralph Sweet-Escott was dropped to allow Davies another chance. Played away at Rectory Field in Blackheath, Wales were completely outclassed, losing 25-0. Neither Morgan or Davies were ever selected for Wales again. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 464. * 1895, 1896 Bibliography  * References Category:1873 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Rugby union scrum-halves Category:Rugby union players from Llanelli Category:Llanelli RFC players Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:British sportswriters ","title":"Ben Davies (rugby union)"},{"id":"23067079","text":"Egil Svartdahl (born 16 August 1954 in Sarpsborg) is a famous Norwegian TV- pastor.

The satellite provides broadband Internet access services across Europe and also a small area of the Middle East, and additionally the Saorsat TV service to Ireland. It is positioned at 9¬∞E, joining the Eurobird 9A Ku band satellite. KA-SAT was manufactured by EADS Astrium, based on the Eurostar E3000 platform, with a total weight of 6 tons. It was launched by Proton in December 2010. The satellite is named after the Ka band frequency, which is used on the spacecraft. Spacecraft The spacecraft is equipped with four multi-feed deployable antennas with enhanced pointing accuracy and a high- efficiency repeater. It is configured with 82 spotbeams, making it the most advanced multi-spot satellite designed in the world to date. Each spotbeam is associated with a 237 MHz wide transponder, allowing a data bit rate throughput of 475 Mbit/s per spot. The spacecraft power is about 14 kW and the payload DC power is 11 kW. The solar array power provides up to 16 kW. The payload mass is about 1000 kg, the dry mass is about 3170 kg, the launch mass was 6100 kg. The manoeuvre lifetime in orbit is estimated to 16 years.

Born in Caerleon, Sommerin baked with his grandmother on Saturdays as a child. Determined to become a chef, his father secured the 12-year-old Sommerin's first Saturday job in an Italian restaurant in the hope of dissuading his son from getting into the industry, but the job only served to convince Sommerin of his vocation. After school he undertook formal cookery training. Sommerin's first full-time job cooking was as a commis chef at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, Llangybi. Then, aged 16, he headed to the Farleyer House Hotel in Aberfeldy, Scotland, where he trained further under Richard Lyth, who gave him his under- stated French style. Returning to Wales to be closer to his family, Sommerin joined The Crown at Whitebrook, Monmouthshire in 2000 as Sous Chef. In December 2003 he became Executive Chef.

Out of the ashes of Rick & The Hayseeds the band came to be known as The Onyx Set, named after an Onyx ring owned by original band member Mike Black- Borow. After various changes in the line-up they shortened their name to The Onyx and the classic line-up was formed. The band members were: guitarist Alan Hodge, who had previously played with various local bands such as The Buccaneers and The Fabulous Jaguars, vocalist Tony Priest, bassist Dick Bland, keyboard player Steve Cotton and drummer Roger Dell. The band evolved from doing cover versions of popular contemporary Beat boom bands in its early days to Psychedelia. It was known for its intricate five part harmonies. During the late 1960s they were a popular live attraction, focusing most of their gigging activity in Bristol and South Wales, as well as touring throughout the UK and making trips to Germany. They also featured on numerous Radio One sessions, resulting in the band being one of the most played bands on BBC Radio at the time. They also featured heavily on radio stations in Europe. They released a total of seven singles, one of which was released under the pseudonym. Salamander. Oddly, it had been hoped that a change in the band's name would help distance them from their BBC Radio One work and increase record sales. Most of the A sides of the singles were written by Guy Fletcher and Doug Flett with the B sides credited to the members of the band. They are also credited as the writers on the single. \\"Climb That Tree\\", which was recorded by The She Trinity in 1970, in addition to writing \\"I'm Going Down\\" for Mike Raynor & Sky. Hodge left the band in late 1970 to get married and return to Cornwall, leaving just prior to the release of \\"Our House\\". The band continued as The Onyx with a new guitarist, Bernie Lee from Paper Blitz Tissue and Orange Bicycle, releasing one final single \\"The Next Stop Is Mine\\". Under the guidance of Jerry Lordan, the band emerge shortly afterwards as Vineyard releasing two singles on Decca and Deram. Original drummer Dell left the band to be replaced by Herman Rarebell (later of Scorpions). Vineyard recorded a number of tracks for a possible LP release, but with poor singles sales these tracks remained unreleased. The band finally called it a day in 1975. Bland went on to work with Joe Brown, Shakin' Stevens and Cliff Richard The band featured on the Bam Caruso's Rubble collection in the early 1980s, as well as numerous other compilations.

The district is required to conduct child find activities for children who may be eligible for services via Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Department of Special Education. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding.Pennsylvania Special Education Funding Annville-Cleona School District received a $815,463 supplement for special education services in 2010.Special Education Funding from Pennsylvania State_2010-2011 July2010 In 2006, the Annville-Cleona School District received a $20,000 Special Education Inclusive Practices mini-grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The grant was to be used for developing and expanding the effective instruction that encourages meaningful participation in regular education settings. Grants could be used to support the implementation of targeted instructional practices, supplementary aids and services, professional development, or related activities. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 72 student or 4.60% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy In 2009, the administration reported there was one reported incident of bullying in the district. The Annville-Cleona School Board adopted a policy which prohibits bullying by district students and the faculty. The policy defines bullying and cyberbullying. The Board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. The board expects staff members to be responsible to maintain an educational environment free from all forms of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students.Regular Session 2007-2008 House Bill 1067, Act 61 Section 6 page 8 The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.Pennsylvania Academic Standards Budget In 2009, the district reported employing over 130 teachers with a starting salary of $38,000 to $156,000 for a 190-day work year (181 days for pupil instruction).Annville- Cleona School District Report, Pa.

The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. The district administration reported that per pupil spending in 2008 was $12,076 which ranked 264th in the state's 501 school districts. In January 2009, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the administration and the school board. The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of personal wealth. =State basic education funding= For the 2010-11 budget year, the Annville-Cleona School District was allotted a 5.06% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $4,670,645. Of the six school districts in Lebanon County, Lebanon School District received the highest a 14.46% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The amount of increase each school district receives is set by the Governor and the Secretary of Education as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. In the 2009-2010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 3.04% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $4,445,822. This was the second lowest percentage point increase, in Basic Education Funding, for the school districts in Lebanon County. Two county school districts received increases of over 11% in Basic Education Funding. The state Basic Education funding to the district in 2008-09 was $4,314,764.16. Ninety school districts received a base 2% increase. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received a 22.31% increase in state basic education funding in 2009 which was the highest increase. Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010-11 the Annville-Cleona School District applied for and received $185,399 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide lower class size K-3rd grades, for tutoring before and after school, and to provide teacher training. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 203 students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007-2008 school year. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Annville-Cleona School District received $229,645 funding in 2006-07. In 2007-08 it received $250,000. In 2008-09 it did not apply for funding. The district received a total funding of $479,645. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awardsPennsylvania Auditor General CFF grants audit 12/22/08 =Federal Stimulus funding= The district received an extra $927,589 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money, in 2009-2010, to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. This money was in addition to all regular federal funding. Lebanon County ARRA FUNDING Race to the Top grant School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant. When approved for the grant, the district would have received hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Common Cents state initiative= The Annville-Cleona School Board did not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.Common Cents program - Making Every Dollar Count After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= The school board levied a real estate tax of 100.9440 mills in 2010-11.Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, Pennsylvania Department of Education. 2010 A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Act 511 Tax Report, 2004 *2009-10 - 93.4900 millsPennsylvania School District Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates_0910 *2008-09 - 88.9600 millsPennsylvania School District Real Estate Tax Rates 2008-09 Senior Tax Work Off Program The district provides an opportunity for eligible residents aged 60 or older to earn a $500 discount on their property tax bill. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.Scarcella, Frank and Pursell, Tricia, Local school tax assessments exceed state averages. The Daily Item, May 25, 2010 Property tax relief In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Annville-Cleona School District was $83 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 3,083 property owners applied for the tax relief.Tax Relief per Homestead 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report May 1, 2010 The highest tax relief provided in Lebanon County went to the Lebanon School District at $397 per homestead/farmstead. The property tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $641 per homestead and farmstead in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead 5-1-09. Report Pennsylvania Department of Education, May 2009 CUSD was given $632 in 2009. This was the second year they were the top recipient. A special investigation conducted by the Pennsylvania Auditor General found that 76% of homeowners in Lebanon County had applied for the property tax relief. Auditor General Jack Wagner: Potentially Hundreds of Thousands Of Pennsylvanians Missing Out on Property Tax Relief from Slots Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially greater than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Enrollment Annville-Cleona School District is experiencing low enrollment in K-12. The Pennsylvania Department of Education projects the district's enrollment will decline to 1200 pupils through 2018. Shifting population trends across the U.S. and Pennsylvania are affecting school enrollment and may impact the building needs of school districts in the years to come.Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. The most significant enrollment decline is projected to be in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater).\\"Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity\\", The Center for Rural Pennsylvania. October 2009. A study done by Standard and Poors in 2007 (at the request of the PA General Assembly) examined whether the consolidation of small school district's administrations would yield saving where the resulting district had approximately 3000 pupils. Superintendent were asked about savings, if their district were to merge with another district at the administrative level only, but not close any of their schools. It found 42% of survey respondents thought consolidation could achieve cost reductions. Additionally, 63% of responding superintendents believed that consolidation with another district would help provide additional academic enrichment opportunities for the students. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any schools. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007. Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by the school board policy. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

Along with the Illawarra Steelers, they became the first clubs from outside the Sydney area in over half a century to compete in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership. The Raiders have competed in every season of top-level rugby league in Australia since then and have won a total of three premierships: 1989, 1990 and 1994. Establishment In 1981, the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) decided to expand the number of teams in its Sydney-based premiership for the first time since the 1960s. This time it would venture further out into the state of New South Wales by introducing two teams from outside Sydney. The Canberra franchise was accepted as the 14th team to compete in the NSWRFL premiership for the 1982 season, beating bids from Campbelltown, Newcastle and the Central Coast. They were admitted along with the Illawarra Steelers, of Wollongong. Thus the Canberra club, being in the Australian Capital Territory, was the first team ever from an Australian state other than New South Wales to compete in the premiership. The initially unnamed team decided to adopt the name \\"Raiders\\", which was coined by the media in reference to the team being the first based outside Sydney since the old Newcastle team left the League in 1909. 1982-86 The club's first coach was former Australian international player and Easts coach, Don Furner who was coaching in the nearby town of Queanbeyan at the time. Their inaugural captain was Balmain forward, David Grant. Canberra's initial seasons were a mixed bag and they became notorious for late game collapses, leading to the nickname \\"Canberra Faders\\". In fact, no team had conceded more tries in a season than the 1982 Raiders. The club's first win, a 12-11 heartstopper v Newtown, came in its 8th match, and 3 more wins followed, most notably against then competition leaders Souths. The team earned the wooden spoon in their debut year, although this would be the last time they did so. 1983 saw a new captain, Newtown and former Kangaroos back, Allan McMahon, and nine wins, more than doubling 1982's four. However, the team continued to struggle to win away from home. Ron Giteau was handed the captaincy in 1984 and an away win first up that year foreshadowed a much improved season, a positive winning record (13-11) snagging a playoff for fifth versus Souths. But this game was lost (4-23), and the Raiders had still not succeeded in reaching the semi-finals of the competition. 1985 saw Dean Lance named captain of the club which had a regression, with the team winning only 8 games (though the reserves did reach the Grand Final). Though 1986 was similarly disappointing, the team had a core group of players, such as Mal Meninga, Gary Belcher, Steve Walters, and John Ferguson who would greatly influence the coming decade. Belcher became the first Raiders player to be selected to make his d√©but for the Australian national side in 1986.  1987-1995  This was the most successful period in the Raiders' short history, with 5 Grand Finals and 3 premierships. In 1987, Souths' Brisbane Rugby League premiership-winning coach and incumbent Queensland State of Origin coach, Wayne Bennett became Don Furner's co-coach at Canberra. Laurie Daley, Peter Jackson and Glenn Lazarus also debuted this year. The team finished third, resulting in a maiden semi-finals appearance. Despite losing their first finals match against Easts, the Raiders rallied to defeat Souths (46-12) and Easts again (32-24). The latter earned the team a place in the Grand Final, but they were never really competitive against minor premiers Manly, going down 8-18. 1988 saw the departure of the Furner-Bennett coaching partnership and a new coach in Penrith's Tim Sheens. Notable players starting out in 1988 were Bradley Clyde and Ricky Stuart. The 1988 season featured free-scoring (over 100 tries in 22 games) and a number of large victories, with the team again finishing in third place on the ladder. Unfortunately, a narrow loss against Canterbury in the Major Semi-Final was followed by defeat against Balmain and an early exit. Mal Meninga became captain of the club in 1989. With 5 rounds to play in the '89 season, Canberra were 7th and in danger of missing the semis. But a hard-fought 14‚Äì10 win over Easts started a 9-match winning streak, culminating in the club's first Premiership. In one of the all-time great Grand Finals, the Raiders sent the game into extra time after a late John Ferguson try that was converted by Meninga. Steve Jackson scored the winning try to win the premiership for the Raiders. This memorable match is now commemorated each year with the 1989 League Legends Cup. On 4 October, Canberra played British champions Widnes in the 1989 World Club Challenge at Old Trafford, Manchester. The Raiders lost 18 to 30 in front of 30,768. 1990 was a stellar year for the club at all levels. All three grades making the Grand Final, with only the reserves losing. The first grade side earned their first Minor Premiership and a second consecutive title, defeating Penrith in the decider. Trouble brewed in 1991 as the club was embroiled in salary cap hardships. On 3 April, NSWRL general manager John Quayle revealed that Canberra were in breach of their salary cap when they won the previous year's premiership. Nonetheless, a fourth Grand Final berth was secured - the team's third in a row. However, the team went down to Penrith in a repeat of the 1990 Grand Final. Jason Croker, who would go on to become the team's longest serving player, debuted this year. The fallout from the salary cap imbroglio saw several players leave the club, most prominently Glenn Lazarus, Brent Todd, David Barnhill, Nigel Gaffey and Paul Martin. An average performance resulted, with the Raiders missing the finals for the first time since 1986. David Furner, son of the Raiders' inaugural coach Don Furner, started out in 1992. The club finished 12th and failed to reach the finals. 1993 was a marked improvement, with the Raiders sitting in first place on the ladder with 2 rounds remaining when tragedy struck during their record breaking 68 - 0 victory over Parramatta at Bruce Stadium. Ricky Stuart suffered a bad leg break and the team went on to lose its next three games against Brisbane, St George and Canterbury. Having beaten all three of these teams recently in the season the Raiders were well placed to secure another Grand Final berth before the injury occurred. 1994 was the last season of the Raiders' and Australia's test captain, Mal Meninga. Canberra finished the regular season in 3rd place and successfully played their way to the grand final once again. Meninga went out in style, scoring the final try of the match as the Raiders scored their 3rd premiership in six seasons. With the retirement of Meninga, Ricky Stuart was named as captain of the club in 1995. That season they finished second, but lost in the preliminary finals. 1996-2006 Since their final premiership in 1994, the Raiders have been unable to scale their previous heights, largely due to their inability to lure representative players to the capital. The team bowed out in Round 1 of the 1996 finals series, losing to St George. The next year, the Raiders were one of several teams that joined the breakaway Super League competition. Mal Meninga made a return to the club, this time as coach. Canberra lost in the preliminary final to eventual grand- finalists, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. It was upon rejoining the newly formed National Rugby League the following year that the team began their decline. The Raiders' problems came to a head in the late 1990s, when club legends Ricky Stuart (Laurie Daley succeeded him as club captain) and Bradley Clyde were forced out in order to accommodate players such as Brett Finch. Finch would ironically leave the Raiders soon after to play under Stuart, then a coach at the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. The Raiders had mixed results in the new millennium, often finishing just inside or just outside the final eight and usually being bundled out of the finals in the early weeks. Simon Woolford became captain of the club in 2001. Matthew Elliott succeeded Mal Meninga as the Raiders' coach in 2002. In 2003, the Raiders unexpectedly led the competition for most of the season, almost clinching the minor premiership. They then lost narrowly to the Melbourne Storm in the opening finals game, but still advanced to Week 2 due to ladder position. In one of the closest games in recent history, the Raiders were eclipsed by one point in the preliminary final by the New Zealand Warriors and eliminated from the 2003 competition. Many fans believed the achievements of 2003 would be improved in the following years. However, the Raiders finished a disappointing 8th in 2004, being knocked out in week one of the finals by the Sydney Roosters. Club legends Ruben Wiki and Mark McLinden left the Raiders for other clubs in this year. Wiki's loss, in particular, was a bitter pill to swallow for many Raiders fans, as it was found that the New Zealand Warriors had significantly breached the salary cap in signing him. The 2005 side was written off by fans and critics alike, as the club's two major signings, Jason Smith and Matt Adamson, were ageing veterans considered well past their prime. However, both, particularly Smith, proved formidable campaigners, and the Raiders were joint competition leaders in Round 10. But as the season progressed, injuries took their toll and the Raiders finished second last on points differential to the Newcastle Knights. Tigers at Canberra Stadium, July 2006 The Raiders started Season 2006 heavy favourites to run last, but despite this pessimism and heavy losses to the Knights and the Roosters early on, fought back and guaranteed themselves a finals berth with a round to play. 2006 saw club stalwarts Simon Woolford, newly named captain, Clinton Schifcofske and the club's longest serving player, Jason Croker, leave the club, going to St George Illawarra, the Queensland Reds rugby union team and Super League club the Catalans Dragons respectively. Outgoing backs Schifcofske and Adam Mogg both earned representative berths with Queensland in State of Origin. Saturday 9 September 2006 saw Jason Croker, Simon Woolford, Clinton Schifcofske, Michael Hodgson, Jason Smith and Adam Mogg all play their final games for the club. The round one finals series clash with the Bulldogs saw the Raiders defeated 30‚Äì12 in slippery and muddy conditions at Telstra Stadium, and eliminated from the 2006 premiership race. This was also the final match for coach Matthew Elliott, who is coaching Penrith in 2007. His replacement is former North Queensland Cowboys' assistant coach Neil Henry. 2007‚Äì2009 In 2007, Canberra were an unknown quantity. Having lost star players such as Schifcofske, Smith, Croker and Woolford in key positions, the Raiders found themselves with a new captain in Alan Tongue relying on young, inexperienced players such as Todd Carney, William Zillman and Michael Dobson to step up and take on more prominent roles within the team. The sense of inexperience was reinforced by the selection of Neil Henry as coach, despite his lack of first-grade coaching experience. Though the Raiders were bolstered by late-season signings Neville Costigan and Matt Bickerstaff, several critics believed that the Raiders' significant loss of experience would result in their \\"winning\\" the wooden spoon. 2007 was, overall, a disappointing season for the Raiders, who finished in 14th place despite entering the top 8 midway through the season. However, two players - Phil Graham for Country Origin and Neville Costigan for Queensland - achieved representative status. The season was notable for the difference in the team's performance at and away from home, with just 2 of their 9 wins occurring outside Canberra. Coach Neil Henry incurred a fine of $10 000 for questioning the impartiality of the referee after the round 19 clash.Raiders accept $10,000 fine - leaguehq.com.au The 2008 season started with some promise for the Raiders - a good showing despite a loss in round 1 vs. Newcastle was followed up with two solid wins against Penrith and St. George-Illawarra. The club has since suffered a series of losses, whilst snaring only the occasional victory, with a big come from behind victory against Wests being noteworthy. In the representative field, Todd Carney and Joel Monaghan picked for Country Origin, and Monaghan being a shadow player for the New South Wales side. He also became the first Raider to represent Australia in eight years. However, as in recent seasons, injuries have been the curse of the Canberra club, with no less than three players suffering dreaded ACL ruptures, arguably the worst kind of injury a footballer can receive, essentially ending their season. Worse, the three players afflicted, Will Zillman, Lincoln Withers and Phil Graham are amongst the Raiders best players. Compounding this, talented back- rowers Neville Costigan and Tom Learoyd-Lahrs have spent minimal time on the field due to recurring minor injuries. The club has also suffered badly in the recruiting race, with Zillman and strong front rower Michael Weyman opting to go elsewhere next season, with indications that Costigan and Scott Logan will do the same. Additionally, half Michael Dobson left the club mid-season for the English club Hull KR, due to lack of opportunities in Canberra. Finally, Coach Neil Henry exercised a get-out clause in his contract, and opted to move to the North Queensland Cowboys in 2009. Former player and club legend, but inexperienced coach, David Furner took over the coaching reins over in 2009. To date, beyond a few talented youngsters, the club has yet to procure a single player of note for season 2009, and will once again be forced to rely on youthful talent. At Round 13, Canberra sat well outside the eight, and the season looked as though it could end with a whimper. However, far from fading away, the Raiders bounced back with a comprehensive victory over the Brisbane Broncos and then proceeded to thrash the Canterbury Bulldogs, inflicting the worst loss on the Sydney-based club in over half a century. Despite successive losses to the Cronulla Sharks and defending premiers Melbourne Storm, Canberra fought hard in both games, then broke a 13-year losing streak in Wollongong (and ended a seven-match winning streak by the home team) with a win over St. George-Illawarra. The season highlight, however, was a comprehensive 34‚Äì12 win over league leaders, the Sydney Roosters. With 7 rounds left in the 2008 premiership, Canberra sits just one point outside the top eight. With a comparatively friendly draw, playing several teams below them on the table, the Raiders are poised to sneak into the semi-finals for the first time in two years. After a comprehensive 74‚Äì12 win over the Panthers the Raiders moved into an unexpected 6th spot on the ladder from 11th to almost cement a spot in the 2008 finals series with 4 games remaining. The raiders went closer to the top eight with two important wins against Newcastle and Souths, giving them a three match winning streak with two games remaining. The season had not been without controversy, however, with star halfback Todd Carney and fullback Bronx Goodwin being stood down by the club after an altercation at a Canberra nightclub following the round 19 win against the Roosters. Carney was eventually dismissed by the club after failing to agree to the punishment plan the club had laid out for him, Goodwin's was sacked by the club however he appealed this decision and take it to the Industrial Relations Commission. However, in August 2009 he dropped the charges againest the club. On 6 September 2008, despite a heavy injury toll, the Raiders were guaranteed a place in the NRL 2008 Finals Series, a feat which was at the start of the season impossible according to Rugby League punditry in Australia. The Raiders semi-final appearance was brief, however. After being defeated by the Cronulla Sharks, the Raiders 6th-place finish was considered to be enough to get them a second chance. However, a huge upset with 8th place New Zealand defeating minor premiers Melbourne saw the Raiders eliminated. The Raiders' Toyota Cup team won 28‚Äì24 over the Broncos' team in golden point extra time to with the Toyota Cup (Under 20s) premiership in the lead-up game to the NRL Grand Final on 5 October 2008Raiders snatch golden point premiership, Canberra Raiders, 5 October 2008 The Canberra Raiders lost founding father Les McIntyre in the 2009 pre-season on 22 February leading to the disruption of a pre-season camp and his name being embroidered on the club jerseys for the rest of the season 2009 season. A slow start to the 2009 season saw the raiders lose to the tigers and the roosters. However, with the help from under 20's debutants Josh Dugan, Jarrad Croker and Travis Waddell they won their next two matches. Despite a disappointing season for the raiders, losing to many close games, the Raiders beat the Melbourne Storm for the first time in 14 games and 7 years, 26‚Äì16, in round 16 to keep their slim finals hopes alive. In 2009 the Raiders handed the Brisbane Broncos club the heaviest defeat in their history with a 56‚Äì0 win at Canberra Stadium, the largest winning margin of the season. The Raiders also had a win over the number-one team at the time St George- Illawarra Dragons, by 24‚Äì12. Despite wins against three of the top four (St George Illawarra Dragons, Gold Coast Titans and the Melbourne Storm) and coming within three points of the other (Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs) losses to bottom placed teams Cronulla Sharks and Sydney Roosters at home saw the raiders finish in 13th. 2010s The 2010 season began traditionally poorly for Canberra with a loss to Penrith in the opening round however against early-season expectations that the Raiders would again struggle the club posted early season wins over Brisbane in round two, Parramatta in round five and the New Zealand Warriors in round eight in New Zealand in what was the club's first win in New Zealand since the early 2000s. However, losses to Todd Carney's new club the Roosters in round six and a narrow loss at home to South Sydney in round seven saw the club sitting second from last after round seven (last had the Melbourne Storm not been stripped of competition points due to salary cap breaches) of the 2010 season. Wins over the ladder-leading Dragons and the Gold Coast Titans followed until a four-game losing streak ensued; with the club sitting third from last after a round 17 home loss to the Roosters in what was Todd Carney's return to the nation's capital. The Raiders then began a run similar to that of Parramatta last year; winning eight of their next nine regular season matches to sneak into the top eight by season's end. The regular season's highest home attendance came when 20,445 fans filled Canberra Stadium to see the Raiders defeat the ladder-leading Dragons 32-16 for the second time in the season. Canberra advanced to the finals on the back of eight wins from their past nine and were drawn a tough away final against the second-placed Penrith Panthers whom the Raiders had beaten just five weeks earlier. The Raiders led from the start and despite lapses at times during the match the Raiders managed to sniff out a narrow 24‚Äì22 win, thus achieving its first final win in a decade, which ironically was also against the Panthers. This saw the Raiders draw a home final against the Wests Tigers in round two of the finals. Having lost to the Tigers twice during the regular season, it was hoped that a record crowd of 26,746 would inspire the Raiders to continue their fairytale run deep into the finals, however a missed penalty attempt by Jarrod Croker in the final minutes of the match saw Canberra lose by 26-24 and therefore draw a curtain on the Raiders' 2010 season. The Raiders off season didn't start well, with Joel Monaghan being sacked by the club for inappropriate behaviour with a teammate's dog. This appeared to be a team building exercise, as photos surfaced showing the rest of the team cheering him on. Canberra, looking to build on their strong finish to the 2010 season in 2011, bolstered its already strong roster with the addition of Blake Ferguson, Brett White and former Dally M medalist Matt Orford. The latter signing was an important one for the Raiders as vice-captain and star playmaker Terry Campese is out indefinitely due to a knee injury suffered in the semi-final loss to Wests at the end of the 2010 season. After starting the season with a 40-16 thumping of the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in round one, the Raiders have since lost their last eight matches in succession, and were sitting at the bottom of the ladder by round nine. Their fortunes started to turn when they caused the boilover of the 2011 season, upsetting the Melbourne Storm in Melbourne by 20‚Äì12. This was Canberra's first win in the Victorian capital since 2000. This was tempered by being held scoreless for the first time at home in their history by Melbourne in round 19, losing 26‚Äì0. One other unlikely win to the Raiders against a 7th place Bulldogs at home 20-12 has kept the momentum building as the Raiders look to turn their season around. Canberra finished the 2012 NRL season in 6th position on the table and qualified for the finals. The club defeated the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the qualifying final but were eliminated the following week by South Sydney in the semi final. The Canberra Raiders 2013 campaign began with two demoralising defeats to Penrith Panthers and Gold Coast Titans, only managing to score 10 points in the two games while conceding 68. Another early blow to the Raiders at the start of the 2013 season was the irresponsible behaviour of up and coming superstar Josh Dugan whom was sacked from the club for disciplinary reasons after he and teammate Blake Ferguson missed a team recovery session in favour of spending the day drinking on the rooftop of Blake Fergusons home. The Raiders then managed to win 5 of the next 7 games including upsets to the undefeated Melbourne Storm away from home and premiership favourites Sydney Roosters, winning all games played at Canberra Stadium for the first 12 rounds of the premiership season. In 2014, Canberra hired Ricky Stuart as their new head coach. He had large success with the team. Star player, Anthony Milford, agreed to sign with rival team, Brisbane, disappointing Canberra fans. Canberra would finish the 2014 NRL season in 15th place, narrowly avoiding the wooden spoon. In 2015, Canberra finished 10th off the back of well below average defence. In 2016, Canberra finished 2nd, for just the 3rd time in their history. They made the finals for the first time since 2012, Jarrod Croker broke the club point scoring record, they scored the most points for any Raiders team in a single season and they made a preliminary final for the first time since 1997. They eventually lost in the preliminary final 14‚Äì12 to the Melbourne Storm at AAMI Park. In 2017, Canberra finished in 10th position with 11 wins and 13 losses. In the 2018 NRL season, Canberra finished in 10th place on the table and missed out on the finals for the second consecutive season. The year was typified by the fact that the club could not hold onto a lead in many games throughout the season with the club losing games against Brisbane and Penrith despite being between 14 and 18 points ahead in both matches.https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/panthers-overrun-raiders-yet- again-20180804-p4zvip.htmlhttps://www.thechronicle.com.au/news/better-luck- next-year-best-and-worst-of-nrl-alsora/3511253/ The 2019 NRL season saw one of the best starts by the club since the 90's when they got off to a 5‚Äì1 record after the first 6 rounds. At the completion of round 21, Canberra sat in 3rd place with a record of 13 wins and 7 losses which is an almost identical position on the ladder and win/loss record they had at the same stage of the 2016 season. 2019 saw the introduction and flying start to their careers for new fullback Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad and the club's 4th English recruit John Bateman both of whom have been revelations for the club and vying for 'signing of the year'. The Raiders qualified for the 2019 NRL Grand Final, defeating Minor Premiers Melbourne Storm and 3rd placed South Sydney Rabbitohs in the process.

New Jersey: Princeton University Press: 10 Along its route the stream separated into two branches, with the name 'Sawkill' reserved for the southern arm of the creek. The name for the smaller, northern stream is undocumented, but is recorded by the Randel Map (1870) as entering the East River at 79th Street.  Early history  Undoubtedly, the stream received its name from the saw mill that existed for some time \\"in the bed of 74th Street, about 250 ft east of Avenue A.\\" The workers of the saw mill are thought to have been primarily the slaves of the Dutch West India Company, whose lodgings, stationed at the mouth of the Sawkill until at least 1639, were referenced as \\"the quarter of the blacks, the [West India] company's slaves\\" in the first landmark map of Manhattan Island, the Manatus Map of 1639. It is thought that the slaves would use the stream to float the logs hewn by the mill to the East River, from which they would be transported to the newly established fort at New Amsterdam, at the southern tip of Manhattan Island, or thence to the Netherlands. The creek originated at the present day site of the American Museum of Natural History. The creek ran through the park site, south of Seneca Village, originally exiting the park under Fifth Avenue near 74th Street, where Conservatory Water lies today, before emptying in the East River. (Egbert Viele's 1856 survey forms the \\"Pre-Park Site, 1857\\" map) To create the Lake the outlet was dammed with a broad, curving earth dam, which carries the East Carriage Drive past the Kerbs Boathouse (1954), at the end of the Lake's eastern arm, so subtly that few visitors are aware of the landform's function.  Arch Brook  Although local historian Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes regarded the Sawkill a, \\"the well known Saw-kill, which played an important part in the early days of Manhattan\\" by 1677, when the land was transferred from the Dutch West India Company to Abraham Shotwell, the stream was known commonly as \\"ye run of water, formerly called ye saw mill creeke.\\" Eventually the saw mill was replaced by a leather mill and the Sawkill was dammed and arched over in the early-mid 19th century, creating a much smaller stream called Arch Brook. It seems that the bridge traversing the Sawkill, however, remained a popular \\"Kissing Bridge\\" (first noted as such in 1806) throughout the 19th century.  Central Park  While even Arch Brook has long since disappeared, the waters of the Sawkill are still present in Central Park. Park planners used the remnants of the Saw-kill's source waters to create the picturesque Lake situated in the middle of the Park between 71st and 78th streets. The upper portion of the Saw-kill within the Park was also utilized to connect the two bays of Ladies Pond, a small ice skating pond west of the Lake that was reserved for women's private use.Propriety deemed it improper for women to bare their ankles in front of men in the 19th century. The creation of Ladies Pond allowed women to participate in ice skating without the risk of men seeing their ankles as they changed their shoes. () Until 1930, when Ladies Pond was filled in to serve as a pedestrian path, the Sawkill remained an active watercourse. One of the rustic bridges built as part of the park still spans the former site of the Ladies Pond. In 2000, it was dedicated the \\"Triplets Bridge\\", after Benjamin, Rachel and Justin Chasalow. The Balcony Bridge also crosses over the former pond to the east.

Formed in 2003 by Canadian entrepreneur Timothy Kimber, PlaSmart launched its first product, the PlasmaCar, to the North American market. The company has since grown to 14 employees and over 90 sales contractors, with products available worldwide in more than 60 countries. History In December 2002, Timothy Kimber met Bin Chen, who was in business importing relatively inexpensive products from China to sell at retail in an Ottawa-area mall. One product Chen sold was an unusual ride-on toy that was not powered by batteries or foot pedals, but by moving the steering wheel back and forth. After learning that the product was not selling well in North America, Kimber negotiated the rights to distribute and market the product himself under the name PlasmaCar. At the beginning of 2003, Kimber founded PlaSmart and displayed the PlasmaCar at the Canadian Toy and Hobby Show, a trade fair for toy retailers. Kimber has said that while PlaSmart was pressured to immediately enter the American toy market, the company made a deliberate decision to spend the first two years learning about the Canadian toy industry. In 2005, PlaSmart attended the New York Toy Fair and expanded distribution into the United States. PlasmaCar received positive reviews in major U.S. publications, including New York Magazine, TIME Magazine, and Wired. In 2006, PlaSmart moved into an Ottawa office and warehouse unit and expanded sales into Germany, its first international market. PlaSmart announced the opening of a permanent showroom in Kowloon, Hong Kong in June 2010, as a result of growing international demand for its products. As U.S. sales continued to expand in April 2012, PlaSmart closed its Ottawa warehouse and currently ships products destined for North American markets from its warehouses in Pennsylvania and California. Since the release of the PlasmaCar, PlaSmart has expanded its offerings to include a range of battery-free toys that meet its ‚Äòsmart and simple‚Äô philosophy. In 2008, PlaSmart was listed as Canada's 13th fastest-growing company in Canada on ProfitGUIDE‚Äôs Profit 100 rankings, and in 2010 it reached the position of 8th fastest. PlaSmart was listed as the 7th fastest growing company in Ottawa by the Ottawa Business Journal. Products *PlasmaCar - A ride-on toy without batteries, gears, or pedals.

The Pri√© Attack Pri√© gave his name to an opening, the Pri√© Attack (ECO D00, Closed Game) : 1.d4 d5 2.a3 (diagram). He explained that this move prevents Black from playing the useful move Bb4 and, in some variations, prepares the b2-b4 pawn advance. The latter idea is akin to playing a Slav Defense, Chebanenko Variation (also called Chameleon Variation), with reversed colors. Other move orders transpose into this system, e.g. 1.d4 e6 2.a3 d5. This opening addresses the problem of excessive theoretical preparation among high-level chess players by playing a sane but unusual system, which forces Black to think from the start of the game instead of reciting moves learnt by heart. Pri√© reached that goal by successfully playing his opening against amateurs, but also against titled players. =Notable Game= The following game was played by √âric Pri√© against British GM Glenn Flear in 2005, in Lattes. 1.d4 d5 2.a3 Nf6 3.Nf3 Nbd7 4.Bf4 g6 5.h3 Bg7 6.e3 0‚Äì0 7.Nbd2 b6 8.c3 Bb7 9.Qb3 Ne4 10.Rd1 Nxd2 11.Rxd2 e5 12.dxe5 Qe7 13.Be2 Nxe5 14.Nxe5 Bxe5 15.Bxe5 Qxe5 16.0‚Äì0 Rfd8 17.Rfd1 Rd6 18.Bf3 Rad8 19.Qa4 a5 20.c4 c6 21.cxd5 cxd5 Black now has an isolated central pawn, but he cannot use the c and e columns.

The song includes references to the team's roster and events from the 1980s. It was released in 1983 and charted 47th on RPM's singles list. It was written by Jack Lenz and Tony Kosinec and is performed by Keith Hampshire and \\"The Bat Boys\\". The song was remixed by Rob Wells and Chris Anderson in 2003. By 1986, the single had sold over 50,000 copies and was certified gold. In a pre-game ceremony in 1986, Jimy Williams accepted a gold record from a recording industry representative before a game against the Milwaukee Brewers. The Blue Jays song was conceptualized by Alan Smith, Creative Director at JWT Direct. He wrote most of the lyrics together with copywriter Pat Arbour, although the first verse was written entirely by recording artist Tony Kosinec of the Lenz/Kosinec jingle house, which was hired to write the music and produce the song under Smith and Arbour's direction. The project was approved and supported by Blue Jays executive Paul Beeston. Lenz stated that Beeston \\"wanted the song to be fun, but not to promise too much because the team was OK\\". The original version of the song was about two and a half minutes long, but the version played during the seventh-inning stretch is 58 seconds long. During its play, the Blue Jays JForce cheerleaders lead fans in simple stretching activities, such as clapping and fist-pumping. When the song was first introduced in 1983, a group from Fitness Ontario would lead fans in calisthenics exercises. The lyrics state: The song refers to eight teams; in order, they are the Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Texas Rangers, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, and Oakland Athletics. The original version referred to the Milwaukee Brewers instead of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Two individuals are mentioned by their given name only. The first is Dave Stieb, about whom the song states: The lyrics were later changed to \\"Jays throw down a smoker\\". The second individual mentioned is \\"Billy\\", referring to Billy Martin, who had been the manager of the Oakland Athletics in 1982 and had his third stint as manager of the New York Yankees in 1983. The refrain of the song is: The song ends with the sound of a bat swung by Willie Upshaw striking a pitched baseball.

It was announced on Nintendo's press site on June 2, 2009, during E3 2009. The game requires the use of the Wii MotionPlus peripheral. Nintendo introduced the Wii Remote Plus, a variation of the Wii Remote with features of the MotionPlus, which is bundled with the game. It was released in November 2010 in North America, Europe, and Japan. The game borrows heavily from the paddleball concept and consists of players using the Wii Remote to hit the character, Zip, towards obstacles and collectable items. Plot The game is set on the fictional Suthon Island. It is said to hold the power to protect the world from harm, which was protected by a large palm tree and watched over by the nature spirits in the island. Before the game, the antagonist, Omminus, takes over the island in order to rule the world. As a result, the palm tree begins to wither and the princess becomes ill. The leader of the nature spirits recalls an old legend about a hero using sacred pearls to restore the peace. He finds the treasure chest where the hero, Zip, resides. Zip, and a friend from the neighboring Eesturn Island, Pip, set out to retrieve the pearls and defeat Omminus. Gameplay =Worlds and stages= The game consists of eight worlds, each of which consists of three levels. In each level, the screen will scroll constantly in one direction. The direction depends on the stage and Wii Remote Hand. Players must collect a pearl to complete the level. To collect a pearl, players will need to find three medals. Medals are hidden within each stage, and are sometimes carried by enemies that the player must hit. If the player falls back to the edge of the screen for too long, he/she will get eaten by Hydracoil, and will lose a life. If the player loses all of his/her lives, the game is over. If the players collects a pearl in all three levels, a boss stage is unlocked in each world. The world is cleared after the player beats the boss. =Mini-games= If the player gets an A ranking in all three stages of a specific world, a mini-game option will appear on the world's selection screen. Each mini-game shows instructions on how to play it. If playing with a friend, players will see a gold icon for a competitive game and a blue icon for cooperative play. Reception FlingSmash received mixed reviews. It has a Metacritic score of 48 out of 100.

The battle took place near the village of Matrand in Eidskog and at Skotterud. It was the bloodiest battle of the entire war, in which the Swedes lost more than 340 men, of which 270 were captured; the Norwegians lost around 50 men with 90 wounded and 36 captured. Background After the defeat at Lier the Swedish army retreated first to Malmer and from there back to Matrand, where the rest of the army was stationed. At Matrand they took care of the wounded and it is said that they used the local church there as a field hospital. At Matrand, Major General Carl Pontus Gahn (1759‚Äì1825) would let the troops rest and resupply themselves with new ammunition, before they again should attempt an offensive towards Kongsvinger Fortress in Hedmark. But on 4 August, Gahn received a message that Norwegian reinforcements were sent from H√∏land to Kongsvinger in order to reinforce the Norwegian positions. Gahn therefore decided to withdraw back across the border to Sweden instead of attempting an offensive. =Norwegian Plan= From Norwegian farmers who visited the Swedish camp at Matrand, Lt. Colonel Andreas Samuel Krebs (1766- 1818) had received reliable information about the Swedish plans. When he got the message that Gahn intended to march his troops back across the border, he decided to strike against the Swedish in the early morning of August the 5th. =Norwegian forces= *Trondheim Regiment (1,200 men) *Odal's company (260 men) *Sol√∏r's company (220 men) *Nes's company (260 men) *Vinger's company (260 men) *Elverum, Sol√∏r and √Ömot's skiers (750 men) *Eidsvoll's company (260 men) *Artillery (190 men; 6 guns) *Mounted j√§gers (22 men) *Sharpshooters (400 men) Reserve: *Akershus's grenadiers (650 men) Total: 3,822 men (not including the reserve) =Swedish forces= *V√§sterbotten Regiment; 3 infantry and 1 j√§ger battalion *V√§rmland Regiment; 1 infantry battalion *6 guns Total: 1,200 men The Battle On 4 August, Krebs started his march against the Swedish forces at Matrand. The troops marched together to √Öbogen in Hedmark where Captain Dons, with about 1,000 men, was sent to Pramhus, from where he could attack the enemy from behind at Skotterud. Lt. Colonel Krebs with his remaining troops continued to Malmer, where he sent off 250 men to Skinpungrud to attack the enemy flanks. The rest of his troops continued on to Matrand, but it was a weak force of only about 700-800 men. The Norwegian and Swedish vanguards met quickly close to Matrand, and the Swedes were forced to retreat back to stronger defensive positions. There, the Swedish vanguard also got reinforced, and they managed to keep the Norwegian troops back for about an hour. Gahn used this opportunity to try to speed up the withdrawal and get the Swedish troops safely back behind the border, but they were eventually quickly pushed back towards the rest of the brigade, which had taken positions on both sides of the road, east of the river at Matrand. After being reinforced by the column that had passed by Skinpungrud, Krebs' forces continued their advance under heavy fire. Krebs did, at this time, not know if Dons and his troops were in position at Skotterud, and for this reason he would not continue to move forward against the enemy. But after a while the Norwegians had grouped themselves so that they were about to encircle the Swedish defenders, and Gahn therefore decided to withdraw to Skotterud with one battalion and two cannons to keep the escape route open. While all this was going on, Captain Dons and his troops were on the march towards Skotterud. When they heard musket fire coming from Matrand, they were concerned that they would not arrive in time to take part in the battle and the last few kilometers they ran. Many of Dons' soldiers could not keep up and thus did not participate in the early stages of the attack on the withdrawing Swedes. When Dons' troops reached the main road at Ilag, which the Swedes used for their withdrawal, some Swedish supply troops were about to pass. Many of their horses were killed by the Norwegians so that the road was blocked for those who followed. Dons had intended to create a roadblock by Ilag to prevent the Swedish withdrawal, but arrived too late for this. The Swedish forces were now under attack from two sides and were also about to run out of ammunition. Gahn saw that they would be captured unless they managed to break through Norwegian lines. With only their bayonets, the third battalion of the V√§sterbotten Regiment managed to penetrate the Norwegian lines, after several attacks, which allowed the Swedish force to retreat back to Sweden. The Norwegians had lost 50 men killed, 60 wounded and 36 prisoners, most of which were captured as the Swedes broke out. The Swedes had 60 men killed and about 258 captured and or wounded. An additional 30 men, all wounded, made it back to the Swedish army at a later stage. The battle had been very intense, and both sides were praised afterwards; the Swedes in particular were surprised by the Norwegian fighting spirit. The successful Swedish outbreak, from an otherwise hopeless situation, was foremost thanks due to the V√§sterbotten Regiment and the Swedish commander, Carl Pontus Gahn, who remained calm ‚Äì despite being encircled by overwhelming numbers of enemies. This was not the first time Gahn had faced such difficulties; his entire Dala Battalion was forced to surrender in a similar situation, in 1808, in the Battle of Trangen.Philstr√∂m & Westerlund (1911), pp. 182‚Äì190 Aftermath Monumental of Andreas Samuel Krebs Lt. Colonel Krebs was hailed as a hero and promoted for the victory at Matrand as well as the prior Battle of Lier (Slaget p√• Lier). His victories were the only ones in an otherwise despondently led campaign. It obtained for the Norwegian envoys a valuable starting point for the negotiations leading to the Convention of Moss. The terms of that cease-fire required Norway to enter into a personal union with Sweden, while Sweden agreed to recognize the Constitution of Norway as an independent state, adopted by the Norwegian Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll on 17 May 1814.

The film was entered into the 1981 Cannes Film Festival and served as the inspiration for the 1994 Broadway musical Passion by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. Plot In Turin in the winter of 1862, the unmarried Giorgio Bacchetti, a good-looking cavalry captain with a distinguished combat record, is involved in a passionate affair with Clara, a sweet and beautiful married woman. Their meetings end when he is transferred to an isolated outpost on the frontier. The officers there eat and socialise in the house of their colonel, who has given a home to a handicapped cousin of his. This is a young woman named Fosca, suffering not only from a range of physical and psychological problems but also strikingly ugly. Yet she is also sensitive and cultured, and desperate for sympathetic male company. Encouraged by the regimental surgeon, who thinks contact with the new arrival may help, Giorgio spends time with her. While she thrives on what to her is a conquest, Giorgio is dragged down by the emotional strain of her demands on him and falls ill.The surgeon realises that his plan was a mistake and that the only solution is to get Giorgio a transfer. The transfer notice is delivered during the Christmas party in the colonel's house. Fosca goes into massive hysterics, to the horror of the guests who had no idea of the existence and depth of her passion. The colonel, considering his honour impugned by this relationship, which Giorgio entered into out of kindness and pity, challenges Giorgio to a duel next morning. That night, knowing it may be his last and desperately sorry for Fosca, he goes to her bedroom and they consummate their strange love. In the duel, he wounds the colonel but himself collapses under the nervous strain. Fosca dies of shock, and Giorgio is invalided out of the army with no prospects.

Founded during file sharing service Napster's legal troubles, Streamwaves was the first company to license major label masters for a subscription service, and the first company to launch a subscription service with major label content in 2002. In 2005 Streamwaves became part of the Rhapsody Music Service owned by Real Networks. History In 1999, CEO Jeff Tribble began work on a legal alternative to illegal file sharing services such as Napster and Kazaa. The final product was a web-based streaming service that did not require users to download any software to play music or save playlists. In November, 2000, EMI became the first major label to license a portion of its music catalog to Streamwaves. The next major label was Universal Music Group, which signed a licensing agreement with Streamwaves in June, 2002. In September 2002, Warner Music Group became the third major label to license content to Streamwaves. Streamwaves now offered over 150,000 digital songs and albums in its collection. Subsequent deals with other labels, including Sony Music Entertainment, Harry Fox Agency, BMI and others brought the size of Streamwaves' library to over 450,000 songs and albums. In 2004 the Streamwaves service was merged with the Rhapsody music service. Compatibility Being a browser-based service, Streamwaves did not have most of the compatibility problems other services encountered. The Streamwaves jukebox worked on Windows and Macintosh computers alike. The company lured Macintosh users and members of Mac user communities through discounts on the monthly subscription fee. Marketing Streamwaves marketed its service online and through traditional brick and mortar stores such as FYE and CompUSA stores, among others. Hewlett- Packard offered 30-day trials to users of its myhpclub.com and mypresarioclub.com websites. In 2003, Streamwaves took to the task of converting Kazaa users to paying, legal customers. Partnering with Altnet, Streamwaves offered searchers on KaZaA free 30-second samples of songs for which they were searching and directed them to sign up for the full-featured service. Also in 2003, Streamwaves partnered with Excite to provide a co- branded online streaming music store to Excite customers. CD3 Storage Systems, Inc. partnered with Streamwaves to offer free music on all of its Discgear products for the 2004 holiday season.

The game was released in Japan on October 1, 2009 and other regions in the same month. Wii Fit Plus was announced during Nintendo's E3 2009 media briefing on June 2, 2009. The game is an enhanced version of Wii Fit, with 15 new balance and aerobics games (referred to as \\"Training Plus\\") and six new strength training and yoga activities. New features include a calorie burning counter, the ability for users to create custom fitness regimens or choose from a number of specialized routines based on specific objectives and available time, and the option to create profiles for pets and babies. Users are also able to navigate more quickly between exercises. Wii Fit Plus is sold bundled with a Wii Balance Board, as well as separately for existing Wii Balance Board owners. Most activities are for a single player, but there are a number of multi-player activities that allow up to 8 players to take turns using one Wii Balance Board. Wii Fit Plus garnered both critical and commercial success. The game has received aggregate review scores of 80.83% and 80% on GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Wii Fit Plus is the seventh best-selling game on the Wii, with a total of 21.13 million copies sold as of September 2018. Gameplay Wii Fit Plus provides all of the original activities in Wii Fit, fifteen additional balance/aerobics games (in a separate category called \\"Training Plus\\"), and six yoga and strength- training exercises unique to the game. *Yoga **Spine Extension **Gate **Grounded V *Strength Training **Balance Bridge **Single-Leg Reach **Side Lunge *Training Plus Games marked ‚Ä† are remakes of games from the original Wii Fit **Perfect 10 **Island Cycling **Rhythm Kung-Fu **Driving Range **Segway Circuit **Bird's-Eye Bulls-Eye **Snowball Fight **Obstacle Course **Tilt City **Rhythm Parade **Big Top Juggling **Skateboard Arena **Table Tilt Plus ‚Ä† **Balance Bubble Plus ‚Ä† **Basic Run Plus ‚Ä† Development Following the commercial success of Wii Fit, producer Shigeru Miyamoto decided to produce a follow-up. Miyamoto learned during Wii Fit Plus development that many Wii Fit owners had stopped playing the game, believing the primary reason to be inconvenience. A new menu interface, My Wii Fit Plus, was implemented to address this issue and make accessing activities quicker and easier. The interface was recreated and adjusted multiple times during development. In designing new minigames for Wii Fit Plus, Miyamoto wanted to create activities that played upon the Stroop effect, requiring coordination of both the player's mind and body; minigames in which the player uses both the Wii Remote and the Wii Balance Board at the same time became a major focus. Reception Wii Fit Plus generally received positive reviews from critics. GameRankings reports an aggregate score of 80.83% based on 18 reviews, and Metacritic reports a score of 80% based on 33 reviews. IGN gave Wii Fit Plus a score of 8.2. GameSpot gave it a 7.5 out of 10. 1UP gave it an A-, stating, \\"There's still some tightening up to be done, but Wii Fit Plus is a definite improvement in the format.\\" Within one month of its release, Wii Fit Plus sold 2.16 million copies worldwide, and by September 2018 had sold 21.13 million units worldwide. In May 2010 the American Heart Association (AHA) endorsed the Wii to encourage sedentary people to take the first step toward fitness. The AHA heart icon covers the console itself along with two of its more active games, Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports Resort.

It is based on a stage production of William Shakespeare's play Othello, directed by Trevor Nunn, and later rethought for TV and filmed in a studio. It was shot in a black box theater, so minimal props or scenery were needed, and aired 23 June 1990 on Theatre Night. Cast *Ian McKellen as Iago *Willard White as Othello *Imogen Stubbs as Desdemona *Zo√´ Wanamaker as Emilia *Michael Grandage as Roderigo *Clive Swift as Brabantio / Gratiano *John Burgess as Duke of Venice / Lodovico *Marsha Hunt as Bianca Production Trevor Nunn directed the film himself based on his 1989 production for the Royal Shakespeare Company. The sets, costumes, and props are from the American Civil War, but the dialogue remains tied to Venice and Cyprus. In contrast with Antony and Cleopatra (1974) and Macbeth (1979), Nunn preferred \\"contemplative\\" medium shots over extreme closeups. The film makes little attempt to hide that it is a filmed stage production, and Brooke thinks this is because Nunn's state purpose was to preserve the stage production for posterity. The film presents almost the complete text of the play, leaving out just one scene with Cassio and the clown. Reception The previous film adaptation of a Nunn stage production for the Royal Shakespeare Company of a Shakespeare play, Macbeth (1979), was \\"widely regarded as one of the finest screen Shakespeares ever\\", so expectations for this adaptation were \\"sky-high\\". Michael Brooke, writing for BFI Screenonline, thinks the expectations were \\"‚Ä¶ generally met by a production that holds a very distinguished place amongst filmed Othellos, and is arguably its most successful television translation.\\" He particularly calls out \\"the beautifully achieved chemistry between the four leads\\" as among its strongest features.

The false positive rate is calculated as the ratio between the number of negative events wrongly categorized as positive (false positives) and the total number of actual negative events (regardless of classification). The false positive rate (or \\"false alarm rate\\") usually refers to the expectancy of the false positive ratio.  Definition  The false positive rate is \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{FP}}{N}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{FP}}{\\\\mathrm{FP} + \\\\mathrm{TN}} where \\\\mathrm{FP} is the number of false positives, \\\\mathrm{TN} is the number of true negatives and N=\\\\mathrm{FP}+\\\\mathrm{TN} is the total number of negatives. The level of significance that is used to test each hypothesis is set based on the form of inference (simultaneous inference vs. selective inference) and its supporting criteria (for example FWER or FDR), that were pre-determined by the researcher. When performing multiple comparisons in a statistical framework such as above, the false positive ratio (also known as the false alarm ratio, as opposed to false positive rate / false alarm rate ) usually refers to the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis for a particular test. Using the terminology suggested here, it is simply V/m_0. Since V is a random variable and m_0 is a constant ( V \\\\leq m_0 ), the false positive ratio is also a random variable, ranging between 0-1. The false positive rate (or \\"false alarm rate\\") usually refers to the expectancy of the false positive ratio, expressed by E(V/m_0). It is worth noticing that the two definitions (\\"false positive ratio\\" / \\"false positive rate\\") are somewhat interchangeable. For example, in the referenced article V/m_0 serves as the false positive \\"rate\\" rather than as its \\"ratio\\". = Classification of multiple hypothesis tests =  Difference from \\"type I error rate\\" and other close terms  While the false positive rate is mathematically equal to the type I error rate, it is viewed as a separate term for the following reasons: * The type I error rate is often associated with the a-priori setting of the significance level by the researcher: the significance level represents an acceptable error rate considering that all null hypotheses are true (the \\"global null\\" hypothesis). the choice of a significance level may thus be somewhat arbitrary (i.e. setting 10% (0.1), 5% (0.05), 1% (0.01) etc.) : As opposed to that, the false positive rate is associated with a post-prior result, which is the expected number of false positives divided by the total number of hypotheses under the real combination of true and non-true null hypotheses (disregarding the \\"global null\\" hypothesis). Since the false positive rate is a parameter that is not controlled by the researcher, it cannot be identified with the significance level. * Moreover, false positive rate is usually used regarding a medical test or diagnostic device (i.e. \\"the false positive rate of a certain diagnostic device is 1%\\"), while type I error is a term associated with statistical tests, where the meaning of the word \\"positive\\" is not as clear (i.e. \\"the type I error of a test is 1%\\"). The false positive rate should also not be confused with the familywise error rate, which is defined as \\\\mathrm{FWER} = \\\\Pr(V \\\\ge 1)\\\\,. As the number of tests grows, the familywise error rate usually converges to 1 while the false positive rate remains fixed. Lastly, it is important to note the profound difference between the false positive rate and the false discovery rate: while the first is defined as E(V/m_0), the second is defined as E(V/R).

In 2005, Swarup's first novel, Q&A;, was published and was later turned into an Oscar Award-winning film, Slumdog Millionaire in 2008.  Plot  Seven years ago, Vivek \\"Vicky\\" Rai, the playboy son of the Home Minister of Uttar Pradesh, murdered bartender Ruby Gill at a trendy restaurant in New Delhi, simply because she refused to serve him a drink. The opening murder committed by Vicky Rai is similar to the Jessica Lal murder case in which the killer was Manu Sharma. Now Vicky Rai has been killed at the party he was throwing to celebrate his acquittal. The police recover six guests with guns in their possession: a corrupt bureaucrat who claims to have become Mahatma Gandhi; an American tourist infatuated with an Indian actress; a member of an ancient tribe on a quest to recover a sacred stone; a Bollywood sex symbol with a guilty secret; a mobile-phone thief who dreams big; and an ambitious politician prepared to stoop low.

The school accepts pupils from all over the Central Bedfordshire area. Oak Bank was established in 1976 as school for 'maladjusted children', and originally had capacity for 40 boarding pupils and 20 day pupils. The school had been commissioned by Luton County Borough, specifically for children from Luton, however Bedfordshire County Council took over responsibility for completing the school after the Local Government Act 1972, and the school accepted children from all over the county of Bedfordshire from its opening. Central Bedfordshire Council took over responsibility for the school after the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. In November 2013 the school converted to academy status. Today Oak Bank is a day school for pupils who have statements of special educational need associated with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties. When pupils join the school they have frequently had fractured experiences of education, and so their attainment on entry is well below average.

Nearby places include Altura, Elba, Plainview, St. Charles, Weaver, and Whitewater State Park. The Whitewater River and Beaver Creek both flow through the area. History Beaver was settled in 1854, by people from New England. It was the first community established in the Whitewater valley. The name came from observing beavers building dams on the creek that travels through the site to join with the Whitewater River. Following the example of the beavers, the early settlers decided to dam the creek to furnish power for a mill. The community was platted in 1856 by Albert Hopson, Dr. Sheldon Brooks, and William J. Duley, as 20 blocks on .Minnesota Place Names . Minnesota Historical Society. Accessed June 2, 2009. Beaver had a post office from 1857 to 1906. At one time, the community also had a flour mill, hardware store, general store, Methodist church, blacksmith, wagon shop, saloon (maybe two), hotel, school, and cheese factory. However, the farming practices up the hillsides encouraged erosion, and the high hills produced frequent flooding. At first rich soil came down the hillsides when rains came. Then sand from the underlying sandstone was washed down year after year covering everything. Some years because of the flooding the farmers had to plant three times. The flood deposits devastated the area, and today, most of the site is overgrown and much is swampy. In 1932, the state purchased most of the land, buildings were torn down and the Beaver area became a nature reserve.Jostad, Karen.

Eleanor Putnam, age 89 in 2009, a former resident of Beaver during her childhood in the 1920s and 1930s, recalled climbing the hills around Beaver, and how her family farmed the rugged land. She recalled her uncle struggling to climb the hills to farm the top of a plateau, which can be seen in aerial photos.

Due in large measure to the seminal work of Stephen Mitchell, the term \\"relational psychoanalysis\\" grew and began to accrue to itself many other influences and developments.Mitchell, S.

Relational psychoanalysis has become the dominant form of American contemporary psychoanalysis. Aron's contributions to the field include: * the development and expansion of relational theory and practice. * a comprehensive examination of the patient's experience of the analyst's subjectivity. * a view of psychoanalysis that emphasizes mutual regulation and mutual recognition, even within the context of a certain necessary asymmetry of roles and responsibilities. * studies on the ethics of psychoanalysis and particularly the ethics of writing about patients. * examination of controversies in psychoanalytic education and psychoanalytic institutions. * explorations of psychoanalysis, religion, and spirituality. * systematic exploration of the historically defined distinction between psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. * the development of a \\"progressive psychoanalysis\\" for the twenty-first century.

It offers a line of protein- enhanced powders, shakes, and bars has broken into the mainstream market with a ready-to-drink form of protein supplement Muscle Milk, a non-dairy beverage which is trans-fat- and lactose-free, contains no high fructose corn syrup and is shelf stable. Muscle Milk mainly markets on taste by using familiar milkshake flavors such as banana, milk chocolate and vanilla to drive consumers to the product, along with multiple drink sizes and formats, including powders and being sold in convenience stores alongside regular energy drinks and sports drinks. In Canada, the product is branded as Muscle Mlk, a modification required in Canada to avoid confusion with milk. History CytoSport was founded in 1998 by the father/son team of Greg and Mike Pickett. It produces its powder products and pre-blends of ready-to-drink products at a manufacturing facility. Its products are endorsed by running back Adrian Peterson and by college swimming coach Mike Bottom. TSG Consumer Partners has financed Cytosport. The company reportedly earned US$200 million in 2008, and received the Small Company of the Year Award at the 16th annual Beverage Forum presented by Beverage World magazine and Beverage Marketing Corporation. Hormel announced it was acquiring CytoSport for $450 million in 2014. In February 2019, Hormel announced it was selling the CytoSport business to PepsiCo, Inc. for a purchase price of $465 million. The transaction included the Muscle Milk and Evolve sports nutrition brands and was completed in April 2019. Controversy A June 2010 investigation by Consumer Reports, a US consumer advocacy magazine, found that two of Cytosport's Muscle Milk products contained levels of heavy metals near or exceeding levels proposed by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). Muscle Milk's Chocolate powder had four heavy metals ‚Äî cadmium, lead, arsenic, and mercury ‚Äî and three of these metals were found to be at the highest levels of all the health drinks tested. Average cadmium levels of 5.6 ¬µg in three daily servings exceeded the USP limit of 5 ¬µg per day, and the average lead level of 13.5 ¬µg also topped the USP limit of 10 ¬µg per day. The average arsenic level of 12.2 ¬µg was near the USP limit of 15 ¬µg per day. Muscle Milk's Vanilla Cr√®me powder had 12.2 ¬µg of lead in three daily servings, exceeding the lead limits, and 11.2 ¬µg of arsenic. In response, CytoSport said, \\"Importantly, the tests underscored the fact that Muscle Milk Chocolate liquid shakes, by far and away our company's most popular consumer form of Muscle Milk, did not exceed the proposed maximum levels of any heavy metals tested, even when used three times per day.\\" CytoSport's founder, Greg Pickett, also indicated that NSF International released a conclusion that its own test results 'do not reflect the concentrations stated in the Consumer Reports article.'\\" In turn, Consumer Reports provided their rebuttal, defending their statements. On June 8, 2009, it was reported that The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus (BBB) was referring advertising claims made by CytoSport Beverage Co. for its Muscle Milk product to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Food and Drug Administration for review. Under its National Advertising Review Council terms, NAD had asked Cytosport to substantiate certain claims following a challenge to its advertising filed by Nestle USA. Nestle said the marketing of Muscle Milk was false and misleading, alleging consumers would be misled into thinking it is a supplemented milk product instead of a dietary supplement. CytoSport said its product claims are truthful and non-misleading, and that the product name is a non-deceptive registered trademark; it declined to participate in the NAD review, stating the review was unnecessary and inappropriate. On May 6, 2009, in Sacramento, California, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction requiring Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VPX) to immediately remove Muscle Power from the marketplace, after concluding that the product infringes on CytoSport's trademark rights of Muscle Milk. This was prompted after CytoSport filed a lawsuit against VPX, stating that Muscle Power's packaging, or \\"trade dress\\", was deceptively similar to Muscle Milk's packaging. The court held that \\"VPX has chosen an identical font, in an identical color, on an identically shaped package, and placed the mark on the package in an identical location.\\" Muscle Milk Pickett Racing Muscle Milk Pickett Racings HPD ARX-03a at the 2012 Petit Le Mans Muscle Milk owner and founder, Greg Pickett, has also been involved in a championship winning North American sports car racing team. Founded in 2007, Pickett's team has competed in the American Le Mans Series the 24 Hours of Le Mans and Tudor United SportsCar Championship. The team's successes include overall and class victories as well as the 2012 and 2013 American Le Mans Series LMP1 Drivers' and Teams' Championship. The team officially closed operations on May 16th, 2014 with Greg Pickett focusing his attention back on the expansion of his Muscle Milk brand.

It was established in 1952 at O'Hare as the 4706th Defense Wing in a general reorganization of Air Defense Command (ADC), which replaced wings responsible for a base with wings responsible for a geographical area. It assumed control of several Fighter Interceptor squadrons that had been assigned to the 142d Fighter-Interceptor Wing, an Air National Guard wing mobilized for the Korean War and the 56th Fighter-Interceptor Group. In early 1953 it also was assigned six radar squadrons in the Midwest and its dispersed fighter squadrons combined with colocated air base squadrons into air defense groups. The wing was redesignated as an air defense wing in 1954. It was discontinued in 1956 and most of its units transferred to the 58th Air Division. History The 4706th Defense Wing was organized at the beginning of 1952 at O'Hare IAP in a major reorganization of ADC responding to ADC's difficulty under the existing wing base organizational structure in deploying fighter squadrons to best advantage.Grant, C.L., The Development of Continental Air Defense to 1 September 1954, (1961), USAF Historical Study No. 126, p. 33 The wing assumed the operational squadrons and air defense mission of the inactivating 142d Fighter-Interceptor Wing (FIW), an Oregon Air National Guard (ANG) wing, which had been federalized and moved to O'Hare in 1951 in the expansion of the USAF for the Korean War.see (move of 142d Fighter-Interceptor Group) The wing also received the regular USAF 62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (FIS). flying F-86 Sabre aircraft, at O'Hare from the inactivating 56th Fighter-Interceptor Group at Selfridge AFB, Michigan and the 97th FIS at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, which had been attached to the 142nd FIW.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 119 The wing also assumed command of ANG units stationed elsewhere in this reorganization, the 113th FIS, flying F-51H Mustangs, at Scott AFB, Illinois,Cornett & Johnson, p. 122 and the 166th FIS, at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, flying F-84 Thunderjet aircraft.Cornett & Johnson, p. 123 Thus, the wing's fighter squadrons defended Illinois, Indiana, southern Wisconsin, western Michigan and western Ohio. Air Base Squadrons were also activated and assigned to the wing to provide support for USAF units stationed at bases where ADC was the host command. As ADC realigned during the year. the 113th FIS was reassigned directly to Central Air Defense Force. Then in July, the 63d FIS, another F-86 squadronCornett & Johnson, p. 117 at Oscoda AFB, Michigan transferred into the wing,Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 242 and in August, the 166th FIS, moved to Youngstown Municipal Airport, Ohio and was reassigned to the 4708th Defense Wing. In February 1953 another ADC reorganization activated Air Defense Groups at ADC bases with dispersed fighter squadrons. These groups assumed direct command of the fighter squadrons at their stations, in addition to support squadrons to assist in their role as USAF host organizations at the bases. The 501st Air Defense Group (Air Def Gp), activated at O'Hare IAP, the 520th Air Defense Group, at Truax Field and the 534th Air Defense Group at Kinross AFB (later Kincheloe AFB), Michigan.Cornett & Johnson, pp. 81‚Äì83 Although the 527th Air Defense Group, activated at Oscoda AFB, it was assigned to another wing. Another result of the February 1953 reorganization was that the wing assumed the aircraft detection, control and warning mission, with six squadrons in four states being assigned to the wing.Cornett & Johnson, p. 158Cornett & Johnson, p. 159Cornett & Johnson, p. 168 In 1955, ADC implemented Project Arrow, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units that had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.Buss, Lydus H.(ed), Sturm, Thomas A., Volan, Denys, and McMullen, Richard F., History of Continental Air Defense Command and Air Defense Command July to December 1955, Directorate of Historical Services, Air Defense Command, Ent AFB, CO, (1956), p. 6 As a result of Project Arrow, the 501st Air Def Gp was replaced by the 56th Fighter Group (Air Defense), the 520th Air Def Gp was replaced by the 327th Fighter Group (Air Defense), and the 534th Air Def Gp was replaced by the 507th Fighter Group (Air Defense).Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 209, 370 Because Project Arrow called for fighter squadrons to be assigned to their traditional group headquarters, the 97th FIS was moved to Delaware and its personnel and equipment reassigned to the 56th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 227, 323 In early October, the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, flying F-94 Starfire aircraftCornett & Johnson, p. 125 was assigned to the wing in anticipation of its return to the United States as the Korean war was ending.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 391 The 56th FIS and 319th FIS and three of the radar squadrons transferred from the wing to the 58th Air Division in March 1956 The wing was discontinued a few months later and its units assigned to other ADC organizations. =Lineage= * Designated as the 4706th Defense Wing and organized on 1 February 1952 : Redesignated as 4706th Air Defense Wing on 1 September 1954 : Discontinued on 8 July 1956 =Assignments= * Western Air Defense Force, 1 February 1952 * 30th Air Division, 16 February 1953 * 37th Air Division, 1 March 1956 ‚Äì 8 July 1956 =Stations= * O'Hare International Airport, Illinois, 1 February 1952 ‚Äì 8 July 1956 =Components= Groups Air Defense Groups * 501st Air Defense Group, 16 February 1953 ‚Äì 18 August 1955 * 520th Air Defense Group : Truax Field, Wisconsin, 16 February 1953 ‚Äì 18 August 1955 * 534th Air Defense Group : Kinross AFB, Michigan, 16 February 1953 ‚Äì 18 August 1955 Fighter Groups * 56th Fighter Group (Air Defense), 18 August 1955 ‚Äì 8 July 1956 AFHRA Factsheet, 56th Operations Group .

The school accepts pupils from all over the Central Bedfordshire area, and was opened in September 2010 on the site of Sunnyside School. History Sunnyside School and Hitchmead School were two separate schools for children with different levels of special educational needs. In June 2009, Central Bedfordshire Council launched a consultation on the future of special education provision in the district. The consultation included a proposal to merge the two schools. This was due to Sunnyside School having more pupils attending than the school buildings were designed for, while Hitchmead School had a falling roll call, which has fallen from 87 pupils to 51 in the previous five years. In December 2009, Central Bedfordshire Council confirmed that a new combined special school would open on the current site of Sunnyside School in September 2010, with most pupils from Sunnyside and Hitchmead Schools transferring to the new school. The school today The new school formally opened in September 2010 with the name of Ivel Valley School. Various modifications were made to the school site to accommodate the new range of pupils, while the old Hitchmead School site is still used for some educational activities by the school's pupils. The school is currently for pupils between the ages of 3 and 19 years of age, whose special educational needs fall predominantly within the categories of Severe or Moderate Learning Difficulties. Some pupils may have additional medical, physical or sensory impairments or emotional and behavioural difficulties. All pupils attending the school will have an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP). Following a reorganisation of the school, and additional classrooms being installed, in summer 2018 most pupils between 3 and 16 are now based on the Hitchmead Road site (the School site) and those between 16 and 19 are based at The Baulk (the College site). Some pupils are based in satellite classes at Biggleswade Academy.

The organization states that its goals are to: \\"identify the best and brightest early career scientists in cancer research, accelerate the translation of scientific discoveries into new diagnostic tools and treatments, and to enable risk-taking on bold new ideas\\". The organization was founded in 1946 by media personality Walter Winchell in New York City, New York, under the name Damon Runyon Cancer Memorial Fund in memory of his colleague and friend Damon Runyon, a newspaperman and author. History Almost immediately after Runyon's passing on December 10, 1946, Winchell went on the air and asked his audience for contributions to cancer research. > \\"Mr. and Mrs. United States! A very dear friend of mine a great > newspaperman, a great writer, and a very great guy Damon Runyon, was killed > this week by America's Number Two killer Cancer.

All > of your money will go directly to the cancer fighters, in Damon Runyon's > name. There will be no expenses of any kind deducted.\\" The organization gained more visibility in 1949 when Milton Berle, a long-time friend of both Runyon and Winchell, hosted the first-ever telethon, raising $1.1 million for the foundation over 16 hours. In its first three decades, the foundation was a popular cause among celebrities from Hollywood to Broadway and the sports world. Marlene Dietrich, Bob Hope, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and many of their contemporaries served as supporters and board members. Award programs and research The organization manages six award programs \\"aimed at encouraging and advancing the work of early career cancer researchers with high promise\\". The Fellowship Award is the oldest and most widely known in the scientific community, giving postdoctoral researchers between $200,000 and $250,000 over four years. Other programs include the Damon Runyon-Sohn Pediatric Cancer Fellowship Award, the Damon Runyon Clinical Investigator Award and the Damon Runyon-Rachleff Innovation Award. The foundation launched in 2020 the Damon Runyon Quantitative Biology Fellowship to bridge quantitative approaches to cancer research. https://www.damonrunyon.org/news/entries/5551/Damon%20Runyon%20Cancer%20Research%20Foundation%20awards%20new%20Quantitative%20Biology%20Fellowships The foundation has funded twelve Nobel Prize laureates, including Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi, Salvador E.

Dual enrollment The high school offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system.

Special education In December 2010, Antietam School District administration reported that 194 pupils or 18.4% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 47% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 209 pupils or 19.5% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Antietam School District received a $495,797 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012-13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 28 or 2.64% of its students were gifted in 2010. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy The Antietam School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the district in 2009.Pennsylvania Safe Schools Online Reports The Antietam School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.

Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 Antietam School District reported spending $11,852 per pupil in 2008. This ranked 290th among PA school districts.

In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that Pennsylvania spent $8,191 per pupil in school year 2000-01. Students who live in the Antietam School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Antietam School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Antietam District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $8,853.96, High School - $10,111.35. Antietam School District is funded by a combination of: a local income tax 0.5%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the income level. In a 2007 referendum vote, the residents rejected raising the local earned income tax to 1% in exchange for lowering local property taxes by an estimated $365. =State basic education funding= For the 2013-14 school year, the Hamburg Area School District received a 2.4% increase or $3,125,205 in Pennsylvania Basic Education Funding.

The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 392 students received free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 For the 2010‚Äì11 school year, the state gave a 2% increase in basic education funding to the Antietam School District for $3,353,643. The highest increase in BEF allotted to schools in Berks County went to Muhlenberg School District at 8.17%. In the Commonwealth, the highest increase in state funding went to Kennett Consolidated School District which received a 23.65% increase. Among the 500 Pennsylvania public school district, 150 received the base 2% increase in 2010. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even when enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. For the 2009‚Äì10 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided an 8.88% increase in Basic Education Funding to Antietam School District, for a total of $3,287,886. Nine Berks County school districts received increases of less than 6% in Basic Education Funding in 2009‚Äì10. Neighboring Muhlenberg School District received a 22.31% increase in state BEF. Reading School District received a 13.29% increase. In Pennsylvania, 15 school districts received Basic Education Funding increases in excess of 10% in 2009. Ninety Pennsylvania school districts received a base increase of 2% including two districts in Berks County. The state's Basic Education Funding to the Antietam School District in 2008‚Äì09 was $3,019,653. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the budget proposal made in February each year. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Pennsylvania spent $7,824 Per Pupil in the year 2000. This amount increased up to $12,085 by the year 2008.U.S. Census Bureau., Annual Survey of Local Government Finances., 2000U.S. Census Bureau., 2008 Survey of Local Government Finances ‚Äì School Systems, 2010 In 2008 the district reported that 341 students participated in the federal free and reduced-price lunch program due to low family income.Pennsylvania Department of Education Report on Basic Education Funding October 2009 Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004‚Äì2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010‚Äì11 the Antietam School District applied for and received $153,473 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide extensive teacher training and to provide full-day kindergarten for the 6th year. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006‚Äì2009. Antietam School District did not apply for funding in 2006‚Äì07 nor in 2007‚Äì08. In 2008‚Äì09, Antietam School District received $74,691. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awards Other grants Antietam School District did not participate in: PA DEP Environmental Education grants, Science Its Elementary grants, Education Assistance Grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, nor the 21st Century learning grants. =Federal Stimulus funding= The district received an extra $486,880 in ARRA ‚Äì Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Antietam School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant. When approved for the grant, the district will receive hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Common Cents state initiative= The Antietam School Board did not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= The Antietam School Board set property tax rates in 2013‚Äì14 at 34.5600 mills. This was the highest tax increase permitted without going to voter referendum. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2012-13 - 33.7500 mills *2011-12 - 32.9600 mills. *2010-11 - 32.3500 mills. *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 31.6000 mills. *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 31.6000 mills. *2007-08 - 30.8000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 29.2500 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 28.0600 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 The average yearly property tax paid by Berks County residents amounts to about 4.66% of their yearly income. Berks County is ranked 112th of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax- rates.org., County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect on or before 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, Antietam School Board apply for three exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: teacher pension costs, special education costs and maintenance of selected revenue sources. Each year, Antietam School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Antietam School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2009‚Äì10 nor in 2010‚Äì11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, property tax relief for Antietam School District was set at $227 for 2,019 approved properties. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Antietam School District was $228 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2,008 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Pennsylvania the highest 2010 property tax relief was for Chester Upland School District of Delaware County which was given $632 per homestead. This was the second year Chester Upland School District got the highest amount. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Berks County, 65% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). SMILE program The district offers resident senior citizens the opportunity to exchange volunteer hours for a tax credit. The program is open to residents who are 62 years of age or older and pay residential property taxes. Participants may volunteer for up to 100 hours of service in exchange for $500 reduction in next year's school property taxes per residence. Extracurriculars Antietam School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and interscholastic athletics. Eligibility for participation is set by school board policy and the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association and PIAA regulations. Antietam School District and Exeter Township School District operate a cooperative sports agreement for 11 sports for both boys and girls, including football, wrestling, swimming and diving and cross country. Costs are significant. The program started in 1985‚Äì1986 school year. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. =Sports= The District funds: ;Boys: *Baseball - A *Basketball- A *Bowling - AAAA *Cross country (with ETSD) *Football (with MSD) *Golf - AA *Indoor Track and Field (with ETSD) *Lacrosse - (with ETSD) *Soccer JV/V - A *Swimming and Diving - (with ETSD) *Track and Field (with ETSD) *Volleyball - AA *Wrestling - (with ETSD) ;Girls: *Basketball - A *Bowling - AAAA *Cross country (with ETSD) *Field Hockey (with ETSD) *Golf - AA *Indoor Track and Field (with ETSD) *Lacrosse - (with ETSD) *Soccer (Fall) - A *Softball - A *Swimming and Diving - (with ETSD) *Girls' Tennis - AA *Track and Field (with ETSD) *Volleyball JV/V - A Middle School Sports: ;Boys: *Baseball *Basketball *Soccer ;Girls: *Basketball *Field Hockey *Soccer (Fall) *Softball According to PIAA directory July 2012 References Category:School districts in Berks County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Antietam School District"},{"id":"23068653","text":"Mollard may refer to : * Didier Mollard (born 1969), a French ski jumper who competed from 1986 to 1997 * Jean Mollard, a French engineer who invented with Jacques-Yves Cousteau the SP-350 Denise \\"Diving saucer\\" * Philibert Mollard (1801‚Äì1873), a French general * Tikhon Mollard (born 1966) is an Eastern Orthodox bishop and the Primate of the Orthodox Church in America, holding the rank of Metropolitan of All America and Canada ; Places : * Palais Mollard- Clary, a baroque palace in Vienna, Austria * Col du Mollard, a high mountain pass in the Alps ; Other uses: *Mollard (grape), another name for the red wine grape Carignan  See also * Molard (disambiguation) ","title":"Mollard"},{"id":"23068658","text":"Fort Dodge Stampede is a 1951 western film produced and directed by Harry Keller and starring Allan Lane.

When construed narrowly, eutrapelia is associated with an emotion in the same manner modesty and righteousness are associated with emotion, while it is not tied to any particular emotion when construed in wider terms, and is classified with truthfulness, friendliness, and dignity in the category of mean-dispositions that cannot be called pathetikai mesotetes. For a while, eutrapelia mostly came to signify jokes that were obscene and coarse. The word appears only once in the New Testament, in Ephesians 5:4, where it is translated as, \\"coarse jesting\\", in the NIV. The influential Medieval philosopher, Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), viewed eutrapelia in a positive light, again, favoring the ancient Aristotelian notion that it is constituted by mental relaxation and honorable fun. In Summa Theologica, Aquinas made it the virtue of moderation in relation to jesting. By the second half of thirteenth century, the concept was considered a state of judicious pleasure and returned to being considered a virtue by commentators.

In 1973 the store was closed and became home to Big Biba, which closed in 1975. The site was developed into smaller stores and offices. Origins In 1853 Joseph Toms opened a small drapery shop on Kensington High Street. In 1862 Joseph Toms joined forces with his brother-in-law, Charles Derry, to set up Derry & Toms. By 1870 the business had grown to incorporate seven of the surrounding stores, with one of the buildings being used as a mourning department. The company prided itself as being the supplier of goods to the upper class of Kensington. History In 1920 John Barker & Co., the department store next door, acquired Derry & Toms. The firm already owned Pontings, which was adjacent to Derry & Toms on the other side. In 1919 Derry & Toms employed the services of poster artist F Gregory Brown to produce advertising. His advert The Daintiest of Legwear at Derry & Toms sold for ¬£6,240 at Bonhams in 2007. In 1930, building work was started and the new, seven-storey building on Kensington High Street opened in 1933. The building was designed by Bernard George in an Art Deco style popular at the time, and featured metalwork by Walter Gilbert and panel reliefs, entitled Labour & Technology, by Charles Henry Mabey Jnr. The building is most famous for its Roof Gardens, which opened in 1938 and still exist today. The garden was designed by landscape architect Ralph Hancock after the Managing Director of Barkers, Trevor Bowen, visited Rockefeller Center in New York. The main restaurant, situated on the fifth floor, was called \\"The Rainbow Room\\" and became a venue for thousands of \\"Dinner & Dances\\" (banquets), for both private firms and government departments. In 1957 John Barker & Co was bought by House of Fraser, bringing Derry & Toms under their stewardship. The store was sold in 1971 to Biba. Derry & Toms continued to operate until 1973, when it finally closed. It was replaced in 1974 by Big Biba, which itself closed in 1975. Developer British Land developed the site into offices and shops. The location is now used by Marks & Spencer, H&M;, and Gap, and as offices for Sony Music UK and Warner Music Group. In 2012, the American luxury fitness chain Equinox opened its first UK location on the fifth floor. Since 1978 the roof garden has been listed as Grade II, and since 1981 the building has been a Grade II* listed building.

In a career that lasted from 1967 to 1970, he won eleven races from across the country, including the Arkansas Derby, Hawthorne Gold Cup (twice) and the Santa Anita, Brooklyn and Metropolitan Handicaps. He was twice voted American Champion Older Male Horse by the Thoroughbred Racing Association. After retirement to stud, he became the leading sire in North America of 1981 and was also a notable broodmare sire. Background Nodouble was a chestnut stallion, bred in Arkansas by oilman Gene Goff‚Äôs Verna Lea Farms. He was out of the mare Abla-Jay, who won eight races from 68 career starts and was bought by Goff in 1963 as a broodmare for $3,200, Her sire Double Jay was the 1946 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt and a four-time Leading broodmare sire in North America. Nodouble's Australian-bred sire, Noholme, was the 1959 Australian Horse of the Year who took nearly a full second off the race record in winning the prestigious Cox Plate Noholme was purchased in July 1960 by Goff and brought to the United States where he raced until being retired to stud.. Nodouble was trained by Bert Sonnier. Racing career At age two, Nodouble was competitive in stakes races for his age group but did not record a significant win. As a three-year-old, he began to blossom into a consistently good runner. Nodouble had not been nominated for the 1968 U.S. Triple Crown series, but after he won the Arkansas Derby owner Goff paid a supplementary fee to enter the colt in the second leg, the Preakness Stakes. Nodouble finished third behind winner Forward Pass and went on that year to win the first of two straight editions of the Hawthorne Gold Cup Handicap and to defeat the great Damascus in the Michigan Mile And One-Eighth Handicap. Racing at ages four and five, Nodouble was named American Champion Older Male Horse by the Thoroughbred Racing Association in both years. The rival Daily Racing Form award went to Arts and Letters in 1969 and Fort Marcy in 1970. His major win in 1969 was the richest race in California, the Santa Anita Handicap after earlier winning the Strub Stakes but being disqualified to second place. Traveling to the east coast, he won the Brooklyn Handicap and repeated in the Hawthorne Handicap. In addition, he ran second to Arts and Letters in the 1969 Woodward Stakes, Jockey Club Gold Cup and Metropolitan Handicap. In 1970, he started his campaign in California, where he won the San Pasqual Handicap in a track record time of 1:40 for miles. Travelling back to New York, he won his final start: the prestigious Metropolitan Handicap while setting a new track record of 1:34 for the mile. Stud record At the end of October 1970, Gene Goff retired Nodouble. In 1971, he began his first year at stud in California. After initially being unsuccessful both there and in Kentucky, Nodouble was moved to Florida to stand.

It is the fourteenth entry in the main Final Fantasy series and the second MMORPG in the series after Final Fantasy XI. Set in the fantasy realm of Eorzea, players take control of a customized avatar as they explore the land and are caught up in both an invasion by the hostile Garlean Empire and the threat of the Primals, the deities of the land's Beastmen tribes. Eventually, they are embroiled in a plot by a Garlean Legatus to destroy the Primals by bringing one of the planet's moons down on Eorzea. The game had been in development since 2005 under the codename \\"Rapture\\", and was announced in 2009 for Windows and the PlayStation 3 video game console. It ran on Square Enix's Crystal Tools middleware engine, which was adjusted to suit the game's specifications. During development, the team carried over multiple aesthetic elements from Final Fantasy XI while attempting to create something that stood on its own. Due to several factors, the development was beset by problems that would later have drastic effects on the game. Attempts to bring the game to Xbox 360 consoles fell through due to disagreements with Microsoft about the use of Xbox Live. After its alpha test and a delayed beta test, the game went live on , remaining active until its servers were closed on . At launch, the game was met with a negative response: while the graphics and music were praised, other aspects were unanimously panned, including the gameplay, interface, and the general impression of the game being unfinished. Critic and fan backlash caused Square Enix to suspend subscription fees, indefinitely postpone the PlayStation 3 version, and replace the development team leadership, with Naoki Yoshida as producer and director. Yoshida decided to make marginal improvements before shutting down the servers in November 11, 2012, and replacing the game with a new version initially subtitled A Realm Reborn. Gameplay Final Fantasy XIV is a massively multiplayer online role- playing game (MMORPG) in which the player controls a customized Adventurer avatar from one of the five playable races. Each race has two tribes, and all but two allow for the selection of male or female characters. The avatar can have their eye and hair color, facial features, and skin tone customized, and features such as birthmarks and scars can be added. Their chosen tribe, along with their chosen patron deity, affect their stats and elemental attributes. The game's opening varies depending on which starting location is chosen. Two different types of quests are available for players: story quests, which are unlocked as characters accumulate experience points (EXP) and raise their experience level while unlocking new abilities; and Levequests (leves), side quests accessed through the Adventurers' Guilds. Leves are broken down into multiple types, focusing on gathering or combat. Levequests are associated with particular non-playable characters (NPCs). As the player completes leves, they gain favor with three different factions and unlock new abilities, with rewards only coming from the NPCs within the factions who issued the quest. Gaining favor also unlocks a new type of level called Faction leves, which deplete a character's favor when completed. Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based gameplay is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so that players can go for longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a manual input while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), and the number of abilities available to them. Under the Armory System, a character's equipped weapon or crafting tool determines the player's character class, allowing them to switch roles at will. Some classes are associated with a particular starting point. Classes are divided into four disciplines: Disciples of War, masters of physical combat; Disciples of Magic, practitioners of the magical arts; Disciples of the Hand, crafters and handymen who synthesize and repair items; and Disciples of the Land, gatherers who collect resources from the environment. Certain abilities learned under one class may be equipped and used by other classes. The Job System (a post-launch addition) builds upon the Armoury System for Disciples of War and Magic. In exchange for restricting the range of equippable abilities from other classes, players gain access to powerful skills, magic, weapons, and armor exclusive to the Job corresponding to that class. These Jobs, based on classic Final Fantasy character jobs, are more suited to party- based combat. Synopsis =Setting and characters= Final Fantasy XIV takes place in a high fantasy setting. The main location is Eorzea, a continent on the larger planet Hydaelyn: this contrasts Final Fantasy XI which uses one name to refer to the entire world and its regions. Eorzea is broken up among three main powers: the forest nation of Gridania; the desert-based Ul'dah sultanate; and the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa, Eorzea's dominant maritime power. Other important locations include the scholarly city-state of Sharlayan and the Garlean Empire, a hostile northern power with highly developed technology. Five years prior to the start of the game, the Garlean Empire invaded the land of Ala Mhigo, but were prevented from conquering Eorzea by the attacks of the ancient dragon Midgardsomr and his dragon hordes. In response to the Empire's threat, the three nations of Eorzea reform the Grand Companies, comprehensive centers of command which combine the cities' military and economic assets. The Grand Companies attracted people from all walks of life, who take up the mantle of Adventurers. The player character is a customizable Adventurer avatar taken from the five main races of Eorzea. The playable races are the human-like , the elf-like , the physically-imposing , the diminutive , and the feline . Playable Roegadyn and Miqo'te are gender- locked to male and female respectively. Aside from these races are the Beastmen, tribes who worship ancient gods called the Primals, which require aether-rich crystals and whose presence damages the planet. =Plot= Beginning in one of Eorzea's three main states, the player character awakes to the Echo, a power granting them the ability to see the past. The Adventurers are initially involved in both conflicts within the nations provoked by the Garlean presence, led by the Garlean Legatus Gaius Van Baelsar, and the Beastmen's attempts to hoard crystals and summon their Primals. Eventually, a greater threat is brought to the attention of the nations by the Sharlayan scholar Louisoix Leveilleur: another Garlean Legatus named Nael Van Darnus is using arcane magic and technology to summon Dalamud, the planet's second moon, down on Eorzea to purge the Beastmen and Primals whom the Garleans hate as violent pagans. With the aid of Garlean defector Cid nan Garlond, the Adventurers discover that Nael has set up a beacon for summoning Dalamud in the new fortress of Castrum Novum. While each nation makes individual attempts to storm the fortress, they are repelled. Faced with this, their leaders form a pact and unite the nations under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance. Now united, the nations, aided by Adventurers, successfully storm Castrum Novum and destroy the beacon. Nael, insanely committed to his plan, makes himself into a second beacon. Though he is defeated by the Adventurers, Dalamud has descended too far for it to return into orbit, so Louisoix proposes a final desperate plan: to summon the Twelve, Eorzea's guardian deities, and return Dalamud into orbit. The Adventurers pray to altars dedicated to the Twelve across the land, then rally with the armies of the Eorzean Alliance to fight Nael's legion on the Carteneau Flats, the predicted impact site of Dalamud. In the midst of the battle, Dalamud disintegrates and reveals itself to have been a prison for the Elder Primal Bahamut. Enraged after its imprisonment, Bahamut begins laying waste to Eorzea. After the attempt to summon the Twelve fails, Louisoix uses the last of his power to send the Adventurers into a time rift, separating them from the flow of time so they can return when Eorzea has recovered. Development Hiromichi Tanaka, the original producer of Final Fantasy XIV, in 2007. Planning for Final Fantasy XIV began in 2005, four years prior to its official announcement. At the time, it was codenamed . While it had been decided within the company that MMORPGs would be mainline entries rather than spin-offs, the team was worried that the final product would be too radical for the main numbered series. The main staff included multiple developers who had worked on previous entries in the Final Fantasy series: producer Hiromichi Tanaka had acted as the original producer for Final Fantasy XI and been involved in multiple early Final Fantasy games, director Nobuaki Komoto was a director for XI and had been among the staff of Final Fantasy IX, writer Yeako Sato had been the main scenario writer for XI, and Akihiko Yoshida had previously also been art director for Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII. The game's logo and some other artwork was designed by Yoshitaka Amano. The game's story, primarily written by Sato, was based around a central narrative complemented by side-stories. The setting and gameplay were decided upon before Sato was brought on board, with the result that she needed to consult the rest of the team when she wished to use one of Eorzea's main locations in a certain way. The story's main conflict was to be among the five main races of Eorzea and the Beastmen, with the Garlean Empire acting as a third force. The placement of the Garlean Empire to the northeast of Eorzea was not meant to simulate a real-world location, but naturally ended up there as the map of Hydaelyn was being created. The game's logo, designed by Amano, was designed around the importance of weapons and the concept of a wheel: the \\"wheel\\" in question was a wheel of adventurers, arranged so their backs were exposed and they needed to rely on their comrades and friends for support. For his work as art director, Yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to creating artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded. While the game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic, it was meant to be realistic and encourage exploration. At the beginning of development, the team created a detailed profile of Hydaelyn, including its relation with other planets, ecosystems, climate, and geography. This was done to promote a sense of realism. Alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players, careful work was put into the topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive. After the environment was created, the architectural, cultural and religious elements of the world were incorporated into the environment. City and machine designs mixed metallic and natural materials to create a combined sense of wonder and familiarity for players. The game's five playable races were directly based on the five initial races from Final Fantasy XI, with design adjustments to reflect the new setting. The developers also created two different tribes, as opposed to the single tribe set-up present in XI. Characters' movements were primarily developed using motion capture, though the recorded movements were then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive. Much work was invested in creating emotes, character movements chosen by the player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in XI. To create realistic expressions, a character artist manually adjusted the faces for each expression. For the monsters, advances in hardware enabled the team to create more realistic and detailed character models, including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles. The game's cutscenes were first drafted using a storyboard, then when the sequence of events had been finalized, motion capture was used to create the scene in a digitized format. Lighting and environmental effects were then put in place. One of the most challenging sequences to create was the opening real-time cutscene for the Limsa Lominsa story route: the giant sea serpent's fins were each individually animated. The game's opening cinematic was produced by Visual Works, Square Enix's in-house CGI development company. All the in-game models were first created in high- resolution form using a 3D sculpturing program, then readjusted so they could appear in the game with a lower polygon count but equivalent graphical quality. Another large part of creating the characters was their accessories: to help with this, the team developed a multi-layered development system. A technique dubbed \\"polygon shaving\\" was used so two sets of equipment could be designed to look different while using the same model data. Another function dubbed \\"reshaping\\" was used to adjust the shapes of equipment and accessories. The third element, dubbed \\"SSD-file\\", enabled the adjustment of the \\"materials\\" equipment was made off, so its color and texture could be changed. Rather than relying on a single design image, which would have been impractical for the hardware, the team took basic art and used Photoshop to add subtle changes to each. It was then passed down to the modeling team, who used the same sculpting process as was used for the game's monsters to create high-detail models while keeping the polygon count low. The game's engine was Crystal Tools, a specially-created middleware engine that was also used in Final Fantasy XIII. So that it would be compatible with the game's specifications, the team customized the engine to suit their needs. In the end, the game's chosen engine proved unsuitable to the needs of the game, rendering its internal structure \\"broken\\". The game's development ended up being beset with multiple problems. According to a later postmortem, the team developing the game had an unhealthy obsession of graphical quality over gameplay content that led to other parts of the game being neglected, reinforced by the company's then-outdated development methods. A cited example of the focus on graphics was a flowerpot, which had as many polygons and lines of shader code as a player character. This high graphical quality meant that compromises needed to be made; for example, the number of players present on- screen at any one time needed to be limited to twenty, undermining the large- scale communal appeal of MMORPGs. This issue also impacted the game's environments; to save on memory space while preserving seamless travel, the team needed to reuse environmental features and textures on a regular basis. Another problem was that the team lacked experience in developing MMORPGs, a problem that had also beset Final Fantasy XI, but had been successfully overcome. With this in mind, the team were still using the development mindset used during the sixth console generation, which could not hold up under the increased staff and resource needs for seventh generation development. A third major reason was the company's belief that the game's problems could be patched after the initial launch, compounded by the lack of an overall plan for how to deal with them. =Music= The music for Final Fantasy XIV was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, a regular contributor to the music of the Final Fantasy series. Originally contracted to create the ending theme for XIII, Uematsu accepted the request by the XIV team to work on the game, leaving XIIIs theme song to be composed by Masashi Hamauzu. Having only contributed a few tunes to Final Fantasy XI, XIV was Uematsu's first full-time work on an MMORPG. Despite this, he treated as any other project, and had considerable creative freedom as the team's vision for the game had not been finalized. For the battle themes, he used a mix of orchestral and rock pieces. He worked on XIV at the same time as working on The Last Story, a video game from original Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. During the time XIV was active after the initial release, other composers including Masayoshi Soken, Naoshi Mizuta, Tsuyoshi Sekito and Ryo Yamazaki contributed to the score. Soken acted as the game's sound director, and would take over as the main composer for its relaunch. The game's theme song, \\"Answers\\", was composed by Uematsu and sung by Susan Calloway, who was specially chosen by Uematsu after hearing her rendition of previous Final Fantasy theme songs. Multiple albums featuring music from XIV have been released. Two mini-albums, Final Fantasy XIV: Battle Tracks and Final Fantasy XIV: Field Tracks, were released on September 29, 2010. A full album, Final Fantasy XIV - Eorzean Frontiers, was released on September 1, 2012 as both a single album and three mini-albums. A Blu-ray album featuring all music from the original version of XIV, Before Meteor: Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack, was released on August 14, 2013, two weeks prior to its relaunch. Release XIV was first hinted at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) when Square Enix announced that they were developing a new MMORPG, showing it off using a tech demo. The demo included aesthetic elements similar to XI, such as races from Vana'diel. In 2006, rumors emerged that Square Enix was developing a direct sequel to Final Fantasy XI, but further details remained unknown. During the next few years, contradictory reports were issued as to what platforms the game was being developed for: the platforms listed varied from the game being an Xbox 360 exclusive, to being for PlayStation platforms, to being for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 (PS3) and Windows platforms. XIV was officially announced at E3 2009 for PS3, then for Windows. After its official announcement for those platforms, it was stated that a port to Microsoft hardware was under consideration. Despite negotiation with Microsoft concerning an Xbox 360 version of the game, the two companies were unable to agree upon the use of Xbox Live, as Square Enix wanted a shared server across all platforms and Microsoft would not give them the full access necessary to implement this. Because of this disagreement and the consequent extra manpower needed to develop a version separate from the other two platforms, development on the Xbox 360 version was stopped. According to Yoichi Wada, then-CEO of Square Enix, XIV was being planned as a serious rival to successful western MMORPG World of Warcraft. The game was developed primarily for Windows, and was then ported across to PS3. XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010, but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011. This was explained as due to it taking longer than expected to make the adjustments needed so the game could fit within the console's limited memory. The game did not use the PlayOnline service used for XI. This was explained as being due to the marked decrease of content on the service. Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In October 2009, the game's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows. First print runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in-game item. Due to earlier recurring issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team decided not to implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of mistranslation fears, dedicated teams in each of the game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During alpha testing, the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate. The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game. The Beta test eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners to log into the game from that date. The Collector's Edition, which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida, came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary, a security token, a case for the game's box, and a decorated tumbler. The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions. Reception During its debut week in Japan, the Collector's Edition reached #2 in the PC games charts behind Civilization 5 and ahead of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. In the UK charts, the game debuted at #10 behind multiple other games including F1 2010 (#1), Halo: Reach (#2), Civilization 5 (#4) and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (#7). By November 2010, the game had sold 603,000 copies worldwide. The game received generally negative reviews at release, garnering scores of 50% and 49/100 by aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Computer and Video Games said \\"Eorzea is a beautiful world with huge potential for vast adventures, but it's just a shame that this first voyage into it is such a mis-step\\". 1UP.com said that \\"playing [Final Fantasy XIV] is like playing with a toy stuck in a plastic bag: it can be fun for a while and you can get the general idea, but you can't appreciate the full experience\\", stating that future updates would likely rectify this issue. IGN said that \\"Much of the promise of the combat system and depth of the crafting mechanics are drowned, unfortunately, under a sea of interface and performance issues that hinder the experience at nearly every step\\", further stating that while patches might improve the experience, its state at the time of the review made it \\"not a world worth visiting\\". GameSpot, in addition to warning players away from the game, said that \\"Final Fantasy XIV is a notable entry to the genre but only for what it lacks\\". GameTrailers was particularly critical, saying that it had been \\"released before it was finished\\", calling it \\"[a] broken, incomplete mess\\". PC Gamer called the game \\"a shallow, slow, grind-heavy MMO crippled by a horrible interface and nonsensical player limitations\\". GameSpy was again highly critical, saying that \\"barring a complete overhaul of the user interface, the combat, the player interaction mechanics, the progress system, and of the layout of the world itself, [Final Fantasy XIV] is unlikely to ever be fun.\\" Eurogamer said that while the game would appeal to some players, they advised them to \\"wait another six months before even thinking about Final Fantasy XIV, because Square Enix hasn't yet got its head around its own players\\". Critics agreed that the game's graphics were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and glitches, and the slow pace of the story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, as part of an interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable. Post-release The release of the game sparked immediate player backlash in addition to its negative critical reception. Some of the controversy was produced by the use of gameplay features unusual for the genre. The main complaint by players was the user interface, followed by problems with the performance and aspects of gameplay. The initial 30-day free trial was extended twice in order to allow players to experience the new development team's updates before committing to the game. In December 2010, it was announced that Tanaka and Komoto had been removed from their posts as producer and director, with Tanaka taking full responsibility for the game's problems. The PS3 version was indefinitely delayed from its original March 2011 release date, with Square Enix saying that it would not release the game for that platform until it fully met the quality standards suitable for the Final Fantasy series. Subscriptions for the Windows version were also suspended indefinitely. The position of producer and director was taken over by Naoki Yoshida, a staff member at Square Enix who had previously worked on the Dragon Quest series. Among these were other staff changes: Komoto was reassigned to become lead game designer, Akihiko Yoshida became lead scenario concept artist, Hiroshi Takai was appointed as lead artist, and Akihiko Matsui became lead combat system designer. Yoshida's main priority was to make the game a playable experience after the poor launch and subsequent reaction. Through subsequent patches to the game, multiple graphical and gameplay improvements were made: among the most notable were the addition of a job system, personal chocobos, a revamped battle system, greater customization options for gear, and multiple new dungeons and bosses. Yoshida also introduced the official Final Fantasy XIV forums in order to obtain player feedback and suggestions, and stated that interacting with and growing closer to the community would be a high priority. During this period, XIV and XI were taken offline to help with energy conservation in the aftermath of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. They went back online one week later as other means were found to reduce their energy usage that did not involve their online services. The developers also received messages from Japanese players that they were using the game to communicate with their friends and relatives while landline and cell service was still unavailable.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoOI5R-6u8k @ 20:30-24:50 Due to the earthquake, a planned and partially-developed boss battle with the Primal Titan was cut and replaced by another battle: the team felt that players might be offended by the Primal and associate beast tribe's links with the power of earth in this context. They created a fight against Good King Moggle Mog instead by repurposing existing character models for moogles and modifying a moogle theme song that Uematsu had already composed. The team could not fully mend the game in its existing form as its engine and server structure were already critically flawed. This meant that, in order to save XIV, the entire game needed to be rebuilt from the ground up. The decision to launch a new version as a reboot instead of a whole new title was driven by the need to regain player trust, which was felt would not be done by just scrapping XIV. The original story planned for XIV was changed to build up towards the end of the original game's life, with new boss battles being introduced leading up to the final storyline. The \\"Seventh Umbral Era\\" storyline was used as a story- based reason for the radical changes coming to the game and its landscape. Yoshida came up with the idea to use a world-ending event after seeing a television program about the 2012 Doomsday prophecy, attributed to the Mayan calendar. In the run-up to this, reduced subscription fees were reintroduced with special bonuses included for the eventual reboot of the game, and major server merges were carried out to ease the transition between versions of the game, a move which initially provoked a negative reaction for players. The final revision of the game was put out on November 1, 2012. After a final in- game battle where all XIV players were invited, the servers were closed down on November 11. Legacy The flawed release and poor reception of the game had a heavy impact on Square Enix: citing XIV among other reasons, the company reduced its projected income for the year by 90%. At the 2011 Tokyo Game Show, Wada issued an official apology for the quality of the game, saying that \\"the Final Fantasy brand [had] been greatly damaged\\". The company and development team eventually decided to scrap the current version of XIV, rebuilding it from the ground up. This rebooted version, initially titled Final Fantasy XIV 2.0, began development in April 2011. The rebooted version was released in 2013 with the subtitle A Realm Reborn, and has been positively received by critics and players. Yoshida, commenting in a later interview, stated that A Realm Reborn was just the first part of regaining player trust after the release of XIV, predicting that the process would take a long time. In a 2019 interview with Easy Allies, Yoshida joked that the idea of a legacy XIV 1.0 server (in the vein of World of Warcraft Classic) would be a \\"nightmare\\".

It is a four-cylinder, four-stroke engine introduced in 1989 and discontinued in 2012. It was a replacement for the two-cylinder EK23 that was used in the Subaru Rex. While other manufacturers adopted a three-cylinder engine, the Subaru EN is a four-cylinder of only 547 cc. Subaru also did make a three-cylinder engine, called the Subaru EF engine which was used in the Subaru Justy, but the larger EF engine (which was based on the smaller EK23) was not modernized at the same time. The following year, 1989, the Japanese Ministry of Transport revised the standards for kei cars. This resulted in the new 660 cc class series of four-cylinder engines, and the EN05 had its stroke increased to produce the EN07. The bore pitch remained to help keep the changes to a minimum. The increased stroke helped make up for the lack of low-speed torque, a weakness of the other four-cylinder 660 cc engines. While four-cylinder engines are not typical in kei class cars, Subaru kept using this layout until they stopped manufacturing their own kei vehicles in 2012. Three-cylinder engines have proved to be on par with Subaru's four-cylinder designs; while not as smooth running they tend to be lighter and more economical due to lower friction losses. Nonetheless, the EN07 powered three of the five most fuel efficient kei passenger cars in 2009 (heading the list for the third year in a row), when the EN engine was its peak of development. There was a turbocharged version of the predecessor, the EK23, used in the Subaru Rex, which competed with the Daihatsu Mira and Suzuki Alto. This was replaced with a supercharger for the EN-series. The four-cylinder EN engine was originally marketed as the Clover 4, and Subaru cast the head with a clover-leaf mark, to set it apart from its three-cylinder version. Subaru remained faithful to the EN-series until they stopped building kei car engines. Subaru uses Daihatsu three- cylinder units for the Sambar truck (now a rebadged Daihatsu Hijet) since 28 February 2012. EN05 The EN05 was the first engine in the EN series.

College career Anderson began is NCAA career at Northern Illinois, where he was the 2007-08 Mid-American Conference Freshman of the Year. A three-year starter at NIU, Anderson averaged 13.2 PPG and 5.5 RPG from 2007-10. He decided to enter his name in the 2009 NBA draft but did not hire an agent, so he retained his right to return to school the next season. After completing his degree in Communications in 2010, Anderson transferred to Iowa State for his final season of eligibility, where he was enrolled in graduate classes in Hospitality Management. Anderson had an outstanding senior season in Ames, starting 31 games and averaging 12.8 PPG, and leading the team with 7.2 rebounds per game. In Anderson's final collegiate game, he scored a career- high 33 points vs. Colorado in the Big 12 Conference Tournament. Professional career On November 3, 2011, Anderson was selected by the Dakota Wizards in the fourth round of the 2011 NBA Development League Draft. The next day, his rights were trade to the Iowa Energy, going on to join the team for the 2011‚Äì12 season.

The market was built in 1850 and named \\"St. Andrew's Market\\" after its city ward. It served as an important commercial center for what was then Toronto's west end. A fire in 1860 destroyed the first market buildings. They were replaced in 1873 by the much larger St. Andrew's Hall and Market, designed in Renaissance Revival style. The building housed a police station, a community hall, a public library branch, as well as the market sellers of fresh produce and butchers. In the 1870s, St. Andrew's Market began to lose some of its relevance as a commercial hub. In 1889, an addition was added, however by 1900 the market stalls were mostly empty. The buildings were demolished in 1932, and replaced by a water works building (housing offices, warehouse and workshops) designed by City Architect James John Woolnough.https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2017/te/bgrd/backgroundfile-100813.pdf St. Andrew's Market prior to its demolition in 1932.

It may also be referred to as a swift moth or a ghost moth, as this is a common name associated with Hepialidae. Endemic to Australia and identified in 1932, it is most populous in temperate rainforest where eucalypti are prevalent, as the larvae feed primarily on the roots of these trees. Females lay eggs during flight in a scattering fashion. The larvae live for over eighteen months underground, while adult moths survive for approximately one week, as they have no mouthparts with which to feed. The moths are preyed upon by a number of predators, including bats and owls. Brown in colour overall, males are paler and the identifying silver bars of the male's wings are more prominent than those of the female's, with dark margins. Male adults are generally smaller. Established clearfelling practices have been shown to favour the Pindi moth, and could lead to it being considered a pest due to opportunistic proliferation of the species. The resulting damage caused to the trees on which it feeds may be considered significant.  Taxonomy and naming  Abantiades latipennis is one of fourteen species currently identified within the genus Abantiades, all of which are found exclusively in Australia. The species was first described in 1932 by Norman Tindale, an Australian entomologist and anthropologist. Tindale described the species, under its current name, but provided no etymology for the specific epithet latipennis. He based the species description on specimens from Lorne (including the holotype male and allotype female), Pomonal and Mount Mistake (in the Langi Ghiran State Park), Victoria, and from Zeehan, Eaglehawk Neck and Launceston, Tasmania. Being a member of the Hepialiade family, A. latipennis is considered phylogenetically primitive, possessing several features that are indicative of earlier evolutionary development. The jugum on the forewings of the adult is an archaic wing coupling mechanism; further primitive characteristics include, as adults, the lack of mouthparts, large spacing between the fore- and hindwings, and the arrangement of the female genitalia.  Distribution and habitat  A. latipennis is endemic to the Australasian region. More specifically, the moths inhabit New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, and Australian Capital Territory. As with other Abantiades species, the moth's habitat is temperate rainforest, both primary and secondary. During its larval stage, the moth feeds on the roots of trees, and its prospering is thought to have an economic impact on the timber industry.  Life cycle and behaviour  Female moths \\"lay\\" their eggs by scattering them during flight; up to 10,000 eggs are released at once. Larvae then hatch from the eggs in the leaf litter on the forest floor and begin tunnelling, in search of suitable host roots. The number of instars and the period of the larval stage is yet unknown, with field observations suggesting a larval stage of more than eighteen months. An adult Abantiades latipennis, possibly a female, photographed in Austins Ferry, Tasmania The phytophagous larvae of A. latipennis feed primarily on the root systems of two species of tree, Eucalyptus obliqua (messmate stringybark) and Eucalyptus regnans (mountain ash). Both of these species are present in old growth forests and dominant in regrowth forests, contributing to the moth's success in its own habitat. Forming simple and vertical tunnels, lined with silk, the caterpillars are subterranean before and during pupation, emerging for their metamorphosis. The tunnel entrances, 6 to 10 millimetres in diameter, are covered with silk webbing and leaf litter, and can be up to deep, although depth is more usually 12 to 35 cm. By chewing the tap and lateral roots of trees, caterpillars feed on the cambium growth, produced by the tree at the site of the injury. The larvae may girdle a root, thereby causing its death, or the lesions may be only partial, allowing the root to continue functioning, albeit with some deformity. The subterranean habitat of the larvae generally provides protection from predation, but the larvae are sometimes parasitised by tachina flies. The parasitoid larvae of the tachinid Rutilotrixa diversa, usually hosted by scarab beetles, have been discovered infecting A. latipennis. Adult A. latipennis are crepuscular and males are strongly attracted to lights, forming leks at dusk, most notably after rains in autumn and late summer. Females use pheromones to attract males for mating. As a primitive species, they lack mouthparts as adults and are therefore unable to feed. Their lifespan as winged creatures is understandably short, lasting approximately a week, barring predation. Predation is commonly by bats, owls, and possums, though several other animals, from spiders to cats, occasionally consume them and contribute to the brief lifespan of the metamorphosed moths.  Ecology  As part of a study measuring the impact that the practice of clearfelling has on biodiversity in the Weld Valley of Tasmania, it was found that A. latipennis was one of the few species that thrived in regrowth forests that were previously clearfelled. An earlier study, conducted in other regions of southern Tasmania, examined the relationship between the moth and Eucalyptus regnans and E. obliqua and reached the same conclusion. The tunnelling and feeding habit of A. latipennis larvae on the roots of these two eucalypt species is mostly responsible for its abundance in clearfelled forests, as the trees are the typical regrowth of logged areas. This success may also be due in part to the caterpillar's lack of dependence on decaying vegetation, a characteristic of the genus Abantiades and dissimilar to other Tasmanian genera‚Äîsuch as Eudonia and Barea‚Äîthat have not fared as well in clearfelled forest. The crowns of the eucalypts infected by A. latipennis have exhibited no consistent indication of root disturbance, with most trees studied appearing healthy and of average size for secondary forest. E. regnans and E. obliqua have demonstrated slow growth in regrowth stands, but this tendency has been attributed to significant root and crown competition. Some trees appeared chlorotic (a yellowing effect in plants, caused by a reduction in chlorophyll), but this was not a reliable indicator of root infestation, and may be the result of other influences. Well-established clearfelling practices in Tasmania could exacerbate the favouring of this species, and its proliferation could lead to extensive eucalypt damage and pest concerns, though the potential effect of this threat is as yet undetermined. Lesions on the roots caused by the larval feeding provide ideal sites for the establishment of root rot-causing fungi, once the larvae depart the root system for pupation. Areas on the roots with past feeding damage were found to have Armillaria sp. flourishing in the lesions. In rarer cases, the pathogen Perenniporia medulla-panis was also found attacking the roots at the damaged locations. Other cases of decay and discolouration were noted, but attributed to unidentified microorganisms.  Morphology and identification  A. latipennis larvae vary in size and colour during growth, but can be grouped small and large. The small caterpillars are generally long and an overall milky grey, with a light brown head capsule that is about wide. Large caterpillars may be milky grey or a dark green-brown, long, with a wide brown head capsule. Females are larger than males, with the wingspan of the male adult approximately . A female specimen collected in 1979 had a wingspan of , but Tindale recorded female wingspans at in 1932. The forewings of both males and females feature silvery-white bars, although the bars of the male moth's wings are more prominent and with dark margins. The female's body colour is usually a darker brown than the male's pale brown, as noted by Tindale, although a grey-brown female was collected in 1979. Hepialidae have short, pectinate antennae and, unusually primitive for Lepidoptera, lack a functional proboscis or retinaculum and are therefore non-feeding. The moths possess several other morphological features that are considered phylogenetically primitive. The gap between the fore- and hindwing is distinct and the wings are covered in scale-like hairs. At the base of the forewing is a jugum, a small lobe that joins the fore- and hindwings during flight. In females, the configuration of the genitalia is exoporian, typified by an external groove along which spermatophores are transferred after mating, from the copulatory opening (the ostium bursae), to the ovipore for fertilisation.

It is also popular in Jharkhand and parts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh. It is a dough ball made up of whole wheat flour and stuffed with gram flour, pulses and mixed with herbs and spices and then roasted over coal or wood then it is tossed with much ghee. Although very often confused with the closely related baati, it is a completely different dish in terms of taste, texture and preparation. It may be eaten with yogurt, baigan bharta, alu bharta, and papad. The litti are traditionally baked over wood fire, but in the modern day a new fried version has been developed. Herbs and spices used to flavour the litti include onion, garlic, ginger, coriander leaves, lime juice, carom seeds, nigella seeds and salt. Tasty pickles can also be used to add spice flavour. In western Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh litti is served with murgh korma (a creamy chicken curry) or chokha (a vegetable preparation of roasted and mashed eggplant, tomato, and potato). Litti and chokha is not only nationally famous but it is also eaten in foreign countries such as Mauritius, Fiji, Suriname etc, where people from Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh migrated. They took their cuisine with them and there it became popular. Due to this, litti and chokha are famous not only in India but also in many other countries. See also * Bihari cuisine Litti is a staple food of Bihar, Jharkhand and Eastern Uttar Pradesh. It is pocket friendly for the working classes and also healthy in terms of proteins and nutrients. It is made of whole-wheat flour and stuffed with sattu (gram flour powder). Cooking and serving of litti is very important to realise the actual taste of this food. The best littis should be cooked in low fire of cow dung cake so that the littis are baked properly and the inside fillings are cooked and mixed well. The taste of litti lies in its stuffed material, namely sattu. Dry sattu is mixed with chopped garlic and ginger and some Indian dry species to give a tangy flavour, and after the litti is baked it is broken into pieces, and hot ghee is poured all over it. It is best served with raw onions soaked in lemon and vinegar, chokha (spicy mashed potatoes) and chicken/meat gravy.

He studied at the Amsterdam Rabbinical Seminary under Rabbi Dr. Joseph Hirsch D√ºnner. He also studied at the University of Amsterdam, from which he graduated in 1884 with a bachelor's degree in the classics. In 1886, he was ordained as rabbi. Onderwijzer was appointed rabbi of the Ashkenazi community in Amsterdam on July 5, 1888. On June 12, 1889, he married Lea Wagenaar. They had nine children. In 1895, Rabbi Onderwijzer published a translation of the Pentateuch and Rashi's notes. On October 29, 1895, he founded the Jewish labor-union Betsalel, of which he was the honorary president. Bezaleel cared especially for the religious needs of its members (200 in 1904), who were for the greater part diamond-workers. With the other congregational unions of Amsterdam, Patrimonium and St. Eduardus, it supported the Algemeene Nederlandsche Diamantbewerkers Bond (ANDBB), though Betsalel was entirely independent of that organization. Rabbi Onderwijzer died in 1934 after a collision with a tram in Amsterdam.

Initially released in 2010 for use with the PlayStation 3 video game console, its compatibility was later expanded to its successor, the PlayStation 4, in 2013, its PlayStation VR platform in 2016 and the PlayStation 5 in 2020. Conceptually similar to Nintendo's Wii Remote and Microsoft's Kinect, its function is based around controller input in games stemming from the actual physical movement of the player. The Move uses inertial sensors in the wand to detect motion while the wand's position is tracked using a PlayStation Eye or PlayStation Camera. The device was generally well-received by critics, but has not quite met Sony's goals for integration into the market.  Hardware  As with the standard PlayStation 3 wireless controllers (Sixaxis, DualShock 3), both the main PlayStation Move motion controller and the PlayStation Move navigation controller use Bluetooth 2.0 and an internal lithium-ion battery charged via a USB Mini-B port on the controller. On the PlayStation 3, up to four Move controllers can be used at once (four Move motion controllers, or two Move motion controllers and two Move navigation controllers). =Motion controller= The primary component of PlayStation Move, the PlayStation Move motion controller, is a wand controller which allows the user to interact with the console through motion and position in front of a PlayStation camera. It functions similarly to the Wii Remote. The PlayStation Move features a variety of internal sensors to gauge orientation. The PlayStation Move motion controller features an orb at the head which can glow in any of a full range of colors using RGB light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Based on the colors in the user environment captured by the camera, the system dynamically selects an orb color that can be distinguished from the rest of the scene. The colored light serves as an active marker, the position of which can be tracked along the image plane by the camera. The uniform spherical shape and known size of the light also allows the system to simply determine the controller's distance from the camera through the light's image size, thus enabling the controller's position to be tracked in three dimensions with high precision and accuracy. The simple sphere-based distance calculation allows the controller to operate with minimal processing latency, as opposed to other camera-based control techniques on the PlayStation 3. A pair of inertial sensors inside the controller, a three-axis linear accelerometer and a three-axis angular rate sensor, are used to track rotation as well as overall motion. An internal magnetometer is also used for calibrating the controller's orientation against the Earth's magnetic field to help correct against cumulative error (drift) by the inertial sensors. In addition, an internal temperature sensor is used to adjust the inertial sensor readings against temperature effects. The inertial sensors can be used for dead reckoning in cases which the camera tracking is insufficient, such as when the controller is obscured behind the player's back. The controller face features a large oblong primary button (Move), surrounded by small action buttons (Triangle, Circle, Cross, Square), and with a regular-sized PS button beneath, arranged in a similar configuration as on the Blu-ray Disc Remote Control. On the left and right side of the controller is a Select and Start button, respectively. On the underside is an analog trigger (T). On the tail end of the controller is the wrist strap, USB port, and extension port. The motion controller features vibration-based haptic technology. In addition to providing a tracking reference, the controller's orb light can be used to provide visual feedback, simulating aesthetic effects such as the muzzle flash of a gun or the paint on a brush. Using different orb colors for each controller, up to four motion controllers can be tracked at once on the PlayStation 3. Demonstrations for the controller have featured activities using a single motion controller, as well as those in which the user wields two motion controllers, with one in each hand. To minimize the cost of entry, Sony stated that all launch titles for PlayStation Move would be playable with one motion controller, with enhanced options available for multiple motion controllers. On the PlayStation 3, image processing for PlayStation Move is performed in the console's Cell microprocessor. According to Sony, use of the motion-tracking library entails some Synergistic Processing Unit (SPU) overhead as well an impact on memory, though the company states that the effects will be minimized. According to Move motion controller co-designer Anton Mikhailov, the library uses 1-2 megabytes of system memory. =Navigation controller= PlayStation Move navigation controller The PlayStation Move navigation controller is a one-handed supplementary controller designed for use in conjunction with the PlayStation Move motion controller for certain types of gameplay, similar to Nintendo Wii Nunchuk. Replicating the major functionality of the left side of a standard PlayStation 3 gamepad, the PlayStation Move navigation controller features a left analog stick (with L3 button function), a D-pad, L1 button and L2 analog trigger. The navigation controller also features Cross and Circle action buttons, as well as a PS button. Since all controls correspond to those of a standard PlayStation 3 gamepad, a Sixaxis or DualShock 3 controller can be used in place of the navigation controller in PlayStation Move applications. =Accessories= A number of additional accessories have also been released for use in conjunction with the PlayStation Move controllers. * PlayStation Move charging station could charge up any combination of two Move controllers. * PlayStation Move shooting attachment adapts the Move controllers into a handgun form. The motion controller is fitted into the gun barrel so that the motion controller's T trigger is interlocked with the trigger on the gun attachment, while leaving all the topmost buttons accessible through an opening in the top. Its functions are similar to the Wii Zapper. * PlayStation Move Sharp Shooter attachment adapts both Move controllers into a submachine gun form, which features an adjustable shoulder support. The motion controller is fitted into the gun barrel, while the navigation controller is clipped into a holder below this gun barrel. This accessory also adds several buttons to the controller. Several games, including Killzone 3, Dead Space: Extraction, SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs and Resistance 3., officially support this peripheral. * The PlayStation Move Racing Wheel allows players to simulate driving in video games. The accessory features vibration feedback, paddle- style gear shifters and twist throttle controls. It supports games like LittleBigPlanet Karting, Gran Turismo 5, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, Burnout Paradise, and MotorStorm: Apocalypse. Bundle packages The PS Move Sharp Shooter, a controller holder shaped like an assault rifle that was commonly sold in a bundle with PS Move controllers, PS Eye and the games Killzone 3 and Resistance 3. In addition to selling the controllers individually, Sony also provides several different bundle options for PlayStation Move hardware such as: software/camera bundles with a PlayStation Eye, a Move motion controller and motion-control enabled software; console bundles which include a PS3 console, DualShock 3 controller, PlayStation Eye, and Move motion controller; and bundles with a Move motion controller with select games. Though the games with the bundles vary in each region, most bundles come with the PlayStation Move Demo Disc which contains demos for eleven different games. The bundles in Europe and Oceania however, come with the PlayStation Move Starter Disc with a setup tutorial and nine demos (same as the Demo Disc, except without Kung Fu Rider and Time Crisis). The demos included are for the games Beat Sketcher, Echochrome II, EyePet, Kung Fu Rider, Sports Champions, Start the Party!, The Shoot, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11, Time Crisis: Razing Storm, Tumble, and TV Superstars. In North America, bundles are available with the game Sports Champions or the PlayStation Move edition of EyePet. In Japan, bundles with Beat Sketch!, Biohazard 5 Alternative Edition, or Big 3 Gun Shooting are available. All bundles, as well as the stand-alone controller will also include the demo disk for a limited time. In Europe, a bundle will be released with a demo disc. In Asian countries outside Japan such as Singapore, the bundles are available with the games Sports Champions, Start the Party!, and Kung Fu Rider.  History  The PlayStation Eye is used in conjunction with the Move to track movement. PlayStation Move stems from early work on the EyeToy, a webcam-based controller for the PlayStation 2 conceived in 1999 and released in 2003. Early in the EyeToy's inception, developers experimented with color-based 3D wand tracking, including prototypes using spheres. By the time it was released, the EyeToy's focus was on hands-free applications. With the emergence of affordable inertial sensors and the success of the Wii Remote motion controller wand, in 2008 Sony began work on productizing its own motion controller wand, revisiting the sphere-tracking concept for use with the PlayStation Eye, integrating inertial sensors, and refining the device from an engineering and a design perspective. The Move's internal development codename was the \\"Y-con\\", so called because three groups ‚Äî the hardware team in SCEI in Japan, the software engineering team at SCEA, and Sony's Worldwide Studios ‚Äî worked together to develop the hardware, with the three points of a \\"Y\\" indicating the three teams coming together. This was the start of a new form of development at Sony, where hardware had previously been developed separately from software teams and later delivered along with technical documentation for software teams to get to grips with themselves; this move was continued with the development of the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4. The motion controller was revealed at Sony's E3 2009 press conference on 2 June 2009, with a live demonstration using an engineering prototype. Tentatively referred to as the PlayStation Motion Controller, the device was originally stated to be available in Q1/Q2 2010. As of August 2009, the controller features and design had not been finalized. Soon after revealing the motion controller to developers, Sony indicated that it was exploring the possibility of using the motion controller in combination with a standard PlayStation 3 gamepad, such as having the player use \\"the motion controller as a sword and use DualShock 3 as a shield.\\" One combination control scheme was demonstrated in September 2009 at the Tokyo Game Show for Biohazard 5: Alternative Edition, making particular use of the DualShock 3's analog stick. Although users found the setup to work well, some found holding a DualShock with one hand to be somewhat awkward. At the time Sony was already rumored to be in the design phase of a supplementary controller akin to that of the Nunchuk controller for the Wii Remote. In January 2010, Sony announced a revised release target, stating instead that the motion controller would launch in Q3/Q4 of 2010. On March 10, Sony revealed the official name and logo at the Game Developers Conference, showcasing the final motion controller design, and unveiling the PlayStation Move navigation controller (then referred to as the PlayStation Move sub-controller), to be launched concurrently with the motion controller. The logo is a colored squiggle-like shape, representing a light trail from the sphere of a PlayStation Move motion controller being waved. Newly revealed in the final motion controller was the inclusion of an internal magnetometer. =Name= Prior to the Game Developers Conference 2010, the PlayStation Move motion controller was known by several names. Initially given little guidance on what to call the device when it was unveiled in June 2009, many in the video game press informally referred to the controller as the \\"magic wand\\", or simply \\"Wand\\" due to the controller's wand design and glowing orb. Sony had used the term \\"PlayStation Motion Controller\\" from the motion controller's introduction, but many perceived it to be used merely as a description. Sony gradually clarified \\"Motion Controller\\" as the tentative name, but by this time media attention had shifted to rumored final names. In September 2009, statements in two unconnected interviews at the Tokyo Game Show led to speculation that the controller may be referred to by developers as the \\"Sphere\\". In December, a brief reference to the motion controller as \\"Gem\\" by Electronic Arts CEO John Riccitiello during a media industry conference presentation prompted an admission by Sony that \\"Gem\\" was an early code name for the controller. In January 2010, video game blog VG247 reported that Sony had named its PS3 motion control platform \\"Arc\\". The name was observed to liken the controller's glowing orb to the charged sphere of a Tesla coil or a plasma globe electrode. The report was supported by evidence emerging in the following weeks, including a registration of the playstationarc.com domain name to SCE dated October 2009 (shortly after the Tokyo Game Show) and numerous references to \\"Arc\\" by president Brian Farrell of video game publisher THQ during the company's February earnings conference call. Responding to speculation that Farrell's statements effectively confirmed the name, SCEA senior director of corporate communications Patrick Seybold stated that they did not, and that Farrell was referring to \\"Arc\\" as a \\"rumored code name.\\" On March 1, it was reported that Sony submitted Japanese trademark application filing for \\"PlayStation Arc\\". A week later on March 8, Sony was reportedly considering a hasty renaming due to a trademark held by competitor Microsoft for its Arc-brand PC accessories, which could present trademark conflicts. On March 9, Sony submitted a European trademark filing for \\"PlayStation Move\\", which was announced as the official name the next day at Sony's press conference at the Game Developers Conference. Video gaming blog Joystiq reports several anonymous Sony sources claiming that the PlayStation Move logo presented at the conference resembles a letter \\"A\\" because it is the same design for when the name was \\"PlayStation Arc\\", in which the \\"A\\" would stand for \\"Arc\\". =Promotion= As part of the promotional marketing for Sorcery, the PlayStation Move controller was inducted into The Magic Circle museum by Vice President Scott Penrose. = Recreational therapy = PlayStation Move is now being actively used in recreational therapy on children that suffer from obesity. The Move creates a challenging physical environment for the children. In one study, recreational therapists utilized PlayStation Move Fitness. The children chose which activity to do and then, they engaged for a period of approximately 30 minutes. The recreational therapists monitored the children. These programs have shown to: * Lower BMI and weight. * Improve cardiovascular endurance. * Lead to healthier choices in recreation activities. * Improve self-esteem. * Identify the importance of exercise. Software Alongside SIE Worldwide Studios and its second-party partners, a total of 36 third-party game development companies had confirmed that they would support the PlayStation Move by the time the finalized controller was announced in March 2010. On the box art of PlayStation Move games, underneath the PlayStation 3 logo banner, a blue bar with white letters indicates when a game supports the PlayStation Move. When a game can only be played with the PlayStation Move, the box art carries a \\"PlayStation Move Required\\" label. When a game supports traditional Sixaxis/DualShock 3 controls and PlayStation Move controls it carries a \\"PlayStation Move Features\\" (or \\"PlayStation Move Compatible\\") label. Reception =Critical reception= The PlayStation Move has been generally well received. Game Informer gave it an 8 out of 10, saying, \\"The PlayStation Eye and motion controller are a killer combination for accurate and highly responsive motion-based gameplay, and we applaud Sony for getting the hardware right the first time.\\" Kotaku praised its accuracy, design, use of augmented reality and said, \\"The Playstation Move is a intuitive, natural feeling way to play games and it brings with it not only a sense of increased immersion to already graphically immersive games, but a new way to play with your reality and a refreshing form of colorful feedback.\\" IGN gave the Move an 8.5 out of 10, noting that the launch line-up of games for the controller was insufficient though it summarized by saying, \\"At the end of the day, the PlayStation Move has the potential to be the best motion control system on the current crop of consoles.\\" Joystiq praised the Move, saying, \\"The hardware's great, and I can see it being used in a multitude of really cool ways, but of course it's only as cool as the games that use it\\" and that the launch line-up was not worth the purchase, though it believed that the Move would be worth the purchase in early 2011 due to a stronger line-up of games such as SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs and Killzone 3. CVG gave the Move an extremely positive review and awarded it 9 out of 10, saying, \\"Sony's motion control gets beyond being a gimmick. We found ourselves constantly itching for 'one more go'.\\" The Guardian strongly criticized the Move's launch line-up, though it noted that the hardware was strong and that after playing with the Move it was \\"very hard to go back to the relative inaccuracy of the Wii\\". The PlayStation Move won the 2010 Popular Science award for the \\"Most immersive game controller\\". =Sales= In October 2010, the PlayStation Move had shipped around 1.5 million units in Europe and 1 million units in North America during its first month of release, figures that Sony felt were selling \\"extremely well\\" at the time. On 30 November 2010, it was announced that 4.1 million units had been shipped worldwide in the first two months since its release. By June 2011, at E3 2011, Sony announced that the PlayStation Move had sold 8.8 million units. By November 2012, this figure had grown to 15 million. In March 2012 Fergal Gara of Sony UK spoke to Official PlayStation Magazine UK to acknowledge that, the device had not lived up to their expectations, in either their target audience or the software support that had been provided for it.

The PSP version was announced in February 2010. Both versions of the game were released in Europe on May 21, 2010, the UK on May 19 and North America on May 25. Gameplay Karts drifting during a race. Players are able to accelerate and drift, successful drifts allow players to fill their boost meter. The meter resembles a multi- tiered thermometer which allows players to the choice of activating a turbo boost to increase the kart's speed, a shield to protect their kart from incoming attacks or sideswiping other racers. Players are able to collect weapons as they race which can be upgraded to up to three levels of power, weapons include sonic attacks, missiles and lightning strikes. For example, a first level sonic attack emits a series of rings around the player knocking nearby opponents off the track while a third level sonic attack sends the rings forward, knocking all racers ahead of the player off of the track. In addition to the emphasis on user-generated content, the game includes a full- fledged single-player mode featuring a story by professional Hollywood writers. =ModSpot= ModSpot is the main lobby area for ModNation Racers. Players can meet up, race, and create and download content. The ModSpot contains Race Station which has Online Race, Quick Race, Split-Screen and Career (Story Mode), Creation Station, where players create their Mods, Karts and Tracks, and also share and shop points, Top Mods, Top Karts and Top Tracks, Coming Attractions to view upcoming DLC, Hot Lap where players can try to earn the best times on a track and a News Update screen. Players can start chats using text, voice or gestures. =Content creation= When the game was first announced, it was likened to LittleBigPlanet to highlight the game's emphasis on customization. Players are able to design and create their own characters, vehicles and race tracks in great detail. The overall style of the cars and characters is based on vinyl art and collectors' toys, but players are able to greatly modify their clothing and overall look. Players are also able to create and modify race tracks using the in-game 'Track Studio' tool. This tool was showcased at Sony's E3 2009 press conference where one of the game's developers created a race track and its surroundings in a five-minute presentation. In April 2010, Infamous developer Sucker Punch Productions showcased the game's editing tools with a track based on Empire City, where Infamous is set. Players start off by customizing their racer who begins as an all-white character model similar to Sackboy from LittleBigPlanet. Players can put various decals, different skins, masks, facial hair as well as other details on their racer. The material properties of certain customizable accessories allow players to make materials look more rubbery or metallic. E3 2009. The track creation was designed to be user-friendly and has been described as \\"probably one of the deepest you‚Äôve ever seen in a racing game.\\" The player drives over a flat terrain template and \\"paints\\" the road from the starting point of the race to the finish. The player can then modify things such as land deformation, lakes, mountains, surface texture, houses, item pick-ups, trees, animals and time-of-day settings. 30 staff-made circuits were available on release, according to United Front Games at E3 2009. Players can choose between 29 different types of terrain to create a track on. Landscapes can be sprayed onto the course using a virtual spray can such as dirt, sand, and tunnels. The game can auto-populate the track with items and ramps after the player creates the basic design.

Story The story is focused around the player, commonly referred to as 'Tagger' or 'Tag', who remains silent throughout in- game cutscenes. Biff Tradwell and Gary Reasons, commentators of the Modnation Racing Championship announce the qualifier of this season's MRC tour. Tag lives with his mother at their family run paintshop, where business has been slow for a long time. Upon showing an MRC poster to race to his mother, she informs him that his grandfather, Chief, is a crew-chief, which along with his own kart is all he requires to enter the qualifier. Chief, while critical of Tag's choice of kart decoration, agrees to be his crew-chief. Upon qualifying for the MRC Tour and already becoming a popular contestant with fans for his unique style, Tag's Uncle Richard, head of Conservative Motors, a company responsible for cheap, bland and uninteresting karts, attempts to sign him up for a sponsorship deal which is quickly turned down. Halfway through the Home Tour, Tag's mother reveals that they are unable to afford the constant repairs to his kart. When the kart blows out, Tag's mother is inspired from her son's newfound popularity to reopen the paintshop as a bodyshop garage, becoming an instant hit with customers and allowing them to stay financially afloat. During the third Tour, Chief finds that the Boom Box Weapons System on Tag's kart is badly damaged, despite their supposed indestructibility, and since they are expensive to replace, could risk Tag being unable to race. Tag's mother asks if the Boom Box from Chief's old kart is still functional after his racing wreck years ago, but Chief claims it was the reason he was unable to remain a racer. While working on repairs for Tag's kart the night before the Grim Tour, Chief discovers a bomb planted on the kart's undercarriage. Chief survives the explosion but falls into a coma. Not wanting his mother to sell the paintshop to afford a new Boom Box, Tag reluctantly signs on to the Conservative Motors team, now being forced to race in a bland kart and racing outfit with no creative freedom, and to have Richard as his inexperienced crew-chief. Eventually Chief recovers from his coma. Unhappy that Tag has signed onto the CM Team, he reveals that he actually retired from racing after being petrified from his wreck caused by MRC reigning champion Espresso, and that the Boom Box from his kart is still functional. He offers it to Tag so that he can remain in the race, break away from CM and get his creative freedom back. Tag wins the MRC Grand Tour, becoming the new champion of the MRC replacing Espresso. Chief gets his revenge on Espresso, and Uncle Richard is arrested as the culprit of the bomb on Tag's kart, in order to force Tag to sign onto the team. Development The game was first announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009 cited as being a \\"thoroughly modern take on kart racing.\\" Producer Dan Sochan stated that the PlayStation Network being free and the PlayStation 3 console's power were important factors when deciding to make ModNation Racers a PlayStation 3-exclusive game. During development, the aim has been to reduce the restrictions and limits the circuit building tool places on circuit design, to create as open an experience as possible. The circuits themselves won't necessarily have to be realistic as various obstacles, launchers and the like will be available, as well as some new and original weapons. In addition United Front Games, the developers of ModNation Racers, have a \\"great relationship\\" with LittleBigPlanet developer Media Molecule. At Gamescom 2009 in August, the developers confirmed that ModNation Racers was to have 4-player split screen and an online mode where twelve people could join in on a single race. Marketing Sony announced a range of pre-order incentives featuring video game characters. Kratos (from God of War) and his Kart of Chaos, Ratchet and Clank (from Ratchet & Clank) with their HoverKart, Nathan Drake (from Uncharted) with a Jungle Jeep Kart, and Sackboy (from LittleBigPlanet), with his Cardboard Kart. A demo was released on the PlayStation Store one week prior to the game's release. It includes limited Track, Mod and Kart creation tools and offline multiplayer and single player races. A month prior to the game's release, an event was held in PlayStation Home in a special events space called The Backstage Pass and the event was called the \\"ModSpot Challenge\\". The challenge was for users to run around the dedicated area of the space and search for certain Mods. This event began on April 29, 2010 in the European and North American versions. On May 7, 2010 GameSpot began to give away Air Raid downloadable content to their members. On May 27, 2010, a dedicated Game Space was released in PlayStation Home for ModNation Racers called the ModNation Club. The space features a Sticky Wall where users can create their own stickers and it also features a kart race minigame based on ModNation Racers. Sweet Tooth (from Twisted Metal) with his ice cream truck is available from July 6, 2010 as a download from PlayStation Store. ModNation Racers is also available as a social multiplayer game on Facebook. On May 16, 2011, Sony announced that along with LittleBigPlanet, inFAMOUS, Super Stardust HD, and Wipeout HD Fury, the PSP edition of ModNation racers would be given for free on the PlayStation Store for 30 days as a welcome back gesture after the PSN outage.

On May 3, 2018, it was announced that the online services deadline would be extended to October 10 because of the reaction by some players. Reception ModNation Racers received mostly positive reviews. It was rated 9 out of 10 by IGN, who commended the game for its excellent kart racing mechanics and robust level design tools, stating, \\"If you can dream it, you really can make it in ModNation Racers.\\" Gamers Globe, a Danish gaming website, also rated ModNation Racers 9 out of 10, saying \\"the game isn't a creative breakthrough as LittleBigPlanet or a go-kart game so complete as Mario Kart - it's a solid combination of both, which borrows the best of two worlds.\\" Eurogamer scored the game 7 out of 10, criticising long loading times and saying that the dynamic game difficulty can make the player feel like they're \\"operating at a distinct disadvantage,\\" but that, when playing online or split-screen against other human players, \\"ModNation allows its own charm to shine through\\".

Because it superficially resembles the modern-day internal parasites known as the acanthocephalids or \\"spiny-headed worms,\\" A. minor was once thought to be, or once thought to resemble the hypothetical free-living ancestor of acanthocephalids. Along with the other Cambrian worms such as Ottoia, Selkirkia, Louisella, Fieldia, Scolecofurca, and Lecythioscopa, the organism may fall into a clade termed \\"Archaeopriapulida,\\" a stem group to the Priapulids proper. However, the morphological similarity of these organisms to their modern cousins is remarkable, especially for the Burgess Shale. A phylogenetic analysis does not provide a great deal of resolution to the relationships between these basal worms. The generic name is a homage to the dragon Ancalagon of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, in reference to the worm's prominent rows of hooks on its proboscis. The species was previously placed in the genus Ottoia, as Ottoia minor, but was removed by Simon Conway Morris, who noted morphological differences.  Morphology  Ancalagon had a slender, cyndrical, radially symmetric body averaging 6 centimeters in length. Its proboscis was armed with circum-oral hooks at the anterior. There were about 10 of these hooks, equal in size and with prominent bases. Directly posterior was an unarmed space, followed by posteriorly directed spinose hooks. The trunk is annulated with 0.2 to 0.25 millimeter spacing, and carried rows of setae possibly performing sensory functions. The apparent absence of retractor muscles correlates with Ancalagon's inability to significantly invert its proboscis. The organism was probably a burrowing predator.

History The name of the park commemorates Little Norway, the exiled Royal Norwegian Air Force training base that had occupied the site during the Second World War. In 1976, a 3,000 pound boulder from Norway was transported to the location to serve as a permanent monument to that time. It was unveiled by Crown Prince Harald of Norway on September 18, 1976. The base's location was cleared and in the 1980s, an apartment complex was built along the western side. The rest of the former base was converted into a park and opened in 1986. The park was officially dedicated Little Norway Park on November 20, 1987, in a ceremony featuring King Olav V of Norway. Operations Existing park facilities include a baseball diamond and soccer pitch, playground and wading pool, public washrooms, as well as landscaped gardens and art installations.

It was given a limited release in the United States beginning May 7, 2010. Plot When she was 14, Karen became pregnant and gave her daughter up for adoption. The decision to give up her child has always haunted her. Upon meeting laid-back Paco at work, Karen allows her anxiety and mistrust to get the best of her. She gradually calms her anxiety through her growing relationship with Paco, and they get married. Paco persuades Karen to write a letter to her unknown, adult daughter, and she leaves the letter with the Catholic agency that had arranged the adoption. Karen's daughter, Elizabeth, grows up to be solitary, willful, and hardhearted. She is hired as an attorney at a prestigious law firm headed by Paul. They have an affair, and Elizabeth becomes pregnant. She quits without informing Paul of her condition and moves to a new apartment and a new job. She also leaves a letter for her biological mother with the adoption agency. Lucy is a baker who longs to be a mother, but she cannot have children of her own. She and her husband, Joseph, contact the same adoption agency and they meet with a young pregnant, prospective mother. After a protracted interview period, the mother agrees to give the couple her baby, but she changes her mind shortly after giving birth. Lucy is devastated by this news. Joseph reveals that he really wants to have his own biological child and he and Lucy separate. Elizabeth dies while giving birth to her child. Since no one steps forward to claim the baby, the agency offers the baby to Lucy, who adopts her. At first, Lucy is overwhelmed by the demands of being a new mother. One year later, Karen finds out about Elizabeth's death and her letter, which had been misplaced, informing her that she has a granddaughter named Ella. The agency arranges a meeting and Karen meets the little girl and Lucy, who live a short distance away in her own neighborhood.

Due to its position in the middle of the nature reserve L√ºneburg Heath it is a popular tourist destination, especially in the period when the heather is in flower.  Description  The Wilseder Berg is part of a nature reserve within the L√ºneburg Heath and lies near the villages of Wilsede and Bispingen in the Heidekreis. The hill was formed during the penultimate ice age, the Saale glaciation, and was part of a terminal moraine. It has a broad plateau and a flat summit. Around it lies a varied landscape of hollows, valleys and small ravines. The surrounding area has leached, gravelly-sandy soils with layers of hardpan, covered by open sand, large areas of heathland and extensive coniferous forest. The heathland is grazed by a variety of moorland sheep, known as the Heidschnucke. The Wilseder Berg lies on a watershed, from which several headstreams emerge, such as those of the Este, Luhe, W√ºmme and B√∂hme. Some of these streams feed the river system of the Weser, others flow eventually into the Elbe. There is a stone on the summit plateau on which there is a metal cone engraved with the directions and distance of neighbouring hills and towns, near and far. =Totengrund and Steingrund= The best-known valley in the vicinity of the hill is the Totengrund hollow, several hectares in area, south of the museum village of Wilsede. It is an old dead-ice kettle hole with sides up to 40 metres high, covered in heather and juniper bushes. The name means \\"dead ground\\" and was probably so called because of its very infertile, i.e. dead, soil, because the valley is very dry. The Totengrund became the heart of the present-day nature reserve when Egestorf priest, Wilhelm Bode, purchased it in 1906 with donations. There is a controversy involving current plans to build seven wind turbines of a height in excess of 180 metres (over 600 feet) near Behringen. These would be visible from the Totengrund and according to local environmentalists spoil the view. Another nearby valley is the Steingrund, which is covered thickly with stones deposited during the ice age and is a typical heathland dry valley.  Triangulation station  Stone commemorating the survey with a portrait of Carl Friedrich Gauss In 1820 George IV of England, who was also the King of Hanover, tasked the Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Observatory at G√∂ttingen University, Carl Friedrich Gauss, to survey the Kingdom of Hanover. Gauss used the summit of the Wilseder Berg, amongst others, as a triangulation station for his land surveys. Other central triangulation points were the Falkenberg (150 m above NN)Overview of the survey triangulation systems in North Germany to the south and the Hau√üelberg (118 m above NN) to the east. Part of the triangulation network, depicting the Wilseder Berg, was represented on the reverse side of the 4th series of 10 Deutschmark banknotes.10DM note, on the reverse side: Sextant and triangulation network (Wilseder Berg at centre right)  Tourism  The picturesque landscape is popular with tourists. There are horse-drawn carriages for hire to the Wilseder Berg from the villages of Oberhaverbeck, Niederhaverbeck, Undeloh, D√∂hle or Suderm√ºhlen and it can also be reached on foot from Volkwardingen. On a clear day the TV tower at Hamburg can be seen on the horizon. There are also scenic views over the heath towards the west and north.

Torre d'en Galm√©s is a Talayotic site on the island of Menorca, between Alaior and Son Bou, Menorca. The town developed from the start of the Talayotic era (1400 BC) and expanded until the end of the Roman occupation, after which it was abandoned. Buildings were reoccupied and adapted by Muslim refugees from the Reconquista (reconquest of Spain by Christian kingdoms) until the end of the Muslim occupation of the island. Situation The town is situated on a small hill which is steeper on its south side. It has clear views over a large stretch of southern coast (and even to the mountains of Majorca). As the town grew it expanded southwards, and used a remarkably sophisticated water collection system to collect water coming down the hill in cisterns. The town was one of the biggest in the Balearic Islands, and its high position overlooked other neighbouring towns. Talayots There are three talayots at Torre d'en Galm√©s. The top of these stone towers provide the best views over the surrounding countryside, indicating their use as watchtowers. Between the middle and western one is an open space which may have been a public square. In addition to the three talayots, there are remains of defensive walls and peripheral houses had fortified outer walls. Taula There is a horseshoe shaped enclosure with a characteristic Menorcan taula, the T-shaped stone monument that presumably represents a religious site. The taula seems to have been intact until the end of Roman times, but the capital (top horizontal stone) is now separated and lies between the entrance door and the large vertical pillar stone. Two stages of construction are evident in the apse and sides, formed by large surprisingly smooth stones. Houses Facade of a houseInside of a house The talayotic houses are constructed in the characteristic circular fashion. The outside wall is made of large stones, with radial walls making various rooms, and an open air central patio, where the fireplace and cistern were located. One of the excavated houses (house 1) takes advantage of the rocky slope and includes a cave. \\"Sala hip√≤stila\\"In the south of the town, one of the circular buildings features a well preserved \\"Sala Hipostila\\" (room of columns), adjacent to the side of the house and with large rocks still across the roof. The columns are of the Mediterranean type, wider at the top than the bottom. It is believed that this room was used as a storeroom and for livestock. In the Roman period, some houses were modified, with more rectangular shaped interior rooms and smaller stones. Further modifications were made during Muslim occupation. Water Rainwater conservation system In the south of the town, there is a well preserved and remarkably sophisticated water conservation system, involving a sequence of underground cisterns connected by channels to store water. At least one cave that had been used as a pre-talayotic funeral chamber (pre 1400 BC) was used to store water.ROSSELL√ì-BORDOY, G. (1986): El poblado prehist√≥rico de Torre d‚Äôen Gaumes (Alaior), Palma de Mallorca: Institut d‚ÄôEstudis Bale√†rics To clean soil from the water, a filter system was used consisting of concavities filled with stones. Artefacts Among the artefacts discovered at the site is a small fine figure of Imhotep, the Egyptian whose cult spread throughout the Mediterranean.

However, after the 11 September attacks he no longer regarded himself as a socialist and his political thinking became largely dominated by the issue of defending civilization from terrorists and against the totalitarian regimes that protect them. Hitchens nonetheless continued to identify as a Marxist, endorsing the materialist conception of history, but believed that Karl Marx had underestimated the revolutionary nature of capitalism. He sympathized with libertarian ideals of limited state interference, but considered libertarianism not to be a viable system. In the 2000 U.S. presidential election, he supported the independent candidate Ralph Nader. After 9/11, Hitchens advocated the invasion of Iraq. In the 2004 election, he very slightly favored the incumbent Republican President George W. Bush or was neutral and in 2008 he favored the Democratic candidate Barack Obama. Political orientation =First principles= Alexander Linklater has summarized Hitchens' basic intellectual outlook as follows: =British republicanism= Hitchens was a vocal supporter of republicanism in the United Kingdom, advocating the abolition of the monarchy, and in 1990 published the book-long polemic The Monarchy: A Critique of Britain's Favourite Fetish. His 1998 documentary Princess Diana: The Mourning After accused the British media of playing an essential role in creating a national, unchallengeable, and at times hysterical cult of personality surrounding the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, whereas previously they had been extremely critical of her and the monarchy after she had separated and divorced from Charles, Prince of Wales, and was having an affair with Egyptian billionaire son Dodi Fayed. Hitchens claimed the public were behaving irrationally, and that many appeared to not even know why they were mourning. He also scrutinised the level of censorship against criticism of Diana and the monarchy but was accused, in a review by The Independent, of exaggerating on this point. =Labour Party= In 1965, Hitchens joined the Labour Party on the very first day he was eligible to vote, but along with the majority of the Labour students' organization was expelled in 1967, because of what Hitchens called \\"Prime Minister Harold Wilson's contemptible support for the war in Vietnam\\". Since then he stated he had \\"re-enlisted a few times\\" back into the Labour Party. In a 2001 interview with Reason, he said, in 1979, that even though he was a member of the Labour Party, that he wasn't going to vote for the Labour Party, nor could he bring himself to \\"vote conservative.\\" He didn't vote at all in that election. He also stated that by not voting for the Labour Party he was effectively voting for Margaret Thatcher to win, which he said he had \\"secretly hoped would happen.\\" In a 2005 Vanity Fair article, he endorsed Tony Blair in the 2005 general election, mainly due to his support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In a 2009 Slate article, he described that in the late 1970s the Labour Party moved to the right and stated that the downfall of the Labour Party was when Gordon Brown became the Prime Minister. =European Union= Hitchens was a supporter of the European Union. In an appearance on C-SPAN in 1993, Hitchens said, \\"As of 1992, there is a now a Euro passport that makes you free to travel within the boundaries of... member countries, and I've always liked the idea of European unity, and so I held out for a Euro passport. So I travel as a European.\\" Hitchens - For the Sake of Argument (1993) Speaking at the launch of his brother Peter Hitchens' book, The Abolition of Britain at Conway Hall in London, Hitchens denounced the so-called Eurosceptic movement, describing it as \\"the British version of fascism\\". He went on to say, \\"Scepticism is a title of honour. These people are not sceptical. They‚Äôre fanatical. They‚Äôre dogmatic\\".Christopher Hitchens 1999 Discussing 'The Abolition of Britain' with Peter Hitchens =Northern Ireland= During a debate with George Galloway in 2005, Hitchens revealed that he was \\"a lifelong supporter of the reunification of Ireland\\". Many times, when discussing \\"the Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland, Hitchens would refer to their location as simply \\"Ireland\\", rather than \\"Northern Ireland\\", as for example in an article written for Slate in 2007, discussing the power-sharing and devolved government in Northern Ireland and describing it as \\"an agreement to divide the spoils of Ireland's six northeastern counties\\". During the IRA bombing campaigns on Great Britain, which began in the nineteen-seventies, Hitchens claimed that he had \\"kept two sets of books: I didn‚Äôt like bombs, I didn‚Äôt like the partition of Ireland.\\" =Libertarianism and capitalism= In a 2001 interview with Reason, Hitchens said he had been interested in libertarian ideas when he was younger, but set aside those interests in the 1960s. He stated that capitalism had become the more revolutionary economic system, and he welcomed globalisation as \\"innovative and internationalist\\", but added, \\"I don't think that the contradictions, as we used to say, of the system, are by any means all resolved.\\" He also stated that he had a renewed interest in the freedom of the individual from the state, but that he still considered libertarianism \\"ahistorical\\" both on the world stage and in the work of creating a stable and functional society, adding that libertarians are \\"more worried about the over- mighty state than the unaccountable corporation\\" whereas \\"the present state of affairs ... combines the worst of bureaucracy with the worst of the insurance companies.\\" He also said that libertarians did not have a clear foreign policy stance. In a 2001 C-SPAN appearance, he told a caller: = Objectivism = Hitchens said of Objectivism, \\"I have always found it quaint, and rather touching, that there is a movement in the US that thinks Americans are not yet selfish enough\\". =Marxism and socialism= In a 2001 interview with Reason, Hitchens said he became a Marxist and a Trotskyist in his teens, beliefs that further developed during his time at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1966, he was demonstrating in Trafalgar Square against the Vietnam War. In 1967, he joined the International Socialists while at Balliol College, Oxford. Under the influence of Peter Sedgwick, who translated the writings of Russian revolutionary and Soviet dissident Victor Serge, Hitchens forged an ideological interest in Trotskyist and anti-Stalinist socialism. Shortly after he joined \\"a small but growing post-Trotskyist Luxemburgist sect\\". This organisation is now known as the Alliance for Workers' Liberty. He became a socialist \\"largely [as] the outcome of a study of history, taking sides ... in the battles over industrialism and war and empire.\\" He was also drawn into the political left by his anger over the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, racism and \\"oligarchy\\", including that of \\"the unaccountable corporation.\\" He also said in the same interview with Reason that he could no longer say \\"I am a socialist\\". Socialists, he claimed, had ceased to offer a positive alternative to the capitalist system. In 2006, in a town hall meeting in Pennsylvania debating the Jewish Tradition with Martin Amis, Hitchens commented on his political philosophy by stating, \\"I am no longer a socialist, but I still am a Marxist\\". In a June 2010 interview with The New York Times, he stated that \\"I still think like a Marxist in many ways. I think the materialist conception of history is valid. I consider myself a very conservative Marxist\\". In 2009, in an article for The Atlantic entitled \\"The Revenge of Karl Marx\\", Hitchens frames the late-2000s recession in terms of Marx's economic analysis and notes how much Marx admired the capitalist system that he called for the end of, but says that Marx ultimately failed to grasp how revolutionary capitalist innovation was. Hitchens was an admirer of Che Guevara, yet in an essay written in 1997, he distanced himself from Che, and referred to the mythos surrounding him as a \\"cult\\". In 2004 he re-emphasized his positive view of Che, commenting that \\"[Che's] death meant a lot to me and countless like me at the time. He was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do ‚Äì fought and died for his beliefs.\\" He continued to regard Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin as great men, and the October Revolution as a necessary event in the modernisation of Russia. In 2005, Hitchens praised Lenin's creation of \\"secular Russia\\" and his attacks on the Russian Orthodox Church, describing the church's power as \\"absolute warren of backwardness and evil and superstition\\". In God is not Great, Hitchens called Marxism his \\"own secular faith\\" that \\"has been shaken and discarded, not without pain.\\" He referred to his period of Marxist faith as \\"when I was a Marxist.\\" According to Andrew Sullivan, his last words were \\"Capitalism, downfall.\\" =American presidential endorsements= President Bill Clinton Hitchens became increasingly disenchanted by the presidency of Bill Clinton, accusing him of being a rapist and a liar. Hitchens said the missile attacks by Clinton on Sudan constituted a war crime.Christopher Hitchens, No One Left To Lie To (Verso, 2000) 2000 United States presidential election third party protest at the headquarters of the Commission on Presidential Debates Hitchens supported Ralph Nader in the 2000 US presidential election. He elaborated on his support for Nader in a discussion with Eric Alterman on Bloggingheads.tv, indicating that he was disenchanted with the candidacy of both George W. Bush and Al Gore.  President George W. Bush  Prior to the September 11 attacks in 2001, and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, Hitchens was critical of President George W. Bush's \\"non-interventionist\\" foreign policy. He also criticised Bush's support for intelligent design and capital punishment. Hitchens defended Bush's post-11 September foreign policy, but he also criticised the actions of US troops in Abu Ghraib and Haditha, and the US government's use of waterboarding, which, after voluntarily undergoing it, he argued was definitely torture. 2004 United States presidential election Hitchens supported George W. Bush in the 2004 US presidential election. He made a brief return to The Nation just before the election and wrote that he was \\"slightly\\" for Bush; shortly afterwards, Slate polled its staff on their positions on the candidates and mistakenly printed Hitchens's vote as pro-John Kerry. Hitchens shifted his opinion to \\"neutral\\", saying: \\"It's absurd for liberals to talk as if Kristallnacht is impending with Bush, and it's unwise and indecent for Republicans to equate Kerry with capitulation. There's no one to whom he can surrender, is there? I think that the nature of the jihadist enemy will decide things in the end\\". 2008 United States presidential election Hitchens supported Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. In an article for Slate he stated, \\"I used to call myself a single-issue voter on the essential question of defending civilization against its terrorist enemies and their totalitarian protectors, and on that 'issue' I hope I can continue to expose and oppose any ambiguity.\\" He was critical of both main party candidates, Obama and John McCain, but wrote that Obama would be the better choice. Hitchens went on to call McCain \\"senile\\", and his choice of running mate Sarah Palin \\"absurd\\", calling Palin a \\"pathological liar\\" and a \\"national disgrace\\". Hitchens also wrote that \\"Obama is greatly overrated\\" and that the Obama-Biden ticket \\"show[s] some signs of being able and willing to profit from experience\\". =The American Revolution= After his disenchantment with socialism, Hitchens increasingly emphasized the centrality of the American Revolution and the U.S. Constitution to his political philosophy. As early as 2002, Hitchens wrote, \\"as the third millennium gets under way, and as the Russian and Chinese and Cuban revolutions drop below the horizon, it is possible to argue that the American revolution, with its promise of cosmopolitan democracy, is the only 'model' revolution that humanity has left to it\\".Hitchens, Christopher (2002), Why Orwell Matters, Basic Books, pg 105 His enthusiasm for the U.S. Bill of Rights contrasts with a dim opinion of constitutional politics on the other side of the Atlantic. Hitchens notes, \\"the utter failure [of the EU] to compose a viable constitution\\" and the \\"brevity of the British constitution, perhaps because the motherland of the English-speaking peoples has absent-mindedly failed to evolve one in written form\\".Hitchens, Christopher (2007), An Anglosphere Future, City Journal, Reprinted in Arguably, p. 105 Foreign policy =Bosnian War= Hitchens cited the Bosnian War as monumentally changing his views on military intervention, commenting that for the first time he found himself on the side of neoconservatives. In an interview with Johann Hari he said: Hitchens argued that the choice in Yugoslavia was between a multi-ethnic plural democracy led by Muslim president Alija Izetbegoviƒá in Bosnia and a fascistic, nationalistically inspired ethnically-cleansed state driven by Serbian leader Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. He called Milo≈°eviƒá a fascist and a \\"national-socialist\\", and condemned his war crimes in the Yugoslav Wars. He considered the Croatian nationalist president Franjo Tudjman \\"equally disgusting\\" for colluding with Milo≈°eviƒá on a partition of Bosnia and empowering Croatian war criminals. In God Is Not Great, he wrote about Christian Orthodox Serbian and Roman Catholic Croatian nationalism- and religion-inspired crimes against the Muslim Bosnians, at the hands of proponents of \\"Greater Serbia\\" and Croatian \\"revived Ustashe formations\\" during this period which are \\"often forgotten\\". He was highly critical of Western inaction in protection of Bosnian Muslims, partially blaming this on the Clinton administration and specifically Hillary Clinton. =Gulf War= Hitchens deplored and opposed the 1990‚Äì91 Gulf War in which the US expelled Iraq from Kuwait after a seven-month invasion and occupation of its neighbor undertaken in an effort to absorb it as its 19th province. He contended that President George H. W. Bush's supposedly principled enthusiasm for the \\"cause\\" of \\"liberating\\" Kuwait was nothing more than realpolitik. In the continuation of a national policy dating back to Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon in 1972, the latest \\"cause was yet another move in the policy of keeping a region divided and embittered, and therefore accessible to the franchisers of weaponry and the owners of black gold\\". However, after the war, Hitchens scolded those within the US who had opposed the war by observing that \\"the peace movement in this country in my opinion acted in a very narrow, isolationist, and almost chauvinistic way. It said that a war was more or less alright with it as long as it could be guaranteed in advance that American casualties could be kept low... I thought that was a dishonourably narrow way of approaching the question. ... When large numbers of Iraqis were turned into soap...and many others, as we've since found out, were bulldozed and buried alive and in other ways done away with and people don't even want to think about the body count ...because they‚Äôre afraid of what they might find out.\\"Hitchens, Christopher, \\"The Middle East and American Democracy\\", Keynote Speech, 45th Annual Conference of the Middle East Institute; Broadcast on CSPAN2, 4 October 1991. (Comments are about 37 minutes into this Youtube clip.) =Israeli‚àíPalestinian conflict= Hitchens described Zionism as being based on Herzl's \\"initial demagogic lie (actually two lies) that a land without a people needs a people without a land.\\" He went further, saying \\"Zionism is a form of Bourgeoisie Nationalism\\" when debating the Jewish Tradition with Martin Amis at a Town hall function in Pennsylvania\\" Hitchens supported Israel's right to exist, but argued that \\"one must not insult or degrade or humiliate people\\" and that he \\"would be opposed to this maltreatment of the Palestinians if it took place on a remote island with no geopolitical implications\\". Hitchens described Zionism as \\"an ethno- nationalist quasi-religious ideology\\" but argued that Zionism \\"nonetheless has founded a sort of democratic state which isn't any worse in its practice than many others with equally dubious origins.\\" He stated that Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory in order to achieve security for Israel is \\"doomed to fail in the worst possible way\\", and the cessation of this \\"appallingly racist and messianic delusion\\" would \\"confront the internal clerical and chauvinist forces which want to instate a theocracy for Jews\\". Hitchens contended that the \\"solution of withdrawal would not satisfy the jihadists\\" and wondered \\"What did they imagine would be the response of the followers of the Prophet [Muhammad]?\\" Hitchens bemoaned the transference of Arab secularism into religious terrorism as a means of democratisation: \\"the most depressing and wretched spectacle of the past decade, for all those who care about democracy and secularism, has been the degeneration of Palestinian Arab nationalism into the theocratic and thanatocratic hell of Hamas and Islamic Jihad\\". He maintained that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a \\"trivial squabble\\" that has become \\"so dangerous to all of us\\" because of \\"the faith-based element.\\" On 14 November 2004, Hitchens noted: Hitchens had previously collaborated on this issue with Edward Said, publishing the 1988 book Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question. Hitchens had said of himself, \\"I am an Anti-Zionist. I'm one of those people of Jewish descent who believes that Zionism would be a mistake even if there were no Palestinians.\\" A review of his autobiography Hitch-22 in The Jewish Daily Forward refers to Hitchens \\"at the time [that he had learned that his grandparents were Jews, he had been] a prominent anti-Zionist\\" and says that he viewed Zionism \\"as an injustice against the Palestinians\\". Others have commented on his anti-Zionism as well. At other times for example speaking at 2nd annual Memorial for Daniel Pearl, and in print in an article for The Atlantic he had made comments against the terrorism against Jews in the Middle East. Hitchens stated \\"But the Jews of the Arab lands were expelled again in revenge for the defeat of Palestinian nationalistic aspirations, in 1947‚Äì48, and now the absolute most evil and discredited fabrication of Jew-baiting Christian Europe ‚Äì The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ‚Äì is eagerly promulgated in the Hamas charter and on the group's Web site and recycled through a whole nexus of outlets that includes schools as well as state-run television stations\\". In Slate magazine, Hitchens pondered the notion that, instead of curing antisemitism through the creation of a Jewish state, \\"Zionism has only replaced and repositioned\\" it, saying: \\"there are three groups of 6 million Jews. The first 6 million live in what the Zionist movement used to call Palestine. The second 6 million live in the United States. The third 6 million are distributed mainly among Russia, France, Britain, and Argentina. Only the first group lives daily in range of missiles that can be (and are) launched by people who hate Jews.\\" Hitchens argued that instead of supporting Zionism, Jews should help \\"secularise and reform their own societies\\", believing that unless one is religious, \\"what the hell are you doing in the greater Jerusalem area in the first place?\\" Indeed, Hitchens claimed that the only justification for Zionism given by Jews is a religious one. =Kurdistan= Hitchens was a longtime observer of the cruelty of Saddam Hussein and publicly called for his removal, albeit only beginning in 1998. This led him to support the establishment of a self-governing state for the Kurds with political autonomy, if not full independence. He also wore a lapel pin with the flag of Kurdistan on it, to show his solidarity with the Kurds. =War on terror= September 11 attacks In the months following the 9/11 attacks, Hitchens and Noam Chomsky debated the nature of radical Islam and the proper response to it in a highly charged exchange of letters in The Nation, including discussion of whether any comparison could be legitimately made between the 9/11 attacks and the 1998 Al Shifa bombing by the US. Approximately a year after the 9/11 attacks and his exchanges with Chomsky, Hitchens left The Nation, claiming that its editors, readers and contributors considered John Ashcroft a bigger threat than Osama bin Laden, and were making excuses on behalf of Islamist terrorism; in the following months he wrote articles increasingly at odds with his former colleagues. War in Afghanistan Hitchens strongly supported US military actions in Afghanistan, particularly in his \\"Fighting Words\\" columns in Slate. Iraq War Hitchens' employed the term \\"Islamofascist\\" and supported the Iraq War causing his critics to consider him a \\"neoconservative\\". Hitchens, however, refused to embrace this designation, insisting, \\"I'm not any kind of conservative\\". In 2004, Hitchens stated that neoconservative support for US intervention in Iraq convinced him that he was \\"on the same side as the neo- conservatives\\" when it came to contemporary foreign policy issues, and characterized himself as an unqualified \\"supporter of Paul Wolfowitz.\\" He referred to his associations as \\"temporary neocon allies\\". In this period he opined that \\"the Bush administration [...] has redefined the lazy term 'conservative' to mean someone who is impatient with the status quo.\\" In the years after the fatwa issued against Salman Rushdie in response to his novel The Satanic Verses, Hitchens became increasingly critical of what he called \\"excuse making\\" on the left. At the same time, he was attracted to the foreign policy ideas of some on the Republican-right that promoted pro-liberalism intervention, especially the neoconservative group that included Paul Wolfowitz. Around this time, he befriended the Iraqi dissident and businessman Ahmed Chalabi. Christopher Hitchens argued the case for the Iraq War in a 2003 collection of essays entitled A Long Short War: The Postponed Liberation of Iraq, and participated in public debates on the topic with George Galloway, Scott Ritter, and his brother Peter Hitchens. In its obituary of Hitchens, The Economist wrote that, \\"on the most consequential political issue of the last decade of his life, the bullshit got him.\\"\\"Christopher Hitchens: The struggle against bullshit\\" The Economist, 16 December 2011 Human rights violations at Abu Ghraib and Haditha Hitchens criticised human rights abuses by US forces in Iraq but argued that conditions had improved considerably compared either to Saddam Hussein's previous regime or to previous US military actions in Vietnam. In 2005, Hitchens criticised the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib but argued that overall \\"prison conditions at Abu Ghraib have improved markedly and dramatically since the arrival of Coalition troops in Baghdad\\", arguing that \\"before March 2003, Abu Ghraib was an abattoir, a torture chamber, and a concentration camp.\\" In a 5 June 2006 article on the alleged killings of Iraqi civilians by U.S. Marines in Haditha, Hitchens argued that whether or not a massacre had taken place, comparisons with the My Lai massacre in Vietnam were \\"so much propaganda and hot air\\" that ignored substantial changes in the rules of engagement and US Army procedures and training designed to prevent and discourage such an event. He argued that lesson had been learned such that \\"as a consequence, a training film about My Lai ‚Äì \\"if anything like this happens, you have really, truly screwed up\\" ‚Äì has been in use for U. S. soldiers for some time\\". Pre-war American and British Intelligence In a variety of articles and interviews, Hitchens asserted that British intelligence was correct in claiming that Saddam had attempted to buy uranium from Niger, and that US envoy Joseph Wilson had been dishonest in his public denials of it. He also pointed to discovered munitions in Iraq that violated U. N. Security Council Resolutions 686 and 687, the cease-fire agreements ending the 1991 Iraq-Kuwait conflict. On 19 March 2007, Hitchens asked himself whether Western intelligence sources should have known that Iraq had 'no stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.' In his response, Hitchens stated that: Saddam Hussein In July 2007, the New Statesman printed selected portions of a 1976 piece by Hitchens which they claimed \\"took a more admiring view of the Iraqi dictator\\" than his later strong support for ousting Saddam Hussein. (originally published 1976) In this Hitchens pointed to Iraq's military strength, oil reserves and young leadership to argue that Iraq was \\"a force to be reckoned with\\" and described Saddam Hussein as a leader \\"who has sprung from being an underground revolutionary gunman to perhaps the first visionary Arab statesman since Nasser.\\" He also argued: He argued that the means through which the Baathist regime rose to power were similar to that of Iran: having crushed any political dissent and notions of an independent Kurdish state. He stated that the Ba'ath party \\"point to efforts made by the party press to stimulate criticism of revolutionary shortcomings\\" but that these \\"fall rather short of permitting any organised opposition\\". He claimed that Iraq defended this by claiming \\"that the country is surrounded by enemies and attacked by imperialist intrigue\\" but that this had led to the repression of Kurdish nationalists. Waterboarding Hitchens was asked by Vanity Fair to experience waterboarding for himself at a U.S. Army training facility. In May 2008, Hitchens voluntarily underwent the procedure. Hitchens stopped the procedure after 11 seconds and subsequently endorsed the view that it was \\"torture.\\" He concluded, \\"If waterboarding does not constitute torture, then there is no such thing as torture.\\" =Lebanon= Hitchens described Lebanon as \\"the most plural society in the region\\" and criticized the Syrian regime for continuing to manipulate the country by proxies and by surrogates notably Hezbollah and the SSNP. Hezbollah In an article written on Slate, Hitchens stated: Domestic policy =Civil liberties= Abortion Hell's Angel ‚Äì Mother Teresa of Calcutta (1994), a documentary by Christopher Hitchens Hitchens stated, \\"[an] unborn child seems to me to be a real concept. It's not a growth or an appendix. You can't say the rights question doesn't come up. I don't think a woman should be forced to choose, or even can be\\", and, \\"as a materialist, I think it has been demonstrated that an embryo is a separate body and entity\\". Showing a desire to recognise the unborn as a life, he also affirmed a need for the right to abortion, stating, \\"the second-best fallback solution, which may sometimes be desirable for other reasons, is termination of pregnancy... all thinking people recognise a painful conflict of rights and interest in this question\\". Hitchens opposed the overturning of Roe v. Wade and instead hoped for science to develop new solutions to unwanted pregnancies \\"that will make abortion more like a contraceptive procedure than a surgical one.\\" He strongly criticized the encouragement of sexual abstinence within the pro-life movement of the Christian right, and the equating of contraceptives to abortion, as expressed by Mother Teresa and representatives of the Roman Catholic Church. Capital punishment Hitchens was a lifelong opponent of capital punishment. In a 2001 interview with Reason, Hitchens recalled that this was the very first issue on which he ever decided to take a stand in his youth. The reason for his opposition to capital punishment was that it gave too much power to the government. He later publicly opposed use of the death penalty for Saddam Hussein, an issue he discussed at length in his November 2006 essay \\"Don't Hang Saddam\\" for Slate. Drug policy Hitchens has called for the abolition of the \\"War on Drugs,\\" which he described as an \\"authoritarian war\\" during a debate with William F. Buckley. Hitchens favored the legalization of cannabis for both recreational and medicinal purposes, and said, \\"Marijuana is a medicine. I have heard and read convincing arguments and had convincing testimony from real people who say that marijuana is a very useful medicine for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and for glaucoma. To keep that out of the reach of the sick, it seems to me, is sadistic\\".Page 571 of the book titled \\"atheism\\" by By George H. Smith. Page 571 Genital integrity Hitchens was a genital integrity activist, strongly criticizing the tradition of both male circumcision and female genital mutilation. In accordance with his antitheism, Hitchens described the tolerance of metzitzah b'peh (a Jewish tradition of sucking blood from the penis after the removal of the male foreskin) as \\"another disgusting religious practice\\". Gun rights Hitchens philosophically supported gun rights and was generally opposed to gun control. On the subject of the second amendment, Hitchens argued that as both an outright ban on guns and relying on a citizen militia for the national defence were equally as idealistic and utopian, and that as gun control created a duopoly of force between the state and criminals, it would be more desirable to encourage training among average citizens so they might develop a better relationship with firearms. Although Hitchens repeatedly stated a broad support for the right to keep and bear arms, he was not an enthusiastic advocate and he rarely publicly discussed his views. LGBT rights Hitchens was a supporter of LGBT rights. He opposed sodomy laws and supported same-sex marriage. He argued that the legalization of same- sex marriage was the \\"socialization of homosexuality\\" and \\"demonstrates the spread of conservatism\\" among the gay community. NSA warrantless surveillance In January 2006, Hitchens joined with four other individuals and four organisations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Greenpeace, as plaintiffs in a lawsuit, ACLU v. NSA, challenging Bush's warrantless domestic spying program; the lawsuit was filed by the ACLU. Voting rights In March 2005, Hitchens supported further investigation into voting irregularities in Ohio during the 2004 presidential election. Religion At the New York Public Library in May 2007, Hitchens debated Al Sharpton on the issue of theism and anti-theism, giving rise to a memorable exchange about Mormonism in particular. In God is Not Great, Hitchens contended that, Hitchens was accused of \\"anti-Catholic bigotry\\" by others, including Brent Bozell and UCLA Law Professor Stephen Bainbridge. When Joe Scarborough on 12 March 2004 asked Hitchens whether he was \\"consumed with hatred for conservative Catholics\\", Hitchens responded that he was not and that he just thinks that \\"all religious belief is sinister and infantile\\". In 2005, Hitchens praised Lenin's creation of \\"secular Russia\\" and his destruction of the Russian Orthodox Church, describing it as \\"an absolute warren of backwardness and evil and superstition.\\" In an interview with Radar in 2007, Hitchens said that if the Christian right's agenda were implemented in the United States \\"It wouldn't last very long and would, I hope, lead to civil war, which they will lose, but for which it would be a great pleasure to take part.\\" On 4 April 2009, Hitchens debated Christian philosopher William Lane Craig at Biola University on the topic \\"Does God Exist?\\" before both a live and closed circuit audience of over 15,000. =Islamism= Hitchens was deeply shocked by the 14 February 1989 fatwa against his longtime friend Salman Rushdie. He became increasingly critical of what he called \\"theocratic fascism\\" or \\"fascism with an Islamic face\\": radical Islamists who supported the fatwa against Rushdie and sought the recreation of the medieval caliphate. Hitchens is often credited with coining the term \\"Islamofascism\\", but Hitchens himself denied it, attributing its coinage to Malise Ruthven. Hitchens did use the term Islamic fascism for an article he wrote for The Nation, shortly after the September 11 attacks, but this phrase also had an earlier history.

The station, along with FM sister stations WEGE, WWSR and WFGF, share studio facilities on Cable Road in Lima. WCIT must operate with reduced power after local sunset to avoid interference with a Canadian clear channel signal, reserved for Montreal by international treaty (it was held by CINW until that station's shutdown in 2010). History Originally broadcasting only during the daytime hours, WCIT was founded in 1959 by the owners of The Lima Citizen. The Citizen folded in 1964, shortly thereafter, WCIT was sold off by the now- former newspaper's owners to Riggs Broadcasting, who also owned a combination AM/FM combination in Lansing, Michigan. Riggs Broadcasting owners were Richard Riggs, his wife Norma Riggs, Sales Manager Bob Rice and Chief Engineer Ray Allen. WCIT would find a new studio home February 15, 1968 in downtown Lima. The studios were located on the 9th floor, suite 940 of Cook Tower, which was Lima's tallest building at the time. The move to a new studio location occurred in 1971 with FM sister WLSR.. It would be known as the \\"Lima Broadcast House\\" at 1301 Cable Road. Much of its programming consisted of an hourly local newscast and a Top Forty format using the branding \\"Great 94\\". WCIT became the market leader within a few years being the most recognized name in the market for news and music. Jim Baldridge, a Lima native had his start at WCIT in the late 1960s before moving on to WIZE in Springfield and later at WHIO-TV in Dayton. 1972 ushered in an era of the small town top 40 radio station with a big city sound. Jim Wood (Robert Marquitz), Tommy Judge (Carl David Hamilton), Johnny Williams, Skip Essex, Rick Lane, Chuck Martin (L Harrison), Dave Shannon, Bill Apple, Rob Bromley, Don Sherwood and Steve R. Nelson. Gordy Price (later of WIMT) spent part of his career beginnings at WCIT in 1974 as afternoon personality before automating in 1975 as \\"Rock 94.\\" Price also worked at WMVR, WING and the former WTOO (now WPKO) before his move to WIMT in 1987. In 1986 Riggs Broadcasting sold WCIT-AM/WLSR-FM to Allen Broadcasting. Upon taking over the radio station they flipped WCIT-AM to oldies. In 1991, WCIT switched to all news and talk, featuring a three-hour morning news block with local anchors Bill Holden and Anne Nashif and national news from CBS at the top of each hour and NBC Radio News at the bottom of the hour. Regional news, weather and sports were provided by the Ohio News Network. WCIT also added Rush Limbaugh to its lineup, boosting the station's listenership and ratings. In 1996, Allen Broadcasting switched the format of sister station WLSR from Adult Contemporary to Urban using the calls WLJM. Then in 1997, WCIT-AM/WLJM-FM were sold to Forever Broadcasting of Pennsylvania who owned WZOQ-FM/WYRX-FM. Forever Broadcasting moved the Urban Format to the AM side and turned WLJM-FM into a Soft Adult Contemporary again. WLJM's call letters originally referred to its former nickname \\"Lima's 940 JAMZ\\" for its urban contemporary and R&B; format. 940 JAMZ was the local affiliate of ABC Radio's \\"Hits and Oldies\\" satellite R&B; format (also known as \\"The Touch\\") as well as the Tom Joyner Morning Show which were both discontinued after the station was sold by Forever Broadcasting to Maverick Media in 2005. Beforehand, 940 JAMZ was locally originating with personalities. It then changed format to \\"Lima's ESPN 940,\\" carrying the programming of the national sports network ESPN Radio, in a move that created a large outcry among the African-American community in Lima as WLJM was Lima's only radio station specifically targeting Black listeners. Some local sports programming included \\"Sports Talk With Koza\\" hosted by former WLIO-TV sports director Vince Koza, \\"Sportsrap with Matt and Matt\\" and TALK with Ron Williams. In 2007, the WLJM call letters were replaced with WZOQ, calls that were previously used at 92.1 FM, which became WWSR and is now WFGF. On June 1, 2009, the sports/talk format was moved to the FM dial on the 93.1 FM facility and taking the WWSR calls. The country format and WFGF calls were then relocated to the 92.1 FM facility, and the 940 facility reverted to their original WCIT calls and assumed an oldies format. On January 10, 2011 WCIT changed their format from oldies to news/talk. In July 2013, Childers Media Group purchased WCIT and its Lima clustermates from Maverick Media for $2.1 million. Childers Media Group was in turn acquired by Wolf Boom Radio in 2017. On January 6, 2014, WCIT re-launched as Sports Talk 940. On July 1, 2019, WCIT dropped the sports format and began stunting with Christmas music with the sign-on of FM translator W253CM 98.5; on July 4, 2019, it launched a classic country format, branded as 98.5 The Legend.

Gilinski resides in London. According to Forbes, he is the second richest person in Colombia, with a net worth of US$3.6 billion as of 2020.  Early life  He is the son of Isaac Gilinski Sragowicz, a banker and himself the son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants. Gilinski earned his BS in Industrial Engineering from Georgia Tech in 1978, and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1980.  Banking  In the 1990s, Gilinski acquired the Colombian assets of BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International) for a nominal sum after its global collapse. Renamed Banco Andino, it became one of the most efficient banks in the Colombian banking system within four years. The Gilinski Group sold the reconstituted bank for a reported $70 million. The family then moved to purchase Banco de Colombia for $365 million, in what was then the largest privatization in Colombia's history. A group of premier private equity investors led by Morgan Stanley Asset Management investing $65 million, billionaire George Soros investing $50 million and Tiger Asset Management with $35 million together with more than 100 other European and North American institutional investors co-invested with Gilinski. Later, the family sold control of the bank to Banco Industrial Colombiano, and its controlling stakeholder Sindicato Antioque√±o, in a deal valued at $800 million, among Colombia's largest deals. Gilinski received $418 million for its stake and retained a minority position in the new bank as part of the deal. As of 2018, Bancolombia was the largest in Colombia with a market capitalization of $11 billion on the NYSE. In 2003, Gilinski acquired and subsequently merged Banco Sudameris and Banco Tequendama. This merger created GNB Sudameris, a bank with assets of over US $10 billion that ranks among the largest private Colombian banks as of 2018. The purchase of Servibanca, an ATM network with over 2,600 machines, and Suma Valores, a stock exchange commission agent company, has further expanded the network. In May 2012, HSBC announced the sale of its Latin American operations (Colombia, Peru, Paraguay) to Banco GNB Sudameris for $400 million in cash. In September 2013, Banco Sabadell announced that Gilinski became its largest shareholder as the anchor investor in a US $1.8 billion capital raise. Through the ABB and share rights issue, Gilinski's investment totals approximately $500 million. Banco Sabadell is the 5th largest bank in Spain, with over US $220 billion in assets and a 13% market share. The Gilinski group also owns Yupi, a snack food company in Latin America, and exports to nine countries. Gilinski Group also owns Rimax Plastics, which was founded by his father Isaac Gilinski. In December 2019, Gilinski became the largest shareholder of Metro Bank, after upping his interest in the business to 6.1%. In May 2020, he increased his stake to 9%. Gilinski holds his stake through British Virgin Islands-based Spaldy Investments.  Real estate  In partnership with London & Regional Properties, Gilinski has developed the Panama Pacifico business and residential development in Panama City, Panama. Jaime Gilinski and his partners Ian and Richard Livingstone beat 16 other international firms in a competition to develop the project. The project, based on the former Howard Air Force Base in Panama, includes of land, which makes it one of the largest development projects in the world.  Philanthropy  In the 1990s, the Gilinskis contributed US$8 million to the Fundacion Santa Fe. This was during Jaime Gilinski's time as chairman of Banco de Colombia. La Fundaci√≥n Santa Fe de Bogot√° supports Santa Fe Hospital in Bogot√°. Founded in 1972, this hospital is recognized as Colombia‚Äôs most technologically advanced. Gilinski is the chair of Capital Projects for The Chabad House at Harvard University.

Though its date of creation is uncertain, it was possibly composed in 1793. It deals with the image of the River Otter, near Coleridge's childhood home in Devon. Background Editions of Coleridge's works edited by James Dykes Campbell (1899) and by E. H. Coleridge (1912) determine that the \\"To the River Otter\\" is from 1793. However, J. C. C. Mays (2001) argues that there is no certainty for the earlier dating as the poem does not appear in Coleridge's 1796 collection of poems and was not described as \\"juvenilia\\" in his later collections. The first 11 lines were used in Coleridge's 1796 poem \\"Recollection\\" and published as a sonnet in the late 1796 Sonnets from Various Authors. The poem was eventually republished in Coleridge's 1797 collection of poems and in all of the later collections.Mays 2001 pp. 299‚Äì300 \\"Recollections\\" was published 2 April 1796 in Coleridge's The Watchman periodical.Mays 2001 p. 259 Poem The sonnet portrays a view of the river Otter from a child's perspective:McKusick 2000 p. 131 The final line ends with a regretful use of \\"ah\\" that is common to Coleridge's poems:Kneale 1999 p. 89 =Recollections= \\"Recollections\\" is a complete poem made up of lines from three of Coleridge's poems: \\"Absence: A Poem\\", \\"To the River Otter\\", and \\"Anna and Harland\\". The lines contain little alteration. Lines 13 and 17‚Äì26 are variations of lines 1‚Äì11 of \\"To the River Otter\\": Themes Coleridge, while writing the poem, focused on the sonnet form and sought to recreate the poetry of Bowles while he put together a collection of his own poems, those of Bowles, Charles Lloyd, and others.Curran 1986 pp. 35‚Äì36 The ideas within the poem is thematically connected to Bowles's To the River Wensbeck, To Evening, and To the River Itchen. Bowles's and Coleridge's poems are part of the larger tradition of 18th-century poems dealing with rivers, including many poems within Egerton Brydges's Sonnets and Other Poems, Charlotte Smith's Elegiac Sonnets, and Thomas Warton's To the River Lodon.Mays 2001 p. 299 These, in turn, establish the tradition that William Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey would later join. The opening of Tintern Abbey is related to how Coleridge opens \\"To the River Otter\\" and how Warton opens \\"To the River Lodon\\".Cox 1996 p. 42 According to William Wimsatt, nature is connected to humanity, and the poem relies on the river to talk about childhood. However, Hendrik Rookmaaker points out that there is little evidence to read the poem in such a manner. There is little justification for the reader to find an unconscious meaning to the poem, and indeed, such a reading would go against the way nature is used within the poem; nature is greater than humanity, and the Romantics like Coleridge are trying to find meaning within nature and are searching for the divine within nature.Rookmaaker 1984 pp. 28‚Äì29 James McKusick argues that the transparency of nature within the poem allows for the narrator to witness what is hidden within nature, which is \\"specifically the intense awareness of a child peering into the shimmering depths of a wild, free-flowing river.\\" Critical response A review in the July 1798 Critical Review only says in regard to the poem, \\"From the new sonnets we select that which is addressed to the river Otter, as it will gratify those who love to refer to the scenes of early enjoyment\\".Jackson 1996 qtd. 42 In 1975, Wimsatt points out that \\"What is of great importance to note is that Coleridge's own sonnet 'To the River Otter' (while not a completely successful poem) shows a remarkable intensification of such [metaphorical] color.\\"Wimsatt 1975 p. 28 Later, M. H. Abrahms, addressing Coleridge's use of Bowles as a source to imitate, says, \\"Why Coleridge should have been moved to idolatry by so slender, if genuine, a talent as that of Bowles has been an enigma of literary history.\\"Abrams 2006 p. 208 At the end of the 20th-century, Jack Stillinger argues, in regard to the 1797 edition of Coleridge's works, that \\"Apart from the addition of works by Lamb and Lloyd, 1797 contains ten new poems by Coleridge, of which Sonnet to the River Otter and Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement are the most important.\\"Stillinger 1994 p. 13 Notes References * Abrams, M.

Notable American Women: The Modern Period : a Biographical Dictionary. Cambridge, Mass: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1980. She emigrated to the United States when she was sixteen in 1888. Once in America she worked as a dishwasher at a lumberjacks' boarding house in Ludington, Michigan. She moved to Chicago where she worked in a garment factory and as a shoe stitcher in West Pullman. She joined the Boot and Shoe Workers Union and was elected president of the women's stitchers Local 94 in 1900. She became a leader in the Women's Trade Union League in Chicago, Illinois. She gained valuable experience from the Women's Trade Union League in public administration. She then applied these skills to her work with the Women's Bureau in the U.S. Department of Labor which she was the first director of in 1920. She directed and used the Bureau for 25 years to better the working conditions, wages, and hours for women. And even once she retired from office Mary Anderson continued to fight for the rights of working women. =Woman's Trade Union League 1900‚Äì1919= The main goal of this league was to organize women and to gain support for a union. This union would strive to get safer factory conditions for women workers. Mary Anderson had first hand experience of the very dangerous working conditions of the factory floor and knew things had to be improved. It was during Anderson's time in the WTUL that's she began a friendship with Jane Addams who would greatly influence Anderson's views on helping all people, not just women. In Anderson's eulogy to Addams she tells of how, \\"'She was not one of those feminist who are for women alone. Her heart and her brilliant mind recognized that as long as one group could be exploited society as a whole must suffer'\\". Anderson too believed that the work of feminists should not be constrained to only women's issues but more importantly address broader social concerns. 40,000 garment workers went on strike in Chicago in 1910. This was Anderson's and the WTUL chance to organize these women and to use the tactics of the male unions to gain better pay for pant makers and better working conditions. During the strike the main goal of the WTUL was to relieve distress of families by donating food clothes and coal to those who were not getting paid and had very little money saved up. The strike seemed to be working as employers were beginning to give in to the demands for collective bargaining of the garment workers. However the strike was abruptly called off by the United Garment Workers without any forewarning. Anderson was disappointed and shocked. She felt that for how much people endured through the strike they gained very little from their suffering. This failure of the method of collective organization to achieve the WTUL's goals in the garment strike would affect Anderson's views later on in her political career. She defiantly rejected of the National Woman's Party proposed Equal Rights Amendment and embraced the idea of Social Justice Feminism. =Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor 1920‚Äì1944= Mary Anderson became the head of the Women's Bureau in March 1920, replacing her friend and fellow activist Mary van Kleeck. She was going to lead the Bureau and use its influence to advance her agenda of Social Justice Feminism. Social Justice Feminism is using legislation to bring social justice and improvement of lives. The ultimate goal was to use women's labor legislation to set precedents so that the state would protect all workers, male and female, from the very real oppressions of the employer in the work place. Here you can see Addams influence on Anderson, with her goal to help society at large, not just women. However, after World War I and the ratification of the 19th Amendment there was a rhetorical reform going through government of Administrative Orthodoxy, that placed an emphasis on scientific objectivity and expertise as the criteria for action within the Bureaucracy. Men in government argued that because women now had equal say in voting on policies that there was no need for gender specific legislation based on old ideals of women's subordination to men and thus needing their own gendered protection in the law. By today's standard, 2012, these men in government would appear to be in consensus with modern feminists. However, the reality was even with the vote women were still oppressed by their lower wage than men and conditions in the factory were still horrible as Anderson saw firsthand when she toured the U.S. war factories in 1917. Mary Anderson had to figure out a way to pass legislation that would bring social justice and protect women from the realities of factory work while battling with the ideology of Administrative Orthodoxy. From her life experiences, of first hand factory work, witnessing the Chicago garment worker strike, actively engaged in the work of the WTUL, and her factory tour in 1917, Mary Anderson could arguably be called an expert on Women's struggle in the factory. All that was left to do to fulfill the Administrative Orthodoxy requirements was to have the expert collect data, or scientific objectivity. This is precisely what the Women's Bureau did. One example was filing and publishing reports on African American female workers. By focusing the Bureau's efforts and minority groups that other public administrators' largely ignored Anderson was able to resolve her dilemma of getting legislative social justice for women while staying within the government's trend or Administrative Orthodoxy. Again we see Addams influence on Anderson, helping society at large by giving attention to ignored minority groups. =Women's Bureau vs. National Woman's Party and the Equal Rights Movement= Once the 19th Amendment was ratified and women received the vote the National Woman's Party set its sights on a new goal, an Equal Rights Amendment that would end all discrimination against women. This included the social justice legislation that Anderson and the Women's Bureau had gathered all that data and filed reports to enact in order to protect women. The NWP thought women should get equality in the work place by organizing into unions like men do. Anderson opposed this idea because of the anti-climactic end to the Chicago garment worker strike. The chasm here is one of ideal versus reality. The NWP had very strong ideological views of what it viewed as women's equality i.e. the ERA. However, the reality of the situation, as Anderson knew from scores of data collected by the Women's Bureau, was that not just women but all workers needed protection from harsh conditions allowed to exist in the factory. Mary Anderson would do all she could to prevent an Equal Rights Amendment from being ratified. Not because she thought women were weaker, but only because there was a real societal need for protective legislation. Thus, through some tactical political maneuvering Mary Anderson was able to select who would head the NWP committee to study the effects of women specific labor legislation. She chose her close friend and committed social justice advocate Mary van Kleeck to be the technical advisor of the committee. Leaders on the NWP and Kleeck bickered and debated on every point making it virtually impossible for the committee to do anything. Eventually members on the committee who supported the ERA left the group, and the Women's Bureau and Mary Anderson successfully defended the policies they had worked so hard to enact. =After The Bureau 1945‚Äì1964= Mary Anderson retired from the Women's Bureau in 1944. She never married, and did not end her efforts to gain woman's equality in the work place. She stayed active by lobbying Washington D.C. for equal pay for equal work by men and women in the factory. She became the legislative representative of the National Consumers League and again found statistical facts to point out the real abuses in wage discrimination against women in union contracts. While the unions preached the ideology of equal pay for equal work, they also had a \\"wage scale\\" which posed a reality of a set pay for men and a separate lower set pay for women. She goes on to state that with more women in the work force it is \\"simple justice\\", social justice, to give men and women equal pay for equal work.\\"Statement of Miss Mary Anderson, 18 may 1950\\" (League of Women Voters) Mary Anderson was the first \\"'up from the ranks\\" labor woman to head an executive department of the federal government. She served under five U.S. presidents during her tenure at the Women's Bureau. During this time, there was more than a doubling of the number of women working. She did everything in her, the Bureau's, and legislative power to protect the rights of working women. Autobiography *Woman At Work: The Autobiography of Mary Anderson as Told to Mary N.

History The first church on the site was founded by Ine of Wessex in the 7th century, which grew into an Augustinian priory, becoming Bruton Abbey shortly before the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The church was within the grounds of the abbey so strictly a chapel of it, but always in effect the parish church of the town, with an office and what was perhaps a schoolroom in the north tower above the porch.Somerset Churches Trust The Bruton branch of the Berkeley family have a long association with the town and the church.

Chicago, 561 U.S. 742 (2010), is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that found that the right of an individual to \\"keep and bear arms,\\" as protected under the Second Amendment, is incorporated by either the Due Process Clause or Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and is thereby enforceable against the states. The decision cleared up the uncertainty left in the wake of District of Columbia v. Heller as to the scope of gun rights in regard to the states. Initially the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had upheld a Chicago ordinance banning the possession of handguns as well as other gun regulations affecting rifles and shotguns, citing United States v. Cruikshank, Presser v. Illinois, and Miller v. Texas.National Rifle Ass'n of Amer., Inc. v. City of Chicago, The petition for certiorari was filed by Alan Gura, the attorney who had successfully argued Heller, and Chicago-area attorney David G. Sigale. The Second Amendment Foundation and the Illinois State Rifle Association sponsored the litigation on behalf of several Chicago residents, including retiree Otis McDonald. The oral arguments took place on March 2, 2010. On June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court, in a 5‚Äì4 decision, reversed the Seventh Circuit's decision, holding that the Second Amendment was incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment thus protecting those rights from infringement by state and local governments. It then remanded the case back to Seventh Circuit to resolve conflicts between certain Chicago gun restrictions and the Second Amendment.  Case background  In the 2010 case McDonald v. City of Chicago, Chicago resident Otis McDonald, a 76-year-old (in 2010) retired maintenance engineer, had lived in the Morgan Park neighborhood since buying a house there in 1971. McDonald described the decline of his neighborhood, claiming it was being taken over by gangs and drug dealers. His lawn was regularly littered with refuse and his home and garage had been broken into a combined five times, with the most recent robbery committed by a man McDonald recognized from his own neighborhood. An experienced hunter, McDonald legally owned shotguns, but believed them too unwieldy in the event of a robbery, and wanted to purchase a handgun for personal home defense. Due to Chicago's requirement that all firearms in the city be registered, yet refusing all handgun registrations after 1982 when a citywide handgun ban was passed, he was unable to legally own a handgun. As a result, in 2008, he joined three other Chicago residents in filing a lawsuit which became McDonald v. Chicago. McDonald v. Chicago as compared to NRA v. Chicago Despite being consolidated at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, the cases are different in scope in terms of the specific regulations challenged and the legal argument for applying the Second Amendment against state and local governments. The Second Amendment Foundation brought the McDonald case to the Supreme Court with its lead attorney Alan Gura. The cases were appealed separately to the U.S. Supreme Court. * McDonald Petition for Certiorari * Chicago Brief in Opposition to Cert Petition =Regulations challenged= McDonald challenged four broad aspects of Chicago's gun registration law, which, according to the plaintiffs: * Prohibit the registration of handguns, thus effecting a broad handgun ban * Require that guns be registered prior to their acquisition by Chicago residents * Mandate that guns be re-registered annually, with another payment of the fee * Render any gun permanently non-registrable if its registration lapses =Legal basis for incorporation= All of the post-Heller cases, including McDonald, NRA v. Chicago, Nordyke and Maloney, argued that the Second Amendment, in addition to applying to federal jurisdictions, should also be applied against state and local governments, using a judicial process called selective incorporation. Selective incorporation involves convincing the court that a right is \\"fundamental\\" by being \\"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\\" or \\"deeply rooted in our nation's history and traditions\\" as defined most recently in the Supreme Court case Duncan v. Louisiana, . In addition to claiming the Second Amendment should be incorporated through the selective incorporation process, McDonald is unique among post-Heller gun cases in that it asked the court to overturn the Slaughter-House Cases, . Slaughter-House determined that the 14th Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause did not apply the Bill of Rights to the actions of states (and by extension, local governments). If it had been overturned, the Selective Incorporation process may have become unnecessary, since the entire Bill of Rights, including the 2nd Amendment, would arguably be applied to the states.\\"[T]he words 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' seems to me an eminently reasonable way of expressing the idea that henceforth the Bill of Rights shall apply to the States.\\" Erwin Chemerinsky et al., Constitutional Law ¬ß 6.3.2 (3d ed. 2006) (quoting Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 166 (1968) (Black, dissenting))More precisely, the Privileges or Immunities Clause would incorporate the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights; since the 9th and 10th Amendments refer to the unenumerated rights of individuals and reserved powers of the states respectively, their incorporation, at least for the 10th Amendment, would be paradoxical or meaningless. In attempting to overturn Slaughter-House, this case garnered the attention and support of both conservative and liberal legal scholars interested in its potential application in areas outside of firearms law. Their interest was that if Slaughter-House had been overturned, it would have been possible that constitutional guarantees such as the right to a jury in civil cases, right to a grand jury in felony cases, and other parts of the Bill of Rights, as well as future court rulings and existing federal precedent, not universally guaranteed in actions by the states, would have been applied against the states automatically. In his concurring opinion, Justice Thomas criticized the Slaughter-House and Cruikshank decisions,slip op., at 52-54 (Thomas, J., concurring) proposing that \\"the right to keep and bear arms is a privilege of American citizenship that applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause.\\"slip op., at 1 (Thomas, J., concurring) Amici curiae Thirty-three amici curiae (\\"friends of the court\\") briefs for this case were filed with the Clerk of the Supreme Court. One of these briefs was filed by U.S. senators Kay Bailey Hutchison (R, TX) and Jon Tester (D, MT) and U.S. representatives Mark Souder (R, IN) and Mike Ross (D, AR) asking the Supreme Court to find in favor of the petitioners and rule that the Second Amendment does apply to the states. The brief was signed by 58 senators and 251 representatives, more members of Congress than any amicus curiae brief in history. Moreover, thirty-two states under the aegis of Texas (and California independently) also filed amici curiae. Decision =Central Second Amendment findings= In People v. Aguilar (2013), the Illinois Supreme Court summed up the central Second Amendment findings in McDonald: =Majority= The majority agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller, but was split on the rationale. Writing for four members of the court, Justice Alito found that the Due Process Clause incorporates that right against the States.McDonald, at ___-___ (slip op., at 44) While joining most of the rest of Alito‚Äôs opinion, Justice Thomas, in his concurrence, concluded that the right to bear arms is incorporated only on alternative grounds, namely through the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.SCOTUS blog Alito also reaffirmed, in part of the opinion for four justices, that certain firearms restrictions mentioned in District of Columbia v. Heller are assumed permissible and not directly dealt with in this case.McDonald, at ___-___ (slip op., at 39-40) Such restrictions include those to \\"prohibit ... the possession of firearms by felons or mentally ill\\" and \\"laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\\" =Dissents= Justice Stevens wrote a lengthy dissenting opinion. Among his disagreements with the majority was the statement that incorporation was not at issue in this case. Citing Cruikshank, Stevens wrote, \\"The so-called incorporation question was squarely and, in my view, correctly resolved in the late 19th century.\\" In addition, he argued against incorporation, taking issue with the methodology of the majority opinions. Justice Breyer wrote, \\"In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self defense. There has been, and is, no consensus that the right is, or was, 'fundamental.'\\" Reception The initial reactions to the Court's ruling were favorable from both the National Rifle Association and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Both issued statements to the public that they feel they were vindicated by the Court's holding. However, the court did not include a \\"clarification of the standard for review\\" as requested by the Brady group in their amicus brief. In a discussion on the day of the ruling Wayne LaPierre of the NRA and Paul Helmke of the Brady Center both agreed that the Court's ruling ruled out bans on handguns which are to be used for \\"lawful purposes\\" such as self-protection in the home. But as to the general question of gun laws not covered in McDonald, a large number of lawsuits are needed in order to determine whether any other existing State gun regulations might also be unconstitutional. McDonald, supra., stated that the \\"2nd Amendment is 'fully applicable' to all of the States,\\" but Wayne LaPierre expressed caution that the NRA has \\"a lot of work ahead\\" attempting to overturn other gun control regulations not covered by McDonald. Helmke predicted that in that regard the NRA was \\"going to lose most of those lawsuits.\\" Related cases The day after Heller was filed, the National Rifle Association filed five similar lawsuits challenging local gun bans: *Guy Montag Doe v. San Francisco Housing Authority. In January, 2009, the San Francisco Housing Authority reached a settlement in favor of the Plaintiff, Guy Montag Doe, which allows residents to possess legal firearms within a SFHA apartment building. *Three unnamed suits against the Chicago suburbs of Evanston, Morton Grove and Oak Park *NRA v. Chicago ‚Äì eventually merged with McDonald. Other notable post-Heller Second Amendment court cases: *Nordyke v. King, Held that the 2nd Amendment did apply to the states in the Ninth Circuit, though the ruling was vacated for en banc reconsideration, and the Alameda County, California prohibition of firearms on county property remained constitutional until overturned by McDonald v. Chicago. *Maloney v. Rice (a.k.a. Maloney v. Cuomo and Maloney v. Spitzer), Held that the 2nd Amendment does not apply to the states in the Second Circuit. The case involved a state ban on nunchaku sticks (a martial arts weapon). In a memorandum opinion dated June 29, 2010, the Supreme Court vacated the Second Circuit decision in Maloney and remanded for further consideration in light of McDonald's holding that the Second Amendment does apply to the states. In December 2018, it was determined in Maloney v. Singas that nunchaku are considered arms under the second amendment, and as such New York State's outright 1974 ban is unconstitutional. * State of Washington v. Sieyes The Washington Supreme Court held that the 2nd Amendment is incorporated and applies to Washington State, via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Superseded by, but consistent with, McDonald. *Commonwealth v. Runyan, 456 Mass. 230 (2010) The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held that Heller did not apply to the Massachusetts state legislature and that the gun locks ordered under Massachusetts law are different from those regulated in Heller. Partially overturned by McDonald; The decisions made in Heller do apply to the State of Massachusetts (as with all States), but the gun lock requisite under MA law may indeed differ enough from D.C.'s statute to be found constitutional. *In Ezell v. Chicago, decided July 6, 2011, the Seventh Circuit reversed a district court decision that the post-McDonald measures adopted by the City of Chicago were constitutional. The Chicago law required firearms training in a shooting range in order to obtain a gun permit, but also banned shooting ranges within the City of Chicago. The City had argued that applicants could obtain their training at gun ranges in the suburbs. The opinion noted that Chicago could not infringe Second Amendment rights on the grounds that they could be exercised elsewhere, any more than it could infringe the right to freedom of speech on the grounds that citizens could speak elsewhere. *In Moore v. Madigan, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued a ruling in December 2012 that required the Illinois Legislature to modify existing State law to adopt a concealed carry law to allow the denizens of Illinois the right to bear arms outside of the home. In February 2013, the entire Court of Appeals decided to let stand the December 2012 decision of a three-judge panel. Following a final 30-day extension, Illinois was required by the court to draft a concealed carry law by July 9, 2013. In the end, the legislature overrode a veto of the governor and approved Illinois concealed carry to begin January 2014, at the latest.McCune, Greg (July 9, 2013). \\"Illinois Is Last State to Allow Concealed Carry of Guns\\", Reuters.

In 1946 she served with the Brigade's 1st Squadron in Poland's Pomerania region. Considered a national heroine, she was captured, tortured and sentenced to death at the age of 17 by the communist authorities.

Siedzik√≥wna was born on 3 September 1928 in Guszczewina, near Narewka, Bielsk Podlaski. Her father, Wac≈Çaw Siedzik, was a forester who had been sent to Siberia under the Tsar for being involved in pro-Polish independence organisations. He came back to Poland in 1923. In 1940 he was arrested by the NKVD and once again deported to Russia. In 1941 he joined W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders' Polish Army (died in Teheran in 1943). Her mother, Eugenia, n√©e Tymi≈Ñska Prus III coat of arms, was a member of the Home Army and was killed by the Gestapo in September 1943. The son of Waclaw's sister, Paul Hur, finished the Polish Air Force Academy in Dƒôblin and took part in Battle of Britain. Siedzik√≥wna grew up with her siblings Wies≈Çawa (1927‚Äì2004) and Irena (1931? - 1978) in the forester's lodge near Guszczewina. After their father was exiled, then they moved to Narewka.

Together with other employees of the inspectorate she was arrested in June 1945 by NKVD and UB for collaboration with the anticommunist underground.

Subsequently, Siedzik√≥wna served as a medical orderly in the \\"Konus\\" troop, and then in the squadron of lieutenant Jan Mazur, \\"Piast\\", and that of lieutenant Marian P≈Çuci≈Ñski, \\"M≈õcis≈Çaw\\". For a short period her superior was also lieutenant Leon Beynar \\"Nowina\\", deputy of \\"≈Åupaszko\\", later known as \\"Pawe≈Ç Jasienica\\" - a notable Polish historian and writer. During this time Danuta assumed pseudonym \\"Inka\\". The \\"≈Åupaszko\\" brigade was dissolved in September 1945 and Danuta went back to work in the forest inspectorate in Mi≈Çom≈Çyn in Ostr√≥da County under the name \\"Danuta Obuchowicz\\". However, the brigade was re-mobilized in response to Communist repressions in January 1946. In the early spring of 1946 Danuta came into contact with second lieutenant Zdzis≈Çaw Badocha \\"≈ªelazny\\", the commander of one of ≈Åupaszko's squadrons. After \\"≈ªelazny\\"'s death, the new commander, second lieutenant Olgierd Christa \\"Leszek\\", ordered Danuta to travel to Gda≈Ñsk in order to collect medical supplies. She was arrested by the UB again on 20 July 1946 in Gda≈Ñsk. While in prison she was tortured and beaten but refused to give up any information about her contacts in the anti-communist underground and their meeting points. Danuta's brutal interrogations were personally supervised by the Head of the Investigations Department at the Voivodeship Office for Public Security, (WUBP), (Polish Secret Police) in Gda≈Ñsk, J√≥zef Bik, vel Jozef Gawerski, vel Jozef Bukar. In 1968, Bik, vel Bukar emigrated to Sweden, claiming antisemitic persecution. An IPN indictment against Bik, vel Gawerski, vel Bukar reads: \\"Jozef B. is accused of participating in court-sanctioned murders perpetrated against members of Polish Democratic Forces (pol. Polskie Si≈Çy Demokratyczne) and Polish Secret Army (pol. Polska Armia Tajna) whom he was beating and torturing in order to extract confessions\\". Trial and death She was charged with taking an active, violent part in an attack on functionaries of the Ministry of Public Security (Polish secret police) and the Milicja Obywatelska near village Podjazy as part of the ≈Åupaszko unit, despite the fact that she was only a medic. She was accused of shooting at policemen and even issuing orders to other partisans. However, the testimony submitted by MO and UB members involved in the fight was at best contradictory, as some claimed to have seen her shooting and giving orders, while other denied it altogether. One, named Mieczys≈Çaw Mazur, testified that Siedzik√≥wna had given him first aid after he was wounded by other partisans. She was charged with killing wounded policemen, a charge contradicted during her trial. The court decided she had not played a direct part in the attack. Despite this and Siedzik√≥wna's age (17), the court still sentenced her to death. The president of People's Republic of Poland, Boleslaw Bierut refused to grant her clemency (the request was submitted by Siedzik√≥wna's public defender, which the prisoner herself refused to sign). Siedzik√≥wna was executed (along with Feliks Selmanowicz, whose nom de guerre was \\"Zago≈Ñczyk\\"), six days before her 18th birthday, on 28 August 1946, in a Gda≈Ñsk prison.Jerzy Morawski, \\"Lepiej, ≈ºe ja jedna zginƒô\\" (\\"It's better if I'm the only one to die\\"), Rzeczpospolita 11 March 2000; accessed 6 May 2014. Days before the execution a secret letter from Inka was smuggled out of the prison, where she wrote: \\"Please tell my grandmother, that i have acted right.\\" Memorial tribute to Siedzik√≥wna, Gda≈Ñsk, Poland The last minutes of her life are known from the testimony of Father Marian Prusak, the priest-chaplain called to give \\"Inka\\" and \\"Zago≈Ñczyk\\" the last rites. According to Father Prusak both prisoners were calm before their execution. Siedzik√≥wna, after taking the Sacrament of Penance, asked the priest to inform her family of her death and gave him their address. Afterward the two were executed in the basement of the prison, tied to wooden stakes. They both refused blindfolds. When the prosecutor gave the order for the execution squad to fire, both prisoners simultaneously shouted (in Polish) \\"Long Live Poland!\\" She remained alive and the coup de gr√¢ce was delivered by Franciszek Sawicki (other members of the firing squad refused to do so). Her Protocol of Execution was signed by: Major Wiktor Suchacki (prosecutor), 2nd Lt. Franciszek Sawicki (firing squad leader), Captain Mieczys≈Çaw Rutkowski (attending physician), and Jan W√≥jcik (jail warden). The location of her remains remained unknown until 2014. They were discovered due to a nation-wide programme launched by the Institute of National Remembrance in 2003. The remains were confirmed as Siedzik√≥wna's via DNA testing in 2015. On 28 August 2016, a state burial attended by President Andrzej Duda, was held in Gda≈Ñsk at the Garrison Cemetery for Siedzik√≥wna and one of her companions. Later events Gda≈Ñsk Basilica Father Prusak did deliver the news of Siedzik√≥wna's death to her family, although they had already found out through other sources. Unknown to him he was under UB surveillance, and in 1949 was charged with \\"espionage\\" for informing Danuta's family about her death. For that alone, he spent three and a half years in Communist prison. After the fall of communism in Poland, the main Stalinist prosecutor in Danuta's trial who demanded the death penalty, Wac≈Çaw Krzy≈ºanowski, was brought up on charges of judicial murder twice (in 1993 and 2001). However, both times he was declared innocent of the charges. (Krzy≈ºanowski argued that he had been only marginally involved with the case.) Awards and recognition On Polish Independence Day (11 November) 2006, President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski posthumously awarded Danuta Siedzik√≥wna the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In 2017, the National Bank of Poland (NBP) introduced a 10-zloty silver commemorative coin, as part of the \\"Cursed Soldiers\\" series, in honour of Danuta Siedzik√≥wna.

It is stored at the West Boonton Yard in Boonton, New Jersey, United States. It is fully cosmetically restored to its original appearance.  Background  The GG1 was developed in 1930s by General Electric as the replacement for the Pennsylvania Railroad's then standard electric locomotive, the P5a, and was based largely on the New Haven EP3. The GG1 was capable of a top speed of , powered by its twelve traction motors. The prototype GG1, PRR 4800, was tested against Westinghouse's submission, the R1. The Pennsylvania selected the GG1 over the R1, as the R1 was not articulated and the GG1's traction motors were similar to ones already in use. An order for 57 GG1s was placed in November 1934 and the first locomotives were delivered in April 1935. Raymond Loewy was hired by the Pennsylvania to \\"enhance the GG1's aesthetics.\\" Loewy had the production locomotives' bodies be welded together, instead of riveted the way 4800 was, to give the GG1 a more streamlined appearance. Loewy also formulated the Brunswick green paint scheme and the gold pinstripes, nicknamed \\"cat's whiskers\\", which was eventually applied by the Pennsylvania to all of its locomotives for the next 20 years. In 1952, the Pennsylvania repainted some of its fleet of GG1s to a Tuscan red paint scheme with pinstripes.  History  4877 was built in January 1939 at the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Works in Altoona, Pennsylvania. 4877 was transferred to Penn Central when the Pennsylvania was merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968. It was transferred again, to Conrail in 1976, when Penn Central went bankrupt. Thirteen GG1s were loaned to the New Jersey Department of Transportation in the 1980s, for use in what would eventually become New Jersey Transit, on its North Jersey Coast Line. 4877 was repainted from the solid black paint scheme used by both Penn Central and Conrail in 1981. Locomotive before restoration In anticipation of the GG1s' final retirement on October 29, 1983, a documentary was made earlier that year about the final operations of NJT's GG1 fleet, focusing on \\"Ol' Big Red\\" 4877 - also the title of a song written by GG1 engineer Cliff Underwood, who was also featured. Clips from the song are played at intervals throughout the film. The documentary depicted the engine change at South Amboy, New Jersey, and features many on-board views; the film was released a year later. The locomotive was donated by New Jersey Transit to the United Railroad Historical Society of New Jersey (URHS) in 1991. Between 2011 and 2013, the locomotive was cosmetically restored by the URHS in-house contractor Star Trak, Inc. It was given its original Brunswick Green paint scheme and was once again displayed to the public at the URHS open house in September 2012. Currently, 4877 calls Boonton Yard home where it is visible from the street, but not regularly accessible by the public. It is part of a large collection of equipment which will be a part of the future New Jersey Transportation Heritage Center.

Located in Kinderhook Township, Branch County, Michigan approximately from Kinderhook, Lake Lavine is situated approximately north of the Indiana state line: directly north of the Lake James chain of lakes located in Indiana. Lake Lavine is a deep lake (84 feet maximum) with steep drop-offs. Speed boats are allowed during the hours of 10:00 am until 6:30 pm. On the southeastern shore there is a state-operated public fishing site with a paved boat ramp. The terrain surrounding Lake Lavine is gently rolling woodlands, wetlands, farm fields, and vineyards. Approximately half of the shoreline is developed, with about 60 summer and permanent homes on the lake. The remaining shoreline is wetlands and undeveloped woodland. The lake is primarily groundwater seepage fed, without any significant inlet and no outlet. Lake Lavine is within the headwaters of the Prairie River watershed. The Prairie River (Michigan) flows westerly, joining the St. Joseph River just south of the community of Three Rivers. Almost half of the lakeshore is privately owned wetlands with no immediate plans for development. This lakes claim to fame is that John Dillinger hid here in till he was found and executed. Known for its exceptional fishing, Lake Lavine holds significant numbers of perch, bass, bluegill and crappie. It was formally stocked by MDNR with rainbow trout. This was stopped in 2009 after illegal release of northern pike diminished the native habitat.

It is one of a collection of historical sources from the late 7th- and early 8th-centuries, along with the anonymous Vita Sancti Cuthberti, the works of Bede and Adomn√°n's Vita Sancti Columbae, that detail the Christianisation of Great Britain and make the period the best documented period in English history before the age of Alfred the Great. Date and authorship In the preface to the Vita Wilfrithi, the author reveals that he is a priest called Stephen.Webb and Farmer (eds.), Age of Bede, p. 107 Writers in modern times often style the author \\"Eddius Stephanus\\",The popular Penguin translation, Webb and Farmer (eds.), Age of Bede, pp. 104-84, styles the author such an attribution that goes back to the 17th century.Kirby, \\"Bede, Eddius Stephanus\\", p. 102 This attribution is now thought unlikely by many historians.See Goffart, Narrators, p. 281, n. 210 The identification was made because the Vita Wilfrithi recounts that sometime between 666 and 669, Wilfrid brought two singing masters from Kent to Ripon, √Üdde and √Üona.VSW, 14, in Webb and Farmer (eds.), Age of Bede, p. 122 This √Üdde was also mentioned by Bede, who says that an √Üddi cognomento Stephanus (\\"√Üdde, also known as Stephen\\") was brought to Northumbria by Wilfrid and was the first singing-master (cantor) among the Northumbrians.Bede, HE, iv.2; Colgrave, McClure and Collins (eds.), Bede, p. 172 This is not however thought to be good evidence by many modern historians,McClure and Collins (eds.), Bede, p. 400, n. 173 while many other factors, such as age, make the attribution positively unlikely.Kirby, \\"Bede, Eddius Stephanus\\", pp. 102-3 The Vita Wilfrithi can be dated reasonably securely between 709, the year of Wilfrid's death, and c. 720.Goffart, Narrators, pp. 282-3; Gransden, Historical Writing, p. 71 The latter date, c. 720, is the approximate date of the Vita Sancti Cuthberti, a text which the Vita Wilfrithi quotes,Goffart, Narrators, p. 283 and indeed imitates so often that one historian has used the word \\"plagiarism\\".Goffart, Narrators, p. 284 There are some indications that it was written after 716.Fraser, Pictland, p. 265 Synopsis The Vita narrates the life and career of Wilfrid, from his boyhood until his death, with brief digressions into the other affairs of Wilfrid's two main monasteries, Ripon and Hexham.Gransden, Historical Writing, p. 71 It details his boyhood decision to become a churchman, his quarrels with Theodore of Tarsus, Archbishop of Canterbury, and various secular figures, his travels back and forth between England and Rome, his participation in church synods, and eventually his death.Gransden, Historical Writing, p. 71; Webb and Farmer (eds.), Age of Bede, pp. 104-84 The text devotes over one third of its contents to Wilfrid's \\"Northumbrian achievements\\", but Stephen devotes almost no space to Wilfrid's second period in office as Bishop of York (686-691), and little space to his activity in Mercia.Goffart, Narrators, pp. 285-6 The Vita Wilfrithi, in common with many hagiographies written close to the death of their subject, records very few miracles, but like Bede and Eusebius of Caesarea, incorporates full documents relevant to its story. Problems According to Fulk et al., the Vita Wilfrithi is tendentious and partisan.Fulk, Cain, and Anderson, History of Old English literature, p. 90 The Vita, perhaps mirroring the views of Wilfrid himself, is contemptuous of the Gaelic contribution, the \\"poisonous seeds\\" they planted, to the development of the Northumbrian and English church, and thus discredits Lindisfarne and the other English monasteries associated with them.Goffart, Narrators, pp. 325-8, for summary Wilfrid is given full responsibility for the victory of the Roman faction in the Synod of Whitby, his great triumph over the Gaelic monks. Bede however sidelines Wilfrid, making it unclear to the modern historian which writer is being more accurate; and while Stephen depicts the second half of the 7th century as a \\"Wilfridian golden age\\", in the narrative of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum, Wilfrid is but one of many ecclesiastical figures who contribute to the development of the English church.Fraser, Pictland, p. 264; for full disccussion, see Goffart, \\"Bede and the Ghost of Bishop Wilfrid\\", Narrators, pp. 235-328 These factors led the historian Walter Goffart to argue that Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica was actually written because the leaders of the Bernician church sought to counter the version of history being promulgated by the Deiran \\"Wilfridians\\" in the Vita Wilfrithi.Goffart, Narrators, pp. 235-328 Inspirations The Vita Wilfrithi inspired a 10th-century Latin poem entitled Breviloquium Vitae Wilfridi, written by Frithegod to commemorate Oda's acquisition of Wilfrid's relics for Canterbury Cathedral around 950. The historian Michael Lapidge has called the Breviloquium \\"one of the most difficult Latin poems written in pre- conquest England\\".Lapidge, \\"Frithegod (fl. c.950‚Äìc.958)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Notes References * Colgrave, Bertram, ed. and trans.

The site is located in Scioto County, Ohio, about five miles northwest of Portsmouth, Ohio, on the second terrace floodplain overlooking the Scioto River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Site description Squier and Davis diagram of Tremper The Tremper Works include a large earthen enclosure in the shape of a flattened oval. Measuring by , the oval was entered through an opening in the southwestern part of the enclosure. At the center of the oval is a large, irregularly shaped mound. Believed by some to be an effigy mound built in the shape of an animal, although there has never been any conclusive proof of this. The site was surveyed in the 1840s by Charles Whittlesey for E. G. Squier and E. H. Davis, and an engraving was included in their book Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. The site was excavated by William C. Mills of the Ohio Historical Society in 1915. He discovered numerous postmolds at the base of the mound, revealing the outline of a wooden structure long by wide. The pattern showed that there had been a large building with several smaller chambers at its eastern end. The site is privately owned and was once a working farm. Pipes Bird Figure from Tremper Mounds Another significant discovery made at Tremper were more than 500 objects that had been deliberately broken and left in one of the eastern chambers. The objects included 136 smoking pipes made of catlinite or pipestone. Ninety were effigy pipes sculpted in the shapes of animals, notably bears, wolves, dogs, beavers, cougars, otters, turtles, cranes, owls, herons, and hawks. It had been thought that the material used to make the pipes had been quarried from Ohio pipestone outcrops across the Scioto River from Tremper, but new tests have shown that the majority of the pipes were made from Sterling pipestone from northwestern Illinois. Many of the Tremper pipes are on display at the Ohio Historical Center in Columbus, Ohio.

Its last assignment was with the 30th Air Division of Air Defense Command (ADC) at Selfridge Air Force Base (AFB), Michigan, where it was discontinued in 1956. It was established in 1952 at Selfridge as the 4708th Defense Wing in a general reorganization of Air Defense Command (ADC), which replaced wings responsible for a base with wings responsible for a geographical area. It assumed control of several fighter Interceptor squadrons that had been assigned to the 56th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, some of which were Air National Guard squadrons mobilized for the Korean War. In early 1953 it also was assigned nine radar squadrons in the Midwest. Several of these radar squadrons were located in Canada as part of the Mid-Canada Line. At the same time its dispersed fighter squadrons combined with colocated air base squadrons into air defense groups. The wing was redesignated as an air defense wing in 1954. It was discontinued in and its units transferred to the 30th Air Division in 1956. History F-47D of the wing's 47th FIS The wing was organized as the 4708th Defense Wing the beginning of February 1952 at Selfridge AFB, Michigan as part of a major reorganization of ADC responding to ADC's difficulty under the existing wing base organizational structure in deploying fighter squadrons to best advantage.Grant, C.L., The Development of Continental Air Defense to 1 September 1954, (1961), USAF Historical Study No. 126, p. 33 It assumed operational control and the air defense mission of fighter squadrons formerly assigned to the inactivating 56th Fighter- Interceptor Wing (FIW). The 61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (FIS), flying Lockheed F-94 Starfire aircraft, and the 172d FIS, flying World War II era North American F-51 Mustang aircraft were located at Selfridge, while the 63d FIS, flying F-86 Sabre aircraft, was located at Oscoda AFB. The 136th FIS at Niagara Falls Municipal Airport, flying World War II era Republic F-47 Thunderbolt aircraft was also transferred to the wing from the 101st FIW,Cornett & Johnson, p. 123 and the 71st FIS at Greater Pittsburgh Airport, another F-86 unit, was transferred from the 1st FIW.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 118 The support elements of the 56th FIW's 56th Air Base Group and 56th Maintenance & Supply Group were replaced at Selfridge by the wing's 575th Air Base Group, and air base squadrons were activated at each of the dispersed locations assigned to the wing to support the fighter squadrons at those stations.Cornett & Johnson, p. 85 The wing's mission was to train and maintain tactical units in a state of readiness to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft attempting to penetrate the air defense system in the Great Lakes area.Abstract, History of 4708th Def Wg, Feb‚ÄìJun 1952. Retrieved 25 February 2012 61st FIS F-94B Starfire In July 1952, units at Oscoda AFB were transferred to the 4706th Defense Wing, while in the following month, the 166th FIS, at Youngstown Municipal Airport, where it flew Republic F-84 Thunderjet aircraft was transferred from the 4706th. In November, the federalized Air National Guard (ANG) squadrons were returned to state control. The 136th FIS was returned to the New York ANG and replaced by the 47th FIS, the 166th FIS was returned to the Ohio ANG and replaced by the 86th FIS, and the 172nd FIS was returned to the Michigan ANG, and replaced by the 431st FIS.Cornett & Johnson, pp. 123‚Äì124Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp.206, 532‚Äì533 Another F-51 squadron, the 56th FIS, was activated at Selfridge later that month. although it converted to F-86 aircraft by the start of 1953.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p.227Cornett & Johnson, p.116 In February 1953, another major reorganization of ADC activated Air Defense Groups at ADC bases with dispersed fighter squadrons. These groups were assigned to the wing and assumed direct control of the interceptor squadrons at those bases, as well as support squadrons to carry out their role as the USAF host organizations at the bases. As a result of this reorganization, the 575th Air Base Group was redesignated the 575th Air Defense Gp and assumed control of the fighter squadrons at Selfridge, while the 500th Air Defense Group at Pittsburgh and the 502d Air Defense Group at Youngstown controlled the squadrons at these locations.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 227, 237, 297‚Äì298, 532 Oscoda AFB (now renamed Wurtsmith AFB), where the 527th Air Defense Group was activated,Cornett & Johnson, p. 83 returned to the control of the wing. Although the 518th Air Defense Group took over operations at Niagara Falls, it was assigned to another wing. The reorganization also resulted in the wing adding the radar detection, control and warning mission, and it was assigned eight Aircraft Control & Warning Squadrons (AC&W; Sq) in the United States and Canada to perform this mission.Cornett & Johnson, p. 99Cornett & Johnson, p. 101Cornett & Johnson, p. 103Cornett & Johnson, p. 158Cornett & Johnson, pp. 163‚Äì164Cornett & Johnson, p. 168 In November it added an additional AC&W; Sq.

Niagara Falls briefly was assigned to the wing in this realignment.Cornett & Johnson, P. 70 The fighter groups and remaining radar detection and control squadrons of the wing were transferred to the 30th Air Division in July. With no remaining operational mission, the wing and the 4711th Wing were discontinued in July 1956 They would be replaced shortly by the 1st Fighter Wing (Air Defense), which was activated on 18 October 1956.Ravenstein, p. 6 Lineage * Designated as the 4708th Defense Wing and organized on 1 February 1952 : Redesignated as 4708th Air Defense Wing on 1 July 1954 : Discontinued on 8 July 1956 =Assignments= * Eastern Air Defense Force, 1 February 1952 * 30th Air Division, 16 February 1953 ‚Äì 18 October 1956 =Stations= * Selfridge AFB, Michigan, 1 February 1952 ‚Äì 18 October 1956 =Components= Groups Fighter Groups * 1st Fighter Group (Air Defense), 18 August 1955 ‚Äì 8 July 1956AFHRA Factsheet, 1st Operations Group .

Despite the name, isometric computer graphics are not necessarily truly isometric--i.e., the x, y, and z axes are not necessarily oriented 120¬∞ to each other. Instead, a variety of angles occur; some form of parallel projection, such as dimetric projection with a 2:1 pixel ratio, is the most common. The terms \\"3/4 perspective\\", \\"2.5D\\", and \\"pseudo-3D\\" are also sometimes used, although these terms can possess slightly different meanings in other contexts. Once common, isometric projection became rarer with the advent of more powerful 3D graphics systems, and as games began to focus more on action and individual characters. However, video games using isometric projection have seen a resurgence since the early 2010s, especially on Kickstarter.  Overview  =Advantages= In the fields of computer and video games and pixel art, the technique has become popular because of the ease with which 2D sprite- and tile-based graphics can be made to represent a 3D gaming environment. Because parallelly projected objects do not change size as they move about the game field, there is no need for the computer to scale sprites or do the complex calculations necessary to simulate visual perspective. This allowed 8-bit and 16-bit game systems (and, more recently, handheld and mobile systems) to portray large 3D areas quickly and easily. And, while the depth confusion problems of parallel projection can sometimes be a problem, good game design can alleviate this. There are also gameplay advantages to using an isometric or pseudo-isometric perspective in video games. For instance, compared to a purely top-down game, they add a third dimension, opening up new avenues for aiming and platforming. Secondly, compared to a first- or third-person game, they allow you to more easily field and control a larger number of additional units, such as a full party of characters in a role-playing game. Further, they may alleviate situations where a player may become distracted from a game's core mechanics by having to constantly manage an unwieldy 3D camera. I.e. the player can focus on playing the game itself, and not on moving and rotating the camera. Lastly, there is an artistic advantage. Though not limited strictly to isometric video games, pre-rendered 2D graphics can possess a higher fidelity and use more advanced techniques than may be possible on commonly available computer hardware, even with 3D hardware acceleration enabled. Similarly to modern CGI used in motion pictures, graphics can be rendered once on a powerful super computer or render farm, and then displayed on less powerful consumer hardware, such as tablet computers and Web browsers. This means that static pre-rendered isometric graphics often look better compared to their real-time rendered counterparts, and may age better over time compared to their peers. However, this advantage may be less pronounced now than it was in the past. One disadvantage of pre- rendered graphics is that, as display resolutions continue to increase, the static 2D images need to ideally be re-rendered to keep pace, or otherwise suffer from pixelation. This is not always possible, however; as was the case in 2012, when BioWare's Baldur's Gate (1998) was remade into Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition by the studio Beamdog. The new developer opted for simple 2D graphics scaling, or \\"zooming\\", without re-rendering the game's sprites, as they were lacking the game's original creative art assets. (The original data was lost in a flood.) Changing the resolution of a real-time rendered game is trivial, in comparison. =Differences from \\"true\\" isometric projection= The projection commonly used in video games deviates slightly from \\"true\\" isometric due to the limitations of raster graphics. Lines in the x and y directions would not follow a neat pixel pattern if drawn in the required 30¬∞ to the horizontal. While modern computers can eliminate this problem using anti-aliasing, earlier computer graphics did not support enough colors or possess enough CPU power to accomplish this. Instead, a 2:1 pixel pattern ratio would be used to draw the x and y axis lines, resulting in these axes following a 26.565¬∞ (\\\\arctan(0.5)) angle to the horizontal. (Game systems that do not use square pixels could, however, yield different angles, including \\"true\\" isometric.) Therefore, this form of projection is more accurately described as a variation of dimetric projection, since only two of the three angles between the axes are equal to each other (116.565¬∞, 116.565¬∞, 126.870¬∞).  History of isometric video games  While the history of computer games saw some true 3D games as soon as the early 1970s, the first video games to use the distinct visual style of isometric projection in the meaning described above were arcade games in the early 1980s. = 1980s = The use of isometric graphics in video games began with the appearance of Sega's Zaxxon,Bernard Perron & Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), Video game theory reader two, p. 158, Taylor & Francis, released as an arcade game in January 1982. It is an isometric shooter where the player flies a space plane through scrolling levels. It is also one of the first video games to display shadows. Data East's Treasure Island used isometric visuals in 1981, but may not have been released worldwide. Another early isometric game is Q*bert, which Warren Davis and Jeff Lee began programming in April 1982 and released in October/November 1982. Q*bert shows a static pyramid in an isometric perspective, with the player controlling a character which can jump around on the pyramid. The following year in March 1983, the isometric platformer arcade game Congo Bongo was released, running on the same hardware as Zaxxon. It allows the player character to move around in bigger isometric levels, including true three-dimensional climbing and falling. The same is possible in the arcade title Marble Madness, released in 1984. At this time, isometric games were no longer exclusive to the arcade market and also entered home computers with the release of Blue Max for the Atari 8-bit family and Ant Attack for the ZX Spectrum in 1983. In Ant Attack, the player could move forward in any direction of the scrolling game, offering complete free movement rather than fixed to one axis as with Zaxxon. The views could also be changed around a 90 degrees axis. The ZX Crash magazine consequently awarded it 100% in the graphics category for this new technique, known as \\"Soft Solid 3-D\\". A year later the ZX Spectrum saw the release of Knight Lore, which is generally regarded as a revolutionary title that defined the subsequent genre of isometric adventure games. Following Knight Lore, many isometric titles were seen on home computers ‚Äì to an extent that it once was regarded as being the second most cloned piece of software after WordStar, according to researcher Jan Krikke. \\"Knight Lore was said to be the second most cloned piece of software after the word- processing program Word Star.\\" Other examples out of those were Highway Encounter (1985), Batman (1986), Head Over Heels (1987) and La Abad√≠a del Crimen (1987). Isometric perspective was not limited to arcade/adventure games, though; for example, the 1989 strategy game Populous used isometric perspective. = 1990s = Throughout the 1990s some successful games like SimCity 2000 (1994), Civilization II (1996), X-COM (1994), and Diablo (1996) used a fixed isometric perspective. But with the advent of 3D acceleration on personal computers and gaming consoles, games previously using a 2D perspective generally started turning to true 3D (e.g. perspective projection) instead. This can be seen in the successors to the above games: For instance SimCity (2013), Civilization VI (2016), XCOM: Enemy Unknown (2012) and Diablo III (2012) all use full 3D; and while Diablo II (2000) used a fixed perspective like its predecessor, it optionally allowed for perspective scaling of the sprites in the distance to lend it a \\"pseudo-3D\\" appearance. Also during the 1990s, isometric graphics began being used for Japanese role-playing video games (JRPGs) on console systems, particularly tactical role-playing games, many of which still use isometric graphics today. Examples include Front Mission (1995), Tactics Ogre (1995) and Final Fantasy Tactics (1997)--the latter of which used 3D graphics to create an environment where the player could freely rotate the camera. Other titles such as Vandal Hearts (1996) and Breath of Fire III (1997) carefully emulated an isometric view, but actually used perspective projection. =Infinity Engine= Black Isle Studios and BioWare helped popularize the use of isometric projection in role-playing games in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These studios utilized the Infinity Engine game engine in several of their titles, developed by BioWare for Baldur's Gate (1998). This engine gained significant traction among players, and many developers since then have tried to emulate and improve upon it in various ways. The Infinity Engine itself was also revamped and modernized by Beamdog in preparation for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (2012), as well as their remakes of several other classic Infinity Engine titles. Two other titles by Black Isle Studios, Fallout (1997) and Fallout 2 (1998), used trimetric projection. =Kickstarter= Isometric projection has seen continued relevance in the new millennium with the release of several newly-crowdfunded role-playing games on Kickstarter. These include the Shadowrun Returns series (2013-2015) by Harebrained Schemes; the Pillars of Eternity series (2015-2018) and Tyranny (2016) by Obsidian Entertainment; and Torment: Tides of Numenera (2017) by inXile Entertainment. Both Obsidian Entertainment and inXile Entertainment have employed, or were founded by, former members of Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment; and Obsidian Entertainment in particular wanted to \\"bring back the look and feel of the Infinity Engine games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment\\" with Pillars of Eternity. Lastly, several pseudo-isometric 3D RPGs, such as Divinity: Original Sin (2014), Wasteland 2 (2014) and Dead State (2014), have also been crowdfunded using Kickstarter in recent years. These titles differ from the above games, however, in that they use perspective projection instead of parallel projection. Rather than being based purely on nostalgia, the revival of isometric projection is the result of real, tangible benefits as well. =Similar projections= The term \\"isometric perspective\\" is often misapplied to any game with an--usually fixed--angled, overhead view that appears at first to be \\"isometric\\". These include games that utilize trimetric projection, such as Fallout (1997) and SimCity 4 (2003); games that utilize oblique projection, such as Divine Divinity (2002) and Ultima Online (1997); and games that utilize a combination of perspective projection and a bird's eye view, such as Silent Storm (2003), Torchlight (2009) and Divinity: Original Sin (2014). There are also titles that utilize polygonal 3D graphics, but render their graphics to the screen using parallel projection instead of perspective projection. These include Syndicate Wars (1996), Dungeon Keeper (1997) and Depths of Peril (2007). And, there are a number of games that use a combination of pre-rendered and real-time rendered isometric graphics, such as The Temple of Elemental Evil (2003) and Torment: Tides of Numenera (2017), which use pre-rendered 2D backgrounds and real-time rendered 3D character models; and Final Fantasy Tactics (1997) and Disgaea: Hour of Darkness (2003), which use real-time rendered 3D backgrounds and hand-drawn 2D character sprites. One additional advantage of top-down oblique projection is that images fit more snugly within a square graphical tile, thereby using less memory.  Mapping screen to world coordinates  Finding world coordinates Comparison of several types of graphical projection. The presence of one or more 90¬∞ angles is often a good indicator that the perspective used is oblique projection. One of the most common problems with programming games that use isometric (or more likely dimetric) projections is the ability to map between events that happen on the 2d plane of the screen and the actual location in the isometric space, called world space. A common example is picking the tile that lies right under the cursor when a user clicks. One such method is using the same rotation matrices that originally produced the isometric view in reverse to turn a point in screen coordinates into a point that would lie on the game board surface before it was rotated. Then, the world x and y values can be calculated by dividing by the tile width and height. Another way that is less computationally intensive and can have good results if our method is called on every frame, rests on the assumption that a square board was rotated by 45 degrees and then squashed to be half its original height. A virtual grid is overlaid on the projection as shown on the diagram, with axes virtual-x and virtual-y. Clicking any tile on the central axis of the board where (x, y) = (tileMapWidth / 2, y), will produce the same tile value for both world-x and world-y which in this example is 3 (0 indexed). Selecting the tile that lies one position on the right on the virtual grid, actually moves one tile less on the world-y and one tile more on the world-x. This is the formula that calculates world-x by taking the virtual-y and adding the virtual-x from the center of the board. Likewise world-y is calculated by taking virtual-y and subtracting virtual-x. These calculations measure from the central axis, as shown, so the results must be translated by half the board. For example, in the C programming language: float virtualTileX = screenx / virtualTileWidth; float virtualTileY = screeny / virtualTileHeight; // some display systems have their origin at the bottom left while the tile map at the top left, so we need to reverse y float inverseTileY = numberOfTilesInY - virtualTileY; float isoTileX = inverseTileY + (virtualTileX - numberOfTilesInX / 2); float isoTileY = inverseTileY - (virtualTileX - numberOfTilesInY / 2); This method might seem counter intuitive at first since the coordinates of a virtual grid are taken, rather than the original isometric world, and there is no one-to- one correspondence between virtual tiles and isometric tiles. A tile on the grid will contain more than one isometric tile, and depending on where it is clicked it should map to different coordinates. The key in this method is that the virtual coordinates are floating point numbers rather than integers. A virtual-x and y value can be (3.5, 3.5) which means the center of the third tile. In the diagram on the left, this falls in the 3rd tile on the y in detail. When the virtual-x and y must add up to 4, the world x will also be 4.

Bid details  In 2007, the City of Edmonton began a high-level assessment of a bid to host an expo in 2017 or 2020. A citizen committee comprising 40 community and business leaders participated in developing a conceptual report. The findings of the report suggest that there are sufficient and compelling reasons to proceed with developing a national bid and business plan for an expo in 2017. On October 29, 2008, Edmonton City Council approved pursuing this next step on the condition of Government of Alberta support and cost-sharing. City Council voted unanimously on April 15, 2009 to release funding for the project's 2009 phase: building a national bid and business case, which involved conducting feasibility studies and reviews of the viability and costs of holding an EXPO, consulting Edmontonians, evaluating potential sites and financing formulas, and developing a theme. In spring of 2009, the Government of Canada's Department of Canadian Heritage, through the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, distributed a request to Canadian cities to express their intent to bid on an EXPO in 2017. By May 29, 2009, Edmonton, Alberta and Calgary, Alberta formally expressed its intent to submit a national bid on November 30, 2009. Other Canadian cities that had expressed interest earlier did not formally express their intent to the Government of Canada by May 29. On July 20, 2009, the national bid received funding from the Government of Alberta. \\"An event like this provides a platform to celebrate the uniqueness and vibrancy of our capital city and province,\\" said Lindsay Blackett, Minister of Culture and Community Spirit. \\"I wish the City of Edmonton all the best in its bid preparations.\\" On November 2, 2009, Calgary withdrew its intent to bid on an expo in 2017. At the end of the month, Edmonton submitted its bid to the Government of Alberta and Government of Canada. On May 13, 2010, Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach announced that the Government of Alberta would support the international bid for Expo 2017. \\"We are certainly supporting Edmonton, the business community with its bid. I think it's the kind of energy and optimism that should be supported by the province,\\" said Stelmach. \\"Should we be successful, there are three levels of government that will be expected to contribute,\\" he added.\\"Premier backs Edmonton's bid to host 2017 World Expo\\", CTV Edmonton, May 13, 2010.

The view model of MVVM is a value converter, meaning the view model is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented. In this respect, the view model is more model than view, and handles most if not all of the view's display logic. The view model may implement a mediator pattern, organizing access to the back-end logic around the set of use cases supported by the view. MVVM is a variation of Martin Fowler's Presentation Model design pattern. It was invented by Microsoft architects Ken Cooper and Ted Peters specifically to simplify event- driven programming of user interfaces. The pattern was incorporated into Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) (Microsoft's .NET graphics system) and Silverlight (WPF's Internet application derivative). John Gossman, one of Microsoft's WPF and Silverlight architects, announced MVVM on his blog in 2005. Model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel is also referred to as model‚Äìview‚Äìbinder, especially in implementations not involving the .NET platform. ZK (a web application framework written in Java) and KnockoutJS (a JavaScript library) use model‚Äìview‚Äìbinder. Components of MVVM pattern ;Model :Model refers either to a domain model, which represents real state content (an object- oriented approach), or to the data access layer, which represents content (a data-centric approach). ;View :As in the model-view-controller (MVC) and model-view-presenter (MVP) patterns, the view is the structure, layout, and appearance of what a user sees on the screen. It displays a representation of the model and receives the user's interaction with the view (mouse clicks, keyboard input, screen tap gestures, etc.), and it forwards the handling of these to the view model via the data binding (properties, event callbacks, etc.) that is defined to link the view and view model. ;View model :The view model is an abstraction of the view exposing public properties and commands. Instead of the controller of the MVC pattern, or the presenter of the MVP pattern, MVVM has a binder, which automates communication between the view and its bound properties in the view model. The view model has been described as a state of the data in the model. :The main difference between the view model and the Presenter in the MVP pattern is that the presenter has a reference to a view, whereas the view model does not. Instead, a view directly binds to properties on the view model to send and receive updates. To function efficiently, this requires a binding technology or generating boilerplate code to do the binding. ;Binder :Declarative data and command-binding are implicit in the MVVM pattern. In the Microsoft solution stack, the binder is a markup language called XAML. The binder frees the developer from being obliged to write boiler-plate logic to synchronize the view model and view. When implemented outside of the Microsoft stack, the presence of a declarative data binding technology is what makes this pattern possible, and without a binder, one would typically use MVP or MVC instead and have to write more boilerplate (or generate it with some other tool). Rationale MVVM was designed to make use of data binding functions in WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) to better facilitate the separation of view layer development from the rest of the pattern, by removing virtually all GUI code (\\"code-behind\\") from the view layer. Instead of requiring user experience (UX) developers to write GUI code, they can use the framework markup language (e.g., XAML) and create data bindings to the view model, which is written and maintained by application developers. The separation of roles allows interactive designers to focus on UX needs rather than programming of business logic. The layers of an application can thus be developed in multiple work streams for higher productivity. Even when a single developer works on the entire code base, a proper separation of the view from the model is more productive, as the user interface typically changes frequently and late in the development cycle based on end-user feedback. The MVVM pattern attempts to gain both advantages of separation of functional development provided by MVC, while leveraging the advantages of data bindings and the framework by binding data as close to the pure application model as possible. It uses the binder, view model, and any business layers' data-checking features to validate incoming data. The result is that the model and framework drive as much of the operations as possible, eliminating or minimizing application logic which directly manipulates the view (e.g., code-behind). Criticism John Gossman has criticized the MVVM pattern and its application in specific uses, stating that MVVM can be \\"overkill\\" when creating simple user interfaces. For larger applications, he believes that generalizing the viewmodel upfront can be difficult, and that large-scale data binding can lead to lower performance.

In 1895, the school for girls expanded to 160 and added a zoo and merry-go-arounds on campus (total population 500 in 1896). 1898 brought the first Psychologist ever employed in an Institution, A.R.T.

In 1909, 507 archers of farmland was purchased for expansion of the facilities. In 1913 tunnels (which are still accessible) and ceiling tracks were installed to make deliveries and travel from building-to-building without going outside.https://ishare.doc.state.mn.us/sites/fac/frb/Faribault%20History/Faribault%20Regional%20Center/FRC%20Timeline%20leading%20to%20creation%20of%20FRB.pdf Expansion was made nearly every few years, adding new buildings (which most still exists and are used by staff and inmates). By 1955, the population of the new Faribault State Hospital was 3355 as well as 639 staff. 1968 brought a close to the working farm on the facility and many buildings closed as a result of losing population. And in 1985 Faribault State Hospital (1970‚Äì1985) changed its name to \\"Faribault Regional Center.\\" In 1987, The State Legislature authorized a bill for MN Corrections to take over FRC grounds. The model for caring for mentally disadvantaged had changed to a more community- based help and support system.https://ishare.doc.state.mn.us/sites/fac/frb/Faribault%20History/Faribault%20Regional%20Center/FRC%20Historical%20Highlights.pdf The prison was officially established in 1989 on the campus of a former state mental hospital. Between 2005 and 2008, the Minnesota legislature funded a $129 million expansion and modernization program, which included the construction of four new 416-bed living units. The prison's medium-security inmates are now primarily housed within these four large \\"K\\" buildings, so called because each building consists of four wings in a \\"K\\" configuration around a central control rotunda, with each two-story wing capable of housing 104 inmates in two-bunk cells. The expansion of the Faribault prison was a primary cause of the state's decreased reliance upon a private prison in Appleton, Minnesota. Corrections Corporation of America closed the 1,600-bed Appleton prison in 2010. MCF-Faribault has educational facilities for GED and adult basic education, and provides education in construction trades such as flooring, drywall, and woodworking. The facility also houses a MINNCOR prison industry facility providing contract labor to outside vendors as well as a line of institutional and library furniture. The 180 bed \\"New Dimensions\\" chemical dependency treatment program provides a 6-12 month treatment program for alcohol and other drug-dependent offenders.

It entered service on 1 July 1938 and was withdrawn on 24 August 1966. History Lord Faringdon was one of a small number of A4 Pacifics built with a double chimney and double Kylchap blastpipe. The first locomotive to have this being no. 4468 \\"Mallard\\". 60034 Lord Faringdon was based at Kings Cross and ran on the London-Edinburgh line. When British Railways were nationalised and the LNER A4s were renumbered, 60034 Lord Faringdon and two other locomotives E22 Mallard and 60033 Seagull were used for the 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials. Lord Faringdon was used on the ex-LMS main line from Euston to Preston and Carlisle route. 60034 Lord Faringdon was withdrawn from Aberdeen Shed on 24 August 1966. It was scrapped at Hughes, Bolckow, Blyth in early 1967 Technical specifications Peregrine, Doncaster Works number 1877, was fitted with a Kylchap double blastpipe as from new, never having a single chimney. In her service life she wore a variety of liveries with different numbering schemes: Garter Blue as 4903 Peregrine from her introduction, wartime black marked on tender as \\"NE\\" from 14 September 1942, she was renumbered as 34 in November 1946, garter blue with no valances as of 10 December 1947, renumbered as 60034 on 24 March 1948, renamed Lord Faringdon on 24 March 1948, painted British Railways dark blue on 4 December 1950 and finally British Railways Brunswick green on 7 August 1952. Advanced Warning System (AWS) was fitted on 11 November 1952 and a Smith-Stone speed recorder was fitted on 2 November 1960. Around 1966, Lord Faringdon gained a red background to its nameplates. As with all 35 of the Gresley A4 pacific steam locomotives, Lord Faringdon was fitted with streamlined valances, or side skirting, when he was built. This was removed to ease maintenance in wartime, as it was on other locomotives. 4903 lost its valances during a wartime works visit. Lord Faringdon was fitted with twelve boilers during its twenty-eight year career. These boilers were: 9031 (from construction), 8951 (from 4488 Union of South Africa, 27 December 1940), 9024 (from 4468 Mallard, 14 September 1942), 8960 (from 29 Woodcock, 10 December 1947 - renumbered 29280 4 December 1950), 29283 (from 60016 Silver King, 7 August 1952), 29270 (from 60017 Silver Fox, 13 January 1954), 29295 (from 60017 Silver Fox, 21 May 1955), 29300 (from 60027 Merlin, 10 November 1956), 29311 (from 60018 Sparrow Hawk, 29 January 1958), 29333 (new-build, 14 May 1959), 29327 (from 60026 Miles Beevor, 2 November 1960) and 27964 (from 60008 Dwight D Eisenhower, 1 June 1962).

The south transept contains the organ, built in 1883. The church used to have galleries. The Fawcus chapel in the north aisle, dedicated to a local physician, includes the Brewer Memorial . The west tower was built between 1505 and 1520 and contains a peal of eight bells, of which two were made in the 1790s by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Cullompton. The three-stage tower has moulded string courses and an angle stair turret in the north-west corner. The clock chimes each quarter-hour in a setting often known as Chard Chimes. There is a church room built in 1827. The parish is part of the benefice of Chard, St. Mary with Combe St Nicholas, Wambrook and Whitestaunton within the deanery of Crewkerne and Ilminster.

It lies at an elevation of 16 feet (5 m). The Alsace Region is one of approximately 472 neighborhoods recognized in Los Angeles County. Although once a large, amorphously defined section of Los Angeles lying between the Ballona Creek and what is now Jefferson Boulevard, today the Alsace Region consists of a strip of unincorporated Los Angeles County land located north of Jefferson Boulevard, west of Centinela, east of Grosvenor, and south of the Marina Freeway, California State Route 90.California State Route 90 The streets within the Region are one block sections of Hammack Street, Aneta Street, Lucile Street, Beatrice Street, as well as a very short span of Juniette Street. The Region features one east-west paved alley (parallel to Jefferson) and one north-south paved alley (parallel to Centinela). As is common in certain unincorporated sections of Los Angeles County, the streets in the Alsace Region do not have sidewalks as the County has limited funds available for sidewalk construction. The Alsace Region is served by Los Angeles County first responders including the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department located in nearby Marina del Rey.per the Author The Ballona Creek, which lies adjacent to the north boundary of the Alsace Region is integral to the settlement and geography of the Alsace Region. From the time of recorded human contact and continuing through the early Mexican period, the entire Los Angeles Basin, including the Region, was mostly a vast wetland with islands of forested land and dense shrub. The Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers watered the basin with most of the water sinking into the soil before reaching the coast. Periodically, the Los Angeles River would flow hard and fast enough to push its way through the Ballona wetlands and empty into the Sea in what is now Marina del Rey. A great flood in 1815 caused the Los Angeles River to change its course near Downtown and flow into the ocean by way of Ballona Creek. The river changed and adopted its current course, which empties near Long Beach, in 1825 when an epic flood from Big Tujunga Canyon in the San Gabriel Mountains and possibly earthquakes forced the Los Angeles River to begin emptying into San Pedro Bay (at Long Beach) where the river ends today. Originally the Ballona Creek was a picturesque natural waterway fed by runoff. The creek collected the water from \\"cienegas\\" (swamps) and the rains. The banks of Ballona Creek were lined with trees, like sycamores, willows and tules. This natural bounty attracted the earliest known human inhabitants of the Region who are known as the Shoshone and Gabrielino-Tongva Indians, the indigenous people of Los Angeles. For some 3,000 years, the Tongva lived in the area encompassing the Ballona Creek flood plain and the Westchester Bluffs. These indigenous peoples left a large burial ground near the Region along the southwest corner of the Ballona Wetlands. The fact that Tongva lived near the Ballona Creek was specifically mentioned in the records of the San Gabriel Mission, which record recruitment of Tongva from a group of settlements named Washna (also referred to in some historical and scholarly sources as Saa‚Äôangna) near the mouth of Ballona Creek. Before the Spanish conquest, Washna was probably the most important Native American center for trade between the mainland and Catalina Island. When Mexico claimed sovereignty over all of Alta California, the Alsace Region was made part of a 13,920-acre (56.3 km2) Mexican land grant that was confirmed by Alta California Governor Juan Alvarado in 1839 that was collectively known as the \\"Rancho Ballona\\".Rancho La Ballona The origin and meaning of ‚ÄúBallona‚Äù remain uncertain. Prevalent theories suggest that it was a misspelling. One school thinks the intended name was Ballena, which means whale in Spanish, and that at the edge of Ballona, where the creek empties, one could watch the migration of the whales. Others differ and hold the opinion that the Talamantes ancestors came from Bayona, Spain, so they named it for their early heritage. The Rancho Ballona grant was made to Ygnacio and Augustin Machado and Felipe and Tomas Talamantes. The Machados and Talamantes had already been given a Spanish concession to graze their cattle on this land in 1819. At the time that Alta California became a State within the United States, the Alsace Region and adjacent Ballona Creek were still known primarily for fishing and duck hunting. There were initial hopes that what is now Marina del Rey could be developed and turned into a working harbor for Los Angeles. In 1887, a developer named M.L. Wicks (working under the auspices of the Santa Fe Railway) commenced efforts to create a commercial harbor for the city of Los Angeles from the estuary and inlets of the village of Playa del Rey. Three years, one wharf-destroying storm, and $300,000 later, Wicks‚Äô Port Ballona Development Company was bankrupt and the ducks and hunters resumed their seasonal pas de deux. Oil was discovered in the area in 1929 and drilling was conducted on the then-vacant Alsace Region for a period of less than a decade thereafter. After that, the Region and adjacent areas remained otherwise primarily vacant through the 1950s. Two prior events changed the status of the region and the feasibility of development. The first was that the In 1940, Howard Hughes bought 380 acres (150 ha) of the Ballona wetlands south of Jefferson Avenue in south-west Culver City and the Alsace region. A total of 9,600 feet (2,900 m) were available for a runway and an unpaved runway 23/5 was operational in 1943. In 1948, 6,800 feet (2,100 m) were paved with asphalt, extended by 1962 to 8,800 feet (2,700 m). The second was that in 1949, the Army Corps of Engineers submitted an elaborate $23 million plan for a marina with the capability of mooring over 8,000 small-craft boats. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed Public Law 780, authorizing the study of the creation of the Marina as a federal project. After 7 years of legislative wrangling, California Congressman James Roosevelt, son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, confirmed that the Marina would be developed by way of a telegram dated January 25, 1962, reading: ‚ÄúHappy To Advise Senate Passed H.R. 157 Today To Change Name To Marina Del Rey. President‚Äôs Signature Expected in Due Course. ‚ÄîJames Roosevelt‚Äù, signaling that the name change and the actual project would be commenced shortly. Marina del Rey was finally officially approved, and work thereon started after President John F. Kennedy signed H.R. 157 into law, which fully and finally authorized the construction of the Marina. HR 157 stated as follows: \\"Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the body of water designated as the Playa del Rey Inlet and Harbor, Venice, California, by section 101 of the River and Harbor Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 1252; Public Law 780, Eighty-third Congress), shall be known and designated hereafter as the \\"Marina del Rey, Los Angeles, California\\". Any law, regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the United States in which such body of water is referred to shall be held to refer to it as the \\"Marina del Rey, Los Angeles, California\\" Approved February 2, 1962. Pictures of the Hughes Aircraft factory as late as 1952 confirm that there the Region remained undeveloped as of that date. Shortly thereafter, construction commenced on free-standing single-family residences completed in 1953 and 1954. By 1960, the housing development portion of the Alsace was completed and was shown on the maps as currently configured.

In South African politics, he was a member of the liberal South African Party and then the United Party from 1929 to 1966 and a member of Jan Smuts' cabinet from 1939 to 1948, during which time, he was minister of Native Affairs.South African Who's Who, 1912-1958 Major Piet (as he was commonly known) was a chevalier de la L√©gion d'Honneur, Honorary Colonel of the University of Cape Town Regiment, as well as receiving the Military Cross and the King George VI Coronation Medal. Family history and early life The first van der Byl to arrive in the Cape was Gerrit van der Byl (from Overschie, Dutch Republic) in 1668.J. van der Bijl, Vander Bijl-geslagsregister, Cape Town, 1958 Over the centuries, the van der Byls became powerful landowners by acquiring estates such as: Vredenberg, Klavervlei, Joostenberg, De Leeuwenhoek, Welmoed, Spier, Fairfield (where the family still resides) and Groote Schuur (the current residence of the president of South Africa and the estate came into the family's possession from Hester Anne Myburgh. It was later sold to Cecil John Rhodes).Groote Schuur Born on 21 February 1889 in Caledon, Cape Colony, van der Byl was the youngest of Adelaide Taylor and Tim van der Byl's four children. His father chose to educate his children locally, instead of sending them abroad, so van der Byl attended Diocesan College, in Cape Town, and then continued the family tradition of studying at Pembroke College, Cambridge.PVG Van der Byl, From playgrounds to battlefields, Cape Town, H Timmins, 1971 He fared feebly at school due to serious illness, however when he went to Cambridge, van der Byl excelled at rowing, partaking several times in the Oxford-Cambridge boat race and in his final year he received a Blue, becoming possibly the first South African to do so for rowing.Obituaries: The Argus, 21 January 1975, Die Burger, 22 January 1975, Cape Times, 22 January 1975 Military career After completing a master's degree in agriculture, van der Byl returned to the Cape with the intention of farming. However, he received a letter in 1911 from General Methuen who needed the aid of someone with local expertise for the forthcoming maneuvers in the Caledon area, after which van der Byl was asked enlist in an officer's course in the newly formed Union Defence Force by General Jan Smuts.PVG Van der Byl, From playgrounds to battlefields, Cape Town, H timmins, 1971 Many of his colleagues on the staff were former enemies from the Boer and British armies, some of which were destined to clash again in the Maritz Rebellion of 1914. At the outbreak of World War I, van der Byl served with distinction under Generals Jan Smuts and Louis Botha in the Maritz Rebellion, German South-West Africa campaign and the East-Africa Campaign (where he caught malaria that would severely affect his health for the rest of his life). In East Africa, van der Byl was appointed staff captain to General Smuts. He was often used to negotiate with the German Army (under the command of the formidable General:von Lettow- Vorbeck who, with only 3000 German Officers and several thousand local Askaris, would keep the South African and British forces at bay for the duration of the War). During this time, van der Byl frequently called on an old family acquaintance and famed big game hunter, F C Selous, and would be one of the last people to see him before his assassination. Since there was little left for him to do in East Africa, van der Byl managed to secure a transfer to the Western Front, where he joined the RAF. The war however ceased before van der Byl was able to complete his training. For his efforts during the war, van der Byl was made a chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur by the French Government and he was invited to Buckingham Palace to receive the Military Cross.‚Ä¢ Who's who of Southern Africa, 1959-1975 Farming and politics The conclusion of the war in Europe signaled a return to a more quiet life of living between England and running the family estates in South Africa. Back in South Africa, van der Byl by chance met Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and the two immediately struck up a close, lifelong friendship. In 1922, he married Joyce Clare Fleming, a Scottish woman renowned for her beauty, whom he had known since the end of the war. After a meeting with General Smuts that year, Smuts persuaded van der Byl to continue to serve under him in an official capacity in the Ministry of Defence. In 1923, van der Byl's first son, P K van der Byl, was born and in 1925 his had a second son, William. In 1928, van der Byl decided to begin a career in politics. Campaigning for the South African Party, van der Byl was elected candidate for Bredasdorp in 1929.PVG Van der Byl, From playgrounds to battlefields, Cape Town, H timmins, 1971 Minister When Smuts became Prime Minister in 1939, van der Byl attained a post in the cabinet and was minister-without-portfolio. Van der Byl was a flamboyant and an entertaining character, known for witty sense of humour and always being extremely elegantly dressed (he was voted best dressed parliamentarian several times). During the War years, amongst other duties, van der Byl was attending minister to the exiled Greek royal family. He became closely befriended with them and they often visited his home, Fairfield. One of King Paul's daughters, Irene, was born in Cape Town and his other daughter, Sophia, would later marry Juan Carlos of Spain and become Queen of Spain. In 1943, van der Byl became Minister of Native Affairs (a name which he particularly disliked). This was a monumental task as there was a growing sentiment against the African population amongst the lower class white population, who feared that they would lose their jobs to cheaper African labour, and the opposing view of Smuts and his supporters, who believed in gradual liberation of the African and non-white population. Although Smuts had used segregation in the past as a method of stemming rapid urbanisation and for other political reasons, his government's view on \\"issues of native affairs\\" was clear: they believed that Africans had the right to be permanent citizens and that segregation was not the way forward: this was highlighted in a speech which he gave in 1942 \\"segregation had failed to solve the Native problem of Africa and that the concept of trusteeship offered the only prospect of happy relations between European and African\\".(^ THE AFRICAN MINERS' STRIKE OF 1946 by M. P. Naicker - accessed 16/10/08). Van der Byl was in accord with Smuts' beliefs, which were in complete contrast with the National Party's ideas. In 1948, van der Byl was requested to crown the new Zulu King, Cyprian Bhekuzulu kaSolomon (father of the current King, Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu), to which van der Byl chose the hymn Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika to be played at the coronation, which forms part of South Africa's current National Anthem. In opposition As a result of Smuts' and van der Byl's views, not only did the South African Party government lose the June 1948 general election to the National PartyB. Friedman, Smuts: a reappraisal, Johannesburg, 1975 (who would start and continue Apartheid in South Africa for the next 46 years), but they lost their own seats in their respective constituencies. However, van der Byl managed to win the seat for Green Point (a suburb of Cape Town) in October of that year. Van der Byl kept his seat in Green Point until his retirement in 1966. During his later years in opposition, van der Byl was a very popular and respected figure by both opposition and government. In parliament, a National Party politician asked the speaker of the house if they could refer to van der Byl as \\"Oom Piet\\" (which is an Afrikaans term of respect, meaning \\"uncle Piet\\"), this was duly granted and van der Byl was henceforth known as \\"Oom Piet\\" in parliament and in the media.PVG van der Byl, The shadows lengthen, Cape Town, H Timmins, 1975 During his years in opposition, van der Byl's views on National Party government policy never changed, he vehemently continued to openly criticise the Apartheid regime for its extreme suppression of the non-white population and its transformation of South Africa into a republic. He especially sympathised with the Coloured community of the Cape, who had been highly respected by the South African government before 1948. Certain members of the community had been given the right to vote since the days of the Cape Colony. The National Party stripped them of this, and many other rights which outraged van der Byl.PVG van der Byl, From top hat to veldskoon, Cape Town, H Timmins, 1972 Although van der Byl opposed segregation and the oppression of the Black population, van der Byl did not believe in majority rule. He believed that the tragedies that occurred in African nations after independence, such as the Congo Massacres and the widespread rapid degeneration of most states, was a result of the African population not being prepared for independence and the colonial powers relinquishing power too quickly. Van der Byl was a supporter of Rhodesia, where he feared that independence would lead to disaster. He was also critical of the British Government's decision to place sanctions on South Africa and Rhodesia, as he believed that the Rhodesians and South Africans had loyally come to the aid of Britain during the World Wars, both militarily and financially. Despite his popularity, he made enemies with key National Party figures such as Vorster, Strijdom and Verwoerd (a National Party extremist and the \\"Architect of Apartheid\\"), due to his outspoken attacks on their policies, which he saw as politically and socially catastrophic to the future of South Africa. The hatred towards van der Byl from certain South African politicians would later be evident as they would refuse to deal with his son P. K. van der Byl, when P. K. became a minister in Rhodesia.PK van der Byl However, in van der Byl's case, the dislike with the National Party extremists was mutual, and he later bought the bench on which Verwoerd was murdered. In 1966, after creating an uproar in the parliament for harshly voicing his opinion on a government policy, he was asked to leave the parliament for the session by the speaker. Van der Byl (aged 77) considered that it was enough after 37 years of politics and retired.Obituaries: The Argus, 21 January 1975 Retirement It was the end of an era for South African politics, as van der Byl had been one of the few politicians to be born in the colonial era and to see the transition of aftermath of the Boer War to the full-blown implementation of Apartheid. In his retirement, van der Byl became a director of South African insurance giant, Old Mutual, and he wrote a three-volume autobiography: Playgrounds to Battlefields; Top hat to Veldtskoon and The Shadows Lengthen. Van der Byl was offered several times a baronetcy by King George VI, but Smuts refused as he insisted that South Africans did not require titles. Private life Van der Byl and wife were prominent in English society. They were closely befriended with members of the military establishment and the Royal Family. He would often be presented in court and he accompanied the Royal Family on their official tour of South Africa in 1947. During the 1947 tour, he arranged Princess Elizabeth's 21st birthday party in the Mount Nelson Hotel.PVG van der Byl, The shadows lengthen, Cape Town, H timmins, 1975 Van der Byl was an avid sportsman (hunting, shooting, fishing and riding) and he would often spend his holidays shooting with his sons in Rhodesia and other parts of Africa. He was known to be a superb rifle shot. He and his wife had two sons: P. K. van der Byl (who became a minister in Rhodesia) and William van der Byl (who became a director of AECI in South Africa).

The mosaic patterned wall and flagstone walk consist of limestone quarried from below the overlook.This section adapted from the existing NRHP sign on the site. In 2003, the Preston Overlook was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Colorado experienced cataclysmic geological events over billions of years, which shaped the land and resulted in diverse ecosystems. The ecosystems included several ice ages, tropical oceans, and a massive volcanic eruption. Then, ancient layers of earth rose to become the Rocky Mountains. Before man, the dinosaur, mammoth, mastodon, camelops and giant bison foraged for food in a verdant land. During the Ice Age Summer humans walked into the present Colorado area as they followed and hunted large animals. The ancient hunters, the Paleo-Indians, evolved into modern Native American nations. The first people in Colorado were nomads, following and hunting large mammals using the Clovis point. As Megafauna became extinct, people adapted by hunting smaller animals, gathering wild plants, and cultivating food, such as maize. As the natives became more sedentary, there were significant technological and social advances, including basket, pottery, and tool making, and creation of permanent structures and communities. Trading with other indigenous people expanded the number and type of material items used for material goods, such as sea shells, stones for jewelry and tools, pottery and food. Origins =Geological formations= The following is a summary of geological formations in Colorado: ;Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks Precambrian metamorphic rock that forms the core of the North American continent during the Precambrian eon 4.5‚Äì1 billion years ago. There is also Precambrian sedimentary argillite, dating back to 1.7 billion years ago. During the Paleozoic, western North America lay underneath a shallow sea, which deposited many kilometers of limestone and dolomite. ;Pikes Peak Granite rightThe Paleozoic era and during the Precambrian eon, about 300 million-1 billion years ago, Pikes Peak Granite was formed from mass amounts of molten rock that would amalgamate, flow and combine, to form the continents. In Colorado it is known as the Precambrian Pikes Peak Granite. Over the next 500 million years, sedimentation (sediment deposition) occurred after the granite was produced. At about 500 ‚Äì 300 million years ago, the region began to sink and lime and mud sediments deposited in the newly formed space. Eroded granite produced sand particles that formed strata, layers of sediment, in the sinking basin. At about 300,000 million years ago the land lifted, creating the ancestral Rocky Mountains.Johnson, Kirk R.; Raynolds, Robert G. (2006) Ancient Denvers: Scenes from the Past 300 Million Years of the Colorado Front Range. Fulcrum Publishing for Denver Museum of Nature and Science . ;Fountain Formation rightFountain Formation was formed during the Pennsylvanian period of the Paleozoic era, 290-296 million years ago. Over the next 150 million years, during uplift the mountains would continue to erode and cover themselves in their own sediment. Wind, gravity, rainwater, snow, and ice-melt supplied rivers that ultimately carved through the granite mountains and eventually led to their end. Fountain Formation is Pennsylvanian bedrock unit consisting primarily of conglomerate, sandstone, or arkose, in Colorado and Wyoming, along the east side of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, and along the west edge of the Denver Basin. The characteristic predominant red color and the composition of the Fountain reflect that of the granites and gneisses from which it was eroded.

At the beginning of the period, sea levels were low and present-day Colorado was part of the super-continent Pangaea. Sand deserts covered most of the area spreading as dunes seen in the rock record, known today as the Lyons Sandstone. These dunes appear to be cross- bedded and show various fossil footprints and leaf imprints in many of the strata making up the section. Related sites include: Garden of the Gods, Roxborough State Park, and the Lyons and neighboring Hall Ranch Open Space areas. ;Lykins Formation rightLykins Formation was formed during the Jurassic and Triassic periods 150-250 million years ago. The sediment deposition of wavy layers of muddy limestone and signs of stromatolites that thrived in a smelly tidal flat at present-day Colorado. The Ancestral Rockies were burying themselves while the shoreline was present during the break-up of Pangaea. This formation began right after Earth's largest extinction 251 million years ago at the Permian-Triassic Boundary. Ninety percent of the planet's marine life was destroyed and a great deal on land as well. Related sites: Garden of the Gods, Red Rocks Park, Roxborough State Park ;Morrison Formation rightThe Morrison Formation was formed during the Cretaceous and Jurassic Period 100-150 million years ago. The Morrison Formation contains some of the best fossils of the Late Jurassic. It is especially known for its sauropod tracks and sauropod bones among other dinosaur fossils. As identified by the fossil record, the environment was filled with various types of vegetation such as ferns and zamites. Related site: Dinosaur Ridge, the roadcut at the Interstate 70 Morrison exit ;Dakota Sandstone rightDakota Sandstone, formed during the Cretaceous period 70-100 million years ago, was deposited 100 million years ago towards Colorado's eastern coast. It shows evidence of ferns, and dinosaur tracks. Sheets of ripple marks can be seen on some of the strata, confirming the shallow-sea environment. Related sites are: Dinosaur Ridge, Garden of the Gods, Roxborough State Park, Deer Creek Canyon Park, the roadcut at the Interstate 70 Morrison exit. ;Pierre Shale rightPierre Shale was formed during the Paleogene and Cretaceous periods about 70 million years ago. The region was taken over by a deep sea, the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway, and deposited mass amounts of shale over the area known as the Pierre Shale. Both the thick section of shale and the marine life fossils found (ammonites and skeletons of fish and such marine reptiles as mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and extinct species of sea turtles, along with rare dinosaur and bird remains). Colorado eventually drained from being at the bottom of an ocean to land again, giving yield to another fossiliferous rock layer, the Denver Formation. At about 68 million years ago, the Front Range began to rise again due to the Laramide Orogeny in the west. Related sites are: Garden of the Gods, Fountain Creek Nature Center, Rooney Road near Dinosaur Ridge, Valmont Dike ;Fox Hills Formation rightFox Hills Formation was formed during the Paleogene / Cretaceous periods. It is a marginal marine yellow sandstone with shale interbeds created with the receding Western Interior Seaway in Late Cretaceous time. ;Laramie Formation Laramie Formation, formed during the Cretaceous periods, is a geologic formation of the Denver Basin that ranges from 400 to 500 feet on the western side of the basin and 200‚Äì300 feet thick on the eastern side. The formation can be divided into a lower unnamed member containing bedded sandstone, clay, and coal and an upper unnamed member composed predominately of 90 to 190 m of drab-colored mudstone, some sandstone, and thin coal beds.Eldridge, G.H., 1888, On some stratigraphical and structural features of the country about Denver, Colorado: Colorado.

Report of the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel. U.S.Geographical and Geological Survey. ;Denver Formation rightDenver Formation, formed during the Paleogene / Cretaceous periods 55 million years, contains fossils and bones from dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops. While the forests of vegetation, dinosaurs, and other organisms thrived, their reign would come to an end at the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary (K‚ÄìT boundary). In an instant, millions of species are obliterated from a meteor impact in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. While this extinction lead to the dinosaurs' and other organisms' demise, some life did prevail to repopulate the earth as it recovered from this tremendous disaster. The uplifted Front Range continued to constantly erode and, by 40 million years ago, the range was once again buried in its own rubble. Related sites are: Austin Bluffs Park, Green Mountain, Palmer Park, Pulpit Rock Park, South Table Mountain ;Paleosol - Dawson Arkose right Dawson Arkose, formed during the Paleogene period 37-55 million years ago, is up to 20 foot thick, multi-colored layers of clay form in this prehistoric tropical forest. This layer, Paleosol, is a soil of fossils such as petrified wood. An uplift occurred on the Front Range that caused the Pikes Peak granite to become exposed and then erode on the surface, resulting in a white sandstone called Dawson Arkose. Related sites are: Castlewood Canyon State Park, Daniel's Park, Paint Mines Interpretive Park, Rock Park ;Castle Rock Rhyolite rightCastle Rock Rhyolite was formed during the Paleogene period 34-37 million years ago. 37 million years ago, a great volcanic eruption took place in the Collegiate Range and covered the landscape in molten hot ash that instantly torched and consumed everything across the landscape. An entire lush environment was capped in a matter of minutes with 20 feet of extremely resistant rock, rhyolite. Related sites are: Castlewood Canyon State Park, Molly Brown House Museum, Rocks Park and mesa tops between Castle Rock and Monument Hill White River Formation Sedimentary rock exposure of the White River Formation in Weld County, Colorado. The White River Formation is found in the Northeastern corner of the Colorado, and was deposited between ~37.2 and ~30.8 Ma, encompassing parts of the late Eocene and early Oligocene. The formation is composed primarily of claystones, mudstones, and siltstones, within which a variety of fossil organisms, collectively referred to as the White River fauna, can be found. The fossil assemblage of the formation includes tortoises, alligators, predatory birds, Perissodactyls such as primitive horses and rhinoceroses, Entelodonts, Nimravids, rodents, Artiodactyls, and other mammals. The paleoenvironment of the formation has been interpreted as being composed of expansive savannah- woodlands and plains, occasionally interrupted by meandering rivers. ;Castle Rock Conglomerate rightCastel Rock Conglomerate was formed 16,000 - 34 million years ago. However, as seen before, life rebounds, and after a few million years mass floods cut through the rhyolite and eroded much of it as plants and animals began to recolonize the landscape. The mass flooding and erosion of the volcanic rock gave way to the Castle Rock Conglomerate that can be found in the Front Range. About 10 million years ago, the Front Range began to rise up again and the resistant granite in the heart of the mountains thrust upwards and stood tall, while the weaker sediments deposited above it eroded away. Related sites: Castlewood Canyon State Park, Rocks Park ;Quaternary Sediments Quaternary Sediments were formed during the Pleistocene period, or Ice Age Summer, 11,000-16,000 years ago. As the Front Range rose, streams and recent (16,000 years ago) glaciations during the Quaternary age literally unburied the range by cutting through the weaker sediment, creating mesa tops and alluvial plains, and giving rise to the present Rocky Mountains. The receding glaciers and warming into an Ice Age summer created a climate suitable to camelops, mastodon, mammoth, bison antiquus and other megafauna. Related sites: Carson Nature Center, Highlands Ranch Open Space, Sand Creek Drainage, South Platte Park =Paleoclimatology= Paleoclimatology is the study of prehistoric weather. The Eemian interglacial period spanned 130,000‚Äì114,000 BP. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered much of Canada and the northern United States from ca. 95,000 and ca. 20,000 years before present. 500px =Ecosystems= Beulah, Colorado - Montane grasslands Colorado has one of the most diverse plant and animal environments of the United States, partially born from the dramatic temperature changes due to elevation changes and topography. The difference in elevation from the lowest ecosystems to the peaks of the Rocky Mountains is 12,000 feet. In dry climates, the average temperature drops 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit with every 1,000 foot increase in elevation (9.8 degrees Celsius per 1,000 meters). The mountains receive the most precipitation, which the lower altitude zones on the eastern and westernmost side of the state are semi-arid, receiving comparatively little precipitation.Kruger, Fraces Alley; Meaney, Carron A. (1995). Explore Colorado: A Naturalist's Notebok. Photography by John Fielder. Englewood, Colorado: Westcliff Publishers and Denver Museum of Natural History. 1-56579-124-X. The Denver Museum of Nature and Science developed an eight-zone classification of ecosystems, defined primarily by the most present dominant plant life: * Grasslands * Semidesert Shrubland * Pinyon-Juniper Woodland (Pygmy forests) * Riparian * Montane Shrubland * Montane Forest * Subalpine Forest * Treeline * Alpine Tundra Since the Precambrian eon, the land forms have lifted, receded and have been eroded; global temperature has vacillated from tropical to ice age, which significantly affected the number and type of ecosystems and what animal and plant life flourished during each geological period. Prehistoric people =Paleo-Indian period= The period immediately preceding the first humans coming into Colorado was the Ice Age Summer starting about 16,000 years ago. For the next five thousand years the landscape would change dramatically and most of the large animals would become extinct. Receding and melting glaciers created the Plum and Monument Creeks, the Castle Rock mesas and unburied the Rocky Mountains. Large mammals, such as the mastodon, mammoth, camels, giant sloths, cheetah, bison antiquus and horses roamed the land.Waldman, Carl. (2009) [1985]. Atlas of the North American. New York:Facts on File. . Sites for the early Paleo-Indian period are found on the plains (eastern half of the state), but later in the period, there are sites found in both the mountains and plains of Colorado.Stiger, Mark. (2001). Hunter-Gatherer Archaeology of the Colorado High Country. University Press of Colorado. p. 169. . Restoration of a Columbian Mammoth ;Pre-Clovis culture Pre-Clovis period is defined by Paleo-Indian hunting before the use of Clovis points.Cassells, E. Steve. (1997). The Archeology of Colorado, Revised Edition. Boulder, Colorado: Johnson Books. pp. 53-54. . An example is Lamb Spring in Littleton, with mammoth bones dated 14,140 to 12,140 years ago and hunting by use of stone tools other than Clovis points. Other examples include Dutton and Selby in the far eastern edge of Colorado. ;Clovis culture There were a few Paleo-Indian cultures, distinctive by the size of the tools they used and the animals they hunted. People in the first Clovis complex period had large tools to hunt the megafauna animals of the early Paleo-Indian period. A key Clovis culture site is the Dent Site discovered in 1932 in Weld County, the first site to provide evidence that men and mammoth co-existed, and that man hunted mammoth on the North American continent. A group of images by Eadweard Muybridge, set to motion to illustrate the movement of the bison ;Folsom culture With time, the climate warmed again and lakes and savannas receded. The land became drier, food became less abundant, and as a result many of the giant mammals became extinct. People adapted by hunting bison and smaller mammals and gathering wild plants to supplement their diet.Griffin-Pierce, Trudy. (2010). The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Southwest. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 130 . A new cultural complex was born, the Folsom tradition, with smaller projectile points to hunt smaller animals. Aside from hunting smaller mammals, people adapted by gathering wild plants to supplement their diet. Examples of the Folsom tradition in Colorado are the Lindenmeier Site, Olsen-Chubbuck Bison Kill Site and Jones-Miller Bison Kill Sites. Aside from other sites on the Plains, there are also Folsom sites in Middle Park and the San Luis Valley of Colorado. ;Plano cultures Plano cultures existed from about 10,000 to 7,000 and are distinguished by their use of long, lanceolate and unfluted blades. Some of the best documented Plano sites are located in Colorado. Cody complex is a Plano culture that used unfluted projectile points and other tools like the Folsom and Clovis cultures from about 9,000 to 7,000 B.C. Olsen-Chubbuck Bison Kill Site, Jurgens Site and Lamb Spring are Cody complex sites. Hell Gap complex, also a Plano culture, from 10,060 to 9,600 before present (roughly 8,050 to 7,590 B.C.) was named for the Hell Gap, Wyoming archaeological site. It is distinguished by its long stemmed, convex and unfluted Hell Gap points. Jones-Miller Bison Kill Site is the only Hell Gap location in Colorado. Other Paleo-Indian sites are Roxborough State Park Archaeological District and, with artifacts from the Goshen complex / Plainview complex, Phillips-Williams Fork Reservoir Site. =Archaic period= The Archaic period began about 7,000 years ago. The bison antiquus had become extinct, like the other megafauna, and people became reliant on smaller game, such as deer, antelope and rabbits, and gathering wild plants. Their tool kits became larger, with greater reliance on manos and metates to grind food and changes in weapons for hunting, such as notched projectile points. They used plant fibers to make cordage, nets or traps to catch small animals and baskets to gather food. The people moved seasonally to hunting and gathering sites. They lived in rock shelters, such as south-facing shelters that were warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and open air campsites. Archaic people roamed the plains and the mountains, although hunting and gathering sufficient food to feed the band of people was more difficult in the higher altitude ecological climates. Late in the Archaic period, about 200-500 A.D., corn was introduced into the diet and pottery-making became an occupation for storing and carrying food.Kipfer, Barbara Ann. (2000). Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology. New York:Plenum Publisher. p. 341. . Archaic cultures: ;Apex complex Apex complex is a cultural tradition of the Middle Archaic period, distinguished by Apex projectile points dated from about 3000 to 500 BC. The type site is the Magic Mountain Site near Apex Creek. The Irwins, archaeologists at Magic Mountain, believe that the artifacts are from ancestors of Puebloan people of the American southwest.Gunnerson, James H. (1987). Archaeology of the High Plains. Denver: United States Forest Service. ;Archaic‚ÄìEarly Basketmaker Era Archaic‚ÄìEarly Basketmaker Era (7000 - 1500 BC) was an cultural period of ancestors to the Ancient Pueblo People. They were distinguished from other Archaic people of the Southwest by their basketry which was used to gather and store food. They became reliant on wild seeds, grasses, nuts and fruit for food and changed their movement patterns and lifestyle by maximizing the edible wild food and small game within a geographical region. Manos and metates began to be used to process seeds and nuts. With the extinction of megafauna, hunters adapted their tools, using spears with smaller projectile points and then atlatl and darts. They lived in simple dwellings made of wood, brush and earth.Archaic: 5500 to 500 B.C.- Overview. Crow Canyon Archaeological Center. 2011. Retrieved 10-18-2011.Time-Life Book Editors.

The Rio Grande region =Post-Archaic= Hunter-gatherer cultures ;Apishapa Phase Apishapa Phase was first identified in the Lower Apishapa canyon and is distinguished by stone or slab constructed structures, cord-wrapped pottery and small projectile points. They were a tradition of hunter gatherers who sometimes farmed and lived in northern New Mexico or southern Colorado in rockshelters, single or multi-room stone or slab structures or in campsites. There are at least 68 Apishapa sites on the Chaquaqua Plateau in southeastern Colorado. Some sites where Apishapa archaeological evidence has been found include Franktown Cave, Picture Canyon and Trinchera Cave Archeological District. ;Dismal River culture The Dismal River culture was first seen in the Dismal River area of Nebraska. Dated between 1650 and 1750 A.D., it is different than other prehistoric Central Plains and Woodland traditions of the western Plains. The people were hunter- gatherers who also cultivated food and make their own distinctive Dismal River pottery. Dismal River villages often had 15-20 round dwellings roughly in diameter. Plains Apache were linked to the culture.The Dismal River Culture. . Nebraska Studies. Retrieved November 26, 2011. Some Colorado sites include Cedar Point Village and Franktown Cave ;Panhandle culture Panhandle culture (AD 1200-1400) is a culture of the southern High Plains, primarily located in the panhandle and west central Oklahoma and the northern half of the Texas Panhandle. Most of the sites are centered around the Canadian River or its tributaries, primarily Antelope Creek and also Cottonwood Creek, Dixon Creek, Tarbox Creek and also on the Archie King Ranch. Distinguishing characteristics of the Panhandle culture are: great similarity to the Central Plains complexes; some evidence of trading or influence of Southwestern pueblo cultures; and single or multi-roomed stone structures. For Colorado sites, see Trinchera Cave Archeological District as well as the Apishapa culture and Sopris Phase articles. ;Sopris Phase Sophris Phase (AD 1000-1250) was first found in southeastern Colorado, near the present town of Trinidad. Although the culture appeared to have been greatly influenced by pueblo people, such as the Taos Pueblo and trade in the Upper Rio Grande, the Sopris culture was generally a hunter-gatherer tradition. See Trinchera Cave Archeological District ;Plains Woodland The Plains Woodland period, or Ceramic period, began in the Plains about AD 0 with the defining distinction of the creation of cordwrapped pottery, development of settlement areas, and use of smaller projectile points for hunting smaller game and/or bow and arrow technology. Sites include Colorado Millennial Site, Franktown Cave, LoDaisKa Site, Magic Mountain Site, Picture Canyon, and Roxborough State Park Archaeological District Basketmaker and Ancient Puebloan people ;Early Basketmaker II Era The Early Basketmaker II Era (1500 BC - AD 50) was the first Post-Archaic cultural period of Ancient Pueblo People. The era began with the cultivation of maize in the northern American southwest, although there was not a dependence upon agriculture until about 500 BC.Ancestral Pueblo - Basketmaker II. Anthropology Laboratories of Northern University of Arizona. Retrieved 10-14-2011. They were named \\"Basketmakers\\" for their skill in making baskets for storing food, covering with pitch to heat water, and using to toast seeds and nuts. They wove bags, sandals, belts out of yucca plants and leaves - and strung beads. They occasionally lived in dry caves where they dug pits and lined with stones to store food.Wenger, Gilbert R. (1991) [1980]. The Story of Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde Museum Association, Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado. .Rohn, Ferguson p. 148 ;Late Basketmaker II Era During the Late Basketmaker II Era (AD 50 to 500), people living in the Four Corners region were introduced to maize and basketry through Mesoamerican trading. Able to have greater control of their diet through cultivation, the hunter- gatherers lifestyle became more sedentary as small disperse groups began cultivating maize and squash. They also continued to hunt and gather wild plants. ;Basketmaker III Era The next era, Basketmaker III Era (AD 500 to 750) resulted in the introduction of pottery which reduced the number of baskets that they made and eliminated the creation of woven bags. The simple, gray pottery allowed them a better tool for cooking and storage. Beans were added to the cultivated diet. Bows and arrows made hunting easier and thus the acquisition of hides for clothing. Turkey feathers were woven into blankets and robes. On the rim of Mesa Verde, small groups built pit houses which were built several feet below the surface with elements suggestive of the introduction of celebration rituals. ;Pueblo I Era Pueblo buildings were built during the Pueblo I Era (AD 750 to 900) with stone, wooden posts, and adobe. The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration. Towers were built near kivas and likely used for look- outs. Pottery became more versatile, not just for cooking, but now included pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants. Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt- retaining dams also emerged during this period. ;Pueblo II Era During the Pueblo II period (AD 900-1150) there was an increase in population that resulted in creation of more than 10,000 sites in 150 years. Since much of the land was arid, the people supplemented their diet by hunting, foraging and trading pottery for food.Stuart, David E.; Moczygemba-McKinsey, Susan B. (2000) Anasazi America: Seventeen Centuries on the Road from Center Place. University of New Mexico Press. pp. 56-57. .

They also ranged out into the plains of northwestern Texas and the western portions of Oklahoma and Kansas. The Jicarilla Apache were hunter-gatherers, hunting primarily buffalo through the 17th century and thereafter added smaller game to their diet. Women gathered berries, agave, honey, onions, potatoes, nuts and seeds. Some bands practiced seasonal agriculture along the upper Arkansas River, cultivating squash, beans, pumpkins, melons, peas, wheat, and corn.\\"Spanish Relations with the Apache Nations east of the Rio Grande\\", Jeffrey D.

Before European expansion into the area, the Arapahos were living on the plains in South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, and Kansas. They were close allies of the Cheyenne. In winter the tribe split up into camps sheltered in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in present-day Colorado. In late spring they moved out onto the Plains into large camps to hunt buffalo gathering for the birthing season. In mid-summer Arapahos traveled into the Parks region of Colorado to hunt mountain herds, returning onto the Plains in late summer to autumn for ceremonies and for collective hunts of herds gathering for the rutting season. ;Cheyenne The Cheyenne arrived in the Colorado area shortly after the Arapaho, spoke both of the Algonquian languages, lived on the plains east of the Rocky Mountains with the Arapaho.

The Navajo ancestors were in the area after AD 1300, but at least by the early 1500s. ;Pawnee The Pawnee ranged through the Great Plains and were first documented by Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado when he met a Pawnee chief from Nebraska in 1541. Regarding Colorado, they hunted bison on plains of eastern Colorado. ;Shoshone ;Ute Ute tribal ancestors migrated east from California in the 12th century. Before the 17th century, more of these indigenous people migrated from across both the Great Basin and Utah to occupy most of Colorado; more places occupied by the Ute tribe were northern New Mexico, Wyoming and Arizona .What Other Indian Tribe is Related to the Navajo? Crow Canyon Archaeological Center. 2011. Retrieved 9-26-2011.The Ute‚ÄìSouthern Paiute Connection. Crow Canyon Archaeological Center. 2011. Retrieved 9-26-2011. The Ute also stand as the oldest inhabitants of Colorado, who chose a variety of locations for camps and routes; such as the Ute trail in the forest of the Grand Mesa. The language spoken by this tribe is a certain dialect of the Ute-Aztecan language, Shoshonean. it is generally believed that the migration of the Ute was in part an effort to separate themselves from other Shoshonean speaking tribes, such as Shoshone Bannock, Paiute, Comanche, Goshute, and Chemehuevi. :The Ute are the only Native American group with reservations in Colorado. :* Southern Ute Indian Reservation :* Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and Reservation Occupation sequences About A.D. 1700 the Ute and Apache shared the present state of Colorado, the Ute primarily and steadfastly in the Rocky Mountains and west and the Apache on the eastern plains. The Comanche entered the eastern half of Colorado early in the 1700s and with the Ute pressed the Apache to the southeastern portion of Colorado between about 1700‚Äì1750. By about 1820 the Comanche territory was the eastern part of the state. Between about 1820 and 1830 the Arapaho and Cheyenne, who had arrived from the northeast, pressed down the eastern side of Colorado pressuring the Comanche to the south, below the Arkansas River.

There are various ways in which this crime is committed. For example, the offender may return stolen merchandise to secure cash, or steal receipts or receipt tape to enable a falsified return, or to use somebody else's receipt to try to return an item picked up from a store shelf. Return abuse is a form of \\"friendly fraud\\" where someone purchases products without intending to keep them. Perhaps the most well-known form of this abuse is \\"wardrobing\\" or \\"free renting\\" ‚Äì in which the person makes a purchase, uses the product(s), and then returns the merchandise. The retail industry experiences a significant fraud and abuse problem, losing money in the range of $24 billion per year, roughly 7% of all returns and exchanges. In order to offset and recover the losses incurred from fraudulent returns, retailers raise prices for shoppers. Some stores create strict return policies such as \\"no receipt, no return\\" or imposed return time restrictions such as a 30-day limit on all returns that impact all shoppers. Some returned merchandise must be discounted or discarded after return. For example, after being returned, out-of-season clothing may have to be sold at a discount, and some clothing items such as lingerie may have to be discarded for health reasons. Types Some examples of the return fraud and abuse problems include: * Wardrobing or renting: Purchasing merchandise for short-term use with the intent to return the item, such as a dress for a special occasion, a video camera for graduations and weddings or a big-screen television for the Super Bowl. * Returning stolen merchandise: Shoplifting with the objective to return the item(s) for full price, plus any sales tax. * Receipt fraud: Utilizing reused, stolen or falsified receipts to return merchandise for profit. Alternatively, returning goods purchased on sale or from a different store at a lower price with the intention of profiting from the difference. * e-receipt fraud: Utilizing e-receipts issued when purchasing goods online, but returning them in store, to return merchandise for profit. A variation of the receipt fraud using the e-receipts. * Employee fraud: Assistance from employees to return stolen goods for full retail price. * Price switching: Placing higher priced labels on merchandise with the intention of returning the item(s) at a higher price than purchase. * Price arbitrage: Purchasing differently priced, but similar-looking merchandise and returning the cheaper item as the expensive one. * Switch fraud: Purchasing a working item, and returning a damaged or defective identical item that was already owned. * Bricking: Purchasing a working electronic item, and deliberately damaging or stripping it of valuable components to render it unusable, then returning the item for profit. * Cross- retailer return: Returning or exchanging an item purchased at another retailer (usually at a lower price) for cash, store credit or a similar, higher-priced item at another retailer. * Open-box fraud: Purchasing an item from a store and returning it opened with the intent to re-purchase it at a lower price under the store's open-box policies. A variation of price-switching. Return policies have historically served as the primary way for retailers to combat return fraud and abuse; the challenge is keeping policies from being overly restrictive and/or inconsistently interpreted, both of which may discourage loyal customers and affect purchases. Separately, automated solutions have also been developed to help combat return fraud and abuse, including software programs that detect such behavior and help retailers determine whether a return is valid. These software programs allow retailers to maintain reasonable price points for consumers, maintain lenient return policies for their good customers, and offer better and more consistent customer service. Reducing fraudulent and abusive returns helps a retailer's financial situation by lowering costs, preserving net sales, reducing shrink, while still delivering better service to their shoppers.

The game is patterned after the films Ghostbusters and Poltergeist III, casting the player as a ghost hunter. There are three mounted guns set up on the cabinet, representing the three members of a ghost hunting team. The game puts the players in the role of Bill, Max and Carol, who must rescue a little girl kidnapped by a blue gargoyle, as well as protect the city from the ghost menaces. A Sega Master System game with the same title was released in 1991 exclusively for Europe, but was not based on the arcade original. Gameplay Arcade screenshot The game was distributed in a horizontally oriented cabinet with a standard resolution color screen that is reflected by a mirror. The game can be played by up to three players simultaneously. It is controlled by a positional gun with two buttons, one for regular fire and another for limited-use special weapons. In addition to the gun, the cabinet also features an on-screen aiming reticule in which a mirror projects a red light beam away from the gun each time the player makes a shot, giving the illusion that an actual laser ray comes out from the gun to the target. The game puts the three hunters in five stages where they must destroy waves of ghosts, each one ending with a boss battle. Each player's damage zone is represented by a third of the screen, where their stats are also located. A player receives damage if their third of the screen is hit by an enemy. Ghost attacks deplete the player's life bar, which can be replenished by shooting a medical kit that some enemies leave after they are destroyed. Laser Ghost for the Sega Master System is completely different from the arcade original. In the game, players must protect a young girl named Catherine who is being held captive in the haunted White Manor. Using either the joypad or the Light Phaser gun, players eliminate the various hazards Catherine encounters as she attempts to escape with her soul. Development The arcade version of Laser Ghost was exhibited at the UK Amusement Trades Exhibition International in 1991. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Laser Ghost on their January 1, 1991 issue as being the seventh most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. The games received mixed reviews. Allgame opined that the arcade game was fun, but probably not worth the quarters players had to spend to play it. According to Zzap!64, while the game looked and sounded good and played well, it did not do enough to distinguish itself from similar games such as Operation Thunderbolt, Space Gun and Mechanized Attack. Mean Machines said that the Master System game was fun, but was critical of the low graphical quality. British gaming magazine The One reviewed the arcade version of Laser Ghost in 1991, comparing its gameplay to Beast Busters and its plot to The Real Ghostbusters. The One calls Laser Ghost's gameplay \\"nothing out of the ordinary to play\\", but expresses that \\"the ghostly goings-on will get most players [excited]\\".

History Transporte Urbano was founded by the Dominican composer Luis D√≠as, in 1982, after he returned from a temporary stay in New York City. D√≠as, a pioneer of Dominican urban folk music and one of the founders of the folk group Convite, wanted to create Dominican music with a new vision of what it could be. This arose from his contact with punk and other rock expressions while living in New York City in the early 1980s and led to the birth of Transporte Urbano. D√≠as chose a few young, Santo Domingo-based musicians for this project: Juan Francisco Ord√≥√±ez on electric guitar, Guy Fr√≥meta on drums, H√©ctor Santana on bass (later replaced by Peter Nova), Bruno Ranson on sax and percussionist Jos√© Duluc. Eventually the group settled into a guitar/bass/drums power trio format fronted by D√≠as. (The D√≠as/Ord√≥√±ez/Nova/Fr√≥meta lineup is considered Transporte Urbano's classic lineup.) In 1983, the band made their debut at the Altos de Chav√≥n amphitheatre, opening for jazz musician Bob James, and in April of the same year for the British band English Beat, at the same venue. Transporte Urbano's performance at \\"Varadero 87\\", a music festival celebrated in Cuba, became infamous when their appearance and music were considered \\"unsuitable\\" by certain Cuban cultural authorities, who were expecting a merengue or more traditional sounding group. The members of the band were \\"invited\\" to leave the country the day after the show. However, the young Cuban press supported the performance of the band, as well as noted Cuban singer/songwriter Pablo Milan√©s. Transporte Urbano remained active on the Dominican musical scene until 2004, when they performed a show for the Dominican culture ministry, at a tribute to D√≠as. Luis Dias died 5 years later in Santo Domingo, on 8 December 2009, at 57 years of age from a heart attack and kidney and liver complications.  Relevance  Transporte Urbano was the first band to make authentic Dominican rock. Although there were earlier rock groups on the island, this was the first time a Dominican rock band had a clear mark of originality.http://rossyd.blogspot.com/2008_01_26_archive.html They are considered highly influential and Dias' being regarded \\"the father of Dominican rock\\" stems directly from his work with Transporte Urbano. Along with the distinct social commentary content of D√≠as' songs, the band mixed in the universal sounds of rock and jazz and referenced authentic Dominican rhythms, generating a new musical style.http://galipote.mx.tripod.com/luisterrordias/id1.html Always a phenomenal live act, the trio's noted virtuosity was an ideal backdrop for D√≠as' showmanship.http://www.cielonaranja.com/luisterrrordiasentre.htm Transporte Urbano performed songs written by Luis Dias exclusively.

In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The School District received a $902,093 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= Apollo-Ridge School District Administration reported that 47 students or 3.10% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget In 2009, the district reported employing 110 teachers and administrators with a salary range of $40,000 to $104,500 for a 186-day work year (includes 2 clerical days and 2 inservice days). The median teacher salary was $54,714. The work day is 7 hours 45 minutes with a 30-minute duty-free lunch break and a duty-free prep period. Teachers receive additional pay at an hourly rate for work or required meetings held outside of the regular school day. Special education teachers receive an extra $200 a year. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days (which accumulate), and many other benefits. Retiring teachers are eligible for up to $100,000 retirement bonus plus paid health insurance until the person qualifies for Medicare. The District provides 10 days leave with pay for teachers to conduct union business and to attend union conventions. In 2007, the district employed 102 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $53,873 for 180 days worked. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries.

Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds. In August 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the school board and administration. The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the individual's level of personal wealth. =State basic education funding= In 2011-12, the district received a $7,761,205 allocation, of state Basic Education Funding.

This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $304,492 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten, to assist struggling students and to provide continuing teacher training. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Apollo-Ridge School District did not apply to participate in 2006-07 or in 2007-08. The district received $83,715 in 2008-09. Federal Stimulus grant The district received an extra $1,925,328 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Apollo-Ridge School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided nearly one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Common Cents state initiative= The Apollo-Ridge School Board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2011-12 were set by the school board at 59.5000 mills in Armstrong County and 143.2000 mills in Indiana County. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate ‚Äì land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. The school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts. *2010-11 - 59.5000 mills in Armstrong County and 146.0000 mills in Indiana County. *2009-10 - 59.5000 mills in Armstrong County and 137.6100 mills in Indiana County. *2008-09 - 59.5000 mills in Armstrong County and 138.8300 mills in Indiana County. *2007-08 - 55.8100 mills in Armstrong County and 132.1000 mills in Indiana County. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The Pennsylvania School District Adjusted Index for the Apollo-Ridge School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 5.7%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 5.0%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 6.5%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 6.1%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 4.3%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 2.1%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.5%, Base 1.7% For the 2011-12 school year, the Apollo-Ridge School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Apollo-Ridge School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. For 2009-10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Apollo-Ridge School District was $324 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 2,714 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Armstrong County, 77% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. In Armstrong County, the highest amount of tax relief in 2010, went to property owners in Apollo-Ridge School District. In Indiana County, the highest amount of tax relief in 2010, went to property owners in Blairsville-Saltsburg School District at $311. The highest property tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the residents of Chester Upland School District of Delaware County who received $632 per approved homestead.Tax Relief per Homestead 2009, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report May 1, 2010 Chester Upland School District has been the top recipient since the program began. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently, individual with income much more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This benefit can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the US in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).

He began practicing wrestling as a senior, going undefeated and winning the heavyweight Class B title, which was the school's first state title in any sport. He accepted a football scholarship from Grand Valley State University, after the wrestling coach Jim Scott, convinced head coach Jim Harkema to make the offer. As a sophomore, he was converted into an offensive tackle because of an injury to a starter. He would become an NCAA Division II and NAIA All-American. As a junior, he helped the team achieve the best record (9‚Äì3) in school history and qualify to the playoffs for the first time.

Location  The story of Per Gynt is set in the historic district of Gudbrandsdal in Norway. Per Gynt's home in the folklore is traditionally claimed to have been Nordre H√•g√• farm in S√∏dorp parish at Nord-Fron in the county of Oppland.  Folklore  The tales encompass the themes of identity, relationships and personal stories from a lonely hunter. The folktale tells of the eponymous Per Gynt and his various exploits. He rescues three dairy-maids from trolls and shoots the B√∏yg, a troll which takes the form of a gigantic serpent and stands as a hindrance to travellers.  Recording  The fairy tale was recorded by Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen in Norwegian Folktales (Norske Huldre-Eventyr og Folkesagn) which was first published in 1845. Asbj√∏rnsen included the stories about Per Gynt into the section \\"Reindeer Hunting at Rondane\\" (Rensdyrjakt ved Rondane).

Education and career Frugoni received his doctorate in 1938 from the elite Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa and pursued post-graduate studies at the Italian Historical Institute for the Middle Ages (Istituto storico italiano per il medio evo ) in Rome. In 1954, he returned to Pisa to teach medieval history at the Scuola Normale. In 1962, he was appointed to a chair in medieval history at the University of Rome, where he remained until his untimely death in 1970 at age 56. Intellectual Influence Frugoni is known principally for his contributions to the field of medieval biography and intellectual history, with a focus on the papacy and religious ideology. His most celebrated and influential work was his 1954 study of the twelfth-century political and religious reformer Arnold of Brescia. The Arnold book made a striking break with older historiographical approaches to biography and religious studies by asking how diverse contemporary authors in their texts constructed or imagined Arnold and his ideas based on their own contexts and agendas. In this way, he focused not on the individual himself, but, in an almost Rashomon-like fashion, the fragments and snippets of history that made up the image of the individual over time. In a subsequent collection of studies on the idiosyncratic hermit pope Celestine V, Frugoni used contemporary descriptions and discussions of Celestine to illuminate the theological and political controversies surrounding the papacy in the late thirteenth century. Frugoni also wrote extensively on Dante as a political and religious dissenter, as well as on the rise of humanism and its impact on the Italian Renaissance. When he died, he was working on a critical edition of Dante's letters that was published posthumously. Many of Frugoni's ideas were more congruent with the French Annales School and its interest in historical mentalities, than with the traditional approaches that were current in the Italian academy during his career. Consequently, he never established what one might call a \\"school\\" of historical thought in Italy, with a cohort of students who continued his work, but his work did influence a number of European scholars who were inspired by his unique approach to the sources and the kinds of questions he asked. Carlo Ginzburg, for example, who studied with Frugoni in Pisa, has cited him as a major influence.See, e.g. Ginzburg, Il filo e le tracce (Milan, 2006) p. 312 Frugoni's daughter, Chiara (b. 1940), followed in her father's footsteps and is a noted historian of medieval social history.

It is a diploid species, and is the parent of several species of hybrid origin, including Dryopteris carthusiana. Other common names for this species include intermediate shield fern, fancy wood fern, fancy fern, glandular wood fern, American shield fern and common wood fern. This fern is often confused with several other wood fern species, including D. carthusiana, D. campyloptera, and D. expansa. It especially extensively shares the range of D. carthusiana, but the two may be distinguished by the innermost pinnule on the bottom side of the bottom pinna: this pinnule is longer than the adjacent pinnules in D. carthusiana, but shorter or even in D. intermedia.  Description  Dryopteris intermedia is a perennial fern that grows to a size of about tall and wide. At its base, it consists of an underground rhizome from which grow the fronds of the plant in a spiral-like arrangement. Each frond consists of a stipe (stalk) that is covered in light-brown scales towards the base and short glandular hairs further up. The stipes generally measure between 1/4 to 1/3 the length of the frond and support a leaf blade that is lance-oblong in shape. The leaves themselves are bipinnately compound, meaning that they divide into leaflets called pinnae and sub-leaflets called pinnules. The pinnules of this species are lobed and toothed. Uniquely, the first pinnule closest to the stem on the lowest pinna is shorter than the second.  Distribution and conservation  Dryopteris intermedia is native to most of eastern North America, ranging from Minnesota in the north-west and Newfoundland and Labrador in the north-east, down to Alabama in the south-west and South Carolina in the south-east. While globally secure, it is considered by NatureServe to be \\"critically imperiled\\" in the states of Iowa and Missouri which represent the western limit of its range, and \\"imperiled\\" in the states of Illinois and South Carolina as well as the region of Labrador.  Habitat Dryopteris intermedia grows in a variety of mesic habitats including forests, woodlands, ravines, swamp edges and rocky slopes.  Cultivation  Dryopteris intermedia is cultivated as an ornamental plant in North America for gardens, especially natural gardens and shade gardens, as it is easy to grow in a range of environments and soils and does not spread much. Care needs to be taken when planting to ensure that the fern is placed in an area of part-shade or full-shade and that the soil remains moist, as it does not tolerate a lot of sun or dry soil.  Hybrids  Several naturally occurring hybrids involving Dryopteris intermedia exist. These include: * Dryopteris campyloptera √ó Dryopteris intermedia (\\"hybrid wood fern\\") * Dryopteris intermedia √ó Dryopteris marginalis (\\"glandular marginal wood fern\\") * Dryopteris √óboottii (\\"Boott's wood fern\\") * Dryopteris √ótriploidea (\\"triploid wood fern\\") * Dryopteris √ódowellii (\\"Dowell's wood fern\\") * Dryopteris goldieana √ó Dryopteris intermedia (\\"hybrid wood fern\\") All of the hybrids listed above are sterile. One exception is the allotetraploid Dryopteris carthusiana (spinulose wood fern), which is said to originate from a hybridization of Dryopteris intermedia and an extinct fern dubbed Dryopteris \\"semicristata\\".

Plot The villages of Charmoussey and Super-Charmoussey (Upper Charmoussey) have been longtime rivals despite the fact that many of their inhabitants are related to each other. While Charmoussey is relatively poor, Upper-Charmoussey enjoys the luxuries of a ski resort and thus a better economy than its sister village. The rivalry is also stressed because of the local beauty pageant, where the better trained and dressed girls of Upper-Charmoussey always win the contest. Since the size of both municipalities is very small, the local government has decided to merge Charmoussey into Upper-Charmoussey, this leaves the inhabitants of Charmoussey desperate because it is their last chance to win the beauty contest. In order to achieve that, they call the only person who has had any success outside the village, Franck (Beno√Æt Poelvoorde) a second rate actor, who has been engaged mostly as an extra in many films (playing dead people) and is currently down on his luck after causing an accident that resulted in breaking the leg of actress Catherine Deneuve (his biggest role so far). It is revealed that he left the village because he was regarded as strange and because his father was an eccentric scientist who died in trying a flying suit. He feels uneasy at coming back to his hometown but also recognizes that he cannot afford not to, so he uses his limited showbiz knowledge to train the local girls. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Upper- Charmoussey have learned from the local postman that Franck has been engaged in training the contestants and start a counter espionage campaign of their own.

I also enjoyed \\"Buddy the Blues,\\" which > could almost be a companion song to Lead Belly's \\"Good Morning Blues.\\" In > Lead Belly's song, the singer talks directly to the blues, in Donohue's, the > blues answer back. The only instrumental is \\"December Waltz,\\" a pretty tune > in 3/4 time that has some of the bluest bent notes you'll hear in a waltz. > Regenstreif, Mike. \\"Pat Donohue: Profile.\\" Sing Out!

Using a binary goal (e.g. first player wins the game), game trees of two-person perfect-information games can be mapped to an and‚Äìor tree. Maximizing nodes become OR-nodes, minimizing nodes are mapped to AND-nodes. For all nodes proof and disproof numbers are stored, and updated during the search. To each node of the partially expanded game tree the proof number and disproof number are associated. A proof number represents the minimum number of leaf nodes which have to be proved in order to prove the node. Analogously, a disproof number represents the minimum number of leaves which have to be disproved in order to disprove the node. Because the goal of the tree is to prove a forced win, winning nodes are regarded as proved. Therefore, they have proof number 0 and disproof number ‚àû. Lost or drawn nodes are regarded as disproved. They have proof number ‚àû and disproof number 0\\\\. Unknown leaf nodes have a proof and disproof number of unity. The proof number of an internal AND node is equal to the sum of its children's proof numbers, since to prove an AND node all the children have to be proved. The disproof number of an AND node is equal to the minimum of its children's disproof numbers. The disproof number of an internal OR node is equal to the sum of its children's disproof numbers, since to disprove an OR node all the children have to be disproved. Its proof number is equal to the minimum of its children's proof numbers. The procedure of selecting the most-proving node to expand is the following. We start at the root. Then, at each OR node the child with the lowest proof number is selected as successor, and at each AND node the child with the lowest disproof number is selected as successor. Finally, when a leaf node is reached, it is expanded and its children are evaluated. The proof and disproof numbers represent lower bounds on the number of nodes to be evaluated to prove (or disprove) certain nodes. By always selecting the most proving (disproving) node to expand, an efficient search is generated. Some variants of proof number search like dfPN, PN2, PDS-PN have been developed to address the quite big memory requirements of the algorithm.  References   Further reading  A. Kishimoto, M.H.M.
