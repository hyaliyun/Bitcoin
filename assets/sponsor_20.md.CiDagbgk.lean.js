Early life He was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1958. He was educated at St. Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School, Belfast, University College Dublin, King's Inns and the University of Virginia. While attending University College Dublin, he won the 1978 Irish Times Debate with Conor Gearty for the UCD Law Society. He graduated from Virginia in 1983, where he wrote a research paper comparing equality under the US and Irish constitutions, supervised by A.E. Dick Howard. Janet Napolitano was also among the class of 1983. His brother Turlough O'Donnell SC is former Chairman of the Bar Council of Ireland. He comes from a legal family, his father, The Rt. Hon Sir Turlough O'Donnell PC, was a member of the High Court of Northern Ireland and of the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland between 1971 and 1990. Legal career He was called to the Irish Bar in 1982. He was then later called to the Bar of Northern Ireland in 1989. He has practised in all courts in Ireland, Northern Ireland, European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). He was known for his speciality in constitutional law. He successfully represented the applicants from the Garda Síochána after the death of John Carthy in a constitutional challenge which limited the powers of investigation of the Oireachtas, which led to the unsuccessful Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution. He acted for the State in Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners and Miss D. He was counsel for Michael Lowry at the Moriarty Tribunal. O'Donnell's practice also extended to commercial law. He and Paul Gallagher acted for a group of tobacco companies in 2004 in challenge to a restriction of tobacco advertising. He represented the Beef Industry Development Society Ltd in a 2008 case in the ECJ which clarified the meaning of an agreement under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. O'Donnell was a member of the Law Reform Commission from 2005 to 2012. He became a Bencher of the King's Inns in 2009. Judicial career O'Donnell was appointed to the Supreme Court in 2010. He was appointed directly from practice to Ireland's highest court, a rare direct appointment. His appointment followed Nicholas Kearns becoming President of the High Court. There have been several distinctive and innovative features of his Supreme Court judgments, including writing joint opinions and opting to delay a declaration of unconstitutionality, in lieu of no declaration at all, to enable the government to take action before a judgment takes effect. Ruadhán Mac Cormaic of The Irish Times says O'Donnell has a reputation for elegant writing and having a \\"socially liberal\\" approach. He was reported to have been one of three judges shortlisted to be the 12th Chief Justice of Ireland in July 2017, however, Frank Clarke was chosen. Personal life He is married to Mary Rose Binchy, an artist, with whom he has four children.

James Redding Ware was born in Southwark, south London, in 1832, the son of James Ware, a grocer, and Elizabeth, nee Redding. By 1851, his father had died, and his mother, according to the census, was a grocer and tea-dealer, and James Redding Ware was her assistant. By 1861, the household is no longer in place, and J. R. Ware is not readily identifiable in the census.1841, 1851, 1861 UK census But in 1865, James Redding Ware became a Freemason, at the Westbourne Lodge No. 733, and he was living in Peckham. (He became a Junior Warden at the Urban Lodge, no. 1196, and by 1872 a Worshipful Master (WM).)The Era, 1 December 1872; he was still a member of the Urban Lodge, according to the Era, 22 November 1891 His detective works include: The Female Detective (c. 1863/1864),1864: British Library catalogue suggested date; acquisition stamp date in British Library copy: 9 January 1863 'edited by A.F.'; Secret Service, or, Recollections of a City Detective (1864?); The Private Detective and Revelations of the Private Detective (both c. 1868). Forrester was for many years known to be a pseudonym, but who he was actually, was unknown. However, recently one of his stories, 'A Child Found Dead: Murder or No Murder?', was discovered, reprinted as a pamphlet and published under the name of J.

In a PDM signal, specific amplitude values are not encoded into codewords of pulses of different weight as they would be in pulse-code modulation (PCM); rather, the relative density of the pulses corresponds to the analog signal's amplitude. The output of a 1-bit DAC is the same as the PDM encoding of the signal. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a special case of PDM where the switching frequency is fixed and all the pulses corresponding to one sample are contiguous in the digital signal. For a 50% voltage with a resolution of 8-bits, a PWM waveform will turn on for 128 clock cycles and then off for the remaining 128 cycles. With PDM and the same clock rate the signal would alternate between on and off every other cycle. The average is 50% for both waveforms, but the PDM signal switches more often. For 100% or 0% level, they are the same. Description In a pulse-density modulation bitstream a 1 corresponds to a pulse of positive polarity (+A) and a 0 corresponds to a pulse of negative polarity (-A). Mathematically, this can be represented as: : x[n] = -A (-1)^{a[n]} \\\\ : where x[n] is the bipolar bitstream (either -A or +A) and a[n] is the corresponding binary bitstream (either 0 or 1). A run consisting of all 1s would correspond to the maximum (positive) amplitude value, all 0s would correspond to the minimum (negative) amplitude value, and alternating 1s and 0s would correspond to a zero amplitude value. The continuous amplitude waveform is recovered by low-pass filtering the bipolar PDM bitstream. Examples A single period of the trigonometric sine function, sampled 100 times and represented as a PDM bitstream, is: 0101011011110111111111111111111111011111101101101010100100100000010000000000000000000001000010010101 An example of PDM of 100 samples of one period of a sine wave. 1s represented by blue, 0s represented by white, overlaid with the sine wave. Two periods of a higher frequency sine wave would appear as: 0101101111111111111101101010010000000000000100010011011101111111111111011010100100000000000000100101 A second example of PDM of 100 samples of two periods of a sine wave of twice the frequency In pulse-density modulation, a high density of 1s occurs at the peaks of the sine wave, while a low density of 1s occurs at the troughs of the sine wave. Analog-to-digital conversion A PDM bitstream is encoded from an analog signal through the process of delta-sigma modulation. This process uses a one bit quantizer that produces either a 1 or 0 depending on the amplitude of the analog signal. A 1 or 0 corresponds to a signal that is all the way up or all the way down, respectively. Because in the real world, analog signals are rarely all the way in one direction, there is a quantization error, the difference between the 1 or 0 and the actual amplitude it represents. This error is fed back negatively in the ΔΣ process loop. In this way, every error successively influences every other quantization measurement and its error. This has the effect of averaging out the quantization error. Digital-to- analog conversion The process of decoding a PDM signal into an analog one is simple: one only has to pass the PDM signal through a low-pass filter. This works because the function of a low-pass filter is essentially to average the signal. The average amplitude of pulses is measured by the density of those pulses over time, thus a low pass filter is the only step required in the decoding process. Relationship to biology Notably, one of the ways animal nervous systems represent sensory and other information is through rate coding whereby the magnitude of the signal is related to the rate of firing of the sensory neuron. In direct analogy, each neural event – called an action potential – represents one bit (pulse), with the rate of firing of the neuron representing the pulse density. Algorithm Pulse-density modulation of a sine wave using this algorithm. A digital model of pulse-density modulation can be obtained from a digital model of the delta-sigma modulator. Consider a signal x[n] in the discrete time domain as the input to a first-order delta- sigma modulator, with y[n] the output. In the discrete frequency domain, where the Z-transform has been applied to the amplitude time-series x[n] to yield X(z), then the output Y(z) of the delta-sigma modulator's operation is represented by :Y(z)=X(z)+E(z)\\\\left(1-z^{-1}\\\\right) where E(z) is the frequency-domain quantization error of the delta-sigma modulator. Rearranging terms, we obtain :Y(z)=E(z) + \\\\left[ X(z)-Y(z)z^{-1} \\\\right] \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{1-z^{-1}} \\\\right). The factor 1-z^{-1} represents a high-pass filter, so it is clear that E(z) contributes less to the output Y(z) at low frequencies, and more at high frequencies. This demonstrates the noise shaping effect of the delta-sigma modulator: the quantization noise is \\"pushed\\" out of the low frequencies up into the high-frequency range. Using the inverse Z-transform, we may convert this into a difference equation relating the input of the delta-sigma modulator to its output in the discrete time domain, :y[n] = x[n] + e[n] - e[n-1] There are two additional constraints to consider: first, at each step the output sample y[n] is chosen so as to minimize the \\"running\\" quantization error e[n]. Second, y[n] is represented as a single bit, meaning it can take on only two values. We choose y[n]=\\\\pm 1 for convenience, allowing us to write :\\\\begin{align} y[n] &= \\\\sgn( x[n] - e[n-1] ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\begin{cases} +1 & x[n] > e[n-1] \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & x[n] < e[n-1] \\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (x[n] - e[n-1]) + e[n] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} : e[n] \\\\leftarrow y[n] - (x[n] - e[n-1]) = \\\\sgn( x[n] - e[n-1] ) - (x[n] - e[n-1]) This, finally, gives a formula for the output sample y[n] in terms of the input sample x[n]. The quantization error of each sample is fed back into the input for the following sample. The following pseudo-code implements this algorithm to convert a pulse-code modulation signal into a PDM signal: // Encode samples into pulse-density modulation // using a first-order sigma-delta modulator function pdm(real[0..s] x, real qe = 0) // initial running error is zero var int[0..s] y for n from 0 to s do if x[n] ≥ qe then y[n] := 1 else y[n] := −1 qe := y[n] − x[n] + qe return y, qe // return output and running error Applications PDM is the encoding used in Sony's Super Audio CD (SACD) format, under the name Direct Stream Digital. Some systems transmit PDM stereo audio over a single data wire. The rising edge of the master clock indicates a bit from the left channel, while the falling edge of the master clock indicates a bit from the right channel.Thomas Kite. \\"Understanding PDM Digital Audio\\" (PDF). 2012.

Scott was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and served in the United States Navy, where he became well known for jumping off the masts of Navy vessels. Upon leaving the Navy he became a professional stuntman, passing the hat for contributions after his performances. Scott performed stunts in Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia and on the St. Lawrence River. He dived from a precipice near Niagara Falls, reported in newspapers as a 593-foot jump, although historians consider this figure to be impossible. Scott also worked as a bartender in Rochester, New York, where Sam Patch had jumped to his death from the High Falls in 1829. Samuel Gilbert Scott jumps from a scaffold on Waterloo Bridge In 1837, Scott traveled to England to continue his diving career. He dove 100 feet in Manchester, 167 feet in Liverpool, and jumped from a 140-foot scaffold at the Chain Pier, Brighton. On the battleship St. Joseph, moored in Devonport, he jumped from a 200-foot topmast. In Cornwall, Scott allegedly jumped from a 240-foot cliff into eight feet of water; this achievement exceeds the current world record high dive, and is also considered unlikely. Performances in England continued in 1838, including a 60 ft leap from the topmast of a barque into the docks at Gloucester in early October, and a promised jump from a 100 ft scaffold into a pond at the Pittville Hotel in Cheltenham.Cheltenham Chronicle, 4 Oct 1838. Scott was nearly killed in an accident while performing on an American ship in Deptford. He often swung from a rope by his feet and neck before jumping. While he was doing so in Deptford, the rope accidentally slipped around his neck and nearly strangled him. Scott was saved only by the quick thinking of a sailor who caught his feet and supported him, allowing Scott to loosen the rope. Scott's comment to the crowd after this accident was, \\"The hemp that is to hang me is not grown yet!\\"The Times, January 12, 1841, cited in \\"Victorian London – Entertainment and Recreation – Theatre – Acts – Samuel Scott, The American Diver\\" victorianlondon.org (Retrieved on June 9, 2011) Awful Death of Sam Scott On January 11, 1841, Scott planned to run from the White Lion Pub in Drury Lane to Waterloo Bridge, jump from a scaffold on the bridge into the river, and return to the pub during the hour between 1:00 and 2:00 P.M. Upon arrival at the bridge, Scott began swinging from a noose attached to the scaffold. Once again the noose slipped and tightened around Scott's neck. As had also happened in Deptford, the spectators erroneously thought that this was part of Scott's act, and no immediate action was taken. Eventually, one man in the crowd insisted that Scott be cut down, but it was too late. According to a contemporary broadside, Scott \\"was immediately taken to Charing Cross Hospital,A handwritten footnote at this point to the original broadside (reproduced in Jay, p. 151) reads \\"twenty minutes past three\\". The broadside earlier states that the accident occurred while Scott was \\"attempting to repeat the performance about three o'clock\\", suggesting that Scott may have earlier successfully completed his two-way run and dive. where every attention was paid to him, but unfortunately without effect, as life was quite extinct.\\" There were conflicting reports of Scott's marital status, but he married at least once. This was in Falmouth, Cornwall, in December 1839, to Miss Mary Ann Cosier of Penryn.Cheltenham Chronicle, 26 Dec 1839 According to The Times of London, Scott was residing with his wife in Deptford at the time of his death. His wife usually accompanied him to his performances, but was not present on the occasion of his fatal accident. Thomas Carlyle mentioned Scott's death in a letter to his brother Alexander Carlyle, written on January 15, 1841. In Carlyle's words: > A wretched mortal that was wont to leap from top masts, bridges &c;, and > dive and do feats of that kind, perished in a shocking manner (as you will > see by that Newspaper) here this week. One of his tricks was to act hanging; > the noose slipt; he was found hanged in earnest! When I think of the mob > looking at him, brutal animals, the still more brutal 'gentlemen' of the > Bridge Committee encouraging such a scene,—few things I have ever heard of > seem more detestable.\\"The Carlyle Letters Online\\" dukejournals.org The > Carlyle Letters Online [CLO]. 2007. . Retrieved on June 6, 2011. The case is further mentioned in Alfred Swaine Taylor's Manual of Medical Jurisprudence, 6th American edition (Philadelphia 1866), p. 339, albeit giving a wrong year: > The death of Scott, the American diver, in January, 1840, shows how readily > asphyxia may be induced by a slight compression of the throat, even when a > person might be supposed to have both the knowledge and the power to save > himself ... No attempt was made to save him until it was too late, and he > was not brought to a hospital until thirty-three minutes had elapsed. He was > allowed to hang thirteen minutes –– the spectators thinking that the > deceased was prolonging the experiment for their gratification!

If Open didn't have the resources to put out a record everyone knew deserved release, Safety Net would. And vice versa. For instance, when Open couldn't release an EP by The Bobs, Safety Net simply slapped on its own label. (The Bobs, with their evocatively clever lyrics and funky arrangements, were a far cry from the better-known soft-rock a cappella group with the same name).

Gregory was an explorer in Western Australia, before moving to Queensland in 1862, serving as Commissioner of Crown Lands and an appointed Member of the Queensland Legislative Council from 1874 until his death in 1888. The home was later used as the summer residence for Lord Lamington who served as Governor of Queensland from 1896 until 1901. A Harlaxton railway station was built for his use at the site (on the Main line railway). The house is in a deteriorating condition, partly due to blasts from the neighbouring quarries.

It lies about from the coast at Playa la Moza, almost halfway between Angostura (to the south) and La Coronilla (to the north), north of Punta del Diablo and roughly northeast of the northeast bank of the Laguna Negra. It lies within the Santa Teresa National Park. It was erected from October 1762 by the Portuguese, having abandoned the attempt at building a fort in Maldonado and leaving the Fuerte San Miguel. Topography The region is characterized by vast expanses of dunes on the coast, as well as a series of wetlands located west and north. The fort was strategically located on a rocky outcrop at 58 m above sea level along the Camino de la Angostura, the only way through the marshes to the sea.  Description  Mauer der Fortaleza de Santa Teresa ;Walls It has the shape of an irregular pentagon, and five angles are finished in projecting bastions. There are five checkpoints for each angle of the pentagon, elegantly constructed in the form of carved stone pulpit. The perimeter of the fortress measures 652 meters and it occupies one hectare in area. The walls are massive, built with huge granite masonry, strictly equal in size and perfectly carved. The outer wall is about four feet thick at the base and about two meters, the interior, filling the space between one and another. A solid embankment in some places is up to 7 m wide. The height of the outside walls in some places reaches to 11.5 m. ;Doors “La puerta principal” It is built of solid wood arched at the top and looks to the west. “La Puerta oculta de socorro”. Looks south, and is of smaller proportions than “la Puerta Principal”. “El Túnel de la Trinchera” corresponds to what is now identified as a deep trench with walls of smaller stones located in front of the fortress in an east-west direction. “El Túnel del Arca”. is supposed to be hidden underground under the Fort. According to oral tradition, it consists of three or more rooms connected by walkways and a large tunnel that goes to the East. The output would be found somewhere near the Atlantic Ocean about 2000 m away. The popular belief here is that a secret artifact is hidden underground called the Arca secreta del Padre Lucas. ;Lodging Inside the fortress it lodged a maximum of about 300 men. The interior construction, also of stone masonry, preserved in perfect condition from the colonial era, have been restored with care and replacement roofs added. These buildings are: the flag room and guardia on the sides of the front door, the main, which was formerly the chapel, two large blocks, and the \\"polvorín\\", built with huge blocks of granite and the cells. ;Cemetery Cemetery The cemetery is located a short distance from the west wall, and used from the second half of the eighteenth century to beyond the extinction of the fortress as such, since it continued to be in use in the neighborhood. Enlisted men lie there, the strong Spanish garrison in the area, Spanish, slaves, Indians and Portuguese alike. Of major note are Agustín Lipopisi and Félix Sayobí, two Guaraní chiefs and missionaries of San Carlos y Chorpus, Cecilia Maroñas, daughter of the Spaniard Francisco Maroñas and Portuguese María Espíndola, one of the sons of Commander Alagón who attacked by a cougar in Potrerillo, and many others. Like the fort, the small enclosure was built by the former Jesuit Lucas Marton, with convicts, and Guaraní Indians. It was designated as the first sector to be restored. Although the condition was not good, it maintained its original layout and stones, albeit collapsed, were in place. The small crosses are the original stone, not the large stone cross though, which was carved by the master mason Juan Buzzalini who served in the whole process of restoration of the fort. History The current Fortaleza de Santa Teresa was built by the Spanish crown, though its foundation and name are due to Portugal. In the brief period from 1762 to October 1775, they built three forts. The signing of the Treaty of El Pardo (1761) in practice nullified the Treaty of Madrid (1750). Governor and Captain General of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, Gomes Freire de Andrade, anticipated its consequences for the southern region and ordered troops to the region. Bringing a little more than a thousand men, the Portuguese strategy was to quickly build a fortified defensive line, south of Fuerte San Miguel to stop the Spanish invasion in progress. After the conquest of Colonia del Sacramento in October 1762 by the governor of Buenos Aires, Pedro de Cevallos, the fort began construction with about 400 soldiers and armed with a few pieces of small arms. The site chosen was the strategical pass of Angostura near the Castillos Grande. right The fort, designed by Gómez de Mello, consisted of a trench dug in the slope of a hill site, known as Chico Castillo. The timber was moved from the area of Fuerte San Miguel, about 30 km distant, a daunting task for the time, because they had to ford countless streams and swamps. On October 6, 1762, a cornerstone was laid at the foot of the foundation and the fort was given the name in honor of Saint Teresa. However, construction was halted due to the war. However, in the war between Spain and Portugal, the Spanish general Pedro de Cevallos ordered the construction of another fort, directed against Portuguese Brazil, designed by Francisco Rodríguez Cardozo. Materials were used from the building that had been started. Ceballos then continued on his way to São Pedro do Rio Grande, in the same month taking Fuerte San Miguel, near the Arroyo Chuí. The Treaty of San Ildefonso (1777) confirmed the Spanish possession of the Fortaleza de Santa Teresa and the Fuerte San Miguel. A third fortification was built between 1765–1775, designed by engineer Bartolomé Howel and built by ex-Jesuit Lucas Marton and Guaraní Indians. With the imminence of a British invasion in 1775, Bernardo Lecocq worked to strengthen the structure of the fort as he did with the Fuerte San Miguel. Other repairs were made in 1797. In 1776, a year after completing the construction of the Fortaleza de Santa Teresa, Portugal returned to threaten the Spanish in these parts of Latin America. Governor Juan José de Vértiz y Salcedo moved from Buenos Aires to organize the defense, pending General Pedro de Cevallos and his army to carry out a counterattack. Upon arrival, they received news of the signing of the peace treaty of San Ildefonso, suspending all activities. Cevallos nevertheless was promoted as Captain General and became first viceroy of Río de la Plata. From that time the fortress was held until 1828, with the emergence of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, becoming state property. By the Treaty of May 15, 1852, which established the border demarcation at the mouth of the Chui Stream and the San Luis River, the two forts (San Miguel and Santa Teresa) remained in Uruguay. View Once Uruguay was established, the state, for nearly a century, had no resources to preserve historical monuments. Thus began the decline of the Fortaleza de Santa Teresa. Nevertheless, it fulfilled its role as a watchtower on the border during the presidencies of Fructuoso Rivera and Manuel Oribe, between 1830 and 1843. During the so-called Guerra Grande in the mid- nineteenth century, it was occupied by Manuel Oribe, but afterwards the structure was abandoned. In 1895 it was reoccupied as a prison. However, the total abandonment came about and it served to shelter cattle and bats, the latter inspired the former president Dr. Baltasar Brum to write a literary composition based on an Indian legend of the place. In 1921, under Brum, the historian and archaeologist Horacio Arredondo conceived and proposed to restore it and preserve the Fort of San Miguel and the Fortaleza del Cerro in Montevideo. In 1928 his plan was put into practice and the forts were restored. Since the 1940s, it has contained a museum and been a tourist site; one of the few bastions of the colonial era in Uruguay which still survives.  Folklore and legends  The following legend was written by Baltasar Brum in 1930 based on an indigenous legend of the place. It recounts the formation of the hills with an emphasis on the origin of the Cerro Verde (the complete original version is on La Fortaleza de Santa Teresa). \\"The Heart of stone siren\\" According to the legend: the spirits of the elements that inhabited the seas and land, after the triumph of Christianity there, migrated to our continent in search of tranquility, but they were discovered and lost their freedom. Lovers of beauty and peace, they refused to fight against the human gods, and therefore, during a large gathering, decided to mutate in forms reminiscent of their passions. The land spirits sought refuge in the flowers, trees, pines and insects, while the marine ones in capes, promontories, reefs, seaweed, dolphins and seals. Five sirens, Caaibaté, Maci, Manipeya, Cuñataí and Alua who lived in the seas were transformed into the Cerro Verde, and into the capes of Fortaleza, i.e. Moza, Chato, del Barco o del Naufragio and Árido. Caaibaté, was a siren loved in the South and in the North, who loved the former and disdained the later. Metamorphosed into the Cerro Verde she suffers the eternal harshness of the North rejected lover, who, with the help of the sunrise and sunset, suppliers of sand, isolated her from the ground, by covering her with dunes. The South prevents this, by circulating, with the caress of his breath, the sap that comes from the heart of the siren in order to give life to the lush green vegetation that covers her, in a triumphant defense of love over hate”.

In the elections for the five Peruvian members of the Andean Parliament, they won 13.94%.

It was formerly the residence of the Counts of Schwarzburg-Leutenberg and today is a dermatological medical facility. History In the 9th century CE, Slav tribes built a hill fort on the site of the castle to take refuge from the Sorbs to the east. There is evidence of a medieval fort beginning in the 14th century. It was the seat of the Ministeriales of Lutenberg (Leutenberg), who are first mentioned in 1187. The Counts of Schwarzburg were lords of the castle by 1326 and from 1363 to 1564 it was the residence of the cadet line of Schwarzburg-Leutenberg, after which it became the dowager house for the main line, whose seat was in Rudolstadt.Luise Grundmann, Saalfeld und das Thüringer Schiefergebirge: eine landeskundliche Bestandsaufnahme im Raum Saalfeld, Leutenberg und Lauenstein, Landschaften in Deutschland 62, Cologne: Böhlau, 2001, , p. 207 (For example, from 1662 to 1670 the Lutheran hymnist Ludämilie Elisabeth von Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt lived there with her widowed mother and her sister, and it was probably there that she composed most of her hymns.Linda Maria Koldau: Frauen – Musik – Kultur: ein Handbuch zum deutschen Sprachgebiet der Frühen Neuzeit, Cologne: Böhlau, 2005, , p. 284 John Julian, ed., A Dictionary of Hymnology: Setting Forth the Origin and History of Christian Hymns of All Ages and Nations, London: Murray, 1892, p. 701.) In the 16th century, constant inheritance conflicts emerged between the Houses of Schwarzburg and Leutenburg and the Counts of Orlamünde; the castle was renamed Friedensburg (Peace Fort) in 1564. It was little used from the mid-18th century on and passed out of the possession of the House of Schwarzburg in 1900.Edgar Winzen and Max Liedtke, Für Hitler erzogen?: Briefe und Notizen des Edgar Winzen aus der Kinderlandverschickung Leutenberg in Thüringen 1944/45, Münster: Waxman, 1999, , p. 21, note 89 It became an inn in 1904 and a possession of the State of Thuringia in 1918. The town of Leutenberg grew up as a result of the castle's presence. The castle was built in three phases: the massive Bergfried (keep) and the east wing, which originated in a freestanding residential tower, are the oldest parts; the north wing was built between 1362 and 1375; and the castle took on its current appearance in a third period of construction in the early 16th century, when the south wing was added and the defensive building reconstituted as a primarily residential castle.Grundmann, pp. 207-08. Since then, the castle has suffered repeated damage from fires, for example in 1567, 1695, 1726, 1800 and 1934. In the last fire, in 1934, the east, north and west wings were gutted and much of the historic interior was destroyed, including the 17th-century chapel. After rebuilding, the castle was used as part of an educational camp for evacuee schoolboys during World War II, then requisitioned for scientists from Peenemünde;See Winzen and Liedtke; for the requisitioning, p. 54, note 63. during the Soviet administration and under the German Democratic Republic it was a holiday resort for Zellwolle Schwarza (1947-51), was administered by the State Forestry Service (1952-56) and then became a residence for the Council of Ministers. Between 1991 and 1993 it underwent a comprehensive restoration and has since been a specialised dermatological hospital. References Sources * C. Truppel.

Formally, the Stanley symmetric function Fw(x1, x2, ...) indexed by a permutation w is defined as a sum of certain fundamental quasisymmetric functions. Each summand corresponds to a reduced decomposition of w, that is, to a way of writing w as a product of a minimal possible number of adjacent transpositions. They were introduced in the course of Stanley's enumeration of the reduced decompositions of permutations, and in particular his proof that the permutation w0 = n(n − 1)...21 (written here in one-line notation) has exactly : \\\\frac{\\\\binom{n}{2}! }{1^{n - 1} \\\\cdot 3^{n - 2} \\\\cdot 5^{n - 3} \\\\cdots (2n - 3)^1} reduced decompositions. (Here \\\\binom{n}{2} denotes the binomial coefficient n(n − 1)/2 and ! denotes the factorial.) Properties The Stanley symmetric function Fw is homogeneous with degree equal to the number of inversions of w. Unlike other nice families of symmetric functions, the Stanley symmetric functions have many linear dependencies and so do not form a basis of the ring of symmetric functions. When a Stanley symmetric function is expanded in the basis of Schur functions, the coefficients are all non-negative integers. The Stanley symmetric functions have the property that they are the stable limit of Schubert polynomials :F_w(x) = \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\mathfrak{S}_{1^n \\\\times w}(x) where we treat both sides as formal power series, and take the limit coefficientwise.

Originally in the Shire of Drayton, the locality was first opened as the Harristown Estate in 1902. The estate consisted of 177 building sites ranging from . Forty blocks were sold at the auction. Harristown State School opened on 4 September 1911 with 67 students. The official opening on Saturday 30 September 1911 was performed by the acting Secretary for Education Kenneth Grant, by which time the enrolment had already increased to 84 students. From 1915 until 1993, the suburb had a functioning railway station on the Toowoomba–Wyreema line. After World War II, the area boomed. Although the need for Lutheran schooling in Toowoomba had been identified since 1926, the Great Depression followed by World War II prevented a school being established. Concordia Lutheran College opened on 17 February 1946 in the (now heritage- listed) house Redlands on a site in Stephens Street with 27 students (23 of them being boarders). In 1964 a primary school campus opened nearby in Warwick Street with an initial 64 students. A second primary school campus (originally called Martin Luther Primary School) was established in 1977 in Hume Street, Centenary Heights. St Anthony's Catholic Primary School was established in 1954 by the Presentation Sisters. The foundation stone was laid on 21 November 1954, which is a significant day for the sisters as their order celebrates the Feast of the Presentation of Mary in the Temple on 21 November each year. The first classroom was ready in February 1955 and by the end of 1955 there were 116 students enrolled. The Presentation Sisters ran the school until the first lay principal was appointed in 1985, although the sisters continued to teach in the school until the end of 1997.

Their importance as a group was largely within the visual arts, where they played a significant role in the birth of the Arts and Crafts Movement: The Set were intimately involved in the murals painted on the Oxford Union Society in 1857, and members William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones and Charles Faulkner were founding partners of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. in 1861. Activities and development The group initially met every evening in the rooms of Charles Faulkner in Pembroke College, though by 1856 its dominant figure was Edwin Hatch. The primary interests of the Birmingham Set were initially literary – they were admirers of Tennyson in particular – and they also read the poetry of Shelley and Keats and the novels of Thackeray, Kingsley and Dickens. The turning point in the group's interests took place when Morris and Burne-Jones, and through them the rest of the group, discovered the writings of John Ruskin and took to visiting English country churches and making pilgrimages to the medieval cities of France and Belgium. In 1856 members of the Set published twelve monthly issues of the Oxford and Cambridge Magazine, which was created to propagate the group's views on aesthetics and social reform.

From 1924 to 1941, following reconstruction, the vessel operated as an auto ferry under the name Olympic. During the Second World War (1941-1945) this vessel was taken under the control of the U.S. Army and renamed the Franklin R. Leisenburg. The Liesenburg served as a ferry in the Panama Canal area under Army control, and then was sold to a firm which ran the vessel on the Surinam river in South America. Design and construction Following the loss of the nearly-new but wooden steamship Clallam in 1904, Joshua Green, president of the Puget Sound Navigation Company, owner of the Clallam and the dominant Puget Sound shipping concern, announced that the company would replace its wooden steamships with ones built of steel. As part of this effort, in 1910, the steel steamers Sioux and Kulshan. were built nearly simultaneously in Seattle by the Seattle Construction and Drydock Company. Sol Duc was specifically designed for the Seattle – Tacoma.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at 172 175, 183, 209, 262, 336, 339, 351, and 492 Dimensions for Sioux were 461 gross tons, length beam of and depth of hold of . Power was supplied by a four-cylinder, compound steam engine, with cylinder bores sized, and two ; stroke . Two oil-fired boilers produced steam at 250 pounds pressure, with whole power plant developing . Operations Originally Sioux was intended to be placed on the route from Seattle to Irondale, where an important ironworks had been established, and which had provided much of the steel for the construction of the vessel. In May 1911 Sioux was placed on the Irondale route but only ran until July 1911, when she was replaced by the City of Everett. The ironworks was in trouble financially and about to file bankruptcy, so the traffic on the route didn't appear to justify use of the new steamer. Instead, Sioux was placed on the route from Seattle to the new municipal dock at Tacoma, alternating with the Indianapolis so that a steamer left Seattle every two hours bound for Tacoma. Sioux was later placed on the Hood Canal route, running with the sternwheeler State of Washington for the rest of the summer of 1911. Afterwards the steamship's permanent route became Seattle-Edmonds- Everett. Sioux could make the run in two hours, not as fast as the Flyer, but still considered good time. When the Lake Washington Ship Canal was completed, the Sioux was the first commercial vessel to pass through the locks during the opening ceremony on July 4, 1917. 1912 Everett harbor accident Sioux was involved in an accident at Everett on August 16, 1912, which as it was said, resulted in \\"seriously depleting the local mosquito fleet\\".McCurdy at 209 Steamships had no direct speed control from the bridge of the vessel. The captain signaled the engine room using a system of bells and dials called the engine room telegraph. Accidents could and did happen when engine telegraph signals were misinterpreted by the engine room. On this particular occasion, Sioux, coming in from Seattle, was approaching the Everett dock. From the bridge, Capt. William Thorton signaled the engine room for \\"half astern\\" to slow the vessel down. Instead the engine room gave him \\"half ahead\\" which caused the steamer to ram into the dock. Captain Thorton then signaled for \\"full astern\\". Another mistake was made and the Sioux went full ahead, smashing into the stern of the Camano, driving Camano forward into the gasoline launch Island Flyer which in turn struck another gasoline launch, the newly built Alverene. Island Flyer was sunk as a result and Alverene was seriously damaged. Camano then sank at the dock. The small launch Arrow was demolished and the steam launches Ranger and Daphne suffered lesser damage.Faber, Steamer's Wake, at 162. It turned out that an engine room assistant, known as an oiler had been left in charge of the telegraph. No one was killed although there was at least one close call. The destruction showed the vulnerability of wooden hulled steamers, one of the reasons why the Puget Sound Navigation Company switched to steel-hulled vessels. Reconstruction as ferry Olympic In 1923, the Puget Sound Navigation Company decided to rebuild Sioux, then running the Seattle - Port Townsend route into an automobile ferry, and late in the year gave the reconstruction contract to the Todd Dry Dock corporation in Seattle. The reconstruction was completed in the first part of 1924. Sioux was renamed Olympic. Sioux, renamed Olympic was placed on the Victoria, British Columbia to Port Angeles, Washington route across the Strait of Juan de Fuca, departed from Seattle on Saturday, June 14, 1924, making her first run on June 15, 1924, under Capt. Louis Van Bogaert, Chief Officer Harry Carter, and Chief Engineer I. Terado. Olympic had been scheduled to depart on Friday the 13th, but company management felt this supposedly ill- omened date would create too much adverse comment, and postponed the departure by one day. Olympic is also reported to have been run on the Victoria, BC- Bellingham, Washington route.Newell and Williamson, Pacific Steamboats, at page 182. Later years In 1941, the U.S. Army bought Olympic from the Puget Sound Navigation Company and rebuilt her for service in the Panama Canal area as the Franklin R. Leisenburg. After the war the vessel was sold to a firm in Dutch Guiana for service out of Paramaribo on the Surinam River. As of the late 1950s the ship was reported to be still in operation on the Surinam river.

In the elections for the five Peruvian members of the Andean Parliament, they won 27.02% and two representatives: Hilaria Supa and Alberto Adrianzén. Presidential candidate Olanta Humala won 31.7% of the votes. As the first-placed he could qualify for the run-off election. Eventually, he won the second round against right-wing candidate Keiko Fujimori with 51.5% of the votes. Peru Wins formed a majority coalition in Congress with the Possible Peru Alliance, the centrist group of ex-president Alejandro Toledo. After his inauguration on 28 July 2011, Humala appointed a cabinet mainly consisting of moderate and established experts. This cleared up the fears that Peru could radically shift to the left. All 47 congressmen elected on the party's lists joined the Nationalist/Peru Wins parliamentary group. At the end of the legislative period, the alliance was shattered. Four years after the election, nearly a third of the lawmakers elected on Peru Wins slates had deserted its benches. In October 2015, even Vice President Marisol Espinoza left the parliamentary group. In the 2016 national election, the PNP does not run at all, while the PCP and PS have joined the Broad Front.

Crime in Romania is combated by the Romanian Police, Gendarmerie and other agencies. Crime by type =Violent crime= Romania differs from many countries in that violent crime is more likely to occur in rural areas than in cities, due to the socioeconomic problems of many parts of the countryside. Such rural areas often suffer from poverty, low level of education of the population, and unemployment. For instance, Romania's Nord-Est development region is one of the poorest areas of the EU. Another peculiarity of Romania is that gun violence is exceptionally rare due to Romania having some of the strictest gun laws in the world. Most homicides are committed with sharp objects such as axes or knives. Among homicides in 2012, only 2% were by firearms, and among suicides in 2015, only 1% were by firearms. Violent crime was much higher in the 1990s. =Murder= In 2016, Romania had a murder rate of 1.25 per 100,000 population.https://dataunodc.un.org/crime/intentional-homicide-victims There were a total of 247 murders in Romania in 2016.https://dataunodc.un.org/crime/intentional-homicide-victims =Corruption= Due to Romania's entry into the EU, Romania has been forced to improve transparency and accountability in the public sector. However, citizens and businesses still consider the government's reform weak and slow due to poor implementation of laws on transparency of information and decision-making process. The EU Commission's latest Cooperation and Verification Mechanism report has however lauded the National Anticorruption Directorate and various other agencies in improving the fight against corruption, which has recently brought a number of high-profile convictions ranging from a former prime minister and parliamentarians to mayors and businessmen. =Crimes against tourists= The United States Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security stated in the Romania 2017 Crime & Safety Report that \\"Most crimes against visitors are limited to crimes of opportunity or scams.\\" The report describes crimes such as individuals posing as plainclothes police officers, approaches of \\"quick friendship\\", pick-pocketing in crowded areas and public transportation, aggressive panhandlers, fraudulently charging exorbitant prices, and crimes against train passengers which cross rural areas. It also warned about avoiding areas with a higher frequency of crime such as the neighborhood of Ferentari in Bucharest. However, the report argued that it was driving which was \\"perhaps the biggest safety concern that visitors will encounter\\", due to disregard of driving laws. =Domestic violence= In the 2010 Eurobarometer poll on violence against women, 39% of Romanian respondents said that they thought DV in their country was \\"very common\\", 45% \\"fairly common\\", 8% \\"not very common\\", 0% \\"not at all common\\", and 8% did not know/did not answer. Victim blaming attitudes are common in Romania. In a 2013 Romanian survey, 30.9% of respondents agreed with the assertion that \\"women are sometimes beaten due to their own fault\\". In the 2010 Eurobarometer survey, 58% of Romanians agreed that the \\"provocative behaviour of women\\" was a cause of violence against women. In 2016, Romania ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention). =Theft= Pick-pocketing and stealing bags often take place in crowded areas, near exchange shops and hotels, on public transportation, in railway stations and inside airport terminals; and such acts are a very serious problem in Romania. A group of people (often including children - see section below) surround a person that appears wealthy, distract their attention, while one or more members of the group attempt to snatch money, watches or jewellery from pockets or from around the neck and wrist. Some thieves take advantage of the lack of attention of the victims and snatch bags and quickly run away. Tourists can also fall victims to thieves who present themselves as plain- clothes policemen, flash a badge and ask to see passports and wallets, after which they steal money from the wallet. =Crimes committed by children= Crimes committed by children peaked in the 1990s when the social context of the time (closing of many Romanian orphanages and economic insecurity due to the collapse of the planned communist economy after the Romanian Revolution) resulted in large numbers of street children. However, the situation has greatly improved since then. Nevertheless, there are still children and teenagers committing petty crimes on the streets and engaging in aggressive begging. According to the US Romania 2017 Crime & Safety Report: \\"Panhandlers -- often groups of teenagers -- can be aggressive and have resorted to grabbing/tearing clothing to distract and steal from their target (...) Organized groups of thieves and pickpockets (including very young children and well-dressed young adults) operate in train stations and on public transportation.\\" Combating crime =Romanian Police= The Romanian Police () is the national police force and main law enforcement agency in Romania. It is subordinated to the Ministry of Administration and Interior. During the communist era it was called miliția. Following the fall of communism, it has undergone numerous changes and reorganizations, the most important of which took place in 2002, when the police was demilitarized, becoming a civilian police force. =Gendarmerie= Romanian Gendarmes The Romanian Gendarmerie () is a military police force of Romania tasked with high-risk and specialized law enforcement duties. It is one of the two main police forces in Romania (the other one being the Romanian Police), both having jurisdiction over the civilian population. Like the Romanian Police, the Gendarmerie is subordinated to the Ministry of Administration and Interior and does not have responsibility for policing the Romanian Armed Forces (this duty lies with the Military Police subordinated to the Romanian Land Forces). Reporting and investigating crime Police headquarters, Bucharest According to the US Romania 2017 Crime & Safety Report: \\"Romanian police do have the capability to conduct complex criminal investigations but are heavily burdened with petty crimes\\". One crucial aspect of Romanian system of dealing with victims - at all levels of investigating and punishing crimes - is the \\"medico-legal certificate\\" () which is obtained from a medical doctor specialized in medical jurisprudence (). It is also called \\"certificat de la IML\\". This certificate is used as proof for violent crimes. Historical crimes Perhaps the most notorious criminal in Romania was Ion Rîmaru, a serial killer who in 1970-1971 murdered and attacked several women in Bucharest. He was sentenced to death and executed in May 1971. In Transylvania, in the 1970s, Romulus Vereș, known as \\"the man with the hammer\\", murdered and attempted to murder several women; he was charged with five murders and several attempted murders, but was never imprisoned due to grounds of insanity having been found suffering from schizophrenia, blaming the devil for his actions - instead, he was institutionalised in the Ștei psychiatric facility in 1976. In 1977, in Bucharest, the Anca case (Cazul Anca) would later prove to be one of the worst miscarriages of justice of Romania. A taxi driver was forced, under torture inflicted on him by militsiya officers and prosecutors, to admit to a murder that he did not commit, after communist authorities ordered the case to be quickly solved. In 1981, the real murderer, Romca Cozmici, was caught: he admitted to the crime for which the taxi driver was convicted - a gruesome murder of an 18-year-old woman, and the dismembering of her body, and also admitted to a second similar murder. He was sentenced to death and executed.

H. Gaunt in Letchworth Cemetery in 2017 William Henry Gaunt (born in Bradford, Yorkshire, 13 January 1874 – 31 October 1951) was an English transport engineer who began his working life developing and building gas- powered trams. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School before joining the Ashbury Company in Manchester as an apprentice. The works at Ashbury supplied the trams for Britain's first gas-powered tramway, the Blackpool, St Annes and Lytham tramway, operated by the British Gas Traction Company. Gaunt transferred to the tramway company in 1896, and then became manager of a similar gas-powered scheme at Trafford Park in 1896. Following the financial collapse of the Gas Traction Company in 1898 Gaunt was appointed manager of Trafford Park's gas and electric tramways, a position he held until 1905, when the operation of the electric line was taken over by the corporations of Manchester and Salford. Gaunt then moved south to manage the world's first garden city, at Letchworth. During the First World War he worked for the Coal Mines Department of the Board of Trade as a distribution superintendent in charge of coal, gas, and electricity. He subsequently joined J. Lyons & Co. as a transport manager, and eventually rose to become a director of the company. In 1940 Gaunt became transport adviser to the Ministry of Food. Gaunt married Kate (née Brooks Kearsley) in 1900. The couple had no children, and she died in 1941. He was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and a Vice-President of the Institute of Transport. He was awarded a C.B.E. in 1938. Gaunt is buried in Letchworth Cemetery.

He built a large part of Moira, County Down in the seventeenth century. Known as \\"Father of Irish Gardening\\" and \\"The Cock of the North\\", he was a keen botanist, and brought over 400 different species of plant to Moira from Jamaica. He played an active role in the Williamite War in Ireland. Following the Glorious Revolution he was involved in the raising of the Army of the North, a Protestant force opposed to the Jacobite Irish Army. Biography His father was Sir George Rawdon, 1st Baronet. Rawdon was a Member of Parliament for Down, and a general in the army of King William of Orange. Besieged at Derry, he fell ill, but managed to escape, though his military career was at an end. Rawdon inherited the lands at Moira after his father died. He rebuilt a mansion, surrounded by trees, sheep and huge gardens. On this estate Arthur built the first hot-house in Europe. Rawdon was a botanist and imported 400 plant species from Jamaica, earning the name \\"Father of Irish Gardening\\". His garden had a labyrinth, ponds, and canals. The trees included the \\"Locust of Virginia\\" which was 30 ft high and a trunk of at least a foot and a half in diameter. For two generations the garden was maintained. Legacy Today in Moira many places are named after Sir Arthur Rawdon, including Rawdon Court, off Main Street, Moira. Off the Meeting Street there is Rawdon Place which is housing street. Parts of the remains of his mansion are still visible.

Biography Étienne Tristan de Salazar was born in Saint-Maurice- Thizouaille ca. 1431, the son of Jean Salazar (a leader of the Écorcheurs) and his wife Marguerite, who was the daughter of Georges de la Trémoille. Tristan de Salazar was himself an illegitimate child, and in his youth he was hidden in Thorailles. After Jean Salazar's service to Louis XI of France at the Battle of Montlhéry (1465), Louis XI was determined to promote Salazar within the Catholic Church in France. Salazar joined the Grandmontines, rising to become commendatory abbot of the Priory of Macheret near Saint-Just-Sauvage. He was appointed Bishop of Meaux on June 25, 1473. He became Archbishop of Sens on September 26, 1474. As archbishop, Salazar presided over an Assembly of the French clergy held in 1475, calling for a crusade against the Turks and calling for a restoration of the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges and the convening of an ecumenical council. He called a synod in Sens in August 1485 to confirm regulations passed by his predecessor, Louis de Melun. In July 1490, he was sent as an ambassador to England. A conflict with the cathedral chapter of Notre Dame de Paris in 1492 saw Salazar lose his right to preside at that cathedral. Also in 1492, he oversaw the fortification of Saint-Julien- du-Sault. In 1498, he oversaw a commission that ordered the annulment of the marriage of Louis XII of France and Jeanne de France. In February 1499, he served as an ambassador to the Swiss Confederacy to seek an alliance in Louis XII's war against Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. Louis XII appointed him to the Grand Conseil on May 13, 1502. During the Italian Wars, in 1507 he accompanied Louis XII to fight against the Republic of Genoa. During the War of the League of Cambrai, he presided over a council at Pisa in May 1511 that purported to depose Pope Julius II. In 1514, he presided over the funeral of Anne of Brittany at the Basilica of St Denis; he presided over Louis XII's funeral there in 1515. He died in Paris on February 11, 1518. He is buried in the nave of Sens Cathedral. Patronage In 1479, he commissioned Francesco Florio to produce a copy of the Decretum Gratiani that is currently on display at the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal. Between 1475 and 1518, he oversaw the building of the Hôtel de Sens, which thereafter served as the Paris residence of the Archbishop of Sens. He improved Sens Cathedral by commissioning the windows of the Last Judgment and the life of Saint Stephen. He added a memorial chapel dedicated to his parents in 1510. During the campaign against Genoa, he acquired a foot of Saint Stephen that he donated to the cathedral. See also * Tristan de Salazar on French Wikipedia.

He is the son of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Salinas served as vice president of Prorsus Capital, a financial consortium with ties to Keith Raniere and Nxivm. Following Raniere's arrest in 2018 for sex trafficking, money laundering, and other misdeeds, Salinas ended a two-decade association with Raniere and resigned from Prorsus. Education and career Salinas is the son of Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his first wife, former Mexican First Lady Cecilia Occelli. Educated in Mexico, Switzerland, France and the USA, he is fluent in Spanish, English and French. He studied in the primary school division of the Liceo Mexicano Japonés in Mexico City.\\"Retrata nuevo libro de Tavira a los Salinas, tras su salida del poder\\" (Archive). El Universal. Wednesday November 19, 2011. \\"Emiliano estudió la primaria en el Liceo Mexicano Japonés, ubicado al sur del DF.\\" Prior to working at Prorsus Capital, Salinas received his Bachelor's degree in Economics from ITAM (the Spanish acronym for Autonomous Technology Institute of Mexico) in Mexico. Later, he received his PhD in Political Economy and Government from Harvard University. Prior to receiving his PhD from Harvard, Salinas worked as a financial analyst for the Lazard Freres and Co. LLC investment bank in New York City, where he participated in mergers and acquisitions involving Telefónica de España, Anheuser-Busch InBev, and Revlon among others. NXIVM In March 2011, journalist Denisse Maerker in her Punto de Partida TV show asked Salinas if he was interested in pursuing a political career. He said that he would \\"if I considered that government is the solution to the problems we face today.\\" He said that he is convinced that good citizenship is the solution to social problems instead of the government. Aside from his professional career, Salinas has arisen as a staunch voice against violence and corruption in Mexico, and he offers that the culture of self victimization is to blame for the plight of Mexico in 2011. It was his belief that if Mexicans were proactive through the use of Civil Resistance, they would have the power to overthrow the regional subjugation of the large drug cartels. He described solutions to these problems in his four levels of response against violence: * Denial and apathy * Fear * Courage * Non-violent action During the time Sallinas developed his anti-violence and anti-corruption persona, he was involved with NXIVM, a self-help group whose founder, Keith Raniere was indicted in New York City on charges of \\"racketeering conspiracy, identify theft, extortion, forced labor, money laundering, wire fraud and sex trafficking. Various high level members of the group pled guilty to similar charges. NXIVM advertised itself as a multi-level marketing enterprise. In 2003, Salinas described Nxivm's Executive Success Program, or ESP, as offering a training \\"like a practical M.B.A.\\" Salinas joined NXIVM's Executive Board in 2009, co-owned various ESP centers, and was associated with various NXIVM- owned companies in Mexico. Salinas is credited with recruiting elite members of Mexican society to the group, including at least two children of two former Mexican presidents. Salinas' sister, Cecilia Salinas Ocelli, was also a member of the group. Among the allegations levied against Salinas was his support for a plan to have critics of Nxivm who traveled to Mexico arrested and put into jail in that country. In the week's following Raniere's 2018 arrest in Mexico and subsequent deportation to the United States, Salinas cut ties with NXIVM and ESP claiming no knowledge of the alleged behavior. Internet rumor suggested Salinas was under pressure from his father, who supposedly was behind the arrest and extradition of Raniere, to distance himself from the group. Patronage and publications Salinas has been involved as producer of acclaimed theater productions, such as Sicario. He has also collaborated in literary productions, like the book on addictions by Luis Eugenio Todd. An essay on corruption co-authored by Salinas, entitled \\"The Organization of Corruption: Political Horizons and Special Interests\\", won the First Prize of the 2006 Research Competition on Corruption organized by Mexico's Office of the Comptroller (SFP) and National Autonomous University of Mexico.

Its name is derived from famous Sufi saint Adalshah Baba, whose Majar is still maintained in vill. Ibrahimpur, which is a cent percent Hindu village. Adalhat is located on SH 5A, also known as Shakti Nagar Highway, being upgraded from two lane to four lane, it has Varanasi in its north at a distance of 30 km and Robertsganj in south at a distance of 60 km. Legal administration of the place lies with Chunar Tahsil. Adalhat is not a revenue village, so not on all administrative records, but it comprises villages Ibrahimpur, Naithi, Hansapur, Garaundi, and Pathraura of Tahsil Chunar. It has police station and post office in name of Adalhat. About 50 years ago this place was confined to village Ibrahimpur only. There was only one primary school for about a dozen villages, nearby till 1951. A social worker and Sarpanch of this area Sri Sita Ram Gupta took initiative and a middle school was started in 1951 which gradually rose up to 10+2 standard now and named as Adarsh Inter College. The college is co- educational with about 3000 students and about an equal number of girls and boys. The connectivity by canal service roads and Sharma Road extended up to Bihar in east and being on main Varanasi-Shaktinagar road, opened doors to good business. There is a post graduate level government-run degree college for women Lalta Singh Rajkiya Mahila Mahavidyalaya. The strength of girls in this college is about 1500. There are three nationalised banks (Union Bank, State bank of India Bank and Allahabad Bank), one cooperative bank and A post- office branch in Adalhat market. This is not a big business center but its proximity to Varanasi (30 km) and being a hub of agricultural activities has a good potential for a food processing unit. Adalhat is also known for its most secular image. On the eve of Moharram every year, more than hundred Tazias are brought here from nearby villages for burial at Garaundi Imambara. They proceed from the northern end of Adalhat market in shape of a procession, which is led by Tazia of Ibrahimpur where only a couple citizens having faith in Islam live. In this village (Ibrahimpur) Hindus fully cooperate for this Tazia and the following events. The place has also been in news for revamping education system in rural India, many schools like Royal Public school, Eden school, Kalidasa have transformed the education system in the area covering approximately 50 km. Some coaching institutes like BASE School of Spoken English, Advance Coaching centre, RB Singh Coaching Centre & Mishra Coaching Centre and private primary school like Swami Vivekanand Adarsh Baal Vidyalaya(Founded by Ramesh Pandey), Kalidas public School (Founded by Kalicharan Gupta) etc. This place is located on Varanasi-Shaktinagar highway, nearest railway station being Ahraura Road (at Narayanpur). The place is famous for its nearby (20 km) waterfall, Lakhania dari. Climate Adalhat experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cwa) with large variations between summer and winter temperatures. Summers are long, from early April to October, with intervening monsoon seasons and are also extremely hot, even by South Asian standards. The temperature ranges between 22°C46 °C (72°F115 °F) in the summers. Winters in this place see very large diurnal variations, with warm days and downright cold nights. Cold waves from the Himalayan region cause temperatures to dip across the city in the winter from December to February and temperatures below 5 °C are not uncommon. The average annual rainfall is . Fog is common in the winters, while hot dry winds, called loo, blow in the summers. Through a combination of water pollution, new constructions of upstream dams, and increase in the local temperature, the water level of the Ganges has recently gone down significantly, and small islands have become visible in the middle of the river.

Its aims focus on developing a vision for the future for coral reef eco-systems and the communities that depend on them within the French overseas territories and Pacific Island developing countries. Programme coordination is provided by the CRISP Coordination Unit and a programme manager who is supported by scientific counselors. The programme is hosted by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community who is located in Nouméa, New-Caledonia. CRISP is under the institutional protection from the Pacific Community and the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme. It is a regional initiative that promotes the protection and sustainable management of the coral reefs of the Pacific island states. History During the French-Oceania Summit of 2003, French President Jacques Chirac promoted the idea of bringing together Oceania participants to work towards sustainable development of the Pacific Ocean coral reefs. Its launch was announced in September 2004 during the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) meeting held in Papeete, French Polynesia. At the initial launch, the project was valued at €10 million over the course of three years, involving fifteen Pacific Island countries and three French Pacific Territories, (New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and Wallis and Futuna) envisioned as a \\"driving belt\\" between these locales. The programme's implementation was facilitated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Its establishment also included a political desire for local oversight in the Pacific region. Programmes Some of CRISP's components include integrated coastal and watershed management, and development of coral ecosystems. The ReefBase Pacific project is a collaborative programme with Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). International Coral Reef Action Network (IRCAN) projects have also been incorporated into CRISP. An additional component is educational, such as the Workshop on Economic Evaluation of MPAs that was sponsored by CRISP in 2008. In partnership with SPREP, CRISP also supports activities of various societies such as the Aiga Folau o Samoa (Samoa Voyaging Society), which is promoting the spread of regional awareness in protecting the environment. CRISP provides support to organizations in developing case studies, of which Navakavu Locally Managed Marine Area, Viti Levu, Fiji (2009) is one example. For the Navakavu Locally Managed Marine Area study, CRISP provided biological monitoring test and comparison, as well as fish larvae research. Pacific COREMO (Coral Reef Monitoring) database training of 2009 through the Institute of Marine Resources at the University of the South Pacific included representatives from CRISP, one of its partner organizations. Supporting Kanak traditions, CRISP's partnership with Conservation International provided recommendations and underwater species guides to the Kanak people.

Crime by type  = Murder = In 2012, Serbia had a murder rate of 1.2 per 100,000 population. There were a total of 111 murders in Serbia in 2012.Global Study on Homicide. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2013. = Organised crime = Serbian Organised Crime ( / Srpska Mafija, Serbian Mafia) are various criminal organisations based in Serbia or composed of ethnic Serbs. Serbian criminals are active in the European Union (EU) countries. The organisations are primarily involved in smuggling, arms trafficking, drug trafficking, protection racket, illegal gambling, jewelry and gems theft, bodyguarding, and contract killing. The Mafia is composed of several major organised groups, which in turn have wider networks throughout primarily Europe. The Yugoslav Wars prompted criminals a \\"way out\\" of economic disaster during the international imposed sanctions against Serbia. Serbian criminals have been recruited to state security forces, a notable example is Legija, a commander in the Arkan's Tigers which after the war was re-labeled as the JSO (Red Berets), he planned the murder of Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić.Organized Crime in the Western Balkans = Corruption = Corruption levels are perceived to be high by surveyed residents of Serbia, and public trust in key institutions remains low. Public procurement, public administration recruitment processes, mining and rail operations are sectors with a serious problem of conflict of interest. The European Commission has raised concern over Serbia's judiciary, police, health and education sectors that are particularly vulnerable to corruption. Transparency Serbia estimated in September 2016 that at least 374,000 cases of \\"petty corruption\\" in public services remain undiscovered every year. = Piracy = Piracy in Serbia is increasing in intensity in 2000s and 2010s. Especially threatened is the shipping on the part of Danube between Belgrade and Smederevo. Most commonly, pirates will plunder bulk cargo such as oil, coke, metals, grains, sugar or fertilizers, but sometimes also remove cables and electric motors from the ships. The confrontations of the pirates with the crews rarely escalate, with a single shipman murder recorded, in late-2000s. This is, in part, because crews will often cooperate with the pirates, sell part of the cargo, then report the piracy in order to receive insurance money. Cases of cooperation of the pirates with the police have also been recorded. The pirates will also often engage in smuggling fuel and other goods across Danube. = False bomb threats = False bomb threats are relatively common in Serbia. Since the police reacts to every bomb threat by searching the entire buildings for the possible bomb, most common targets are schools where students will phone in a threat to delay their exams, and courts where people expecting to lose a trial will phone in to delay it. Due to false bomb threats, the building of the High Court in Belgrade had to be evacuated more than 70 times in 2008 Less common targets include those as diverse as Belgrade firefighters' headquarters, a residential building or Kraljevo public library. Frequency of the false bomb threats was reduced in 2009, after a new law specified harsher, triplified, punishments.

His daring ride of 350 miles in six days to carry dispatches to Fort Laramie for the New York Herald, to tell the news of the great victory by Gen. George Crook against the village of Chief American Horse at the Battle of Slim Buttes during the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877, made him a national celebrity.  Early life  Crawford was born in Carndonagh, North Donegal, Ireland, on March 4, 1847. His parents were both born in Scotland. John Wallace's father, John A. Crawford, was banished from Scotland for making revolutionary speeches and fled to Ireland. Like many Scots-Irish of that time, the Crawfords moved and settled for a time in Ulster, in northern Ireland. At age fourteen, Crawford emigrated to the United States from Ireland, joining other members of his family who had preceded him to Minersville, Pennsylvania, the heart of the nation's anthracite coal region. In 1861, while his father marched away to war, young Crawford went to work in the mines to help support the family. At age seventeen, he enlisted in the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania Regiment volunteers and saw heavy fighting during the last stages of the Civil War. He was wounded twice, once at Spottsylvania and again at Petersburg, just days before Lee's surrender at Appomattox. While convalescing from the first wound in a Philadelphia hospital, young Crawford learned to read and write under the tutelage of a Sister of Charity. He would later incorporate his wartime experiences into his stage presentations. At war's end, Crawford returned home and found a job in the coal mines at Centralia, Pennsylvania. He moved there with his parents, John A. and Susie Crawford. His father John A. became the town's tailor. The death of his mother two years later permanently influenced his life. On her deathbed, Susie Wallace Crawford exacted a promise from her son that \\"as long as he lived he would never drink liquor.\\" The senior Crawford's addiction to strong drink had caused the family to suffer. In fact, one of Jack Crawford's earliest recollections was kneeling by his mother's side \\"praying God to save a wayward father and husband.\\"' Crawford kept this promise for the rest of his life, becoming one of the few teetotal scouts that ever worked for the U.S. Army. This deathbed scene likewise found its way into Captain Jack's lectures and essays, contributing to Crawford's reputation as a leading temperance advocate. While in Centralia in September 1869, Jack married a local school teacher, Anna Maria Stokes, of Numidia, north of Centralia. Jack was appointed postmaster of Girardville, Pennsylvania and Jack and Anna Marie moved there. He was also an officer in the local miner's union. Together they had five children, including a girl who was named for Jack's friend William 'Buffalo Bill' Cody. Her name was May Cody Crawford.Darlis A.

John Wallace \\"Captain Jack\\" Crawford  Black Hills Rangers  Captain Jack Crawford, \\"The Poet Scout\\" In 1875, Jack headed west on the Black Hills Gold Rush. He would later claim that dime novels were among the influences that propelled him west. Jack spent the first six months of the nation's centennial year canvassing the gold camps as a correspondent for the Omaha Daily Bee. During these months, the residents of the mining settlement of Custer elected him to the town's first city council. In 1876, Custer City miners organized a 125-man militia known as the \\"Black Hills Rangers\\". Jack was appointed as chief of scouts, a troubleshooting unit of about twelve experienced fighting men, to look for Indian signs and escort emigrants through dangerous canyons where Indians often waited in ambush. He probably became \\"Captain Jack\\" when he took command of his company.Custer is generally considered to be the oldest town established by European Americans in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. The site of one of the major encampments of the Black Hills Expedition led by Lt. Col.

Journalist  In 1876, Jack spent the first six months of the nation's centennial year canvassing the gold camps as a correspondent for the Omaha Daily Bee. After George Armstrong Custer's death on the Little Bighorn, Crawford joined Brig. Gen. George Crook's command as a civilian scout with the Fifth Cavalry on July 22, 1876. On July 24, 1876, Jack boarded a train for Cheyenne en route to Ft. Laramie and friends presented him with appropriate gifts: a new Winchester repeating rifle, cartridge belt, holster, hunting knife and sheath and a buckskin suit. \\"The management of the Omaha Daily Bee contributed 'liberally to his outfit' and paid tribute to its intrepid correspondent with these words: Captain Jack is a right good fellow, and we hope to see him distinguish himself alongside of his old friend Buffalo Bill. Jack has done some good in advancing the interests of the Black Hills, and it was on this account that his Omaha friends took occasion to give him a handsome testimonial of their appreciation of his labors.\\"  The Great Sioux War of 1876-1877  During the Great Sioux War of 1876 Crawford was civilian scout with the 5th Cavalry Regiment and war correspondent for the Omaha Bee with General George Crook's Yellowstone and Big Horn Expedition. Captain Jack is credited with carrying dispatches on a highly perilous route of 400 miles alone to Fort Fetterman, and he took part in the Horsemeat March of 1876, one of the most grueling marches in American military history. Crawford played a significant role in the Battle of Slim Buttes (1876) and made a daring ride of more than three hundred miles in six days to carry dispatches of the victory to Fort Laramie for the New York Herald. One of his most famous exploits included delivering a bottle of whiskey to Buffalo Bill Cody, while on campaign. Cody wrote of the incident in An Autobiography of Buffalo Bill: > On learning that I was with Crook, Crawford at once hunted me up, and gave > me a letter from General Sheridan, announcing his appointment as a scout. He > also informed me that he had brought me a present from General Jones, of > Cheyenne. 'What kind of a present' I inquired, seeing no indication of any > package about Jack. 'A bottle of whiskey!' he almost shouted. I clapped my > hand over his mouth. News that whiskey was in the camp was likely to cause a > raid ... I will say in passing that I don't believe there is another scout > in the West that would have brought a full bottle of whiskey 300 miles.  Captain Jack joins Gen. Crook's command  Captain Jack traveled for over two weeks, trying to catch up with General Crook's command. On July 24, 1876, Jack boarded a train for Cheyenne en route to Ft. Laramie. When Crawford reached Cheyenne, he discovered that the Fifth Cavalry had already left for Fort Laramie and was en route north to Fort Fetterman. On July 29, Jack arrived at Fort Fetterman and credited with carrying dispatches on a highly perilous route of four hundred miles. On August 2, Jack left Fort Fetterman and finally reached Crook's command camped on Rosebud Creek in Montana on August 8, 1876.\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 54-55. > After a brief nap, Crawford located his friend Buffalo Bill, handed him some > letters, and distributed other communications to officers and newspaper > correspondents accompanying the expedition. He then turned over to Cody a > present from a Mr. Jones, proprietor of the Jones House in Cheyenne. The > gift was a bottle of sour-mash whiskey, which Jack had carried unharmed on > his perilous journey to the Rosebud. In wiring of this incident in his > autobiography, published in 1879, Cody whimsically remarked: \\"Jack Crawford > is the only man I have ever known that could have brought that bottle of > whiskey through without \\"accident befalling it, for he is one of the very > few teetotal scouts I ever met. Indeed, Crawford made a good impression upon > both officers and enlisted men, who considered his ride from Fetterman a > \\"plucky undertaking.\\"\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 55. \\"Our campfires were lively after Captain Jack joined us,\\" recalled an officer. \\"He sang his songs, told his stories, recited his poems and kept his tireless jaw constantly wagging for our edification.\\" Greene, p.27.  Crook's Horsemeat March  Crook's \\"Horsemeat March\\" marked the beginning of one of the most grueling marches in American military history. Crook's command consisted of about 2,200 men: 1,500 cavalry, 450 infantry, 240 Indian scouts, and a contingent of civilian employees, including 44 white scouts and packers. Crook's civilian scouts included Frank Grouard, Baptiste \\"Big Bat\\" Pourier, Baptiste \\"Little Bat\\" Garnier, Captain Jack Crawford and Charles \\"Buffalo Chips\\" White.Jerome A. Greene, \\"Slim Buttes, 1876: An Episode of the Great Sioux War\\", (hereinafter \\"Greene\\") (1982), p.33.. \\"Although Captain Jack's \\"yarns and rhymes\\" would help to relieve the monotony of camp life, Buffalo Bill grew bored by the inactivity and left the expedition to continue his theatrical career in the East. According to one newspaper account, it was on Cody's recommendation that Col. Wesley Merritt subsequently appointed Crawford to succeed Cody as chief of scouts of the 5th Cavalry Regiment.\\"\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 55-56 News of the defeat of General Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25 and 26, 1876, arrived in the East as the U.S. was observing its centennial.Lynne V. Cheney, \\"1876: The Eagle Screams\\", American Heritage 25:3, Apr. 1974. The American public was in dismay and calls to punish the Sioux and awaited the government's response. War correspondents with national newspapers fought alongside General Crook and reported the campaign by telegraph. Correspondents embedded with Crook were Robert E. Strahorn for the New York Times, Chicago Tribune and the Rocky Mountain News; John F. Finerty for the Chicago Times; Reuben Briggs Davenport for New York Herald and Joe Wasson for the New York Tribune and Alta California (San Francisco).Greene, p.15. Soldiers cutting up abandoned horse on Crook's \\"Horsemeat March\\" On August 26, 1876, with his men rationed for fifteen days, a determined General Crook departed from the Powder River and headed east toward the Little Missouri pursuing the Indians. Crook feared that Indians would scatter to seek game rather than meet the soldiers in combat after the fight with Custer. All other commanders had withdrawn from pursuit, but Crook resolved to teach the Indians a lesson. He meant to show that neither distance, bad weather, the loss of horses not the absence of rations could deter the U.S. Army from following up its wild enemies to the bitter end.Greene, p. 26, 31, 114-115. Strahorn reported that \\"all the infantrymen who could ride and who so wished were mounted on mules from the pack train. No circus ever furnished a better show in its mule-riding department than we enjoyed when those two hundred infantrymen essayed their first mount. Many of them had never been astride a horse and many of the mules had never been ridden. Tom Moore, Chief of Pack Trains, and his battalion of assistance, had the time of their lives trying to mount and hold the men in their saddles for the first hours of the performance. Not a few of the soldiers, after being pitched into the sagebrush and cactus a few times, contended they would sooner walk. However, galled but gallant, nearly two hundred stuck to the mules.\\"Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 148. An accident befell Strahorn during the advance. During a rainstorm Strahorn became entangled in his gear and his horse bucked dragging him face first through prickly pear and cactus. With the help of surgeons, it took weeks to painfully extract the barbs. He remarked, \\"I was in good mood for an Indian fight or any other distracting adventure.\\"\\"Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 149-150. > The days soon arrived when, on forced marches after the enemy, all > discharges of firearms except at the enemy were strictly prohibited under > severe penalty. Being out on the right flank one day, just out of sight of > the troops, I came upon a beautiful covey of grouse. They were so tame I > could almost knock them over with rocks, but while the contact thus > established made me increasingly anxious for grouse for dinner that night, I > could not hit them. So finally, in spite of those orders and with growing > appetite, I shot two of them and quickly secreted the evidence of my > disobedience by rolling them up in the rain coat I carried on my saddle. The > right wing of the command was wildly excited by the shots. The skirmishers > thrown out on that side soon discovered my lonely presence and hustled me to > Colonel Chambers with the news that no Indians were visible. He very sternly > asked. \\"Mr. Strahorn, did you do that firing?\\" Upon my answering, \\"Yes sir,\\" > he still more gruffly asked, \\"At Indians, or what?\\" \\"Not at Indians, > Colonel, but at grouse,\\" I answered. \\"I was so hungry for grouse that I just > couldn't help it, so I'm ready to pay the penalty. What is it?\\" Be it > remembered that I was in the Colonel's mess, and he replied quietly on the > side, \\"Well, it will make a damn sight of difference whether you got a > grouse.\\"Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 141. Crook soon began running short of food and supplies and ordered his men to go on half rations. Many of the men were forced to subsist on horsemeat and was thereafter known as \\"General Crook's Horsemeat March.\\"Greene, at p.xiv. Without grain and adequate forage, horses and mules had weakened and many collapsed in the steady rain and mud. Crook had already given orders to shoot abandoned animals for food, and for several days his saddened, ragtag army would exist on a diet of mule and horsemeat. > The horses commenced to play out. As fast as the poor brutes fell the > quartermaster had them killed and issued as rations, so the soldiers had > nothing but played-out horses to eat from there on into the Hills. It looked > funny to see a soldier ride his horse until it dropped exhausted, and then > get off and shoot it and cut up its carcass up and issue meat to the > soldiers of different companies. Gen. Crook would not take any advantage of > his command. If they starved, he starved with them.Grouard, p. 301-302. But the soldiers were nearing total exhaustion; wet, hungry, disheartened by constant hardships. One officer wrote that he saw: \\"men who were very plucky sit down and cry like children because the could not hold out.\\" Years later, Colonel Andrew S. Burt reminisced with Crawford about the hardships they had shared on this grueling march: hunger, marching in the rain, sleeping on wet, muddy ground, eating horse meat. He vividly recalled Jack squatting on the ground before a campfire, \\"gnawing at a horse's rib flesh from the coals and glad to get the rib.\\"\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 57.  Captain Mills's assault at Slim Buttes  = Chief American Horse's village = On September 7, 1876, General Crook ordered Captain Anson Mills to take 150 troopers, riding upon the command's best horses, to the northernmost mining camps in the Black Hills to obtain food and supplies for his starving troops and hurry back. Accompanying Mills's command were civilian scouts Grouard and Crawford, and newspaper correspondents Strahorn and Davenport.\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 57. Lieutenant John W. Bubb, the expedition commissary, had charge of sixteen packers and sixty-one pack mules.Oliver Knight, \\"Following the Indian Wars: The Story of the Newspaper Correspondents Among Indian Campaigners\\" (hereinafter \\"Knight\\"), (1960), p.269. Mills's command left camp that same evening in \\"a thick mist,\\" guided by Grouard, Crook's chief scout. About 1:00 a.m. the command stopped to rest, then moved on at daylight. On the afternoon of September 8, 1876, Grouard and Crawford and were ranging a mile or more in advance of Mills, and Grouard spied Indian hunters and ponies piled high with game.Jerome A. Greene, \\"Slim Buttes, 1876: An Episode of the Great Sioux War\\", (hereinafter \\"Greene\\") (1982), p.51. Further investigation revealed the presence Oglala Lakota Chief American Horse's village of Oglalas, Minneconjous, Brules and Cheyennes, numbering thirty-seven lodges and about 260 people, of whom 40 to 100 were warriors.The number of occupants, including warriors, is a matter of conjecture. Greene, p. 49, 159. The village lay compactly in a broad depression of ravines encircled by the spires of Slim Buttes, limestone and clay summits capped with pine trees near present-day Reva, South Dakota. Grouard and Crawford also found about 400 ponies grazing near the village. Tipis were clustered about the various ravines and streams that crisscrossed the natural amphitheater and smoke from the tipi fires hanging low beneath the misty clouds obscured the lodges. The village slept soundly in the cold rain.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 202-203. Greene, p.50-51, 60. \\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 58. Lt. Schwatka's charge at Slim Buttes = Battle plan = Col. Anson Mills After learning of the village, Captain Mills sent Grouard on reconnaissance mission. Disguised as an Indian, Grouard, went through the village looking for the best point to attack.Grouard recalled that he reported that they had sufficient force to capture the entire village. \\"Grouard\\", p. 302. However, it was also reported that Grouard informed Mills that the village was too large to assault. Greene, p.54. Captain Mills later reported that knew neither the size of the camp or number of warriors. After consulting his officers and scouts, Mills decided to conduct an assault. Captain Mill's battle plan was the classic \\"dawn attack\\" in U.S. Army and Indian warfare. The goal was to surround the enemy, stampede and capture their stock, and kill many of the warriors as possible.Greene, p.59. On the evening of September 8, 1876, Captain Mills split his men into 4 groups to attack the village. Twenty-five were to remain hidden in a ravine a mile or so back, holding the horses and pack train.Knight, p.273. Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka would lead twenty-five mounted soldiers in a cavalry charge through the clustered lodges and stampede the Indians and their pony herd, all hands yelling and firing with revolvers to add to the confusion. One hundred dismounted cavalrymen split in two groups would surround the village as nearly as possible, shoot the stampeded warriors as they emerged from their tipis and capture the ponies.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 202. Lieutenant Emmet Crawford was ordered to post his fifty-seven troopers in skirmish order north and east of the camp, and Lieutenant Adolphus Von Luettwitz moved his fifty-three troopers east and south of the village. Both groups would open fire on the lodges and close in on foot once Schwatka's cavalry had routed the ponies and cleared the village area. On the night before the assault, Strahorn did not even attempt to sleep. Thorough the night he and others alternatively sat and stood, holding their horses in the cold rain and mist. \\"Never before or since,\\" he wrote in later years, \\"were hours so laggard or anxiety so great for the coming of dawn when we could do something that would heat the blood and cheer the soul to the forgetfulness of that everlasting soaking patter, patter of freezing rain.\\"Knight, p. 273. However, before the full plan could be carried out, troopers startled the Indian pony herd and they stampeded through the village neighing the alarm to Indians, who cut their way out of tipis for an escape to the hills.Greene, p.60. Since all chance for a total surprise was lost, Mills ordered the immediate charge with Schwatka and his twenty-five men.Anson Mills, \\"My Story,\\" (hereinafter \\"Anson Mills\\")(1918), p.429. Schwatka, joined by Grouard, Captain Jack and Strahorn thereupon charged and followed the ponies into the village firing pistols into the lodges.Greene, p.60. John Frederick Finerty, \\"War-path and Bivouac: The Conquest of the Sioux,\\" (1890), p.252. Knight, p. 273. \\"Immediately, the dismounted detachments closed on the south side and commenced firing on the Indians.\\"\\"Anson Mills\\" p.429. \\"The fleeing warriors managed to unleash one or two volleys at the soldiers, and Lieutenent Van Luettwitz's fell almost immediately, a bullet shattering his right kneecap as he stood on the knoll next to Mills. Instantly Captain Jack rushed over, tearing off the neckerchief he wore and fashioning a tourniquet about Van Luettwitz's wounded leg to check the flow of blood.\\"Greene, p. 60. Taken by surprise the Indians fled. Strahorn recalled, > As usual, I could not be denied the thrill of the charge of the by the > gallant twenty-five, and I'm sure that everything worked out as planned, > except that many of the Indians escaped into a thicket in the bottom of a > narrow gulch running along within a few yards of the nearest tepee, while a > few others got away into the hills.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 202. The Indians, finding themselves laced in their lodges, the leather drawn tight as a drum in the heavy rain, quickly cut themselves out with their knives and returned fire.\\"Anson Mills\\", p.429. Greene, p.63. Many were seen to fall, and even in the approaching daylight it was often tell whether the burdens carried were children or the slain and wounded.Greene, p.63. The squaws carried the dead, wounded and children up the opposite bluffs, leaving everything but their limited nightclothes in our possession.Anson Mills\\", p.429. Most of the Indians fled splashing through the swollen creek and scrabbling into the heavy underbrush south of the stream bed and up the adjacent bluffs, taking advantage of Mill's failure to secure an effective cordon southwest of the tipis. = Entering the village = 7th Cavalry Regiment guidon found at Slim Buttes fastened to the lodge of Chief American Horse. After the Indians withdrew, Strahorn, Captain Jack and about fourteen volunteers, mostly packers, entered the deserted village to survey its contents. A mule pack was taken along to secure dried meat found hanging from poles. Immediately, the mule was killed by a shot and the men fired upon from Indians concealed in the bluffs. Drawing cross fire, the men quickly jumped into the bed of a dry ravine.\\"Buckskin Poet\\" p. 59. Greene, p.65. Meanwhile, Captain Mills waited for a time, slowly entered the camp, and troopers were sent in groups through the village to check tipis and collect stores.\\"For some time\\" wrote Mills, \\"we did not crowd the village.\\" Greene, p.63. > The picture we quickly presented in our movements around the battle field > with the skirmishing still in progress, rifles in one hand and ravenously > chewing at a great hunk of dried meat in the other, provoked much fun, and, > with blessed momentary sunshine, a general forgetfulness of past troubles. Chief American Horse's camp was a rich prize. \\"The lodges were full of furs and meat, and it seemed to be a very rich village. Crook seized and destroyed food, seized three or four hundred ponies, arms and ammunition, furs and blankets.\\"\\"We took the horses along and they amounted to three or four hundred head.\\" Grouard, p. 311. In a dispatch written for the Omaha Daily Bee, Crawford described the cornucopia he encountered: \\"Tepees full of dried meats, skins, bead work, and all that an Indian's head could wish for.\\"\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 60. The troopers also captured about 300 fine ponies to partly replace their dead horses.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 203-204. Of significance, troopers recovered items from the Battle of Little Bighorn, including a 7th Cavalry Regiment guidon from Company I, fastened to the lodge of Chief American Horse and the bloody gauntlets of slain Captain Myles Keogh.\\"During the charge made on the village Private W. J. McClinton, of Troop C., Third cavalry, discovered one of the guidons belonging to the ill-fated Custer command. It was fastened to the lodge of American Horse.\\" Grouard, p. 306. \\"One of the largest of the lodges, called by Grouard the \\"Brave Night Hearts,\\" supposedly occupied by the guard, contained thirty saddles and equipment. One man found eleven thousand dollars in one of the tipis. Others found three 7th Cavalry horses; letters written to and by 7th Cavalry personnel; officers' clothing; a large amount of cash; jewelry; government- issued guns and ammunition.Grouard, p. 307. Greene, p.73. = Messengers to Crook = Promptly upon taking the village, Captain Mills sent two bareback riders to tell General Crook that he had a village and was trying to hold and needed assistance.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 202-203. \\"Captain Mills had given the order to retreat, and Crawford had told him that it was impossible to retreat.\\" \\"Knowing the Indians would have reinforcements before a great while, I tried to send Captain Jack back with dispatches, but he didn't want to go, and one of the packers volunteered and went back.\\" Grouard, p. 305. When Crook received word from Mills's three messengers he could scarcely contain his anger at Mills.\\"As we were about to break camp, on the morning of September 9th, a packer named George Herman rode up in hot haste to General Crook, bearing a dispatch from Captain Mills, which announced that his detachment and attacked and captured, that morning, an Indian village of forty-one lodges, a large herd of ponies, and some supplies. The Sioux were still fighting to regain what they had lost, and the captain requested reinforcements. He was then seventeen miles south, at Slim Buttes, on a tributary of Grand river. General Crook at once selected one hundred men, with the horses, from the 3d Cavalry, fifty from Noyes' battalion of the 2d [Cavalry], and the 5th Cavalry, and, accompanied by his staff and the commanding officers of the different regiments, rode forward to the assistance of his subordinate.\\" Finerty, p. 249 Crook was primarily interested in feeding his men and ordered Mills to avoid a fight should he encounter a large village, and instead, \\"cut around it\\" and go into the Black Hills to get supplies.Greene, p.48-49. Mills subsequently disputed Crook's orders and said he was to strike any village he might encounter. \\"Anson Mills\\", p.428. Crook also told Mills that he expected to bivouac his exhasted men and therefore Mills could not expect any immediate support. Crook's Officers debated the propriety of Mills's attack on a hostile village of uncertain size, a controversy intensified by Custer's defeat under like circumstances. The question was especially provocative since Mills had opened the engagement with a small supply of ammunition.Greene, p. 69-70. Strahorn reported, \\"Crook was very much disappointed because Mills didn't report his discovery last night, and there was plenty of time to have got the entire command there and so effectively surrounded the village that nothing would have escaped. But the General is also pleased, all things considered.\\"Greene, p.69. Staff officers in telling the receipt of this news said Crook pushed the cavalry on with all possible haste, the infantry to follow more leisurely. But the tidings reaching Crook so electrified the immortal infantry that they forgot all about hunger, cold, wet and fatigue.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 203. Fortunately for Mills, Crook's column was not far behind.Unknown to Mills and his subordinates, the general had decided against remaining in the camp because an abundance of Indian signs and anxieties about Mills's command. Instead of bivouacing his exhasted men, he drove them onward with \\"viscous mud sticking to the feet and making advance almost impossible.\\" Greene, p.67. Crook assembled a relief contingent of about 250 men and 17 officers, plus surgeons Bennett A. Clements and Valentine T. Mcgillycuddy.Greene, p.68-69. John Frederick Finerty, war correspondent for the Chicago Times, joined the advance column. Despite the hardships of the Horsemeat March, the troopers were excited by the prospects of a battle. = Chief American Horse's defiance = At the onset of the stampede and cavalry charge, Chief American Horse with his family of three warriors and about twenty-five women and children retreated into one of the ravines that crisscrossed the village amongst the tipis. The winding dry gully was nearly 20 feet deep and ran some 200 yards back into a hillside. Trees and brush obstructed the view of the interior. \\"We found that some of the Indians had got into a cave at one side of the village. One of the men started to go past that spot on the hill, and as he passed the place he and his horse were both shot. This cave or dugout was down in the bed of a dry creek. The Indian children had been playing there, and dug quite a hole in the bank, so that it made more of a cave than anything else, large enough to hold a number of people.\\"Grouard, p. 307. Troopers were alerted about the ravine when Private John Wenzel, Company A, Third Cavalry, became the first army fatality at Slim Buttes when he ill-advisedly approached the ravine from the front and a Sioux bullet slammed into his forehead. Winzel's horse was also shot and killed. An attempt was made to dislodge the Indians and several troopers were wounded.Greene, p.66. \\"Anson Mills\\", p.430. > Grouard and Big Bat Pourier crept close enough to the banks of the ravine to > parley with the concealed Indians in endeavors to get them to surrender. But > the savages were so confident of succor from Crazy Horse and his much larger > force, who were encamped only a dozen miles to thee west, and to whom they > had sent runners early in the morning, that they were defiant to the last. These Indians felt no urgent need to surrender, for they defiantly yelled over to the soldiers more Sioux camps were at hand and their warriors would soon come to free them. Chief American Horse, anticipating relief from other villages, constructed a dirt breastworks in front of the cave and geared for a stout defense.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 204. = Indians regroup = Mills and Grouard soon realized a mistake had been made; Indians were firing back and the command was surrounded. After the firefight with Chief American Horse at the ravine, Mills sent yet another messenger, the third, to Crook. Mills decided against further efforts to expel the Indians and his men dug entrenchments facing the ravine.\\"Knowing the Indians would have reinforcements before a great while, I tried to send Captain Jack back with dispatches, but he didn't want to go, and one of the packers volunteered and went back.\\" Grouard, p. 305. Greene, p.65. As soon as the warriors had their squaws and children in security, they returned to the contest and soon encompassed Mills's with a skirmish-line, whose command was engaged with the wounded and the held ponies. The Indians made several abortive rushes to recapture their ponies, and Strahorn reported that a number of the most gallant dashes were made at them by Lieut. Crawford at the head of ten or twelve cavalry. Observing warriors riding back and forth through the gaps in the buttes, Mills grew worried that there was another village nearby and that Crook may not arrive in time. Captain Mills gave the order to retreat, but Captain Jack told him that a retreat was impossible. Not anticipating an Indian fight, Mills had allowed his men only fifty rounds of ammunition each, and he would wait for General Crook's personal attention to Chief American Horse.Greene, p.65-66. \\"American Horse and his family, with some wounded, had taken refuge in a deep gorge in the village, and their dislodgement was also, from its difficulty, left to the coming re-enforcements.\\" \\"Anson Mills\\", p.429-430. Knight, p.274. Grouard, p. 305. John Frederick Finerty, \\"War-path and Bivouac: The Conquest of the Sioux,\\" (1890), p.249.  General Crook arrives  General Crook's relief column endured a forced march of twenty-miles in about four hours and a half hours to reach the village and arrived at Slim Buttes at 11:30 a.m. on September 9. The whole cheering command entered the valley, and the village teemed with activity like an anthill which had just been stirred up.\\"Anson Mills\\", p.430. Finerty, p.70, 253. Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 203. Greene, p.71. Crook immediately established his headquarters and set up a field hospital in one of the Indian lodges.Doctors deliberated amputating Lt. Von Luettwitz's right leg Crook inventoried the camp and the booty. The camp held thirty-seven lodges. A three or four-year-old girl was discovered, but no bodies were found. Over 5,000 pounds of dried meat was found and was a \\"God- send\\" for the starved troopers.\\"Greene, p.72. Troopers separated the stores to be saved from the greater number to be destroyed, and the remaining tipis were pulled down. = The ravine at Slim Buttes = Crook soon turned his efforts to dislodging Chief American Horse and his family in the ravine. The defenders had already killed Private John Wenzel, wounded others and threatened all that approached. The deaths and injuries of their comrades inflamed the soldiers who were already distraught from their ordeal. Trees and brush obstructed the view of the interior of the winding dry gully and the narrowness kept the soldiers from firing accurately. Some of the scouts and packers joined in an informal attempt to roust the Indians but met with unexpected firepower and fell back in surprise.Other casualties were Private Edward Kennedy and Private John M. Stevenson. Finerty, p.254. \\"Crook then deployed troops below the mouth of the ravine, crawling on their bellies, firing at random into the hidden ravine without evident harm to the warriors. Before along a multitude of soldiers had gathered near the cavelike mouth of the ditch, somewhat protected from gunfire by sharp embankment. Officers and men joined sending a fusillade into its black depths, and suddenly they received a veritable volley in response that sent them reeling and stumbling away.\\"Greene, p. 74-74. Then, on Crook's orders, First Lieutenant William Philo Clark led a group of twenty volunteers forth, but the Indians sent forth such overwhelming volleys that the troops scampered for safety.Greene, p. 75. Some of the men crept forward with flaming sticks which they tossed into the ditch without apparent effect. By now hundreds of idlers had gathered in the vicinity of the ravine and they complicated the efforts. \\"It was a wonder to me,\\" recalled Major John G. Bourke, \\"that the shots of the beleaguered did not kill them by the half- dozen.\\"\\"Greene, p. 74. = Charles \\"Buffalo Chips\\" White = Crook's scouts positioned themselves on the opposite side of the ravine just above the cave. The bank of the ravine was probably eight to ten feet high, and the scouts could converse with the Indians below without the danger of getting shot.\\"On the south side of the village I could walk right over the place where the Indians were hiding. It was a very steep bank, probably eight to ten feet high. I could go right up to them without them seeing me or there being any danger of getting shot. Going up to that point and talking to them, I told them if they would come out they would not be mollested, and said everything I could to induce them to come out. Not getting any answer from them, the soldiers surrounded the place and commenced firing into the cave, but the Indians would not fire back. They would not shoot unless they had a chance to kill somebody, either.\\" Grouard, p. 309. After Lieutenant Clark's unsuccessful assault, Scout Charles \\"Buffalo Chips\\" White attempted to get a shot in the cave and was immediately killed by the defenders. Frank Grouard witnessed the incident: > Buffalo Chips was standing opposite me. He was one of those long-haired > scouts, and claimed to be a partner of Buffalo Bill's. He thought it was a > good place to make name for himself, I suppose, for he told Big Bat that he > was going to have one of the Indians' scalps. He had no more than got the > words out of his mouth before he yelled, \\"My God, I am shot.\\" I heard this > cry and looked around, Buffalo Chips was falling over into the hole where > the Indians were hiding. Bat was looking into the cave where the Indians > were, and about five seconds afterwards jumped out with an Indian's scalp in > his hand, telling me that he had scalped one of the redskins alive, which I > found out to be true. He had seen the Indian that killed Buffalo Chips, and > he jumped down onto him as the Indian was reaching to get White's six- > shooter. Bat had jumped right down on top of him and scalped him and got out > of the cave before anybody knew what he was doing.\\"Grouard, p. 309-310. > \\"Determined to get a shot into the ditch and just as he raised himself to > take aim he was shot through the heart just across the ravine not ten paces > from General Crook.\\" Finerty, p.253. \\"Buffalo Chips\\" White was a boyhood friend of Col. Cody and also a scout. He wanted to be like Buffalo Bill and acquired the sobriquet \\"Buffalo Chips\\" when Gen. Phillip Sheridan said he was more like Buffalo Chips than Buffalo Bill. Major Bourke described him as a \\"good-natured liar who played Sancho Panza to Buffalo Bill's Don Quixote.\\"\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 55-56 Gen. Charles King said he was a good man.See Elmo Scott Watson, \\"Stories of Great Scouts,\\" Roundup Record Tribune & Winnett Times, Nov. 11, 1921. = Women and children = \\"Crook, exasperated by the protracted defense of the hidden Sioux, and annoyed at the casualties inflicted among his men, formed a perfect cordon of infantry and dismounted cavalry around the Indian den. The soldiers opened upon it an incessant fire, which made the surrounding hills echo back a terrible music.\\"Finerty, p.254. \\"The circumvalleted Indians distributed their shots liberally among the crowding soldiers, but the shower of close-range bullets from the later terrified the unhappy squaws, and they began singing the awful Indian death chant. The papooses wailed so loudly, and so piteously, that even not firing could not quell their voices. General Crook ordered the men to suspend operations immediately, but dozens of angry soldiers surged forward and had to be beat back by officers.Finerty, p.254. \\"Neither General Crook nor any of his officers or men suspected that any women and children were in the gully until their cries were heard above the volume of fire poured upon the fatal spot.\\"Finerty, p.257 Crook Grouard and Pourier, who spoke Lakota, were ordered by General Crook to offer the women and children quarter. This was accepted by the besieged, and Crook in person went into the mouth of the ravine and handed out one tall, fine looking woman, who had an infant strapped to her back. She trembled all over and refused to liberate the General's hand. Eleven other squaws and six papooses were taken out and crowded around Crook, but the few surviving warriors refused to surrender and savagely re-commenced the fight.\\"Finerty, p.254 = \\"Rain of Hell\\" = Chief American Horse refused to leave, and with three warriors, five women and an infant, remained in the cave. Exasperated by the increasing casualties in his ranks, Crook directed some of his infantry and dismounted cavalry to form across the opening of the gorge. On command, the troopers opened steady and withering fire on the ravine which sent an estimated 3,000 bullets among the warriors.Greene, p. 77. Finerty reported, > Then our troops reopened with a very 'rain of hell' upon the infatuated > braves, who, nevertheless, fought it out with Spartan courage, against such > desperate odds, for nearly two hours. Such matchless bravery electrified > even our enraged soldiers into a spirit of chivalry, and General Crook, > recognizing the fact that the unfortunate savages had fought like fiends, in > defense of wives and children, ordered another suspension of hostilities and > called upon the dusky heroes to surrender.Finerty, p.255 Strahorn recalled the horror. > The yelling of Indians, discharge of guns, cursing of soldiers, crying of > children, barking of dogs, the dead crowded in the bottom of the gory, slimy > ditch, and the shrieks of the wounded, presented the most agonizing scene > that clings in my memory of Sioux warfare.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 204. = Surrender of Chief American Horse = Surrender of Chief American Horse to General Crook at Slim Buttes. Dr. McGillycuddy at Slim Buttes. He worked in futility to save the life of Chief American Horse When matters quieted down, Grouard and Pourier asked American Horse again if they would come out of the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. \\"After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a handsome face and a neck like a bull, showed himself at the mouth of the cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General. He had just been shot in the abdomen, and said in his native language, that he would yield if the lives of the warriors who fought with him were spared.Finerty, p.255. Pourier recalled that he first saw American Horse kneeling with a gun is his hand in a hole on the side of the ravine that he had scooped out with a butcher knife. Chief American Horse had been shot through the bowels and was holding his entrails in his hands as he came out. Two of the squaws were also wounded. Eleven were killed in the hole.Greene, p.168. Grouard, p. 311. Grouard recognized Chief American Horse, \\"but you would not have thought he was shot from his appearance and his looks, except for the paleness of his face. He came marching out of that death trap as straight as an arrow. Holding out one of his blood-stained hands he shook hands with me.\\"Grouard, p. 310-311. When Chief American Horse presented the butt end of his rifle, General Crook, who took the proffered rifle, instructed Grouard to ask his name. The Indian replied in Lakota, \\"American Horse.\\"Greene, p. 77. Some of the soldiers, who lost their comrades in the skirmish shouted, \\"No quarter!', but not a man was base enough to attempt shooting down the disabled chief. Crook hesitated for a minute and then said, 'Two or three Sioux, more or less, can make no difference. I can yet use them to good advantage. \\"Tell the chief,\\" he said turning to Grouard, \\"that neither he nor his young men will be harmed further.\\"Finerty, p.255. > This message having been interpreted to Chief American Horse, he beckoned to > his surviving followers, and two strapping Indians, with their long, but > quick and graceful stride, followed him out of the gully. The chieftain's > intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her > shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never > uttering a complaint, walked slowly to a little camp fire, occupied by his > people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and > children.Finerty, p.255 Chief American Horse was examined by the two surgeons. One of them pulled the chief's hands away, and the intestines dropped out. \\"Tell him he will die before next morning,\\" said the surgeon.Finerty, p.255-256. The surgeons worked futilely to close his stomach wound, and Chief American Horse refused morphine preferring to clench a stick between his teeth to hide any sign of pain or emotions and thus he bravely and stolidly died.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 204. Chief American Horse lingered until 6:00 a.m. and confirmed that the tribes were scattering and were becoming discouraged by war. \\"He appeared satisfied that the lives of his squaws and children were spared.\\"Chicago Times, September 17, 1876. Dr. McGillicuddy, who attended the dying chief, said that he was cheerful to the last and manifested the utmost affection for his wives and children. American Horse's squaws and children were allowed to remain on the battleground after the dusky hero's death, and subsequently fell into the hands of their own people. Even \\"Ute John\\" respected the cold clay of the brave Sioux leader, and his corpse was not subjected to the scalping process.\\"Finerty, p.265 Crook was most gentle in his assurances to all of them that no further harm should come if they went along peacefully, and it only required a day or two of kind treatment to make them feel very much at home.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 204. = Prisoners, bodies and scalpings = One of the two remaining warriors from the ravine was Charging Bear, who later became a U.S. Army Indian Scout.Greene, p.89. There is debate to as the name of the other surviving warrior. Grouard, p. 311. They had 24 cartridges remaining among them, and bodies had been used as shields. Finerty wrote that \\"the skull of one poor squaw was blown, literally, to atoms, revealing the ridge of the palate and presenting a most ghastly and revolting spectacle. Another of the dead females was so riddled with bullets that there appeared to be no unwounded part of her person left.\\"Green, p. 169. Crook ordered the remaining bodies removed from the cave. \\"Several soldiers jumped at once into the ravine and bore out the corpses of the warrior killed by Pourier and three dead squaws.\\"Finerty, p.256 \\"The old Indian Big Bat Pourier had killed was unceremoniously hauled up by what hair remained and a leather belt around the middle. The body had stiffened in death in the posture of an old man holding a gun, which was the way he shot. He was an old man, and his features wore a look of grim determination.\\"Greene, p. 79. According to Pourier the Indian he scalped was Iron Shield. Thomas Powers, The Killing of Crazy Horse, ( 2011), p. 449, n. 18. > Ute John scalped all of the dead, unknown to the General or any of the > officers, and I regret to state a few, a very few, brutalized soldiers > followed his savage example. Each took only a portion of the scalp, but the > exhibition of human depravity was nauseating. The unfortunate should have > been respected, even in the coldness and nothingness of death. In that > affair surely the army were the assailants and the savages acted purely in > self defense.Finerty, p.257. Even \\"Ute John\\" respected the cold clay of the brave Sioux leader Chief American Horse and his corpse was not subjected to the scalping process.\\"Finerty, p.265 Captain Jack told readers of the Omaha Daily Bee that he had taken \\"one top-knot\\" during the Battle of Slim Buttes in which he \\"came near losing\\" his own hair. He later regretted the bloody deed and never spoke of it in public performances.\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p.60-61. In fact, he never portrayed himself as a great Indian killer but rather as a trail-smart scout risking his life in a hostile and dangerous environment.\\"  Captain Jack's ride  Frank Grouard and Captain Jack raced to Ft. Laramie to announce the victory at the Battle of Slim Buttes. The Battle of Slim Buttes, fought on September 9 and 10, 1876, was first U.S. Army victory after Custer's defeat at the Battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25 and 26, 1876, in the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877. The American public was fixed on news of the defeat and embedded war correspondents from national newspapers fought alongside General Crook and reported the events. On September 10, 1876, General Crook Crook ordered Frank Grouard, his trusted Chief Scout, to carry dispatches to Fort Laramie announcing the battle and victory at Slim Buttes. Grouard's strict orders were to see that the official dispatches were telegraphed first, then followed by the dispatches from the war correspondents. The next morning, Grouard left in company with Captain Anson Mills, Lieut. Bubb and about seventy-five mounted troopers riding ahead to the Black Hills mining camps to purchase provisions for Crook's starving command. At Crook's request, Captain Jack joined Mills's party, accompanied by war correspondents Robert E. Strahorn and Reuben Briggs Davenport. Unknown to Grouard, Davenport wanted an exclusive for the New York Herald and offered to pay Captain Jack five-hundred dollars if he could beat Grouard to the telegraph in Fort Laramie. Telegraphing news of the victory of Slim Buttes thus became a race between Frank Grouard and Captain Jack Crawford. It was a dangerous undertaking, for Indians were still harassing the mining communities, and only two days earlier, a Sioux party had come within two hundred yards of the main street in Crook City.\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 61-62 and Joe De Barthe, \\"The Life and Adventures of Frank Grouard: Chief of Scouts, U.S.A.\\", (1894), (hereinafter \\"Grouard\\"), p. 312-315. On the morning of September 12, 1876, a small detail galloped into Crook City, with Captain Jack leading the way and quickly purchased supplies from citizens anxious to cooperate with the army. That evening while Grouard slept, Captain Jack embarked upon a daring ride racing ahead to Deadwood in the pitch dark.\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 61-62. Grouard, p. 315. The next day, when Grouard arrived in Deadwood, he learned that Captain Jack had arrived in Deadwood at 6 a.m., secured a new horse, and then headed for Custer City. Grouard quickly purchased fresh mounts and caught up with Captain Jack near Custer City. \\"The animal he was riding was completely winded. I asked him as soon as I caught up with him if he had not had orders to go with Lieut. Bubb to buy supplies. He made the reply that he was taking some dispatches through for the New York Herald.\\" Grouard told Captain Jack that \\"he was discharged from the time he quit the command.\\"Captain Jack was terminated as a military scout on September 15, 1876. \\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 61-63. Grouard, p. 315-317. They agreed to spend the night in Custer City and resume the race the next day. Grouard had changed horses six times on the road, killing three and \\"using three of them up so they never were any good afterwards.\\" Upon his arrival in Custer City, he was so exhausted that he had to be taken off his horse. After handing the dispatches over to U.S. Army Couriers, Grouard wrote a note to Gen. Crook telling him what he had done and laid in bed for 3 days. On September 16, 1876, Captain Jack reached Fort Laramie at 7:00 p.m., nine hours behind a government courier. Crawford had ridden a distance of 350 miles in six days. Still, Crawford had Davenport's dispatches on the wire five hours ahead of all other correspondents. On September 18, 1876, the New York Herald published Crawford's own story under the headline \\"Captain Jack's Ride as a Bearer of Herald Despatches.\\" While, the adventure cost Captain Jack his job as a military scout, his daring ride to tell the news of the great victory at Slim Buttes made him a national celebrity. Captain Jack proudly described his feat to countless audiences in later years.Grouard, p. 317. \\"Crawford's feat was truly remarkable, for he had been living on a starvation rations before leaving Crook's command on the eleventh and then riding 350 miles or more in the next six days. In what was clearly an understatement, he concluded his report to the Herald by saying he was \\"pretty well exhausted.\\" Some months later, James Gordon Bennett of the Herald paid Crawford the 500 dollars that Davenport had promised and an additional 222 dollars to cover expenses.\\" \\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 63.  The Old Scouts  Buffalo Bill Cody and Robert Edmund Strahorn. \\"Old Scouts\\" Robert E. Strahorn, Captain Jack Crawford and Col. Buffalo Bill Cody shaped the popular vision of the American West through their images and narratives. At The Wigwam, the home of their friend Major Israel McCreight (\\"Cante Tanke\\") in Du Bois, Pennsylvania, they could relax, smoke and talk about the Old West. While the Old Scouts found adventure, glory and fame in the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877, in later years they would not talk of it. All expressed remorse.M.I. McCreight, \\"The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe\\", 'Three Greatest American Scouts', (1943), p.15-18. Captain Jack's race with Frank Grouard and perilous ride to tell the news of the great victory at Slim Buttes made him a national celebrity.Captain Jack was terminated as a military scout on September 15, 1876. \\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 61-63. Strahorn remarked that his service in the Sioux War won him undreamed of laurels.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 4. Cody's fight with the young Cheyenne warrior Yellow Hand and \\"First Scalp for Custer\\" launched his theatrical career with a force never before experienced in the relationship between the press and the fledgling world of show business.Bobby Bridger, \\"Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull: Investing the Wild West\\", (2002), p.295. Strahorn knew that war a war with the Indians would settle for all time the Indian troubles, open the American West and was excited to join the adventure. \\"The excitement over war preparations at Cheyenne was mingled with joy that knew no bounds. The belief was general that, whether this campaign was successful or not, it would be the final opening wedge which would for all time settle the Indian troubles. This would quickly result in the opening up of the Black Hills and Big Horn regions with the adjacent territory, altogether an empire of vast extent and untold resources.\\" Strahorn was sympathetic to the plight of the Indians and reported that the Indians were provoked by the breach of the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 and the white invasion of the Black Hills. > The sudden and wanton destruction of the buffalo, deer, antelope and fur > animals left the once opulent Indian virtually a pauper was unquestionably > the chief cause of the Indian wars on the plains. Their hunting ground, > which the government had sworn by treaty to respect, was overthrown with > white hunters, settlers, trappers, gold-seekers and the riff-raff of the > plains, who killed off the game without regard to its use or the consequence > of such a slaughter to the Indians. Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 50, 116. = Battle of Slim Buttes = The Battle of Slim Buttes and the destruction of Oglala Lakota Chief American Horse's village epitomized the excesses of U.S. Army and Indian warfare of the period.Greene, p. xiv. Indian villages were attacked at dawn, sacked and burned.From a purely military standpoint the shock of the dawn attack and the attendant ruin of their homes, food and material goods forced the Indians to choose between the grim realities of starvation and ultimate surrender. \\"Advantage lay with the concept of the strike at dawn: indeed, one army maxim held that any large body of Indians would scatter before a well-implemented cavalry charge.\\" Greene, p.57, 115. Warriors were killed, captured and dispersed; food, lodges and supplies destroyed; ponies seized or killed; and many women and children killed in the confusion.\\"This tactic, though never formally stated, was in part an extension of the annihilation philosophically fostered by Generals Sherman, Sheridan and Ulysses S. Grant during the Civil War. On the plains the maneuver of surprise and destruction, augmented philosophically by the \\"total-war\\" concept, worked best against elusive tribesmen who seldom stood and fought. The most successful assaults occurred at daybreak, with three or more columns of soldiers striking a sleeping camp simultaneously. Against such disconcerting thrusts defense was futile, and warriors rushed from their lodges only to be cut down in the charge. Tragically, large numbers of women and children often died in the confusion of a dawn strike. Once sacked, the village with its supplies was burned, and the ponies were killed. Tribesmen subjected to the tactic of surprise subjected to the tactic of surprise at dawn experienced psychological shock and abjectly surrendered.\\" Greene, p.57-58. The major military objective was to hit Indian commissaries and starve them into submission. \\"Humanistically speaking, the tactic was immoral, but for an army charged with subjugating the Sioux and other dissident Plains tribes, it was justified for the simple reason that it worked.\\" Greene, p.57-58. While the Old Scouts found adventure, glory and fame in the Sioux War, in later years they would not talk of it. Captain Jack and Strahorn were with General George Crook at the Battle of Slim Buttes and expressed remorse. Crawford declined to give any details of his observations at Slim Buttes. He said it was something he neither wanted to discuss or hear of; he said it hurt him even to have to think about it.M.I. McCreight, \\"The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe\\", 'Three Greatest American Scouts', (1943), p.15. Captain Jack said he had taken \\"one top-knot\\" at the Battle of Slim Buttes during a fight in which he \\"came near losing\\" his own hair. He later regretted his bloody deed and never spoke of it in his public performances Darlis A. Miller, \\"Captain Jack Crawford: Buckskin Poet, Scout and Showman\\", (1993), p. 60-61. Strahorn was always reticent when attempts were made to get him to relate his experiences while with Crook's army. Like Crawford, he wished that the Slim Buttes affair could be stricken from the historical records; it was too painful for him to talk of it at all.M.I. McCreight, \\"The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe\\", 'Three Greatest American Scouts', (1943), p.16. Strahorn later recalled Chief American Horse and the ravine at Slim Buttes. > The yelling of Indians, discharge of guns, cursing of soldiers, crying of > children, barking of dogs, the dead crowded in the bottom of the gory, slimy > ditch, and the shrieks of the wounded, presented the most agonizing scene > that clings in my memory of Sioux warfare.Strahorn, Autobiography, p. 204. Buffalo Bill would not discuss the killing of Chief American Horse at Slim Buttes. He just shook his head and said it was too bad to talk about.M.I. McCreight, \\"Buffalo Bill As I Knew Him\\", True West Magazine, July–August (1957). M.I. McCreight, \\"The Wigwam: Puffs from the Peace Pipe\\", 'Three Greatest American Scouts', (1943), p.17. While Cody did not participate in the Battle of Slim Buttes, he took a scalp at the Battle of Warbonnet Creek on July 17, 1876, in a skirmish characterized as duel between Buffalo Bill and a young Cheyenne warrior Yellow Hair.Around August 15, 1876, Cody grew bored by the progress of the campaign, resigned from the expedition and continued his theatrical career in the East. \\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 55-56. Greene, p.30. The engagement, often referred to as the \\"First Scalp for Custer\\", was dramatized with Captain Jack in their consolidated theater act. Buffalo Bill displayed the fallen warrior's scalp, feather war bonnet, knife, saddle and other personal effects. However, scalping Indians become loathsome to Buffalo Bill.On a visit to The Wigwam in 1908, Buffalo Bill told McCreight that did not kill Yellow Hair and said earnestly that he had never knowingly killed any Indian. M.I. McCreight, \\"Buffalo Bill As I Knew Him\\", True West Magazine, July–August (1957). Paul L. Hedren, \\"The Contradictory Legacies of Buffalo Bill Cody's First Scalp for Custer\\", Montana: The Magazine of Western History, Vol. 55, No. 1 (Spring 2005), p. 16-35.  Col. Buffalo Bill Cody  Captain Jack and Buffalo Bill met during the Great Sioux War. In 1876, Crawford left the Black Hills to join Cody on the stage. On January 8, 1877 the Buffalo Bill Combination thrilled a large audience at Boston's Beethoven Hall. The occasion was its performance of the sensational melodrama, 'The Red Right Hand' or 'Buffalo Bill's First Scalp for Custer', loosely based on William F. Cody's exploits as a military scout. The Boston press commented favorably on Captain Jack Crawford's appearance in a leading role, as did newspapers in other towns where the combination performed. Nearly all the stories also described Crawford's \\"perilous journey\\" following the Slim Buttes engagement, and nearly all misrepresented the facts by exaggerating the distance of his ride or the amount of money he had received from the New York Herald. In the summer of 1877, the stage partnership ended on a sour note in Virginia City, Nevada. In a horseback combat scene staged with Buffalo Bill, Captain Jack initially reported he accidentally shot himself in the groin during a performance, but later blamed Cody's drunken condition for the incident. He was confined to bed for more than two weeks.\\"Buckskin Poet\\" p. 67, 74. \\"A Western Military Scout on the Chautauqua Circuit\\", p. 236-237. While newspapers reported the next day that Crawford had accidentally shot himself, privately Captain Jack blamed the accident on Cody. He later stated that Cody had been so drunk on the night of the performance that the actor scheduled to play Yellow Hand had refused to appear on stage. Cody had twice slashed Jack during the knife scene. Cody and Crawford were much alike, and their talents were compared by audiences and themselves. They were sincere friends, but had a rocky relationship. Both were noted for their good fellowship, sunny dispositions, generosity, optimism, and willingness to undergo hardships to achieve their goals. Each had gone to work at a young age to help support his family, thereby neglecting a formal education. Like Crawford, Cody frequently left his wife and children for extended periods. In fact, when Cody's five-year-old son Kit Carson Cody was fatally stricken with scarlet fever in April 1876, Cody was on tour in the East. The death of \\"Kitty\\" gives the first documented evidence of the Cody- Crawford friendship, for Cody notified Crawford (then in the Black Hills) of the little boy's death, and Crawford responded with a poem, which began, \\"My friend, I feel your sorrow, just as though it were my own.\\"'William Frederick Cody, \\"An Autobiography of Buffalo Bill\\", (1920), p. 156-157. \\"A Western Military Scout on the Chautauqua Circuit\\", p. 236.  Apache War in New Mexico  In 1879, Jack relocated his family from Pennsylvania to the New Mexico territory and began scouting for the army again, this time in their war against the Apache nation. He also became a post-trader at Fort Craig New Mexico and engaged in ranching and mining. Crawford served as a U.S. Army scout in New Mexico during Victorio's War of 1880, when he and two companions rode deep into Mexico to locate the camp of the dynamic Warm Springs Apache leader Victorio, then waging war against inhabitants of Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua, Mexico. Following Victorio's War, Crawford became post trader at Fort Craig, New Mexico, where he established a home for his family and engaged in ranching and mining in nearby hills. Even after the post closed in 1885, the Crawfords remained on the abandoned military reservation, serving as custodians.\\"A Western Military Scout on the Chautauqua Circuit\\", p. 232-233.  Native Americans  Captain Jack, like most army officers, looked upon reservations as temporary reserves where Indians would begin to learn about the American way of life. He believed that Indians were capable of great change and that private land ownership would lead to their ultimate assimilation into American society. Captain Jack also believed Native Americans would observe modern life and different cultures, acquire new skills and customs, and change at their own pace and terms. Crawford was angry with the Indians about Custer and the Little Big Horn, and his early performances and poems portray the Indian as a dangerous but worthy opponent. His later performances and poems are more sympathetic, and focus on shared universal emotions with whites. Crawford held progressive views of Indians, including the sanctioning of interracial marriages, which he depicted in poetry and short stories. Captain Jack promoted Indian education and opposed off- reservation boarding schools. He believed that education should be provided close to home \\"under the eyes of the parents, who must thereby learn to respect education. \\"He had witnessed \\"a child torn from his screaming mother's arms and hurried away\\" and asked a reporter, \\"Don't you suppose that mother has the same feeling in her breast for her young as your mother had for you?\\" In 1889, Crawford served as special agent for the U.S. Justice Department of Justice, spending the next four years investigating illegal liquor traffic and fighting alcoholism on Indian reservations in the western states and territories.\\"A Western Military Scout on the Chautauqua Circuit\\", p. 234, 242-243.  Poet and entertainer  Captain Jack, Poet Scout (1904-1905), bronze bust & pedestal by August Zeller. From 1893 to 1898, Crawford built a national reputation as an entertainer known as the \\"Poet Scout.\\" Captain Jack was a popular speaker and performer in music halls and stages all over the U.S. lecturing on the West, the Sioux Wars and encouraging his audiences to forswear liquor. Sometimes he spoke before audiences that numbered a thousand or more. On occasion, he gave three performances in a single day before boarding a train for the next day's engagement. Captain Jack was one of many professional speakers to benefit from the long-entrenched American habit of listening to lectures for amusement and enrichment. Americans in the 1890s continued their quest for self-education, and thousands flocked to Chautauqua grounds in the summer and filled local lecture halls throughout the year. Jack crisscrossed the nation speaking to Chautauquas, veteran's organizations, schoolchildren, college students, reformatory inmates, private clubs, railroad employees, schoolteachers, YMCA boys, and middle-class Americans in general. Captain Jack's manner of dress, charm and gift of poetry made him a popular American celebrity. He stepped on stage dressed in buckskin wearing a wide- brimmed sombrero covering his shoulder-length curly hair. With a Winchester rifle in hand and a six-shooter at his waist, Captain Jack was of the mythical hero of the American Wild West. Captain Jack's performances were a \\"frontier monologue and medley\\" that, as one New York City journalist reported, \\"held his audience spell-bound for two hours by a simple narration of his life.\\" His performances reinforced commonly held views that the West was a land of adventure, opportunity, freedom, and individualism, where civilization ultimately triumphed over savagery. Crawford blamed dime novels for leading many young men into a life of crime, poverty, and dissipation. He blamed their influence for some of the tragedies he had witnessed during the Black Hills gold rush; youngsters lured west by adventure stories only to die from exposure or in brushes with the Sioux.Crawford's first attempt as a public lecturer came in 1886 when he gave a two-hour entertainment as a benefit for a friend's church in Brooklyn. Crawford relied on lyceum bureaus for his speaking dates, but he soon broke with them and secured his own dates with the help of a paid secretary. \\"A Western Military Scout on the Chautauqua Circuit\\", p. 230-245.  Adventurer  \\"Crawford's experiences in the Black Hills, covering no more than eighteen months, dramatically affected his later career and taught him some valuable lessons. He learned the fundamentals of gold mining, for example, and discovered that investment funds were essential for development. For the rest of his life, he retained a consuming interest in mining, working hard to interest capitalists in his mining schemes.\\" In spring of 1878, journeyed to the gold fields of the Cariboo Region in British Columbia.\\"Buckskin Poet\\", p. 64, 78.  Books and poems  Crawford was a prolific writer and published seven books of poetry, wrote more than one hundred short stories and copyrighted four plays. Captain Jack's written accounts of life on the frontier are noted for their true representation of the real dangers of harsh pioneer life. Many of Captain Jack's books and poems are still performed and recorded as songs, such as \\"The Death of Custer\\", \\"Rattlin' Joe's Prayer\\" (which became the basis, reset as narrated by a soldier, of the song \\"Deck of Cards\\") where a miner preaches a sermon from playing cards, and \\"California Joe and the Girl Trapper\\". His poem \\"Only a Miner Killed\\" has been cited as the basis for Bob Dylan's song \\"Only a Hobo\\".\\"A Western Military Scout on the Chautauqua Circuit\\", p. 235.  U.S. Department of Justice  In 1889, Crawford accepted an appointment as special agent for the U.S. Justice Department of Justice, spending the next four years investigating illegal liquor traffic and fighting alcoholism on Indian reservations in the western states and territories.\\"A Western Military Scout on the Chautauqua Circuit\\", p. 234.  Final years  From 1898 to 1900, Captain Jack spent the next two years in the Klondike, fruitlessly searching for gold. Upon his return to the United States, he rejoined the lecture circuit, and for the next decade he traveled throughout the country staging entertainments. When Crawford died in 1917, newspapers across the nation reported on the event, one writer paying tribute in these words: \\"[Crawford] was a real scout, and a real poet —a man with a warrior's soul and the heart of a woman.\\"\\"A Western Military Scout on the Chautauqua Circuit\\", p. 246. In later life Jack separated from his family and moved back east, settling in Woodhaven, Long Island, New York. He died of Bright's disease on February 27, 1917.

Gomarteli was born in the village of Gorisa in the western Georgian province of Imereti, then part of the Kutais Governorate of the Russian Empire. After graduating from the Medical Faculty of Moscow University in 1899, Gomarteli practiced medicine in his homeland. Around the same time he joined the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and later adhered to its Menshevik wing. He regularly published medical articles, political commentary and literary criticism in the Georgian press and authored prose fiction. In 1906, he was elected to the 1st State Duma of the Russian Empire, representing the Kutais Governorate. When the Duma was dissolved, Gomarteli was imprisoned for three months for signing the Vyborg Manifesto. In 1907, he moved to work in Tiflis. By 1913, he had distanced himself from the Mensheviks, criticizing their subservience to the Russian Social Democratic Party on the national question and, like the fellow Menshevik journalist Vladimir Darchiashvili, supported the idea of territorial autonomy for Georgia.Jones, Stephen F.

He told his story to literary agent Rosemary Cresswell, who was doing some work for the Department of Corrective Services, who in turn told the story to producer Errol Sullivan. Several directors were approached to make the movie but turned it down, including Bruce Beresford, Michael Thornhill, Phillip Noyce and Esben Storm. Eventually British director Claude Whatham was imported, which was highly controversial because the movie was made with funds from the Australian tax payer. Release The film was not a large success at the box office.

Bred and owned by Phipps Stable in Kentucky, he is a son of the leading stallion Pulpit, who in turn was sired by Hall of Famer and prominent sire A.P. Indy. He was out of the mare On Parade by perennial leading stallion Storm Cat. Trained by Shug McGaughey, Parading is best known as the turf racing specialist who won the grade-two Dixie Stakes at Pimlico Race Course on May 16, 2009.  Five-year-old season  After winning two of his first three starts in 2008. Shug McGauhey decided to try stakes company and ran Parading in the Volponi Stakes. In that race, Parading won handily on a yielding turf course at Belmont Park over Strike a Deal and Tam Lin in 1:49.39 for a mile and an eighth.  Six-year-old season  As a six-year-old Parading blossomed into a very good runner winning two graded stakes wins. In April, 2009 Parading won the grade three $150,000 Ben Ali Stakes at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Kentucky, on Keeneland's synthetic main track. In his next start his connections Phipps Stable and Shug McGaughey decided to send him to the Grade II $200,000 Dixie Stakes at Pimlico Race Course on the Preakness Stakes undercard. In the Dixie, Parading broke from gate number three under jockey Kent Desormeaux as the 2-1 favorite in the field of twelve stakes horses. Around the first turn and through the back stretch German stakes winner Lauro (at 17-1) led through fractions of 24.6 for the first quarter and 48.7 for the half. Parading stalked the pace in fourth just off the outside flank of Blue Grass Stakes winner Monba. Rounding the final turn, Parading made a bold move fanning out four wide and passing the two leaders in an instant. Coming down the lane Parading drew off to a two length lead but then had to fight off a challenge by Just As Well and won. He won in a final time of 1:48.28 for the mile and one eighth race on the firm turf course.

Founded in January 2010 by singer/songwriter and producer Coko Korinne, producers compete in live monthly beat battles to progress to the Grand Finale, where a winner is selected by a judging panel of music celebrities and record label executives. Since 2010, various judges include Bryan Michael Cox, Boi-1da, Nitti Beats, Def Jam, Atlantic Records, Nipsey Hussle, Warner Music Group, Johnny Juliano, and many others. The Grand Prize includes a production kit from Big Fish Audio, a trip to Los Angeles for a pitch meeting with the VP of Urban A&R; at Sony/ATV Music Publishing, $1000, and a recording session and music video with rapper MIMS. History The Soundtrack Beat Battle was created and launched in January 2010 by singer, songwriter, and producer Coko Korinne. Korinne claims the idea was inspired by the story of the \\"Apple Juice Kid\\" she read in Producer's Edge. She's quoted \\"He got his start from entering beat battles and I always wondered what I could do to shine the spotlight on people behind the scenes. As a producer and songwriter, I know how hard it can be to gain exposure. After reading the article, I did additional research and took steps to create my own beat battle.\\" The annual event is one of the first of its size in Tennessee and is already known as one of the most competitive beat battles in the nation. Soundtrack Beat Battle has included international competitors from Canada, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Overview Runner-up Yeyo Beatz, March 26, 2011 =Format= Every other month the Soundtrack Beat Battle selects 14 contestants from across the United States and internationally to compete live in front of an audience and guest judges. During each monthly event, two randomly selected producers are given an allotted amount of time to go on stage and play two beats at 60 seconds each. Whomever wins proceeds to the next round, and whomever loses is asked to remain in the audience in case they are picked as the 'wild card'. The 'wild card' contestant is a producer who gets invited back to the stage for a second chance after they lost in their first round. The 1st-place winner and runner-up from each monthly battle are then invited to the Grand Finale Beat Battle in Nashville, Tennessee. =Venues= The events are held in various venues in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2010 the beat battles were held at Rocketown. The final event was again at Rocketown on July 24. After the success of the 2010 beat battle, the Soundtrack Beat Battle decided to move to the larger, more upscale venue Limelight in January 2011. =Judging= Judges Panel on March 26, 2011: Drew Money (left), Nipsey Hussle (center), Marc Byers (right), creator and founder Coko Korinne (top) The events are judged by an industry panel (usually one established producer, one established artist and one music executive) who offer feedback on creativity, difficulty, and arrangement in the form of score sheets. The score sheets are only to grade the producer's individual beats but they may not be the deciding factor of who won the round. The ultimate decision comes from the consensus of the judge's panel. In case of a tie, the judges ask the producers to play one more beat. The judges also make the final decision on who should be picked as the \\"wild card\\". At the Grand Finale, the judges decide the overall winner. Since 2010, the judge's panel has consisted of: *Bryan-Michael Cox *Boi-1da *Nitti Beatz *Kia Shine *Michael McCary from Boyz II Men *Young Yonny *Nipsey Hussle *Def Jam *Tiffany J *Universal Music Group *Warner Music Group *Atlantic Records *BET *Sony *many others Beyond the judges, the events are attended by rappers, singers, writers, producers, dancers, DJ's, and radio stations from across the United States. =Prizes= 2010 Soundtrack Beat Battle Grand Prize Winner Mike Ewing (w/trophy)In 2010, the Grand Prize winner was awarded a production kit worth $2500 from Big Fish Audio, a trip to Los Angeles for a pitch meeting with the VP of Urban A&R; at Sony/ATV Music Publishing, and a free online music subscription.

Frederick Rickey and Philip M. Tuchinsky, An Application of Geography to Mathematics: History of the Integral of the Secant in Mathematics Magazine, volume 53, number 3, May 1980, pages 162–166. He applied his result to a problem concerning nautical tables. In 1599, Edward Wright evaluated the integral by numerical methods – what today we would call Riemann sums.Edward Wright, Certaine Errors in Navigation, Arising either of the ordinaire erroneous making or vsing of the sea Chart, Compasse, Crosse staffe, and Tables of declination of the Sunne, and fixed Starres detected and corrected, Valentine Simms, London, 1599. He wanted the solution for the purposes of cartography – specifically for constructing an accurate Mercator projection. In the 1640s, Henry Bond, a teacher of navigation, surveying, and other mathematical topics, compared Wright's numerically computed table of values of the integral of the secant with a table of logarithms of the tangent function, and consequently conjectured that : \\\\int_0^\\\\theta \\\\sec\\\\theta\\\\,d\\\\theta = \\\\ln\\\\left\\\\tan\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} + \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right. This conjecture became widely known, and in 1665, Isaac Newton was aware of it.H. W. Turnbull, editor, The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Cambridge University Press, 1959–1960, volume 1, pages 13–16 and volume 2, pages 99–100.D. T. Whiteside, editor, The Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton, Cambridge University Press, 1967, volume 1, pages 466–467 and 473–475. Evaluations = By a standard substitution (Gregory's approach) = A standard method of evaluating the secant integral presented in various references involves multiplying the numerator and denominator by \\\\sec \\\\theta + \\\\tan \\\\theta and then substituting the following to the resulting expression: u = \\\\sec \\\\theta + \\\\tan \\\\theta and du = (\\\\sec \\\\theta \\\\tan \\\\theta + \\\\sec^2 \\\\theta)\\\\,d\\\\theta. This substitution can be obtained from the derivatives of secant and tangent added together, which have secant as a common factor. Starting with :\\\\frac d{d\\\\theta}\\\\sec \\\\theta = \\\\sec\\\\theta \\\\tan\\\\theta \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\frac d{d\\\\theta}\\\\tan \\\\theta = \\\\sec^2 \\\\theta, adding them gives : \\\\frac d{d\\\\theta}(\\\\sec\\\\theta + \\\\tan\\\\theta) = \\\\sec\\\\theta \\\\tan\\\\theta + \\\\sec^2\\\\theta = \\\\sec\\\\theta (\\\\tan\\\\theta + \\\\sec \\\\theta). The derivative of the sum is thus equal to the sum multiplied by \\\\sec \\\\theta. This enables multiplying \\\\sec \\\\theta by \\\\sec \\\\theta + \\\\tan \\\\theta in the numerator and denominator and performing the following substitutions: u = \\\\sec\\\\theta + \\\\tan\\\\theta and du = (\\\\sec\\\\theta \\\\tan\\\\theta + \\\\sec^2\\\\theta)\\\\,d\\\\theta. The integral is evaluated as follows: \\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\sec \\\\theta \\\\,d\\\\theta &= \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\sec\\\\theta (\\\\sec\\\\theta + \\\\tan\\\\theta)}{\\\\sec\\\\theta + \\\\tan\\\\theta} \\\\,d\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int \\\\frac{(\\\\sec^2\\\\theta + \\\\sec\\\\theta \\\\tan\\\\theta)\\\\,d\\\\theta}{\\\\sec\\\\theta + \\\\tan\\\\theta} && u = \\\\sec\\\\theta + \\\\tan\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int \\\\frac{du}{u} && du = (\\\\sec\\\\theta \\\\tan\\\\theta + \\\\sec^2\\\\theta) \\\\,d\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\ln u + C = \\\\ln \\\\sec\\\\theta + \\\\tan\\\\theta + C, \\\\end{align} as claimed. This was the formula discovered by James Gregory. =By partial fractions and a substitution (Barrow's approach)= Although Gregory proved the conjecture in 1668 in his Exercitationes Geometricae, the proof was presented in a form that renders it nearly impossible for modern readers to comprehend; Isaac Barrow, in his Geometrical Lectures of 1670, gave the first \\"intelligible\\" proof, though even that was \\"couched in the geometric idiom of the day.\\" Barrow's proof of the result was the earliest use of partial fractions in integration. Adapted to modern notation, Barrow's proof began as follows: : \\\\int \\\\sec \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta = \\\\int \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{\\\\cos\\\\theta} = \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta}{\\\\cos^2\\\\theta} = \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta}{1 - \\\\sin^2\\\\theta} Substituting u for \\\\sin\\\\theta reduces the integral to : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\frac{du}{1 - u^2} & = \\\\int\\\\frac{du}{(1+u)(1-u)} = \\\\dfrac12\\\\int \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{1+u} + \\\\frac{1}{1-u}\\\\right)\\\\,du \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & = \\\\frac12 \\\\left( \\\\ln\\\\left1 + u\\\\right-\\\\ln \\\\left1-u\\\\right \\\\right) + C = \\\\frac12 \\\\ln\\\\left\\\\frac{1+u}{1-u}\\\\right + C \\\\end{align} Therefore, > \\\\int \\\\sec \\\\theta \\\\,d\\\\theta = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ln \\\\left \\\\frac{1 + \\\\sin \\\\theta}{1 > - \\\\sin \\\\theta} \\\\right + C, as expected. =By the Weierstrass substitution=  Standard  The formulas for the Weierstrass substitution are as follows. Let t = \\\\tan (\\\\theta/2), where \\\\- \\\\pi < \\\\theta < \\\\pi. Then :\\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\theta 2 \\\\right)= \\\\frac t {\\\\sqrt{1+ t^2}} \\\\qquad \\\\text{and} \\\\qquad \\\\cos \\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\theta 2 \\\\right)= \\\\frac 1 {\\\\sqrt{1+ t^2}}. Hence, : \\\\sin \\\\theta = \\\\frac{2t}{1 + t^2}, \\\\qquad \\\\cos \\\\theta = \\\\frac{1 - t^2}{1 + t^2}, \\\\qquad \\\\text{and} \\\\qquad d\\\\theta = \\\\frac{2}{1 + t^2}\\\\,dt, by the double-angle formulas. As for the integral of the secant function, > \\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\sec \\\\theta \\\\,d\\\\theta &= \\\\int \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{\\\\cos \\\\theta} > = \\\\int \\\\frac{1 + t^2}{1 - t^2} \\\\frac{2}{1 + t^2} dt && t = > \\\\tan\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int \\\\frac{2 \\\\, dt}{1 - t^2} = \\\\int \\\\frac{2 > \\\\, dt}{(1 - t) (1 + t)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int 2 \\\\left [ \\\\frac{1}{2(1+t)} + > \\\\frac{1}{2(1-t)}\\\\right] dt && \\\\text{partial fraction decomposition} > \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{t+1} - \\\\frac{1}{t-1} \\\\right) dt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] > &= \\\\lnt+1 - \\\\lnt-1 + C = \\\\ln \\\\left \\\\frac{t+1}{t-1}\\\\right + C\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] > &= \\\\ln \\\\left \\\\frac{t+1}{t-1} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{t+1}{t+1}\\\\right + C = \\\\ln \\\\left > \\\\frac{t^2 + 2t + 1}{t^2 - 1}\\\\right + C\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\ln \\\\left \\\\frac{t^2 + > 1}{t^2 - 1} + \\\\frac{2t}{t^2 -1}\\\\right + C = \\\\ln \\\\left \\\\frac{t^2 + 1}{t^2 - > 1} + \\\\frac{2t}{t^2 -1} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{t^2 + 1}{t^2 + 1}\\\\right + C\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= > \\\\ln \\\\left \\\\frac{t^2 + 1}{t^2 -1} + \\\\frac{2t}{t^2 + 1} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{t^2 + > 1}{t^2 -1}\\\\right + C\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\ln \\\\left \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos \\\\theta} + \\\\sin > \\\\theta \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cos \\\\theta}\\\\right + C = \\\\ln  \\\\sec \\\\theta + \\\\tan > \\\\theta + C, \\\\end{align} as before.  Non-standard  The integral can also be derived by using the a somewhat non-standard version of the Weierstrass substitution, which is simpler in the case of this particular integral, published in 2013,Michael Hardy, \\"Efficiency in Antidifferentiation of the Secant Function\\", American Mathematical Monthly, June–July 2013, page 580. is as follows: : \\\\begin{align} & x = \\\\tan \\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\pi 4 + \\\\frac \\\\theta 2 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & \\\\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = 2\\\\sin \\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\pi 4 + \\\\frac \\\\theta 2 \\\\right) \\\\cos \\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\pi 4 + \\\\frac \\\\theta 2 \\\\right)=\\\\sin \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}+\\\\theta \\\\right)=\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & dx=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sec^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}+\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right)d\\\\theta=\\\\frac{1}{2} (1+x^2) d\\\\theta\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & \\\\frac{2\\\\,dx}{1+x^2} = d\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] \\\\int \\\\sec\\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta & = \\\\int \\\\left(\\\\frac{1+x^2}{2x}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{1+x^2}\\\\right)\\\\,dx = \\\\int \\\\frac{dx} x = \\\\lnx + C = \\\\ln\\\\left \\\\tan\\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\pi 4 + \\\\frac \\\\theta 2 \\\\right) \\\\right + C. \\\\end{align} Gudermannian and lambertian The integral of the secant function defines the Lambertian function, which is the inverse of the Gudermannian function: : \\\\int \\\\sec \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta =\\\\operatorname{lam}(\\\\theta) =\\\\operatorname{gd}^{-1}(\\\\theta).

Almario. Published by the Limbagang Cultura Filipina in Manila, Philippines, the novel narrates how the Filipinos who became the so-called pensionados undermined the traditional values and mores in the Philippines, including the people who acted as supporters and upholders of those conventional customs and norms. Description Mga Anak- Bukid is about the life of an ordinary farming couple, namely Tonyo and Juli. They were supposed to get married, but on the day before the wedding ceremony, Juli was raped by the pensionado (literally \\"pensioner\\", someone receiving a salary or pension) named George, a Filipino representing the government of the United States. Through his job as a journalist, George criticized and attacked the traditional values and mores of the Filipinos in the Philippines. Through his newspaper columns, George dismissed the long-established rituals and practices in the Philippines as laughable, old-fashioned, and as things that should remain only in the past. In the meantime, Tonyo was still willing to marry Juli despite of the circumstances. However, Juli was no longer enthusiastic in accepting Tonyo as her husband because her honor as a woman had been defiled. Honor and virginity is important in traditional Filipino culture. Tonyo avenged himself and Juli by tricking George. Unaware of the trap set by Tony and Juli, George agreed to meet with Juli. When George went to the appointed place, he was slain by Tonyo. Then Tonyo and Juli ran away into the mountains, both in agreement that there was no righteousness and hope for them if they stay in the lowlands. The book is made up of 78 pages.

They accidentally save Adolf Hitler (Albert Welling) who was scheduled for torture by the Teselecta, a time-travelling justice department. When shot by Hitler, Mels unexpectedly regenerates into River Song, the grown version of Amy and Rory's child who had been taken away from them. As River is a criminal herself due to her future execution of the Doctor, the Teselecta pursue her instead, whilst the Doctor faces death from her poisoned lipstick. Moffat intended for \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" to be more lighthearted than the series opener, and he intended to make fun of Hitler. The episode concludes many elements of River Song's arc. The episode was filmed around March and April 2011, although the opening sequence, set in a cornfield, was filmed much later in the final scenes shot for the series as the production crew had to wait for the corn to grow. Much of Berlin was filmed in Swansea, while the Temple of Peace in Cardiff was also used as a location. In the UK, the episode attracted 8.10 million viewers, the second most-watched episode of the series. Critical reception was mostly positive, though some were critical of the Teselecta and various aspects of the setting and characters. Plot =Prequel= On 15 August 2011, the BBC released a short \\"prequel\\" to \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\", written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, Amy calls the Eleventh Doctor and leaves a message for the Doctor on the TARDIS's answer phone, begging him to find her child, Melody. Though Amy knows Melody will grow up to be River Song, she does not want to miss seeing her grow up. As she ends her message, it is revealed that a very upset Doctor was listening but did not pick up the phone, even though Amy had pleaded for him to. =Synopsis= In modern-day Leadworth, Amy and Rory create a crop circle to gain the Doctor's attention via its newspaper coverage. He arrives with his TARDIS, but Amy and Rory's childhood friend Mels coerces them to travel back in time to \\"kill Hitler\\". Inside the TARDIS, Mels fires a gun, damaging the TARDIS and sending it out of control. Back in 1938 Berlin, the Teselecta, a shape-changing, human-looking robot manned by a human crew from the future miniaturised inside it, is seeking to deliver justice on major criminals from the past by torturing them. The TARDIS crashes into Hitler's office as the Teselecta tortures Hitler and knocks over the Teselecta. Hitler shoots at the Teselecta, but hits Mels instead. As Rory locks Hitler in a cupboard, Mels regenerates, becoming the woman the Doctor knows as River Song. River, having been trained by her captors to kill the Doctor, kisses him with a poisonous lipstick which will kill the Doctor within the hour. The Doctor orders Amy and Rory to follow River, while he returns to the TARDIS. The Teselecta, aware that the Doctor's death in 2011 is a \\"fixed point in time\\", follows River, having identified her as a war criminal who is responsible for the Doctor's death. The Teselecta's antibodies, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. The dying Doctor, having become aware of the Teselecta's nature, stops the Teselecta from punishing River at the Hotel Adlon. The captain, Carter, speaks to the Doctor, informing him that River has been trained to kill him by the Silence, a religious order that believes that silence will fall when \\"the oldest question in the universe\\" is asked. Amy forces the crew to abandon the Teselecta. Amy, Rory, and River find the Doctor near death; the Doctor asks River to find \\"River Song\\" and give her a message, then whispers something in her ear before he dies. River, who at this point still only knows herself as Melody Pond, asks Amy who River Song is. Amy uses the Teselecta records to show her who she will become. With this, River sacrifices her remaining regenerations to bring the Doctor back to life, and passes out. The Doctor, Amy, and Rory take her to a hospital in the far future, leaving a diary as a gift by her bedside, and depart. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor has discovered the date of his death from the records aboard the Teselecta. =Continuity= This episode reveals the origins to several facets of the River Song character. Before transforming into River, Mels states that she was the young girl seen regenerating at the end of \\"Day of the Moon\\", becoming \\"a toddler\\" who presumably grew up to become Mels. River's worn TARDIS-coloured diary, which the Doctor and his companions have seen in her relative future, is given to her brand-new by the Doctor. The Doctor introduces her to the concept of \\"spoilers\\", seen originally in the Tenth Doctor story \\"Silence in the Library\\"/\\"Forest of the Dead\\", and becoming a virtual catchphrase for River. River's aptitude for flying the TARDIS—having been taught how by the machine itself—is demonstrated in \\"The Time of Angels\\"; River explains she \\"had lessons from the very best\\" (which the Doctor assumes refers to himself) and that the Doctor was \\"busy that day\\". The Teselecta crew consider River a wanted, dangerous criminal; River is shown being in prison in her personal future in \\"The Time of Angels\\" for killing \\"the best man I ever knew\\". In this episode's epilogue, River joins the Luna University to become an archaeologist, in order to find the Doctor. Her previous appearances (events which take place later in River's personal timeline) show that she will/has acquired her degrees. When River wakes up in hospital, the Doctor says \\"Rule One: The Doctor lies\\". This rule is 'repeated' by River herself in \\"The Big Bang\\", a future event in her own personal timeline. While activating the voice interface aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor is shown holograms of his former companions Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate). He rejects these, as they all cause him guilt. He eventually settles on the young Amelia (Caitlin Blackwood), who also appears (in flashback scenes of Amy's past) interacting with a younger Mels and Rory. The young Amelia voice interface brings up \\"fish fingers and custard\\", an allusion to the Doctor's meal with the real Amelia in \\"The Eleventh Hour\\". The concept of \\"fixed points in time\\" has been explored before, such as in \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\". The supposed \\"state of temporal grace\\" within the TARDIS was previously asserted by the Fourth Doctor during The Hand of Fear (1976). Production =Writing and casting= Showrunner Steven Moffat wanted to \\"take the mickey out of\\" Hitler in the episode. Serving as the mid-series premiere, it is the opposite of the tone of the opening story \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" / \\"Day of the Moon\\", which was \\"grim and dark\\". Writer Steven Moffat wanted to show Hitler in a comedic light and \\"take the mickey out of him\\" instead of making him \\"an icon of evil\\". He compared it to a scene in an Indiana Jones film which made fun of Hitler. Moffat enjoyed writing Mels' regeneration scene, finding comedy in her checking out her new body. He asserts that the episode is the beginning of River's story and shows how she became the woman the Doctor met in previous episodes. During the moments after her regeneration, River reenacts the iconic scene between Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) from the movie The Graduate, calling out to the Doctor \\"Hello, Benjamin\\". The camera angle is also a tribute to the film. The Doctor previously likened River to Mrs Robinson in \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\". The cast and crew felt that the costume and make-up artists did a good job with Albert Welling, as he looked so much like Hitler it was a \\"surreal\\" experience. Ella Kenion, who plays Harriet in this episode, later appeared in the Fourth Doctor audio drama The Wrath of the Iceni where she played Boudica. Arthur Darvill was pleased that his character, Rory, was more of an \\"action hero\\" in the episode. Before broadcast, actor Matt Smith stated that it was \\"maybe [his] favorite episode to date...it just rockets along\\". Smith's Doctor debuted his secondary jacket, a long dark-green military overcoat, for the first time in this episode. In an interview for the previous series concerning the Eleventh Doctor's costume, executive producer Piers Wenger said, \\"I think he'd really like to evolve it next series. He's really keen to have a coat.\\" Smith explained that he wanted a coat because of the cold weather. =Filming and effects= The read-through for \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" took place on 21 March 2011. The opening scene in the cornfield were the last shots filmed of the series on 11 July 2011. The scene was filmed last because the crew had to wait for the corn to grow; Moffat had written the scene in February. Much of Berlin was filmed in Swansea. Vintage vehicles from the period were used; Darvill loved the motorbike, although he was not allowed to ride it as it was the job of the stuntman. The Temple of Peace in Cardiff used in the episode for the German dinner party was also used for Karen Gillan's first Doctor Who appearance, when she played a Soothsayer in \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\". Smith, Gillan and Darvill had previously filmed in the Temple of Peace for \\"Cold Blood\\" in the previous series. Hitler's office was one of the biggest sets that had been built for the show. Typically it would have been filmed in a real building, but the TARDIS had to crash through the wall and thus the set had to be destroyed with an air cannon. The Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland was the inspiration for the design of the Teselecta corridors. One scene involving the Teselecta (disguised as a German soldier) chasing Amy and Rory on motorcycles through Berlin was cut from filming due to budget issues. AT&T;, who wanted to advertise in the United States broadcast of the episode on BBC America as a tie-in to their \\"Rethink possible\\" slogan, brought the idea of using a motion comic to create a bridging scene within the advertising break where this scene would have been placed. AT&T; and BBC America worked with Moffat and Senior to create the 60 second scene, which was animated by Double Barrel Motion Labs. Broadcast and reception \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" was first broadcast on 27 August 2011 on BBC One in the United Kingdom. Internationally, it was broadcast in America on sister station BBC America on 27 August as well as on Space in Canada. Overnight ratings showed that the episode was watched by 6.2 million viewers on BBC One, the second most viewed show of the day behind The X Factor. The episode also came in at number one on the BBC iPlayer service the day after it aired as well as topping the requests on the service for the month of August with 0.99 million views. The episode also received an Appreciation Index of 85, considered \\"excellent\\". Final viewing figures came in at 8.10 million, the eleventh most watched programme of the week. It was also the second most- watched episode of the sixth series, behind \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\". Some viewers complained to the BBC believing they heard a German guard say the profanity \\"where the fuck is he?\\" However, the BBC stated he said, \\"Halt, was machen Sie?\\", which means \\"Stop, what are you doing?\\" in German. =Critical reception= At least one critic and Arthur Darvill himself were pleased that Rory had become more of an action hero in the episode. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Dan Martin, writing for The Guardian, was more pleased with \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" as an opener than \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\" as a finale, and said it was \\"an energetic, timey-wimey tour de force with gags and flourishes like the car and the crop circles that still maintained a strong sense of what it was about\\". He also commended Alex Kingston's performance, saying that \\"she got to steal her every scene even more completely than usual, masterfully swerving the episode into a properly emotional final act\\". Martin later rated it the sixth best episode of the series, though the finale was not included in the list. He commented that it may be \\"divisive\\" amongst fans as it was criticised for not making sense to casual viewers of the programme, but Martin said he \\"loved it\\". Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode four out of five stars, praising it for being \\"jam-packed full of ideas, twists, turns and wibbly-wobbly time- bending stuff\\" and \\"giddily thrilling entertainment, albeit rather exhausting\\". He also praised the way it allowed Rory to \\"finally find his niche\\". Writing for The Independent, Neela Debnath praised the lighter mood and \\"great slapstick moments\\". Though she thought the identity of Mels was \\"obvious to everyone but the characters\\", she said that Nina Toussaint-White was \\"excellent\\" and that \\"it was shame that she regenerated so early on because she brought a different energy to the character\\". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern, unlike Debnath, admitted that Mels' true identity \\"took [him] completely by surprise\\". He thought that a plot hole was generated in terms of what Melody did in between regenerating in 1969 and joining Amy and Rory, still as a child, 20 years later, but said that \\"the episode moves too fast for such quibbles to stick, and it is hilarious\\". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly called it \\"a marvelously energetic, funny, clever, noble mid-season start\\" and praised the acting of Smith, Gillan, Darvill, and particularly Kingston, as well as the emotion that developed in the episode. IGN's Matt Risley gave the episode a score of 9 out of 10, saying that it was \\"arguably Moffat's most unashamedly fun Time Lord romp yet\\". While he praised the humour, plot and character development, he was critical of the Teselecta; though they \\"score[d] high on the sci-fi kitsch factor\\" they were \\"anything but memorable\\". SFX magazine critic Richard Edwards gave \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" five out of five stars, thinking it \\"has to rank among the cleverest Who episodes Moffat has ever written\\". While he praised Kingston's performance, he wrote that \\"it's Matt Smith who steals the show, in one of his finest performances as the Doctor...he's utterly magnificent, whether acting the joker, or living out 32 minutes (ish) of death scene. The mix of optimism...and sadness is a tricky thing to pull off, yet Smith does it in a quintessentially Doctor way\\". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded the episode as a B+, saying that he was \\"a bit divided\\". He praised Moffat's River Song arc, which made \\"the mind [reel]...in a good way\\", as well as the dialogue and \\"big concepts\\". On the other hand, he did not think the Teselecta's mission was developed and \\"as characters they seem kind of bland\\". What \\"really trouble[d]\\" him was that it did not have the \\"impact\\" of some previous episodes and he thought it unlikely that Amy and Rory were willing to quickly accept that they were meant to raise their daughter as a school friend. Jim Shelley of The Daily Mirror was also negative about the episode, especially towards Alex Kingston, who appeared to be acting while \\"the rest of the cast play their parts perfectly naturally\\". The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller said that Moffat \\"delivered a pacy romp\\" and praised the concept of the Teselecta, but was disappointed with the \\"wasted opportunity\\" of the setting. He thought that the setting offered \\"great dramatic potential\\" but was \\"little more than window dressing for the story\\". He also felt using Hitler as a comic relief \\"struck a wrong note given the nature of the man and the regime he led\\" and that it was \\"an odd way to treat such an historically significant character\\". He was also critical of Moffat's \\"seeming keenness to kill the regular cast in some way, shape or form\\". However, Entertainment Weekly Tucker thought that it \\"didn't need Hitler to be an excellent [Doctor Who] episode\\".

Retrieved June 2011 Life He was born in Wembley, Middlesex and educated at the Latymer Upper School, Hammersmith and Jesus College, Cambridge. He started his career as a Technical Officer with the Meteorological Office involved in weather forecasting for RAF stations during World War II and was then sent to India to be involved in co-ordinating the meteorological service in South-East Asia Air Command (1943). On his return he joined the staff of the Forecast Research Division, Dunstable at its inception in 1949.

His work on the characteristics of fronts is one of the few successful attempts to deal quantitatively with the dynamics (as distinct from the kinematices) of these important phenomena. He has done markedly original work on dynamical similarity in meteorology and his recent numerical calculations of air flow over mountains are believed to be the first realistic computations of their kind. In addition, he has contributed much to the detailed analysis of the salient features of large-scale atmospheric disturbances, including studies of the rainfall of depressions, the behavious of the tropopause, and the cloud systems associated with fronts. His work is characteristic of the younger school of dynamical meteorologists, and is doing much to make meteorology a more exact science than hitherto.\\" He was also a Fellow of the Meteorological Society (FRMetS) and their president from 1963 to 1965.

History  The office of justices’ clerk (or clerk to the justices) is historically linked with the development of the office of justice of the peace in England and Wales from the 12th century. The Justices of the Peace Act of 1361 provided, amongst other things, \\"That in every county of England shall be assigned for the keeping of the peace, one lord and with him three or four of the most worthy of the county, with \\"some learned in the law\\", and they shall have the power to restrain the Offenders, Rioters, and all other Barators, and to pursue, arrest, take and chastise them according to their Trespass or Offence\\".Justices of the Peace Act 1361 Originally known as \\"clerk of the peace\\", \\"clerk of the justices\\" or \\"clerk of the keepers of the peace\\", the clerk who assisted the justices at Quarter Sessions was required to act as a record keeper and, being a lawyer, to provide legal advice to justices of the peace. However, from Tudor times many justices used their personal servants as their legal advisers out of Quarter Sessions and, in the 19th century, many benches were using local solicitors to advise them in their Petty Sessions work. In 1848, as the summary jurisdiction of justices began to expand at Petty Sessions, so the importance of the role of justices' clerk increased and in 1851 an Act of Parliament allowed justices' clerks' fees to be paid out of public funds for the first time. By the 20th century, there was a preponderance of part-time clerks, which was criticised by the report of the Roche Committee in 1944. This report led to the Justices of the Peace Act 1949 and a move towards full-time clerks.Sir Thomas Skyrme, History of the Justices of the Peace, vols 1–3.Report of the Roche Committee Report, Cmnd 6507, HMSO.  The modern justices’ clerk  Although their functions have changed considerably over the intervening years, justices’ clerks and their assistants (also known as legal advisers) remain the linchpin of magistrates' courts. Because magistrates are unpaid members of the local community and do not need to have legal qualifications, they are advised in court on matters of law, practice and procedure by justices' clerks and their assistants. In 2010 there were 49 full-time justices’ clerks in England and Wales. In 2015 they numbered 26. The justices' clerk's role has been adapted to account for modern requirements. The office holder is now a civil servant following the creation of Her Majesty's Courts Service (HMCS now Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service) on 1 April 2005. However, although the justices' clerk is line managed by a senior civil servant for administrative purposes, he/she retains independence when undertaking judicial functions and giving legal advice to magistrates.Guide to the Conduct of Justices' Clerks and Assistant Justices' Clerks, October 2007. = Judicial powers = A justices’ clerk has the powers of a single magistrate, for example to issue a summons, adjourn proceedings, extend bail, issue a warrant for failing to surrender to bail where there is no objection on behalf of the accused, dismiss an information where no evidence is offered, request a pre-sentence report, commit a defendant for trial without consideration of the evidence and give directions in criminal and family proceedings.Justices’ Clerks’ Rules 2005 The justices’ clerk may delegate these functions to a legal adviser (referred to as \\"assistant justices’ clerk\\" in the relevant legislation).The Role of the Justices’ Clerk and the Legal Adviser, Justices’ Clerks’ Society, December 2008. = Advising and supporting magistrates = The justices’ clerk is also responsible for the legal advice tendered to magistrates in and out of the courtroom either personally or by his assistant legal advisers. In the courtroom, whether or not requested, a legal adviser must provide advice necessary for magistrates to properly perform their functions. This includes advice on:- * questions of law * mixed law and fact * practice and procedure * range of penalties * relevant decisions of higher courts and other guidelines * other relevant issues * decision making structures Additionally, in the court room, the justices’ clerk and his assistant legal advisers may ask questions of witnesses and parties to clarify evidence and issues. They must ensure that every case is conducted fairly and assist unrepresented defendants to present their cases (without becoming an advocate). Where appropriate, they are responsible for assisting magistrates with the formulation and recording of reasons.The Responsibilities of Justices’ Clerks to the Magistracy and the Discharge of their Judicial Functions October 2007. = Other functions = Outside the court room, the justices' clerk also supports the work of a bench (or benches) of magistrates by providing administrative support and advice to their various committees and meetings, is responsible for their training and development of magistrates, and assists in their pastoral care. He/she is also responsible for the management and training of legal advisers and with his/her management team, provide guidance and directions to other staff on legal issues and operational matters, such as listing. They work towards achieving improvements in performance and with other criminal justices agencies through Criminal Justice Boards. The Justices’ Clerks’ Society, the membership of which includes all justices’ clerks and many legal advisers, provides professional leadership for lawyers who work in the magistrates’ courts by giving legal advice and guidance, and is represented on a number of national bodies and HMCTS steering and working groups. Its President meets regularly with the Senior Presiding Judge for England and Wales. = Appointment, reassignment or removal = A justices’ clerk is appointed under section 27(1) of the Courts Act 2003 by the Lord Chancellor and designated as such after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice to one or more local justice areas.The Courts Act 2003, sections 27–29 A person can only be designated if he/she has a five-year magistrates' court qualification, was a barrister or solicitor who had served for not less than five years as an assistant to a justices' clerk, or had previously been a justices' clerk. Assistants were required to have certain minimum qualifications (see Justices' Clerks (Qualification of Assistants) Rules 1979 (SI 1979/570), as amended).Justices' Clerks (Qualification of Assistants) Rules 1979 (SI 1979/570) as amended by S.I. 1998/3107, 1999/2814, and 2001/2269. The Assistants to Justices’ Clerks Regulations 2006, in regulation 3, set out the qualifications for assistants to justices’ clerks who could be employed as clerks in court. They provided that people who have qualified as barristers or solicitors and had passed the exams for either of those professions or had been granted an exemption were qualified to be assistants to justices’ clerks which meant that they can carry out matters on behalf of the justices’ clerk. The 2006 Regulations also enabled the Lord Chancellor to make temporary appointments of people to act as clerks in court where he was satisfied that they were, in the circumstances, suitable and that no other arrangement can reasonably be made. However, the Assistants to Justices' Clerks (Amendment) Regulations 2007 amended regulation 3 of the 2006 Regulations. The effect was to clarify that those: # who were in employment as an assistant registered by the Law Society under regulation 23 of the Training Regulations 1990; # who held a valid training certificate granted by a magistrates' courts committee before 1 January 1999; or # who acted as a clerk in court before 1 January 1999 and were qualified to act as such under the Justices’ Clerks (Qualification of Assistants) Rules 1979 (as amended) to carry out the duties of assistant clerks can act; may act as clerks in court. Section 27 (4) of the Act provides that before reassigning a justices’ clerk, the Lord Chancellor must consult the bench chairman of the relevant local justice areas.Protocol for the Appointment, Reassignment or Removal of Justices' Clerks , Department for Constitutional Affairs, February 2005.

A small theatre, seating 225-240 people, it was noted for being without wings and other common aspects of theatrical architecture, having been adapted from a short-lived newsreel cinema intended to entertain waiting bus passengers. It was open from 17 September 1959 until 1995. Establishment The location that became the Eblana Theatre initially intended as a small cinema for newsreel presentations, for the entertainment of waiting bus passengers, and operated in this role for around two years. Then in 1958 the lease was acquired by Phyllis Ryan was run by her and some associates (including Des Nealon) as a conventional theatre, and home to her company Gemini Productions. It opened in 1959 during the Dublin Theatre Festival. The inclusion of the theatre space was part of the concept of Busáras being a multi-use public building. It was the original newsreel cinema purpose that led to the theatre having no wings, which made mounting large plays or complex sets impossible. The modest scale of the theatre, and its proximity to the public toilets of the bus station, were a source of some derision, with claims that it was \\"The only public toilet in Dublin with its own theatre\\" — though in fact only the Ladies toilet was close to the theatre, the Gents being some distance away. Performances were occasionally enlivened by lost passengers seeking the lavatories. Associations Ryan was in the 1960s and 1970s the major producer of new plays in Ireland outside of the Abbey Theatre. Phyllis Ryan and her Gemini Productions kept independent theatre alive in Dublin and premièred most of the work of playwright John B. Keane. The playwrights such as Brian Friel, Joe O'Donnell, Tom Murphy etc., that Gemini nurtured were later adopted by the Abbey and other theatres but owe their first productions to the courage of Phyllis Ryan. Closure In the mid 1990s, the Eblana was run for a short time by Andrew's Lane Theatre when Gemini moved out of the Eblana in the mid-1980s. Following this it was leased by Northside Theatre Company. It closed in 1995. Despite some erroneous claims (including one that it became a left luggage facility) the theatre is still mostly intact, down to posters and programmes from its last performance. In 2012 plans were announced to refurbish the theatre, at a cost estimated to be around one million euro, to house the Fry Model Railway, though this plan did not proceed, and as of 2020, the theatre was still closed and disused.

Frederik Christian \\"Fritz\\" Schübeler (25 September 1815 – 20 June 1892) was a Norwegian botanist. He was born in Fredriksstad as a son of Gregers Frederik Schübeler (1790–1856) and Louise Christine Engstrøm (1786–1846). He was married twice. An adopted daughter of his, Ingeborg Strengberg (1853–1918), married botanical gardener Carl Theodor Schulz. He graduated from the university with the cand.med. degree in 1840. He had physician jobs at Rikshospitalet from 1841 to 1844 and in Odalen and Lillesand between 1845 and 1847. He then studied botany and horticulture in Europe between 1848 and 1851 with a scholarship from the Royal Norwegian Society of Development. He was a curator at the Botanical Museum in Kristiania from 1852. He applied for the position as head gardener in 1857, but was rejected following resistance from professor Mathias Blytt. After the passing of Blytt, Schübeler was appointed as lecturer in botany in 1864, and professor in 1866. At the same time he became leader of the University Botanical Garden, a position he retained until 1892. His most important publications were Die Culturpflanzen Norwegens (1862), Die Pflanzenwelt Norwegens (1873–1875) and Viridarium Norvegicum (three volumes released between 1885 and 1889). Popular publications include Havebog for Almuen (1856). He is now regarded as an incomplete theoretician, with several faulty hypotheses, but with important practical contributions. He has therefore been called \\"the father of horticulture in Norway\\". He was a founding member of the Norwegian Horticulture Society in 1884, and became an honorary member already in 1885. He received an honorary degree at the University of Breslau in 1861 and was awarded the Royal Norwegian Society of Development's gold medal in 1865.

Early life and education From Foxford, County Mayo, O'Donnell is the daughter and second child of Frank O'Donnell from Foxford (relatives founded the Foxford Woolen Mills, in which her father and uncles worked) and Maire Cranny from Newry, a speech and drama teacher, still working in southern County Dublin as of 2018. The family moved to Dublin but O'Donnell and her brother spent summer and Easter holidays in Mayo. O'Donnell studied education and English at the University of Nottingham, then took a Masters in Education at NUI Maynooth, and another, in Modern Drama, at University College, Dublin. Later she studied theatre, including direction, and voice and other acting skills, at Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. Career =Education and the Arts= O'Donnell became head of drama at the teacher training college, Carysfort College. where she taught for ten years, until the college's closure in 1988, when she was appointed as a lecturer in the School of Communications at Dublin City University (DCU). At DCU for 23 years, she taught a range of communications and arts courses, including radio documentary making, storytelling and public speaking, and the university sent her for training at the BBC. Research interests included theatrical and radio voice performance, and ancient and modern chorus speech. She also became involved in building the arts aspect of campus life, including DCU Arts Week, the Writer in Residence Programme, Ford Society Awards and Children's Arts Days. She worked on productions including the Larkin Concert Series, Wilde Space Theatre, Open Air Opera, RIAM graduate concerts, and a performance at DCU by the Royal Shakespeare Company. This work included a key role in the development of The Helix cultural centre, especially including its performance spaces. When the Helix launched, she took a role as Associate Director, and later managed the smaller of its two theatre spaces, The Space. O'Donnell has also lectured extensively in Ireland, Europe and the US in the areas of education, and Irish culture, especially drama and language. In the early 2000s she also spent six months as a touring actor across the UK and Ireland, in The Merry Wives of Windsor and King John with the Northern Broadsides company. O'Donnell served two terms on the board of the National Concert Hall in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2004 she co-founded, with Andy Hinds, the theatrical company Classic Stage Ireland, which produced Shakespeare and ancient Greek drama. =Media= O'Donnell first rose to prominence in the media as a reporter on RTÉ Radio 1's Today with Pat Kenny in the summer of 2010. However, according to a friend who spoke to The Irish Times: \\"\\"It's one of those 'overnight success stories' that was actually years in the making. She trained in radio production and presentation with the BBC and presented programmes for BBC Radio 4.\\" A colleague told the same publication \\"It's extraordinary the amount of people she knows and counts among her friends. Gay Byrne, Charlie McCreevy, many Fine Gael TDs – she's genuinely close to many people. I accompanied her on a trip to America at one stage and she even had a network there.\\" =Political appointment= In May 2011, Taoiseach Enda Kenny nominated O'Donnell to the 24th Seanad. O'Donnell indicated that the appointment was a surprise, and she did not enter as a member of any party. Kenny again nominated her to the 25th Seanad in May 2016. She ousted David Norris from his role as leader of the Seanad's independent Technical Group on 29 June 2016; however she is no longer a member of the group. =Recent years= More recently, in addition to her work with RTÉ and presence in the Seanad, she has appeared as a panellist on TV3's Tonight with Vincent Browne, often featuring in the section of the programme that reviews the following morning's newspapers. She is noted for her persistent and firm defence of Enda Kenny. In March 2018 she sparked criticism after stating teenagers below the age of 18 should “stay away from politics” O'Donnell commenced PhD studies on university teaching at St Patrick's College, Drumcondra, now the DCU Institute of Education, in 2009.

He designed many well-known buildings, including the Utah State Capitol, the Enos Wall Mansion (which now houses the Thomas S. Monson Center), the original Salt Palace, and the original Saltair Resort Pavilion. His design for the Utah State Capitol was chosen over 40 competing designs. A number of his buildings survive and are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places including many in University of Utah Circle and in the Salt Lake City Warehouse District.  Early life  Kletting was born on July 1, 1858, at Unterböhringen, With in the Kingdom of Württemberg, Germany, and was one of sixteen children. He first decided that he wanted to become an architect when he was fifteen, while working in a stone yard where he cut stone. A year later, he became a junior draftsman on railroad construction work. When Kletting was sixteen he arrived in Paris and learned modern architectural design from a big contracting firm. He served in the German army for one year. He left for the United States of America in 1883, when he was twenty five years old. Kletting married a woman named Mary Elizabeth Saaner on 18 May 1905 in San Francisco. Their children were Mary Wilhelmine born 17 August 1906, Walter born 30 November 1907 and Helen Elizabeth born 28 May 1910. All the children were born in Salt Lake City, Utah. More details. Other details, including spelling of birthplace.  Career  Richard K. A. Kletting contributed on several \\"major European projects, including Bon Marche,The Le Bon Marché moved to a revolutionary new building completed in 1869, at 24 rue de Sèvres, which was enlarged in 1872, with help from the engineering firm of Gustave Eiffel; Kletting, who left France in 1883 at age 25, would have been age 14 at the time of the enlargement, but could have been involved in continuous renovations thereafter. Credit de Lyonais,The 1876–1883 construction period of the spectacular Crédit Lyonnais headquarters building in the Second Arrondisement of Paris (which includes Montmarte) also matches up to timing of Kletting's biographical assertion. and Sacre Coeur at Montmarte,Sacré-Cœur was built during 1875-1914, also matching up to all in France, before coming to the United States and settling in Utah in 1883.\\"McIntyre writeup by Utah State Historical Society Richard K.A. Kletting was hired as an architect and worked on many Salt Lake City buildings, both residential and commercial. He became a very well known architect in Utah. He worked in the East before coming to Salt Lake City, where he worked for John H. Burton drafting plans for the old University of Utah. The University of Deseret was Kletting's first architectural design commissioned in Salt Lake. It later became known as the University of Utah in 1892. His next commission was the original Saltair resort in 1893, on the south shore of the Great Salt Lake. It stood on over two thousand pilings and posts. It became known for its detailed woodwork and Moorish design. It also featured the world's largest dance floor. Saltair was intended as a family resort that hoped to provide a safe atmosphere for families with the supervision of Church leaders. In 1899 the original historic Salt Palace was built and Richard Kletting was the architect. It had a racing track, a theatre, and a dance hall. The building eventually burned down on August 29, 1910. In 1912, Kletting was chosen among forty other competing architects to design the Utah State Capitol building in 1912. His design was based on the style of the time of the Renaissance, called Renaissance Revival. Kletting's design was ultimately selected. Utah granite and Georgia marble were common materials throughout the capitol building. It had a large dome and twenty four columns in its colonnade. The total cost for the project was $2,739,528. Kletting built many other buildings, including the Mcintyre Building which is claimed to be Utah's first fire-proof building. The building was of constructed of concrete and steel. The interior included metal railings, metal windows and trim, and plaster and marble walls and floors. It was constructed for $180,000. It was the first and only \\"skyscraper\\" in Utah until two years later, when the Boston and Newhouse Buildings were constructed. Richard Kletting was a well-accomplished architect, but he was also interested in forestry. Over his career, Kletting hired several young architects who later went on to be prominent Utah architects in their own right. These included Richard C. Watkins, Carl M. Neuhausen, and Leslie S. Hodgson. Richard Kletting designed many well-known buildings, including the Utah State Capitol and the original Saltair Pavilion in Utah. He designed several other buildings such as the Territorial Insane Asylum, Albert Fisher Mansion and Carriage House, Reed O. Smoot House, Lehi Tabernacle, Riverton LDS Meetinghouse, LeRoy Cowles Building, Utah Commercial and Savings Bank Building, Beaver County Courthouse, Henry Dinwoody House, Gibbs-Thomas House, J. R.

Its annual IAAPA Expo in Orlando, Florida, is recognized as the world's largest attractions trade show in the number of attendees and exhibitors and providing members insight into current amusement trends, laws, operations and industry methodology.Tampa Bay Times - \\"Theme park professionals gather in Orlando this week for international amusement conventionOrlando Sentinel - \\"From the IAAPA floor: Roller coasters, Big Bird, Aquaman attend big expo IAAPA also helps to promote guest-safety and ride-safety guidelines in conjunction with ASTM International and assists its members to uphold the highest amusement-industry safety and professional standards. IAAPA represents a variety of location- based entertainment facilities, including amusement and theme parks, family entertainment centers, arcades, museums, water parks, aquariums, science centers, zoos, and resorts. It also represents industry equipment manufacturers, distributors, operators, industry suppliers, and service providers.  History  In 1976, Aaron Fechter brought the first full animated show to the convention. In 1990, IAAPA established an international council in expand its global reach and give advice and direction about programs and services for members outside the United States. The council and its operations committee were instrumental in recruiting international members and developing quality products and services. IAAPA also established the IAAPA Hall of Fame, with amusement-industry pioneers its first class of inductees. The following year, the 73rd annual convention and trade show in Orlando, Florida had over 19,000 attendees. The IAAPA Expo was the largest amusement- industry exhibition in the world, offering trends in amusement and arcade equipment, food, beverage, park technology and entertainment. In 2000 the association worked to counter negative publicity following high-profile amusement-ride incidents and surrounding amusement safety, publicizing the industry’s overall safety record. It established a ride-incident reporting system for its U.S. facilities with rides (releasing the initial results in 2003 through the National Safety Council), and helped facilitate independent scientific reviews of ride forces in 2002-03 indicating the inherent safety of rides for the general public. In 2000, IAAPA opened its first full-time overseas office (IAAPA Europe) in Brussels. The organization acquired the Asian Amusement Expo (AAE) in 2003, but canceled the event because of the SARS outbreak in Asia. IAAPA maintained its focus on industry safety that year, establishing an international standards harmonization group to implement universal ride-safety criteria. In 2004, it helped spearhead the adoption of the ASTM International amusement-ride design and manufacture standard and the European standard for amusement machinery and structures. Two years later, IAAPA joined the Travel Industry Association of America to produce \\"The Economic Impact of Domestic and Overseas Travelers Who Visit Amusement/Theme Parks and Other Attractions in the United States\\" on the importance of amusement, theme parks and other attractions to U.S. tourism and its wider economy. The association extended membership to casinos and resorts, since a number of facilities had incorporated amusement and entertainment features. To promote park safety, IAAPA made its ride incident reporting system mandatory for U.S. members and supported Europarks' efforts to implement a similar system for its members. IAAPA encouraged voluntary ride reporting by its global partners, supplying background materials. In 2007 the association opened a new office in Europe with expanded programs and services and increased collaboration with Europarks on ride-safety reporting, and held its annual senior-level training program (the Institute for Executive Education) to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. At its Attractions Expo, the association unveiled its institute for emerging leaders (later renamed the Institute for Attractions Managers) to recruit candidates for senior-level positions. The following year, IAAPA acquired the Euro Attractions Show (EAS). It held its first Middle East safety conference in Dubai in February, and had its inaugural Attractions Safety Awareness Week to enhance understanding of the industry’s safety practices and record in June. In 2010, the IAAPA Foundation was created as a 501(c)(3) organization to fund the development of education programs and information resources for the global attractions industry. The following year, the association implemented its certification program to help raise amusement-industry standards. Its Institute for Executive Education was revived in conjunction with San Diego State University, and IAAPA's first \\"Latin America State of the Industry Report\\" and \\"European Manifesto\\" were released. In September 2016, the association announced plans to move its headquarters from Alexandria, Virginia to Orlando in 2017 and to hold its expo in Orlando until 2030. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the themed entertainment industry faced significant new pressures. IAAPA was among a number of themed entertainment organizations whose members faced potential tens of billions in losses as a result.Zawya - \\"COVID-19 threatens US$80.58 billion MENA leisure attractions industry as MENALAC seeks government support\\" As a result, IAAPA has asked the United States Congress to amend the Paycheck Protection Program to protect small businesses in the industry.blooloop - \\"IAAPA asks Congress to amend current Paycheck Protection ProgramTravel Agent Central - \\"Next Round of Coronavirus Relief: What The Travel Industry Needs\\" The IAAPA Asia Expo had already been postponed by a year due to the pandemic, with the American expo presently staying on the books for November 2020.Orlando Sentinel - \\"IAAPA postpones next Asia Expo until 2021 amid coronavirus outbreak  Structure  Founded in 1918, IAAPA is the largest international trade association for permanent amusement facilities and attractions and is dedicated to the preservation and prosperity of the attractions industry. The association represents nearly 5,000 facility, supplier, and individual members in 99 countries. Member facilities include amusement and theme parks, water parks, attractions, family entertainment centers, zoos, aquariums, museums, science centers, and resorts. IAAPA is a nonprofit organization with its headquarters in Orlando, Florida and regional offices in Brussels, Mexico City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Washington D.C..  Events and publications  The association operates IAAPA Expo, IAAPA Expo Asia, and IAAPA Expo Europe. At each show, IAAPA offers educational, informational, operational, safety, and leadership seminars and behind-the-scenes tours of member amusement parks, theme parks, water parks, and family entertainment centers. IAAPA publishes Funworld the official magazine for members, keeps its global membership informed about current and pending federal, state and local amusement-related laws and legislation and publishes \\"News Daily\\", a daily e-newsletter with industry news stories from around the world.  Awards  The IAAPA Hall Of Fame was established in 1990 to celebrate achievements in and contributions to the growth and development of the amusement park and attractions industry. Its Service Awards honor members who excel in dedication to the association and the industry.  Services  IAAPA offers training in every aspect of the amusement-park and attractions industry and provides member facilities with opportunities to educate their personnel with workshops, on-site seminars, videotapes, manuals, webinars and services provided by institute programs, such as the IAAPA Institutes for Attractions Managers and Executive Education and the IAAPA Safety Institute. The association promotes amusement park safety standards to its members and maintains a partnership with the ASTM International to develop and update ride safety standards and maintenance requirements. IAAPA’s advocacy department reaches out to governments in a number of countries, representing the industry in attraction and amusement-park legislation and regulations.

The building has a two-story rear ell. The property includes a small log slave cabin. The house was built by General Elisha Boyd for his son John as the plantation house for the 1,400 acre Edgewood Manor plantation. During the American Civil War, John Boyd served in the Confederate Army and was captured when he visited home. He was nearly executed, but for the intervention of President Zachary Taylor's daughter, Mrs. Dandridge. Also during the war, General Stonewall Jackson camped on the lawn. Confederate General J.

Clarke was a right-handed batsman who bowled leg break. He was born in Patcham, Sussex. A late starter to county cricket, not making his debut for Sussex until he was 26, Clarke played for Sussex for 3 seasons. He later played Minor counties cricket for Buckinghamshire and Norfolk, before retiring in 2003. Sussex Clarke initially played a Second XI Championship fixture for Sussex in 1981 against the Second XI of Hampshire, but made no further appearances for the Sussex Second XI for some while following that fixture. He did though play club cricket in Brighton, while working as an insurance underwriter. However, in 1987 he had trials at Sussex, where he again played Second XI cricket for the Sussex Second XI. The trial turned out to be a success for Clarke, with Sussex signing following which he took a sabbatical from his job. His late start in county cricket, at the age of 26, was all the more remarkable considering that his bowling style was virtually considered an extinct form in England. His first-class debut followed in the 1988 County Championship against Somerset, with his List A debut also coming in 1988 against the same opposition in the Refuge Assurance League. Clarke played 3 seasons for Sussex, appearing regularly in the Sussex team for first-class matches, before falling out of favour during the 1989 and 1990 seasons. He did though make a total of 26 first-class appearances in the 2 seasons in which he appeared in first-class cricket, with 21 coming in his debut season. A tailender, Clarke scored 406 runs at a batting average of 14.50. He scored a single half century, making 68 against in a rearguard action against Hampshire in 1988. Clarkes primary role was as a bowler, with Clarke taking 53 first- class wickets, at a respectable bowling average of 35.32. He twice took a five wicket haul, with the best of these coming against Hampshire in 1988, the match in which his highest score with the bat came. Clarke was used by Sussex more in limited-overs cricket; he played List A cricket in all 3 of his seasons with the county, making 44 appearances. He was more successful in List A matches for with the ball for Sussex, taking 53 wickets – the same total as he took in first-class cricket – although coming at a better average of 28.52. His best figures for Sussex came against Glamorgan in the 1988 Refuge Assurance League. Having played just 5 first-class matches in 1989, and solely List A cricket for remainder of that season and for the entirety of the 1990 season, he was released by the county at the end of that season. Minor counties He appeared once for the Second XI of Derbyshire in 1992, against the Second XI of Yorkshire. His trial with Derbyshire was not successful, with the county not pursuing their interest in him. He joined Buckinghamshire in 1994, making his debut for the county in the 1994 Minor Counties Championship against Northumberland. His debut in the MCCA Knockout Trophy came in the same season, against Berkshire in the competition's quarter-final. However, at this time Buckinghamshire were permitted to take part in the NatWest Trophy with the first-class counties. He made his first appearance for the county in the List A format against Essex in the 1997 NatWest Trophy. In his first stint with the county, he played a further 2 List A matches: against the Yorkshire Cricket Board and Warwickshire, both in the 1999 NatWest Trophy. He left Buckinghamshire for Norfolk in 2000, making 9 Minor Counties Championship appearances and 4 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches. Clarke also played 2 List A matches in his sole season with Norfolk, both coming in the 2000 NatWest Trophy against Cornwall and Dorset, taking 2 wickets at an average of 28.50. Clarke returned to Buckinghamshire after his sole season with Norfolk. He played Minor counties cricket for Buckinghamshire until 2003, making 15 further Minor Counties Championship appearances, bringing the total amount he played for Buckinghamshire to 62. He also made a total of 15 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches for the county. His return to Buckinghamshire brought him some success in List A cricket. He made 6 further appearances for the county, that last coming against Gloucestershire in the 2003 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. This competition was his most successful, with Clarke ending it as the competition's leading wicket-taker with 11. His best figures in List A cricket came during this competition, when he took 5/36 against Suffolk. In total, Clarke played 9 List A matches for Buckinghamshire, taking 17 wickets at an average of 21.76. His retired from county cricket following the 2003 season.

Definition  The probability density function of the wrapped exponential distribution is : f_{WE}(\\\\theta;\\\\lambda)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\lambda e^{-\\\\lambda (\\\\theta+2 \\\\pi k)}=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda e^{-\\\\lambda \\\\theta}}{1-e^{-2\\\\pi \\\\lambda}} , for 0 \\\\le \\\\theta < 2\\\\pi where \\\\lambda > 0 is the rate parameter of the unwrapped distribution.

Characteristic function The characteristic function of the wrapped exponential is just the characteristic function of the exponential function evaluated at integer arguments: :\\\\varphi_n(\\\\lambda)=\\\\frac{1}{1-in/\\\\lambda} which yields an alternate expression for the wrapped exponential PDF in terms of the circular variable z=e i (θ-m) valid for all real θ and m: : \\\\begin{align} f_{WE}(z;\\\\lambda) & =\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{z^{-n}}{1-in/\\\\lambda}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] & = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\pi}\\\\,\\\\textrm{Im}(\\\\Phi(z,1,-i\\\\lambda))-\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} & \\\\text{if }z eq 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[12pt] \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{1-e^{-2\\\\pi\\\\lambda}} & \\\\text{if }z=1 \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} where \\\\Phi() is the Lerch transcendent function.

Specification and measurement Howard-Dolman test. StereoacuityHoward IP, Rogers BJ (2002) Seeing in Depth. Vol. 1I. Chapter 19 Porteous, Toronto is most simply explained by considering one of its earliest test, a two-peg device, named Howard-Dolman test after its inventors:Howard HJ (1919) A test for the judgment of distance. Amer. J. Ophthalmol., 2, 656-675 The observer is shown a black peg at a distance of 6m (=20 feet). A second peg, below it, can be moved back and forth until it is just detectably nearer than the fixed one. Stereoacuity is this difference in the two positions, converted into an angle of binocular disparity, i.e., the difference in their binocular parallax. Conversion to the angle of disparity dγ is performed by inserting the position difference dz in the formula :d\\\\gamma = c\\\\,a\\\\,dz/z^2 where a is the interocular separation of the observer and z the distance of the fixed peg from the eye. To transfer dγ into the usual unit of minutes of arc, a multiplicative constant c is inserted whose value is 3437.75 (1 radian in arcminutes). In the calculation a, dz and z must be in the same units, say, feet, inches, cm or meters. For the average interocular distance of 6.5 cm, a target distance of 6m and a typical stereoacuity of 0.5 minute of arc, the just detectable depth interval is 8 cm. As targets come closer, this interval gets smaller by the inverse square of the distance, so that an equivalent detectable depth interval at ¼ meter is 0.01 cm or the depth of impression of the head on a coin. These very small values of normal stereoacuity, expressed in differences of either object distances, or angle of disparity, makes it a hyperacuity.  Tests  Example of a Snellen-like depth test Since the Howard-Dolman test described above is cumbersome, stereoacuity is usually measured using a stereogram in which separate panels are shown to each eye by superimposing them in a stereoscope using prisms or goggles with color or polarizing filters or alternating occlusion (for a review see ). A good procedure is a chart, analogous to the familiar Snellen visual acuity chart, in which one letter in each row differs in depth (front or behind) sequentially increasing in difficulty. For children the fly test is ideal: the image of a fly is transilluminated by polarized light; wearing polarizing glasses the wing appears at a different depth and allows stereopsis to be demonstrated by trying to pull on it.  Expected performance  There is no equivalent in stereoacuity of the normal 20/20 visual acuity standard. In every case, the numerical score, even if expressed in disparity angle, depends to some extent on the test being used. Superior observers under ideal conditions can achieve 0.1 arc min or even better. The distinction between screening for the presence of stereopsis and a measurement of stereoacuity is valuable. To ascertain that depth can be seen in a binocular views, a test must be easily administered and not subject to deception. The random-dot stereogram is used widely for this purpose and has the advantage that for the uninitiated the object shape is unknown. It is made of random small pattern elements; depth can be created only in multiples of elements and therefore may not reach the small threshold disparity which is the purpose of stereoacuity measurements. A population study revealed a surprisingly high incidence of good stereoacuity.Coutant BE(1993) Population distribution of stereoscopic ability. Ophthalmic Physiol Opt, 13, 3-7. Out of 188 biology students, 97.3% could perform at 2.3 minutes of arc or better.  Factors influencing stereoacuity  Optimum stereoacuity requires that the following mitigating factors be avoided: * Low contrastWestheimer G, Pettet MW (1990) Contrast and duration of exposure differentially affect vernier and stereoscopic acuity.

Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 257, 205-14 * Uncorrected or unequally corrected refractive errors (monovision) Perceptual training in stereopsis More than other such visual capabilities, the limits of stereopsis depend on the observer's familiarity with the situation.

It is based on the 1919 play by Wilson Collison and Otto A. Harbach. The film's composer, Edward Paul, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1945. The film is a remake of a 1926 silent film of the same name, starring Marie Prevost. Plot Gary Ainsworth (Dennis O'Keefe) is about to celebrate one month of marriage to his Geraldine (Marjorie Reynolds) when his ex- girlfriend Mabel Essington (Gail Patrick) contacts him. Now in a relationship with Gary's business partner Arthur Weldon (Lee Bowman), she wants to return a gift she got from Gary when they were vacationing in Mexico City. Mabel comes to Gary's office with the gift, arriving while Arthur is out on business. Gary and Mabel share a taxi back home from the office. Mabel gives the gift, a slip with a loving message from Gary embroidered on it, to Gary. As he exits the taxi he leaves the gift behind, wishing to be rid of it, but Mabel delivers it to his apartment and threatens to show it to his wife if he doesn't reveal that they had a romance in Mexico City. The following weekend the two couples visit Arthur's sister Martha (Charlotte Greenwood), bringing another couple, Alicia and Jimmy Larchmont (Binnie Barnes and John Hubbard). Geraldine notices that Gary is acting suspiciously and keeps an eye on him. For a sum of money, Gary gets Boris the waiter (Mischa Auer) to sneak into Mabel's room and steal the slip back from her. Marjorie Reynolds Boris manages to get into the room and find the slip. That evening he gives it to Gary, who drops it into his dinner-jacket pocket. The slip falls out of the pocket while Gary is dancing with his wife, and he quickly stuffs it down a vase to avoid discovery. Sure of himself, he tells Mabel he'll tell Geraldine about their past as soon as she brings him the slip. When Gary plucks the slip from the vase, he notices that it's the wrong one. When Geraldine goes off to phone her mother for advice about Gary's strange behavior, Alicia deliberately flirts with him to see what's going on. He tells her the secret, but she misunderstands: she thinks she has an illegitimate child. Mabel discovers that her room has had a visitor and tells Martha about the slip and Mexico City. Gary and Boris make another attempt to steal the slip back, entering Mabel's room through the window, but Mabel interrupts them and they must hide under the bed. Geraldine tells the others that she has spotted an intruder on the roof, and Martha gets her shotgun to fend him off. Noticing that Alicia is showing far too much interest in Gary, her husband Jimmy suspects that they are having an affair. Gary and Boris eventually manage to escape from Mabel's bedroom when she leaves, and they manage to find the right slip. While Gary holds it, Jimmy comes into the room and assuming he's holding Alicia's slip. There is a knock on the door and the three men all hide under the bed, unaware that it is Arthur. Mabel comes into the room again and discovers the men hiding under her bed. Boris escapes up onto the roof, but Martha fires her gun at him, making him climb back in through the window. Geraldine faints onto the floor and spots her husband under Mabel's bed. The next day Gary is sitting alone and abandoned in the library when Martha comes in carrying her maid's sister's baby in her arms. Since Martha is going to the maid's wedding reception, she asks Gary to watch the baby for her. Martha tells Gary she has disposed of the slip by giving it to her maid Priscilla (Jane Lambert) as a wedding gift. Alicia and Arthur see him holding the baby and believe it's his illegitimate child. Gary and Boris make one last attempt to retrieve the slip by crashing the wedding, and they accidentally interrupt the ceremony. Boris tries to take the slip off Priscilla's wrist, but the groom knocks him out. Geraldine is about to leave the house when Gary finally returns with the slip. Gary manages to explain that it was this slip he was guilty of and Geraldine believes him. Soon after, Geraldine's mother phones again, but Geraldine no longer needs advice.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/94556/Up-in-Mabel-s-Room/ Cast *Marjorie Reynolds as Geraldine Ainsworth *Dennis O'Keefe as Gary Ainsworth *Gail Patrick as Mabel Essington *Mischa Auer as Boris *Charlotte Greenwood as Martha *Binnie Barnes as Alicia Larchmont *Lee Bowman as Arthur Weldon *John Hubbard as Jimmy Larchmont *Jane Lambert as Priscilla *Fred Kohler, Jr. as Johnny *Harry Hayden as Justice of the Peace Production Edward Small bought rights in October 1941.

Geometrical properties In studying geometry one concentrates on the position of points and on the length, orientation and curvature of lines. Geometrical-optical illusions then relate in the first instance to object characteristics as defined by geometry. Though vision is three-dimensional, in many situations depth can be factored out and attention concentrated on a simple view of a two-dimensional tablet with its x and y co-ordinates.' Illusions are in visual space Whereas their counterparts in the observer's object space are public and have measurable properties, the illusions themselves are private to the observer's (human or animal) experience. Nevertheless, they are accessible to portrayal by verbal and other communication and even to measurement by psychophysics. A nulling technique is particularly useful in which a target is deliberately given an opposing deformation in an effort to cancel the illusion.  Categories of visual illusions  Mach bands = visual illusion of brightness (intensive property) Illusions of position (Poggendorff), orientation (Zöllner) and, below, length (Müller-Lyer) Hering Illusion of curvature Delboeuf Illusion of size: left inner circle and right outer circle are actually equal Vertical-horizontal Illusion Shifted chessboard illusion Visual or Optical Illusions can be categorized according to the nature of the difference between objects and percepts. For example, these can be in brightness or color, called intensive properties of targets, e.g. Mach bands. Or they can be in their location, size, orientation or depth, called extensive. When an illusion involves properties that fall within the purview of geometry it is geometrical-optical, a term given to it in the first scientific paper devoted to the topic by J.J. Oppel, a German high-school teacher, in 1854. It was taken up by Wilhelm Wundt, widely regarded as the founder of experimental psychology, and is now universally used.Robinson, J.O. (1998) The Psychology of Visual Illusion. Dover, Mineola, NY.Coren, S. and Girgus, J.S. (1978) Seeing is Deceiving: The Psychology of Visual Illusions. Erlbaum, Hillsdale, N.J.Wade, N. (1982) The Art and Science of Visual Illusions. Routledge, London That by 1972 the first edition of Robinson's book devotes 100 closely printed pages and over 180 figures to these illusions attests to their popularity. Examples of geometrical-optical Illusions The easiest to explore are the geometrical-optical illusions that show up in ordinary black and white line drawings. A few examples are drawn from the list of optical illusions. They illustrate illusions of position (Poggendorff illusion), of length (Müller-Lyer illusion), of orientation (Zöllner illusion, Münsterberg illusion or shifted-chess-board illusion and its café wall illusion variant), of rectilinearity or straightness of lines (Hering illusion), of size (Delboeuf illusion) and of vertical/horizontal anisotropy (Vertical-horizontal illusion), in which the vertical extension appears exaggerated. Related phenomena Necker cube = reversible figure Penrose triangle = unrealizable object Kanizsa triangle = illusory contours Visual illusions proper should be distinguished from some related phenomena. Some simple targets such as the Necker Cube are capable of more than one interpretation, which are usually seen in alternation, one at a time. They may be called ambiguous configurations rather than illusion, because what is seen at any time is not actually illusory. The configurations of the Penrose or Escher type are illusory in the sense that only on a detailed logical analysis it becomes apparent that they are not physically realizable. If one thinks of an illusion as something out there that is misinterpreted, and of a delusion when a demonstrable substrate is lacking, the distinction breaks down for such effects as the Kanizsa triangle and illusory contours. Explanations  Explanations of geometrical-optical illusion are based on one of two modes of attack: * the physiological or bottom-up, seeking the cause of the deformation in the eye's optical imaging or in signal misrouting during neural processing in the retina or the first stages of the brain, the primary visual cortex, or * the cognitive or perceptual, which regards the deviation from true size, shape or position as caused by the assignment of a percept to a meaningful but false or inappropriate object class. The first stage in the operations that transfer information from a visual target in front of an observer into its neural representation in the brain and then allow a percept to emerge, is the imaging by the eye and the processing by the neural circuits in the retina. Some components of geometrical-optical illusions can be ascribed to aberrations at that level. Even if this does not fully account for an illusion, the step is helpful because it puts elaborate mental theories in a more secure place. The moon illusion is a good example. Before invoking concepts of apparent distance and size constancy, it helps to be sure that the retinal image hasn't changed much when the moon looks larger as it descends to the horizon. Once the signals from the retina enter the visual cortex, a host of local interactions are known to take place. In particular, neurons are tuned to target orientation and their response are known to depend on context. The widely accepted interpretation of, e.g. the Poggendorff and Hering illusions as manifestation of expansion of acute angles at line intersections, is an example of successful implementation of a \\"bottom-up,\\" physiological explanation of a geometrical-optical illusion. Ponzo illusion in a purely schematic form and, below, with perspective clues However, almost all geometrical optical illusions have components that are at present not amenable to physiological explanations.Gregory, R.L. 1997 Eye and Brain. Princeton University Press: Princeton N.J. The subject, therefore, is a fertile field for propositions based in the disciplines of perception and cognition.Howe CQ, Purves D (2005) Perceiving geometry : geometrical illusions explained by natural scene statistics Springer : New York To illustrate: Instead of interpreting them as just a pair the sloping lines within which one feature is seen smaller than an identical one nearer to the point of convergence, the Ponzo pattern may be taken for a railroad track rendered as a perspective drawing. A barrel lying within the rails would have to be physically wider to cover the increased portion of the width of the track if it were farther away. The consequence is the judgment that the barrels differ in diameter, whereas their physical size in the drawing is equal. A scientific study will include the recognition that a representation of the visual word is embodied in the state of the organism's nervous system at the time the illusion is experienced. In the discipline of experimental neuroscience, a top-down influence has the meaning that signals originating in higher neural centers, repository of memory traces, innate patterns and decision operations, travel down to lower neuronal circuits where they cause a shift of the excitation balance in the deviated direction. Such a concept is to be distinguished from the bottom-up approach which would look for aberrations that are imposed on the input in its path through the sensory apparatus. Top-down neural signaling would be a fitting implementation of the gestalt concept enunciated by Max Wertheimer Wertheimer, M. (1938) in W.D. Ellis (Ed) A Source Book of Gestalt Psychology. Harcourt Brace : New York that the \\"properties of any of the parts are determined by the intrinsic structural laws of the whole.\\" Mathematical transformation When objects and associated percepts, in their respective spaces, correspond to each other albeit with deformations describable in terms of geometry, the mathematically inclined are tempted to search for transformations, perhaps non-Euclidean,Luneburg, R.K. (1947) Mathematical Analysis of Binocular Vision. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. that map them on each other. Application of differential geometry has so far not been notably successful ; the variety and complexity of the phenomena, significant differences between individuals and dependence on context, previous experience and instruction set a high bar for satisfying formulations.Westheimer, G.

The Odessa Zoo is located in downtown Odessa, opposite Odessa Privoz Market, 25 Novoshepnoy Ryad Street. History The first mention of the Odessa Zoo was in 1889 on the city's 100th anniversary when a draft of the plan was first created. Due to delays caused by World War I and the Civil War, the building of the zoo on Primorsky Boulevard did not begin until 1922. In December 1927, three projects were accepted as a zoo building basis. The zoo opened for visitors in 1938. At the zoo housed a unique nursery of rare species of birds of prey and owls of southern Ukraine, where the chicks are prepared to life and later released into the wild nature. For the young nature lovers the zoo regularly hosts thematical festivals, where you can spend your time having fun and advantage. In the zoo every year a lot of pups of rare animals are born. It became possible due to the active work on a complete set of pairs, full feeding and comfortable maintenance pets. In May 2013 Odessa zoo was accepted into the ranks of the Eurasian Regional Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

Name  This German term is probably derived from Hagenrecht (\\"hedging right\\"), i.e. the owner had a right to enclose the land he used. This went even further for the Hägerhufensiedlungen, where there was a Hägerjunker in charge and special courts dealing with enclosure issues, the Hägergerichte.  Description  The Hagenhufensiedlung was a form of planned settlement typical of the High Middle Ages that consisted of individually owned strips of land that were strung together in a line. The hides were as wide as the farmstead, but could be several hundred metres long. The enclosed plots were used as vegetable gardens and for keeping small animals. The stream at the back of the farmhouses supplied the necessary water. From this type of settlement, long linear villages developed like Auhagen, Wiedensahl, Isernhagen, Kathrinhagen or Rodewald in Lower Saxony. Hagenhufensiedlungen may be found from the Taunus region as far as Western Pomerania. The Hägerhufensiedlung is restricted to a region in the area of the Weser Uplands, Leine Uplands and Lippe.  Origin  The Hagenhufendörfer arose from the planned settlement of forested areas, predominantly in the 13th century, with the aim of clearing and cultivating the land. These villages had a lokator with a double hide (Doppelhufe). The Hägerhufensiedlungen go back to the 11th-century Eschershausen Treaty. Although they had no double hide and no lokator, they did have special enclosure rights (Hägerrecht).  Extent  Hagenhufendörfer are especially common in the Börde regions, on the North German Plain immediately north of the German Central Uplands. The best-known region, with many such villages, is the area around Stadthagen, which was itself founded as a planned town in the centre of the plain that was to be settled, between the Schaumburg Forest and Bückebergen. The Hägerhufensiedlungen of the fertile plain can no longer be made out in the countryside.  Sources  *Andreas Reuschel: Hagenhufensiedlungen oder \\"Hägerhufensiedlungen\\" in der Ithbörde?

He was the founder and inaugural leader of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIÉP) from 1993 until his death. He was also a Member of Parliament from 1990 to 1994 and from 1998 to 2002. Biography Csurka was born on 27 March 1934 in Budapest as the first son of Péter Csurka, a journalist. His younger brother was László Csurka, an actor and director. He was interned after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 for half-year. After that he was recruited as a III/III agent. In the early 1990s he was among the first to revealed his informant's past. According to him Csurka was under duress to sign the declaration of recruitment during internment. Founding member of Hungarian Democratic Forum, member of the first elected Parliament of Hungary after the fall of communist-socialist regime. His life before the political transition is multi-sided: renowned novelist and drama-author, a source of critical opinion towards the régime but also an informant to the Hungarian secret police (reluctantly according to him). Since October 1994, he had been chairman of the small Hungarian right-wing extremist party Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIÉP), which defines itself as a radical national-conservative group, and had the support of 5% of voters at its peak. Csurka himself is publicly associated with verbal anti-Semitism and sees himself as a representative of some 3 million Hungarians who have been separated from the Hungarian federation through the Treaty of Trianon (1920). According to a report in The Independent about the right-wing cultural offensive of early 2012 he was \\"convinced Zionists are planning to establish a second home in Hungary.\\"The Independent, 7 January 2011, The Curtain comes down on liberal Hungary, There has always been speculation that he might seek a partnership with the centre-right party of Young Democrats (Fidesz). Its chairman, Viktor Orbán, has denied this repeatedly and publicly rejected any parliamentary support as Prime Minister. After the elections of April 2002 and the victory of the Hungarian Socialist Party, such speculations became irrelevant. In the fall of 2011, Csurka was named as intendant for Új Színház (\\"New Theater) in Budapest by the new director, Hungarian actor György Dörner, who is affiliated with the far-right Jobbik party. They were expected to make productions that move away from what Csurka has described as, \\"the liberal- social-cultural policy... that is so oppressive\\". Later István Tarlós, the mayor of Budapest asked Dörner to reconsider hiring of Csurka following anti- Semitic screed. He was hospitalized in January 2012. His last public appearance was in a pro-government demonstration in Szeged. He said that Hungary was threatened by an unprecedented aggression. He also stressed the need to prevent the country from being diverted from the course set by a power backed by a two-thirds majority. Csurka died on 4 February 2012, aged 77, after a long illness. Personal life He was married and had three children: two daughters, Eszter and Dóra and one son, Endre István.Csurka István gyerekei gyakorolják a hagyatéki jogokat References Sources * Életrajz és program az Origón * A MIÉP története * Hungary's right-wing war on culture Further bibliography * Csurka István: Vasárnapi jegyzetek. – A Kossuth Rádió Vasárnapi Újság-jában 1987 és 1991 augusztusa között elhangzott jegyzetek.

Remains of human heads, feet and arms were found, in all 9 bone fossils, by the Okinawa Limestone Cave Association between 2007 and 2009, and three human samples were dated to between 20,000-16,000 years before present. In the ruins were also found bones from wild boar and birds (one animal bone calibrated at 12,000 BP), while during the three months in 2011 were discovered approximately 300 human bones from the stratum between 24,000-20,000 years old. In 2015, researchers from the University of the Ryukyus and University of Tokyo succeeded in radiocarbon dating three out of five of the bones tested. The three bones yielded the following dates: (20,030 to 18,100 years BP), (22,890 to 22,400 years BP) and (24,990 to 24,210 years BP). The investigation held between 2012 and 2016 found more than 1,000 human fragments from at least 19 human skeletons.

His father was thus one of the early emigrants to Berkeley County, which the Virginia General Assembly split it off from then-vast and later neighboring Frederick County, Virginia. Elisha received a private education, including at Liberty Hall Academy, a predecessor of Washington and Lee University in Staunton, Virginia, graduating in 1785. He also studied law in the office of Colonel Philip Pendleton. Elisha Boyd helped to establish Martinsburg Academy, which closed near the end of his life (after the Panic of 1837).Otis K.

Military service Boyd served in the War of 1812, receiving a commission as Colonel of the 4th Regiment of Virginia Militia. Their troop of Berkeley County militia defended Norfolk and Portsmouth against a British naval and land attack; another Berkeley County militia troop would be the first to reach Washington, D.C. after the British burned the new nation's capitol. His first father in law, Andrew Waggoner, would be cited for heroism at the Battle of Lundy's Lane.Evans p.86 For his services defending Virginia, the General Assembly elected Boyd a Brigadier General.

Taxonomic position Bajkaloceras is the sole member and representative of the Bajkaloceratidae, proposed by Balashov, 1962, and given ordinal rank by Sheveyrev, 2006. Teichert (1964), in the Treatise, Pt K, included Bajkaloceras, and Bajkaloceratidae, along with Intejoceras, Evencoceras, and Padunoceras in the Intejocerida which he joined with the Endocerida in the Endoceratoidea. Flower (1976) separated these into two groups, calling attention to differences in siphuncle morphology and location. Thin connecting rings and the central or subcentral siphuncle separate Bajkaloceras form the endoceroids and suggest a close relationship with the Baltoceratidae or the Troedssonellidae References *Flower, R.H. 1976.

It followed the arrest of freedmen accused of inciting riot in a downtown fire, and blacks' organizing for self- defense. Although the local Ku Klux Klan (KKK) chapter had attacked freedmen since the end of the Civil War, generally without punishment, the first local arrest under the 1870 act to suppress the Klan was of a freedman. This angered the black community. During the trial of black leaders, the presiding judge was shot in the courtroom, and a gunfight erupted that killed several people. In the ensuing mob violence, whites killed as many as 30 blacks over the next few days. Whites drove the Republican mayor from office, and no person was charged or tried in the freedmen's deaths. The Meridian riot was related to widespread postwar violence by whites to drive Reconstruction Republicans from office and restore white supremacy. Although the Enforcement Acts helped suppress the Klan at this time, the Meridian riot marked a turning point in Mississippi violence. By 1875 other white paramilitary groups arose; the Red Shirts suppressed black voting by intimidation, and their efforts led to a Democratic Party victory in state elections. Within two years a national political compromise was reached, and the federal government withdrew its military forces from the South in 1877. Background =Ku Klux Klan= After the American Civil War ended in 1865, the country underwent a period of Reconstruction. During this period, under the Reconstruction Acts the United States Army directly controlled the states that were formerly part of the Confederacy. This takeover was resented by white Democrats in the South, most of whom were temporarily disfranchised by service for the Confederacy. Their resentment increased with the passage of constitutional amendments making freedmen full citizens and the Voting Rights Act of 1867, which enabled freedmen to vote, serve on juries, and hold official positions in government.McGehee, p. 1 The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) arose as independent chapters, part of the postwar insurgency related to the struggle for power in the South. In 1866, Mississippi Governor William L. Sharkey reported that disorder, lack of control and lawlessness were widespread. The Klan used public violence against blacks as intimidation. They burned houses, and attacked and killed blacks, leaving their bodies on the roads. Meridian, the county seat of Lauderdale County, had a Republican mayor appointed by the governor. Sturgis was from Connecticut so opponents called him a carpetbagger. Southern Republicans were called scalawags. The KKK tried to intimidate a black school teacher named Daniel Price, who had migrated from Livingston, Alabama, county seat of the Alabama county just to the east of Lauderdale.McGehee, p. 4 In Livingston, Price had been the leader of the local Loyal League, an organization established to help former slaves transition to freedom. Because of threats against him by local whites who opposed his activism, Price left the city for Mississippi and brought several freedmen with him. They hoped to find jobs in Meridian, a larger town. Numerous other African Americans had been migrating from Alabama to Mississippi since they had been freed and Alabama farmers were running short on labor. To try to force freedmen to return to Alabama and possibly stop the migration of others, Adam Kennard, deputy sheriff of Livingston (also described as a bounty hunter), was sent to arrest the men who went with Price to Meridian. He took some KKK men with him.McGehee, pp. 4–5 The Republican city officials refused to cooperate with Kennard and his group; they thought he was outside his legal jurisdiction. Freedmen were angered by the Klan's presence, yet neither they nor the Republican city government had enough power to deter them. One night when Kennard was sleeping, Price and a band of about six freedmen in disguise took him from the house, carried him outside the city limits, and beat him. Kennard managed to get away and pressed charges against Price the next day.McGehee, p. 6 Price was prosecuted under a statute of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, intended to stop the KKK's widespread violence. It classified committing an act of violence in disguise as a federal crime (related to the KKK practice of wearing masks and costumes to hide individual identities). The root of the riots, were attributed to the ceaseless raids of KKK, in essence forcing the freedmen to leave the Sumter County farms, taking refuge in the nearby Meridian area (located just southwest of the Livingston). According to Michael Newton, Adam Kennard was not a white sheriff, rather a former slave, who was deputized and dispatched to by the farmers, along with some KKK members to retrieve the departed farm hands. Daniel Price, was a white Republican teacher of an all black school.Book reference in Google Referencing the trial's cross examination, the Weekly Clarion, reports that Kennard was a \\"colored man who was Ku Klux Klaned by the Radicals…\\"The Daily Dispatch of Richmond, wrote: > The riots of last year were the result of bad teachings by bad men of both > parties, who wanted strife. At present such feelings were very slight. As a > character of the outrages, the witness instanced where a white Republican > school teacher named Price, assisted by several colored Republicans, nearly > whipped to death Adam Kennard, a colored deputy sheriff, who was also a > Republican. =Price's trial= In the week before Price's trial, whites in Meridian began to threaten him. Freedmen were outraged that he had been arrested at all, as no one had been arrested or convicted for the many previous attacks on black people. Price was the first to be arrested under what was considered the federal anti-KKK law. Freedmen were angered that the law intended to protect them was being used against them. Before his trial, Price stated that he would not pay his bond and would not go to jail. He claimed that if he were convicted, his supporters \\"would begin shooting.\\"McGehee, p. 8 When an armed party of about 50 white men came from Livingston to witness the trial, city officials became uneasy.Rowland, p. 222 They postponed the trial for a week. During the Alabamians' visit to Meridian, the men arrested several freedmen who had migrated with Price to the city. They claimed the men had forfeited labor contracts and, in some cases, stolen money.McGehee, pp. 9–10 At the second date for Price's trial, one of the state witnesses for Kennard was ill, so the court postponed the trial for another week. During this time, several prominent city employees told Mayor Sturgis of their concern that if Price were tried, there was a risk of mass unrest. They suggested avoiding the trial but forcing Price to leave the city. Sturgis and other officials made a deal with the prosecutors, and they freed Price on the condition that he leave the city.McGehee, pp. 10–11 Given Price's absence at his third trial date, the prosecutor dropped the charges against him, but the black community of Meridian was still furious.McGehee, pp. 11–12 They learned that Kennard had arrested several Alabama freedmen and forced them to return to Livingston. The white community organized against Mayor Sturgis and petitioned to have him removed from office. Blacks countered with their own petition, which was sent to the Republican governor Adelbert Ames, who had appointed Sturgis.McGehee, p. 13 Sturgis was not removed; opposed by prominent whites, he became increasingly worried about the hostility between the races.McGehee, pp. 14–18 =Courthouse meeting= Shortly after Price's scheduled trial and departure, the 1870 gubernatorial election was held. The Republican James L. Alcorn won, carrying Lauderdale County by a large majority on the basis of voting by freedmen. Given the unrest in Meridian, Mayor Sturgis requested federal troops, since no local officials were willing to prosecute the Alabamians or other whites in the city. The troops arrived, but stayed only a few days. With no major violence, they were withdrawn as the state's resources were limited. Sturgis began his own legal proceedings against some of the whites in the city, leading to greater opposition and renewed effort to have him removed. Sturgis sent several black advisers to the governor's office in Jackson to plead his case.McGehee, pp. 17–19 When Sturgis's advisers returned to the city on Friday, March 3, 1871, they brought Aaron Moore, a Republican member of the Mississippi Legislature from Lauderdale County. He called for a meeting the next day, March 4, at the county courthouse to make the case for keeping Sturgis in office. About 200 people showed up for the meeting but they included only a few whites. Speeches reportedly criticized militant whites and encouraged freedmen in self-defense. The meeting adjourned at sundown, after which several of the black people in the meeting organized a military company with William Clopton, one of Sturgis's advisers, leading the way. Some were armed with swords while others carried guns; many freedmen avoided the demonstration.McGehee, pp. 19–25 =Downtown fire= Even before the meeting at the courthouse, trouble was brewing. Whites shared rumors of seeing crowds of armed African Americans traveling to the city, which raised their fears. A local store owner overheard a conversation predicting that crowds of people – both black and white – would be out on the streets that night.McGehee, p. 27 When the whites heard about the courthouse meeting, they decided that Sturgis, Clopton, and Warren Tyler, another of Sturgis's advisors and a speechmaker, should be forced to leave the city. They organized an armed search team to find them. About an hour after the meeting adjourned, a fire broke out in the business section of the city.McGehee, p. 26 The fire started on the second floor of a store owned by Theodore Sturgis, the mayor's brother.McGehee, p. 28 Although the cause of the fire is unknown, many people at the time thought the mayor was behind it. The fire was eventually put out, but not before two- thirds of the business district had been engulfed. The block had recently been rebuilt after being destroyed during General William Tecumseh Sherman's 1864 raid. As the fire burned, Clopton was hit in the head with a shotgun barrel. Some witnesses thought he was killed but he was only wounded. Hearing of the attack, freedmen became enraged and began passing out guns. At the same time, groups of whites patrolled the streets as militias for the rest of the night.McGehee, pp. 35–36 Over the next few days under mob rule, the sheriff arrested Clopton, Tyler and Moore, and charged them with inciting riot. Whites appointed a committee to remove Mayor Sturgis from office. Rumors spread as wildly as the fire had; whites said the blacks would burn the entire city down. The sheriff told Moore at his church on Sunday that all black people in the city would be required to disarm. On Monday the committee started an investigation of the fire and concluded that Mayor Sturgis had set it.McGehee, p. 38 The riot After being arrested, Clopton, Tyler, and Moore were brought to trial on Monday, March 6. That morning, the whites held a meeting of their own and passed a resolution condemning the violent acts of Daniel Price, and those of Mayor Sturgis and other people – blacks and whites alike – on Saturday night, the night of the downtown fire.McGehee, pp. 39–40 When William Tyler was arrested, Sheriff Moseley checked him for any firearms, of which he had none, and then allowed him to go to the barbershop for a haircut. The barber Jack Williams later claimed he had seen Tyler wearing a pistol on his side. Tyler went to the courtroom after leaving the barbershop.McGehee, pp. 40–41 Judge E. L. Bramlette was presiding over the trial. Numerous Republicans and as many as two hundred Democrats were present in the courtroom. In general, the white people in the room were situated toward the front, and the black people were in the back.McGehee, p. 43 Before the examination of witnesses began, Mayor Sturgis was seen conversing with Tyler and handed him a written note. After the trial began, Tyler and Moore were taken into another room, and some reports say that Sturgis went in with them. Sturgis never returned to the courtroom, but when Tyler and Moore returned, several witnesses reported that Tyler had a pistol on his side they had not seen before.McGehee, p. 42 The second witness to testify was James Brantley. Tyler asked Brantley to stay on the stand and reportedly said, \\"I want to introduce two or three witnesses to impeach your veracity.\\" Outraged, Brantley took a cane of Marshal William S. Patton and lunged toward Tyler. Patton grabbed Brantley and told him to stop, and Tyler moved toward the courtroom door.McGehee, p. 44 Some witnesses claimed to have seen Tyler reach into his pocket for a gun. At this moment, the first shot was fired, although the person responsible is debated. Marshal Patton said he did not see Tyler shoot, but he thought the shot came from that direction. When the first shot was fired, Tyler was in little to no danger as he was to from Brantley. Several of the people in the courtroom at the time claimed that Tyler fired first.McGehee, pp. 45–46 Firearms were quickly drawn across the courtroom, and general shooting broke out. The shootout lasted somewhere between one and five minutes, and in the process, Judge Bramlette was killed, and Clopton was injured.McGehee, p. 47 Tyler sprinted to a second-floor veranda, hopped the railing, and jumped to the ground. The barber Jack Williams reported seeing him throw away what looked like a pistol as he jumped. Tyler limped towards Williams asking him for help, and then ran through the barber shop with several whites in pursuit. Dr. L. D. Belk, acting deputy sheriff, chased Tyler and asked men to gather arms and help in the pursuit.McGehee, pp. 47–48 Tyler was found wounded in a ditch between the courthouse and Sam Parker's shop by a black laborer Joe Sharp. Sharp and two other men helped Tyler get to a store two doors down from Parker's shop.McGehee, pp. 48–49 A white party later found Tyler and shot him many times, but there were so many in the crowd, that no one knew who had hit him. After the courtroom shootout, Clopton was badly injured and placed under the protection of guards.Rowland, p. 223 Reportedly the two men grew tired and threw Clopton from the second story window, saying they \\"could not waste their time on a wounded Negro murderer.\\"McGehee, p. 53 Clopton was carried back into the courthouse, where sometime during the night he died after his throat was cut.McGehee, p. 54 Moore had fallen by Judge Bramlette and pretended to be dead. After the courthouse was cleared, he ran to the woods to follow the railroad line to Jackson. A mob chased him for or , but they never caught up. He eventually made it to Jackson without harm, and was never arrested or brought to trial again.McGehee, p. 61 The white mob burned down Moore's house along with a Baptist church nearby, which had been donated by the United States government to serve as a school for blacks. Daniel Price had been a teacher there. In the chaos after the courtroom shootout, whites killed many other blacks. When they could not find Tyler and Moore, they attacked other freedmen they came across. For three days, local Klansmen murdered \\"all the leading colored men of the town with one or two exceptions.\\" Several black people were killed in the courtroom, and others died in the fires at Moore's house and the Baptist church. During the night of the shootings, three other blacks were arrested and taken to the courthouse. The next morning, they were found dead. By the time federal troops arrived several days later, about thirty black people had been killed. Many of the fatalities from the riot were buried in McLemore Cemetery. Aftermath During the riot, Mayor Sturgis hid in the attic of a boarding house (owned by his brother Theodore.) He did not emerge until reaching agreement that he could resign and leave town. The day after the riot, men approached and ordered him to return to the North. He agreed to leave that night on a northbound train at midnight; he was escorted safely to the train by a group of about 300 white men.McGehee, p. 64 Upon reaching New York City, he wrote an account of the events in a letter to the New York Daily Tribune: The letter was reprinted widely in the North, and fueled the debate over toughening the restrictions in the Ku Klux Klan Law under consideration. News of the riot angered the Radical Republicans in Congress, and hastened the passage of the law, known as the Enforcement Act. Mississippi Democrats attacked the Radical Republicans for using the riot as a partisan point. Gradually the situation in Meridian quieted down, but debate continued there and in Washington.McGehee, p. 76 On March 21, the state began an investigation of the riot, calling a total of 116 witnesses. The state indicted six men under charges of unlawful assembly and assault with intent to kill. Many black witnesses had credible information as to who shot whom, but most were too afraid to testify, as they feared losing their jobs, rights, or their lives. None of the men responsible for the riot was charged or brought to trial.McGehee, pp. 69–70 Two months later, a Congressional investigation re-examined the case but failed to identify the first shooter in the courthouse. The only person convicted of actions related to the riot was an Alabama KKK man charged with raping a black woman. =Effects= The Meridian riot highlighted the fact that blacks in the South were poorly armed, economically dependent on whites for jobs, and new to freedom; they had difficulty resisting violent attacks without federal help. By the mid-1870s, as war memories faded, Northern whites became tired of supporting the expensive programs to try to suppress the violence in the South and more inclined to let the states handle their own problems. Most Northerners viewed slavery as a moral wrong but did not necessarily believe in racial equality. They were discouraged by the continuing insurgency in much of the South. Whites resorted to force to suppress the opposition. With waning federal help, blacks had difficulty resisting white violence.McGehee, pp. 76–77 The riot marked the decline of Republican power and the waning of Reconstruction in this part of Mississippi. By 1875 in Mississippi, paramilitary insurgent groups, such as the Red Shirts and rifle leagues, described as \\"the military arm of the Democratic Party\\"George C. Rable, But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132 had arisen in the Klan's place. They worked openly to intimidate Republican voters, especially freedmen, and run officials out of office. The insurgents suppressed voting to achieve Democratic landslide victories in the 1875 state elections. By the late 1870s, the Democrats had completed their takeover in Mississippi and other former Confederate states. With control reestablished at the state government level, conservative Democrats passed electoral laws and constitutional amendments to restrict voting by freedmen and poor whites, resulting in their disfranchisement for decades. Mississippi was the first to pass such an amendment in 1890. Its surviving a United States Supreme Court review encouraged other Southern states to pass similar amendments, known as the \\"Mississippi Plan\\". State legislatures also passed Jim Crow laws, which established racial segregation in public facilities.McGehee, p. 77 The next few decades after the Meridian Riot saw a rise in lynchings and violence against blacks across the South, which accompanied their loss of civil rights and the fight for white supremacy. Mississippi would lead the region in racial violence and public support of it. While the rate of lynchings declined into the 20th century, blacks had little legal standing for recourse against abuses until their successes of the Civil Rights Movement and enforcement of their right to vote.

Administratively the Sierra Menera belongs to the Sierra de Albarracín, Jiloca and Comunidad de Teruel, comarcas of Aragon, as well as to the Province of Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha in its western side.Xiloca - Sierra Menera The Castle of Peracense rises atop an escarpment in the southern part of the range. The place known as Mirador de la Marajosa offers ample views of the surrounding landscape.Wikiloc: Minas Ojos Negros - Mirador de la Marajosa - Alto del Lobo There are aerogenerators on some of the Sierra Menera's ridges. Geography The main range is aligned in a NNW - SSE direction. It is not as high or conspicuous as other mountain ranges of the Iberian System. From the hydrographic point of view the Sierra Menera divides the Atlantic from the Mediterranean watershed. The eastern rivulets are tributaries of the Jiloca River, the western of the Tagus, and the northern have no exit, ending up in the Laguna de Gallocanta basin. Sierra Menera's highest point is the 1,601 m high summit known as Monte de San Ginés; another important peak is the 1591 m high Mojón Alto. History The Sierra Menera's name derives from the word for ore in Spanish language, for it has rich iron ore deposits that were exploited since ancient Celtiberian,Ojos Negros - yacimientos metalúrgicos - Celtiberia Histórica and later also during Roman times, well until the late 20th century.Agustín Ubieto Arteta, Toponimia aragonesa medieval, Valencia, 1972 A 200 km long railway line was built by the Compañía Minera de Sierra Menera S. A. in 1903 in order to bring the iron ore to the harbor of Sagunto. This was the longest private company-owned railway line in Europe. A blast furnace facility also belonging to the company was also located in Sagunto, where a pelletizing plant and a long jetty were built in the 1970s. The Sierra Menera range has been much scarred by environmentally unsound mining practices across the centuries. There are many tons of untreated debris and slag scattered across the range, contaminating the soil and the groundwater. Since mid 20th century, large-scale open-pit mining compounded matters, causing severe land degradation in vast mountain areas.Miguel Angel Dobón Pérez, Historia minera y conflicto ambientalel caso de Sierra Menera (Teruel), 1900-1931, 2004, The Sagunto ore-processing facilities, Altos Hornos del Mediterráneo S.A., ceased their activity in 1984 and the Sierra Menera mining company went bankrupt in 1987, following which the mines and their subsidiary facilities were closed.La Compañía Minera de Sierra Menera. Breve historia Massive unemployment hit the mining town of Ojos Negros after mining activity in the nearby mountains ceased. As a consequence its population went from 3000 in the 20th century to 560 in 2010. At the time of the closure of the mines there was no official regulation forcing the mining company to repair the environmental damage caused by its activity.Luis Diego Arribas, Contemporary Art and Opencast Mining, Revista de Humanidades, University of Zaragoza. 2009 The Spanish Mining Law relevant at the time didn't include a provision regarding environmental impact of mining activity when it was promulgated in 1973.Ley de Minas de 21 de Julio de 1973  See also  * Mountains of Aragon * Ojos Negros References External links * Rama aragonesa del Sistema Ibérico * Laguna de Almohaja * Sagunto *Antiguas minas de Ojos Negros * Vía Verde de Ojos Negros Menera Menera Menera Category:Mining in Spain ","title":"Sierra Menera"},{"id":"31983176","text":"John Broxholme (died 1647) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1640 to 1647.

A savings stamp is a stamp issued by a government or other body to enable small amounts of money to be saved over time to accumulate a larger capital sum. The funds accumulated may then be used to make a larger purchase such as taking out a savings bond or to pay a large upcoming bill. Often issued in conjunction with post office run savings banks, savings stamps have also been issued by private companies. Supermarkets have issued the stamps to enable the spreading of large bills, package holiday companies have used them to enable customers to save for an annual holiday, and utilities companies have used the stamps to enable customers to spread the cost of their bills. Savings stamps are not to be confused with trading stamps which provide a discount on goods purchased as part of a customer loyalty program.

Life =Early life= Albanian volunteers unit fighting against the Serbian army 1919-1920 Qazim Mulleti was born in \\"Sulejman Pasha\\" (Mulleti) neighborhood, in Tirana, Albania, Ottoman Empire on December 20, 1893. He had taken first studies in Monastir, continued at Zosimea gymnasium in Yannina, and later conducted studies at Galatasaray Mekteb-i Sultanisi in Istanbul, with the gold medal. He was a polyglot. Mulleti knew Turkish, Arabic, German, French, Italian, Latin, Greek, and Serbo-Croatian. He was fond of horseriding, ice skating, and collecting souvenirs – in his house he put aside one floor for the purpose of a mini museum. In 1912, along with many other Albanian students of that time, he participated in raising the Albanian flag in Tirana and Vlora (see Albanian Declaration of Independence). In 1914, he was one of four adjutants of Prince Wied. He followed Wied to Vienna, where he lived until 1920. There, with the direct support and intervention of the Austrian Major General Ignaz Trollmann, who covered the Balkan region, Mulleti followed additional studies in the field of military diplomacy of war, together with his future enemy Ahmet Zogu and others. He was selected as a member of the Albanian delegation (36 people) that met with Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria congratulating him for the rise in power. =Political activity= In 1920, Mulleti participated in the Congress of Lushnjë. The government that emerged from that Congress was initially prevented from entering Durrës, which was initially dedicated as the destination for the temporary exercise of its functions, as Congress had chosen Tirana as the new capital. With the intervention of his uncle Mytesim Këlliçi, as well as Abdi Toptani, Mulleti himself, and other delegates from Tirana, the government moved to Tirana. As many patriots opened their homes available to the new government in Tirana, Mulleti's house became the first Ministry of Agriculture. He protected in continuity the idea that Tirana should be the capital of Albania, being a better option than Durrës. (Tirana, de jure, became Albania's capital in 1925.) In September 1920 he was appointed the Commander of a Volunteer Force against Serbian Armies. From April 25 to May 3, 1921, he took part in the Congress for National Unity in Vlora, as a representative of Tirana's society \\"Vllaznia- Zgjimi\\" (English: Brotherhood - Awakening), along with Hafiz Ibrahim Dalliu and Musa Maçi as representatives of the other Society \\"Lidhja Kombëtare\\" (English: National League), and Avni Rustemi's society \\"Bashkimi\\" (English: Union). =Anti-Zogist activity and exile= He was prefect in the Dibër region during the governments of Sulejman Delvina and Fan Noli. After the failure of the June Revolution, he left Albania, first moving to Zara, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and later in Vienna, where he stayed as a political immigrant until 1931. Apparently, Mullati was a member of the \\"National Union\\" (), a union of Zog opponents in exile which was formed in Vienna (1925) with the initiative of Ali Këlcyra, Xhemal Bushati, Sejfi Vllamasi, etc. He would be arrested by Austrian authorities in 1931 together with Hasan Prishtina, Rexhep Mitrovica, Menduh Angoni, Luigj Shkurti, Sejfi Vllamasi, and Angjelin Suma as direct organizers of the failed attempt on Zogu, back then proclaimed King Zog I. The attackers were Aziz Çami and Ndok Gjeloshi. Zogu came unharmed, but Eqrem Libohova (1882–1948), who was with him, got wounded, and Zogu's guard Llesh Topallaj got killed. After the release, Mulleti would move to Paris together with Prishtina, Suma, Nikolla Ivanaj, and others. During this time he would receive monetary support from Italy. His name would come up again in a meeting of anti-Zogist diaspora including members of KONARE (founded by Noli), Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo () previously outlawed by Zogu, and other nationalist figures in exile. The initiative was triggered by the Revolt of 1935 in Fier against King Zog's regime and poverty. The meeting resulted in the formation of the \\"National Liberal League\\" (), but Mulleti together with Mustafa Kruja did not sign because of disagreements on the League's programme, allegedly fearing that the support from Italy would be stopped. =World War II and another exile= Qazim Mulleti in his office in Tirana Mulleti would return in Albania only after Zog's exile and the Italian invasion in April 1939. He was elected Mayor of Tirana (1939–1940). Certain well-known architectural objects in Tirana were initiation or given life while he was in office, i.e. Hotel Dajti, today's National Archeological Museum building, Academy of Arts building, Council of Ministers building (), etc. In 1941 got nominated Special Emissary for the Liberation of Albanian Territories of Kosovo and Debar area. In 1942, he became acting prefect of Tirana. His positioning during this time would be mixed. Mulleti would contribute in helping Hebrew families by providing them Albanian documentation, exploiting authority provided by an agreement between the Albanian Regency and Hermann Neubacher. He would also help even communists from Tirana region to flee persecution. At the same time, his name appears in several executive orders for the deportation or imprisonment of other anti-fascist elements and their families. The Tomori newspaper of Tirana, one of the main press-organs controlled by the Fascists, reported on August 5, 1942 that an assassination attempt was carried over towards Mulleti by an Albanian student named Pekmezi, apparently a communist of the \\"Youth\\" (Alb: Rinia) organization. Pekmezi hurled a bomb at Mulleti and his security escort. Two Italian officers were killed and Pekmezi himself was killed at spot by an Italian patrol. Enver Hoxha and the communist regime that followed until 1990 would address Mulleti as a traitor, agent, criminal, or the \\"bloody prefect\\". Today, his figure has been rehabilitated. =Family= While in Vienna, precisely in 1929, he married Hajrie Kusi. His son Reshit was the only child that came out of the marriage. The rest of the family moved back to Albania and will get reunited in 1939. Mulleti would leave Albania before the Communist Partisans took over leaving behind his wife and son another time. They suffered for 45 years in hard-labor concentration camps in Tepelenë, Savër, Gradisht, Porto Palermo, etc. Hajrie died in 1980, while he was in the concentration camp in Savër (Lushnjë) and suffering for years from Alzheimer. Mulleti died on August 28, 1956, in Vicolo delle Grotte, Rocca di Papa, near Rome. Representation in art Mulleti would be depicted in comedies during the Communist Era, based on a script of December 1948 by Besim Levonja (1922–1968). His personage would be brought to the public first by Mihal Popi, and later by Robert Ndrenika and others. Specifically Mihal Popi's performance would be remembered as the best in overall; the play would go on for 25 years. The best-known version would be \\"The Prefect\\" () of 1974, directed by Pirro Mani and adapted for TV screen by Vera Grabocka in 1976. Robert Ndrenika would take over the personage which would remain a symbol of the Albanian comedy. Though the comedy was a highly humorous masterpiece in the artistic point of view regardless who the actors were, it depicted Mulleti in a very different way from what he really was. Mulleti's character would be described with deep nuances of ottomanism, orientalism, and ignorance, as well as a deeply corrupted person, vengeful, and ungrateful beside others. Furthermore, since the first play in 1949, one of the first of the Albanian People's Theater (), his and his family members' real names would be used. Therefore, the comedy is described as a \\"combination of geniality and cruelty\\".

The area consists of mostly social housing estates near an ancient glacial valley known as the 'Glen River Park' (or the 'Glen Amenity Park', formerly 'Goulding's Glen'). The Glen recorded a population of 2,354 in the 2011 census. The Glen is within the Cork North-Central Dáil constituency.  History  =Geology= Looking eastwards at The Glen valley in 'Glen River Park'. The Glen River (obscured by foliage from this angle) runs parallel to the left of the footpath. During the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene periods it is believed that the River Lee valley was occupied by a glacier which melted and the water which sought an outlet created a ravine or glacial valley that now makes up what is known as 'Glen River Park', so named because the Glen River flows through the valley on an east-west axis, and joins the River Bride and the Kilnap River in the Blackpool Valley to form the Kiln River. =Gouldings= In the 1850s W. and H.M. Goulding built a large factory in The Glen that was used to make phosphate fertilizers and the area became known as 'Goulding's Glen'. The factory closed and was demolished in the mid-20th century and very little of it remains today. The land was donated to the people of Cork by Sir Basil Goulding in the late 1960s and was subsequently developed as an amenity park. =19th century railway tunnel= One of four ventilation shafts constructed c.1850 for a subterranean railway tunnel under The Glen. The adjacent metallic train sculpture was added c.2000 The Glen is also the location of a subterranean railway tunnel that was constructed from 1847 to 1855 to connect Mallow to Cork city. The tunnel had four ventilation shafts, all of which are still standing and two of these are located in The Glen. One is located in Arderin Way and the other can be found in Glentrasna Drive. =Early 20th century events= On Saturday, 11 December 1920, the day after martial law was proclaimed during the Irish War of Independence, a six-man IRA squad ambushed a convoy from K Company of the Auxiliary Division at 'Dillon's Cross', not far from Victoria Barracks (renamed Collins Barracks after independence) in Cork City. British forces sustained casualties of one dead and twelve wounded, while the IRA squad escaped unharmed. The usual route taken by military convoys to or from the barracks took them past Dillon's Cross. There was an old stone wall roughly 50 yards long running between Balmoral Terrace and the houses at the corner of the Cross. It was here that the members of A Company decided to lay their ambush. Behind the wall was a field known as 'O'Callaghan's Field', leading down to 'Gouldings Glen', which would provide an excellent escape route for the ambush party. Due to the proximity of Victoria Barracks - just a few hundred yards, the action would have to be quick. It was planned to stop the convoy of Auxiliaries, hurl bombs into the lorries, fire a quick volley of revolver shots and get away as rapidly as possible. Sean Healy a member of the ambush party, described their escape through The Glen after the attack was carried out: > It was now a case of every man for himself to try and make a safe getaway. > Under cover of darkness, and hugging the walls, we ran towards 'Goulding’s > Glen' and reached it in safety. A large stream ran through The Glen. This > was swollen by the winter rains. We crossed the bridge over the stream and > got away into the open country by Blackpool. I stayed at the house of Lt. D. > Duggan’s father that eventful night. Bloodhounds were used in the search but > all their efforts to trace us failed. Retaliation by the Auxiliaries resulted in the Burning of Cork. In his story \\"The Ugly Duckling\\", Irish playwright, novelist, and short-story writer Frank O'Connor writes of the relationship between a man and his home town. Here he describes his return to Cork city from Dublin: > Then, long after, he found himself alone in Cork, tidying up things after > the death of his father, his last relative there, and was suddenly plunged > back into the world of his childhood and youth, wandering like a ghost from > street to street, from pub to pub, from old friend to old friend, > resurrecting other ghosts in a mood that was half anguish, half delight. He > walked out to Blackpool and up 'Goulding's Glen' only to find that the big > mill pond had all dried up, and sat on the pond remembering winter days when > he was a child and the pond was full of skaters, and summer nights when it > was full of stars. His absorption in the familiar made him peculiarly > susceptible to the poetry of change. =Late 20th century housing developments= Most of the present housing estates in The Glen were built in the 1970s in an area to the south of the valley and generally consisted of three bedroom terraced houses (generally six per block) and a number of free standing flat blocks (two bedroom flats with 18 per block). Most of the flats were demolished or refurbished during the Glen Regeneration Project. Like most housing estates and urban areas developed on the outskirts of Irish cities in the 1960s and 1970s, the area was not equipped with adequate facilities for new families that had moved in, an issue that would later be rectified by a regeneration plan. Initial facilities developed with the housing estates include St Brendan's Church and two primary schools; St Mark's Boys National School and St Brendan's Girls School. The area is near Blackpool Shopping Centre and retail park which was developed during the 2000s.\\"£8m expansion planned for shopping centre\\". Irish Times, 17 February 1999. Retrieved 2020.  Regeneration  View across the Glen valley of new housing built during Phase I of the Glen Regeneration Project. During the 2000s, The Glen underwent significant changes as part of the Glen Regeneration Project. Phase I of the project which was completed in 2006 involved using new infill housing to occupy obscure areas and provide passive supervision of public space. A series of new, mainly single-storey terraced houses were used to form a coherent edge to the development where it meets the Glen amenity park, with the re-formed embankment to the park planted with native trees and shrubs in keeping with local biodiversity. Much needed community facilities were provided in the form of a day-care centre which overlooks the Glen Park. The centre is flanked by a care-taker's apartment, and opens onto a semi-private landscaped garden which is shared with a number of the residential units. Additional community facilities will be provided as part of subsequent phases of the Regeneration. One of the existing flat blocks was demolished and the other two refurbished to provide a mix of housing with private outdoor space and better security. Much of the unresolved public space was addressed by extending private space out to the existing road network, which allowed for new gardens and boundary walls as well as new driveways or parking bays to be provided to the existing houses. A new green space was created in the centre of the scheme. Phase II of the project commenced in October 2010. This phase of the project comprises the development of 59 new houses, and a substantial community facility adjacent to St Brendan's Church in the heart of the Glen. The community services centre will house a number of local educational, family and youth services when completed. This scheme builds on the substantial work undertaken in the first Phase of the Glen Regeneration where over 84 homes were upgraded and 80 new homes were provided at a cost of €26.5M. A new housing estate was developed in a large field in The Glen known as 'Susie's field'. The houses are now in areas known as Glentrasna Crescent & Glentrasna Avenue. The development commenced on site in January 2007 and was completed in July 2009. The scheme is housed on a 3 hectare / 7 acre site and comprises 109 housing units all of varying types and sizes. Units include 3 and 4 bed semi-detached houses, 2 bed sheltered houses, two and three bed apartments, duplex units as well as a Crèche. There are 26 dwellings, both 3 and 4 bed, allocated as Affordable type units. The layout of the scheme was dictated by the sloping nature of the site, which resulted in a terraced development from a North-Westerly to a South-Easterly direction. Many of the units have views of the City and of North Cork. Cork City Council collaborated with the Steiner Kindergarten to provide a preschool facility as part of the Susie's field development. Cork Military Graveyard, at the top of Assumption road and adjacent to the Susie's field development was converted into a small park with a playground for children in 2010. It is now called the Military Cemetery Park.  Glen River Park  View of 'Glen River Park'. The Glen River can be seen in addition to walkways and a large soccer pitch. A Cork City Council depot can also be seen in the background. Since the land (then known as Goulding's Glen) was gifted to the people of Cork in the 1960s, Cork City Council have developed the area as the Glen Amenity Park (Glen River Park) - with walkways, seating and plenty of green space in what is otherwise a totally urban setting. Care has been taken in the development of the Glen River Park to preserve the natural attractiveness of the area. The park is located in a deep steep-sided valley and includes a range of habitats that are of biodiversity value. At the heart of the site is one of the city's most diverse wetland areas which includes ponds, wet grassland, wet woodland and swampy areas of emergent vegetation including common reedmace, sweet-grass, canary reed-grass and common reed, providing a valuable refuge for birds, insects and other wildlife and of biodiversity value. Bird species which nest in the area include some that are restricted to wetland areas such as moorhen and reed bunting. Artificial lagoons created at the Glen are a feature of the park. The park also includes a soccer pitch and a Cork City Council depot. The park was at the centre of a controversy in 2002 and 2003 when some local politicians and environmental groups opposed a decision by An Bord Pleanála to permit a housing development in an area of the park known as 'Murphy's Quarry' which contained sandbanks used by sand martins as a nesting area. The development went ahead and is now known as Pynes Valley, Ballyvolane.  Road network and transport  The main road through The Glen to which all housing estates are connected is 'Glen Avenue'. The 1.2 km road commences at a junction with the 'North Ring Road' (R635) on the west and ends at a junction with 'Ballyhooly Road' (R614) in Dillon's Cross in the east. The main access routes to the city by vehicle are via the N20 (connected to the North Ring Road) and the R614 which encompasses the Ballyhooly Road and 'Summerhill North'. The Glen is primarily served by Bus Éireann route 7A. The route operates between the city centre and Glenthorn via The Glen, Blackpool Village and Dublin Hill. Buses depart hourly from Glenthorn between 8.25am and 6pm on Mondays to Saturdays.  Sport and leisure Glen Rovers GAA is located here just beyond the North Ring Road near Dublin Hill. The Glen Boxing Club is also located on the North Ring Road near Glen Avenue. The Glen Resource and Sports Centre which opened in March 2001 offers a range of activities, from six all- weather soccer pitches (two convertible to tennis courts) to the zip-line in addition to indoor activities such as yoga and karate classes. In 2014, the country's first publicly owned artificial ski slope opened in the centre. It is 30 m long, 5 m wide with a gradient of about 14%, consisting of an artificial all-weather perma-snow surface with an in-built pad underneath to absorb the shock of falls. Educational courses are also provided in the centre, some of which are run by University College Cork for adults continuing their education.

The following is the history of the U.S. Open Cup tournament. AFA Era The Fall River Rovers were among the few clubs to win both the National Challenge Cup and the American Cup. Before the creation of the United States Soccer Federation, soccer in the United States was organized on regional levels, with no governing body overlooking regional soccer leagues. The first non-league organizing body within the United States was the American Football Association (AFA) which was incarnated in 1884. The AFA sought to standardize rules for teams competing in northern New Jersey and southern New York. Within two years, this region began to widen to include teams in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Within a year of its founding, the AFA organized the first non- league cup in U.S. soccer history, known as the American Cup. Clubs from New Jersey and Massachusetts dominated the first twelve years. It would not be until 1897 that a club from outside those two states won the American Cup. Philadelphia Manz brought the title to Pennsylvania for the first time. Due to internal conflicts within the AFA, the cup was suspended in 1899, and it was not resumed until 1906. The conflicts within the AFA led to a movement to create a truly national body to oversee American soccer. Drawing on both its position as the oldest soccer organization and the status of the American Cup, the AFA argued that it should be the nationally recognized body. In October 1911, a competing body, the American Amateur Football Association (AAFA) was created. The association quickly spread outside of the Northeast and created its own cup in 1912, the American Amateur Football Association Cup. That year, both the AFA and AAFA applied for membership in FIFA, the international governing body for soccer. In 1913, the AAFA gained an edge over the AFA when several AFA organizations moved to the AAFA. On April 5, 1913, the AAFA reorganized as the United States Football Association, presently known as the United States Soccer Federation. FIFA quickly granted a provisional membership and USFA began exerting its influence on the sport. This led to the establishment of the National Challenge Cup that fall. The National Challenge Cup quickly grew to overshadow the American Cup. However, both cups were played simultaneously for the next ten years. Declining respect for the AFA led to the withdrawal of several associations from its cup in 1917. Further competition came in 1924 when USFA created the National Amateur Cup. That spelled the death knell for the American Cup. It played its last season in 1924. National Challenge Cup era Thomas Dewar and known as the \\"Dewar Cup\\". The competition dates back to 1914, when it was known as the National Challenge Cup. The actual tournament began play following FIFA sanctioning of the American Amateur Football Association (AAFA), which rebranded as United States Football Association (USFA). Following the provisional sanctioning of FIFA in 1913, USFA quickly attempted to earn full sanctioning with the creation of an official national cup competition, which was called the National Challenge Cup, the roots of the modern day Open Cup. In 1914, the USFA overlooked the inaugural National Challenge Cup. In the first final, the Brooklyn Field Club of Brooklyn, New York took on cross-borough rival Brooklyn Celtic. Played at Coates Field in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Field Club defeated Celtic 2–1 thanks to goals from Field Club's Adamson and Ford. In the first ever final, nearly 10,000 fans piled into Coates to watch the match. The winners of the tournament were awarded the Dewar Cup, donated by Sir Thomas Dewar for the promotion of soccer in America in 1912, until it was retired due to poor condition in 1979. It was brought back into use by the United States Adult Soccer Association in 1997, but went back on permanent display at the now closed National Soccer Hall of Fame in Oneonta, New York, and the recent winners of the tournament have been awarded a new, different trophy. Despite this change, the name of each winning club is still added to the base of the original Dewar Cup. = ASL Era = Throughout the latter part of the 1910s, the competition typically saw clubs from New York City or the New England- corridor make it to the finals, in which the clubs played in local regional leagues. However, with the creation of the American Soccer League, the competition became dominated by these ASL clubs, as well as clubs that played in the St. Louis Soccer League (STLSL). One of the first STLSL clubs to break through the domestic cup competition was Scullin Steel, who won the 1922 National Challenge Cup. While Scullins found success in the tournament, ASL clubs typically had more luck in the competition such as ASL titans Bethlehem Steel, Fall River Marksmen and Paterson F.C. = ASL vs. USFA conflicts = The Fall River Marksmen won the 1924, 1927, 1930 and 1931 editions of the Challenge Cup Towards the latter portions of the 1920s a period in American soccer known as the \\"American Soccer Wars\\" ignited. The Soccer Wars regarded the internal conflicts with the American Soccer League and their affiliated clubs participating in the National Challenge Cup. The debate involved whether the United States Football Association or the American Soccer League was the true chief organization of American soccer at the time, and consequently wrecked the reputation and possibly even the popularity of the sport domestically. The colloquial \\"war\\" has been considered responsible for the fall of the ASL, and the end to the first golden age of American soccer. The initial issue with the ASL had been the scheduling of the National Challenge Cup, which had been straining for the ASL season schedule. Typically, the National Challenge Cup had been played during the ASL's offseason, which made it difficult for ASL clubs to compete in the tournament. Consequently, the ASL boycotted the 1925 Challenge Cup due to scheduling conflicts, and the lack of cooperation the USFA inflicted on the ASL. American soccer historians claim that the real issue was the ASL vying to be the premier soccer body in the United States. In 1927, the issue intensified as ASL clubs were accused by FIFA for signing European players who were already under contract to European clubs. Due to the conflict and apparent corruption in the ASL, then USFA president, Andrew M. Brown traveled to Helsinki, Finland for the 1927 FIFA Congress in the hopes of removing any penalizations imposed on the ASL and USFA. Other issues regarding the soccer league involved the closed league model and the lack of American soccer players dominating the league. It resulted in ASL owners wanting to run their soccer clubs more like Major League Baseball teams, as many ASL owners owned MLB franchises. According to owners of ASL clubs, they saw these rulings as restrictions imposed on themselves, including the National Challenge Cup. With the hope of breaking away from the National Challenge Cup, Charles Stoneham, an owner of the New York Nationals proposed that the ASL would create their own tournament to determine the champion of the ASL, and thus ultimately determine the top American soccer club. This was the creation of early forms of playoffs culminating a regular season. Additionally, the proposal included expanding into the Midwest to include clubs from the Ohio River Valley and St. Louis regions, and create a new division for these clubs. Stoneham's plan involved having the two divisions compete in their own season, and the top clubs in each division playing in the ASL tournament to determine the ASL champion. Before the proposal, the National Challenge Cup was seen as the ultimate title in American soccer since most professional leagues in the United States focused on a specific region, rather than encompassing the entire country as a whole. = The \\"American Soccer Wars\\" = The problem with this system was the fact that the American Soccer League was operating under a closed league model with a fixed number of franchises. This new tournament, or playoffs, would permanently cap the number of clubs entering this premier competition, unlike the National Challenge Cup, which the tournament was open to any USFA- affiliated team. Due to such reasons, three teams, Bethlehem Steel, the New York Giants S.C. and the Newark Skeeters, rejected the proposal, played in the 1928 National Challenge Cup and were subsequently suspended from the league and fined $1,000. Because of the ASL's decision, the USFA suspended the ASL which ignited the \\"Soccer Wars\\".September 25, 1928 The Globe In the 1928–29 American Soccer League, the Steel, Giants and Skeeters did not play in the ASL and joined local semi-professional leagues agglomerating to form the Eastern Professional Soccer League. Support for the USFA from other national federations, along with financial disadvantages the ASL faced as an unsanctioned league, eventually convinced the ASL that it could not win this \\"soccer war\\" and should yield. The \\"war\\" between the USFA and ASL was finally settled in early October 1929. During that time the ASL had already begun its 1929–30 season, halted during the settlement. Thanks to the settlement, the ASL was reassembled, and played the remainder of the 1929–30-year under the moniker \\"Atlantic Coast League\\".November 4, 1929 The Globe = Great Depression and collapse of ASL I = Stix, Baer and Fuller, who were dominant in the Challenge Cup in the 1930s Just two weeks following the United States Football Association and American Soccer League settlement, the stock market crashed. The abrupt and intense economic impact drastically affected the ASL in the league's Spring 1930 season, in which several clubs defaulted during the season, and clubs did not finish the season with the same number of matches played. Initially, the struggles in ASL did not affect the league's stronger clubs, as the Fall River Marksmen completed the double by winning both the 1930 season and the 1930 National Challenge Cup. As the Great Depression intensified, the original ASL folded following the Fall 1932 season, which was its 15th season in existence. At the apex of the Depression, several surviving clubs created an incarnation of the ASL which began play in 1933, but the stringent economy lessened the ability of ASL teams to field strong teams, and thereby lacked the financial means nor interest to attract foreign players. This consequently caused a dark age of soccer in which the sport as well as the National Challenge Cup fell out of popularity and into obscurity. In spite of the decline in the sport's popularity, several pockets of the country, primarily the Heartland and New England regions, as well as the New York City and St. Louis metropolitan areas, continued to see excessive popularity of the sport, specifically with ethnic groups and expatriates. The popularity of soccer in these areas reflected on the Challenge Cup during the later Great Depression years, through the World War II years. Most clubs participating were either top amateur teams or semi-professional clubs that hoisted a handful of U.S. internationals, who worked part-time jobs. = World War II and ASL II = As World War II raged on, the National Challenge Cup continued to hold the annual tournament, in spite of several other European nations putting their domestic cups on hold. During the early 1940s, the competition was dominated by Northeastern clubs, particularly Brooklyn Hispano (titles in 1943 and 1944) and their cross-town rivals Brookhattan (title in 1945, finals appearance in 1948). Pawtucket F.C., Ponta Delgada S.C., and Morgan Strasser also made multiple finals appearances in the decade, each winning one title. Post War Era Trophy awarded to the Rochester Rhinos in 1999 With the fall of the First American Soccer League, and the declining number of professional clubs in the American Soccer League II, the competition began to be dominated by several amateur sides, particularly clubs that were based in inter-city areas. From the mid-1940s until the mid-1990s, the competition finals featured only amateur teams. In fact, the United States Soccer Football Association (USSFA) eventually gave primary control of the tournament to the United States Adult Soccer Association, which presently overlooks the fifth tier of American soccer. In spite of the rise of the North American Soccer League, NASL clubs declined to participate in the tournament, fearing it would divert interest away from the NASL Playoffs, and that playing a mix of minor league clubs and amateur clubs might also detract interest. = Inner City dominance = Throughout the post-war era, the National Cup was heavily dominated by clubs based in inner city urban cores, particularly in the New York City, Los Angeles and Philadelphia area. Beginning in 1959, these regions were the only areas that heralded a National Cup champion, until 1976 when SFAC of the San Francisco Bay Area won the National Cup. During the early to mid-1960s, the competition was heavily dominated between the Philadelphia Ukrainians and their expatriate counterparts, the New York Ukrainians. To some, this was considered a budding rivalry. The rivalry between Philadelphia and New York did not make its way to the National Cup Final, because of the Eastern vs. Western bracket set up, in which the final typically included a Mid-Atlantic or New Englander team, against a team from the Greater Los Angeles or San Francisco Bay Area of California. For both the Philadelphia and N.Y. Ukrainians, their domination came to an end with the rise of Cosmopolitan Soccer League juggernaut, Greek American Atlas, who won three National Cup titles consecutively, winning their first tile in 1967 against Orange County. The club's dynasty in the National Cup came to an end in the 1970 edition of the tournament, where they lost to eventual Cup runners-up Elizabeth S.C. in the semifinals. = LA v. NY finals = Towards the latter portion of the 1970s into the 1980s, the National Cup featured a final more times than not between soccer clubs based in New York and Los Angeles, the two largest metropolises in the United States. Two of the strongest clubs during this time included the New York Pancyprian-Freedoms, who won three domestic titles between 1979 and 1982, and Maccabi Los Angeles who made it to the National Cup finals seven times in nine years, from 1975 to 1984. In fact, the two teams met twice in the National Cup finals; in 1980 and 1982 with the Pancyprian- Freedoms defeating Maccabi both times. MLS Era Chicago's Soldier Field hosted the 1998 final, making it the first time in 60 years the final was played in the stadium. The 1998 final had the first five figure attendance since the ASL era of soccer. Starting in 1995, professional clubs would retain their USSF sanctioning if their clubs agreed to participate in the tournament. The 1995 U.S. Open Cup featured a mix of amateur and professional teams, making it the first time in nearly 45 years that the two levels were integrated into Open Cup play. The arrival of professional clubs on the scene dwarfed amateur clubs, and consequently, no amateur club has won or been to the Open Cup final in the MLS era. With the arrival of Major League Soccer in 1996, MLS franchises had the option to participate in the tournament on their terms. However, in 2006, all MLS franchises that were based in the United States had to participate in the tournament propers. Ever since the creation of MLS, an MLS club has won the Open Cup every year except 1999, when the Rochester Rhinos of the A-League defeated the Colorado Rapids. The most successful MLS clubs in Open Cup play are the Chicago Fire and the Seattle Sounders, who have accumulated four domestic titles in their existence. The four titles puts the Fire and the Sounders in a seven-way tie for the second most Open Cup titles won. = Competition rebranded = In 1998, the United States Soccer Federation passed a notion to rebrand the tournament as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup in honor of Lamar Hunt, who has been considered by many as one of the greatest patrons for the growth and development of professional American soccer. Hunt, who owned three MLS clubs at the time, was a key cog in creating MLS and its predecessors, the North American Soccer League and United Soccer Association. The tournament starting in 1999 was known as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup and has been called that since. = Resurgence in popularity = For most of MLS' existence, league clubs could not draw the same crowds for Open Cup matches as they would for the regular season or playoff matches. Some of it is attributed to the fact that MLS clubs typically play a majority of their matches against lower tier clubs which may create a lack of interest. Additionally, all Open Cup matches are scheduled mid-week, which can be inconvenient for fans and supporters. Often, it is considered that the MLS team that wins the Open Cup is one with great depth on their roster, or one that has nothing much to play for in league competition. The fact that there is a lesser amount of interest in the competition leads most MLS clubs to play their home Open Cup games at smaller stadiums, usually high school or smaller college football fields or on their training facilities due to the lower seating capacity, and to create a more \\"intimate\\" setting. Examples include the Seattle Sounders who play their Open Cup matches at Starfire Sports Complex or D.C. United who play their games at Maryland SoccerPlex or George Mason Stadium. The Emerald City Supporters, a supporters' group of Seattle Sounders FC display a tifo prior to kickoff of the 2010 U.S. Open Cup final. To date, the 2010 final had the highest attendance in Open Cup history. In spite of the disinterest in the Open Cup, some signs have indicated an upswing in the tournament importance and popularity. Some cite the competitions' long history as a critical factor in driving interest. The 2009 final, which featured storied MLS club D.C. United, saw a crowd of 17,239 attend the Open Cup final at RFK Stadium, making it the second largest Open Cup crowd in the 2000s and fifth largest overall. The reasoning behind the large crowd has been attributed to the fact that D.C. United's management marketed the Open Cup as a tournament for the team to add an additional trophy to their collection and earn a preliminary berth in the CONCACAF Champions League. For the Seattle Sounders, the club played in and hosted the 2010 edition of the final, in front of a crowd of 31,311. It was the largest attendance for an Open Cup final thus far, outpacing the second largest crowd by slightly under 10,000. Such a crowd was considered to be the result of the Sounders' large fan base and desire to defend their 2009 Open Cup title. This trend of large crowds has continued, with all six finals since and including the 2009 final in the top nine overall in terms of attendance, including another record-breaking crowd in 2011, also in Seattle. = Format changes = For the 2015 tournament, USSF announced that starting with the round of 16 they will use a fixed bracket. In the past, the bracket has been redrawn after each round to match regional teams against each other to save travel expenses. Now, in the round of 16, they will draw teams to a regional quarter of the bracket that will remain locked through the end of the tournament. The only exception is that no two teams from the same ownership group can play each other until the final. Since 2016, this scenario can only occur if at least one of the commonly owned clubs is amateur. Through 2015, the amateur clubs have decided how to qualify their teams based on the number of allocated spots provided by USSF. The USSF has now announced that starting with the 2016 tournament, the organization (USSF) will organize and control amateur qualifying. Qualifying will be completed in the fall of the previous year. This will not affect the upper division teams. Also from 2016 forward, lower- division professional clubs that are owned by higher-division professional clubs, or whose playing staff is managed by a higher-division professional club, have been barred from the competition.

Washington Government Printing Office, 1919. Geology The island of Ivuhos consists entirely of coral limestone rising in steep cliffs to a height of over . These surround the island, except on the eastern side where the land rises gently from the fringe of sand dunes and small ponds around the shore, in contrast to the agglomerate cliffs of the island of Sabtang less than distant. The surface of Ibujos is gently rolling, but without any streams or definite stream valleys. This condition is partly due to the solubility of the rock which allows water to run off in underground channels, but it is also in large part an effect of the recent date of the uplift which formed the island, which has not allowed sufficient time for the streams to form valleys.

Diagnosis Members of the Intejocerida are typically straight shelled with large siphuncles that vary in position from ventral to central, in which septal necks from very short to holochoantic and connecting rings from moderately thick to apparently thin. Common to all, and the character by which the order was defined, are deposits within the siphuncle that have been described as longitudinal, radially arranged, calcareous lamellae. Taxonomy = Taxonomic relations = Flower (1976) pointed out that not only does the Intejocerida contain two groups, one with Intejoceras and Bajkaloceras with central siphuncles, the other with Envencoceras, Padunoceras, and a third genus Rossoceras, but that combining it with the Endocerida in the Endoceratoidea, makes the latter polyphyletic and therefore an invalid taxon. = Derivation = Intejoceras and Bajkaloceras can be reasonably derived from the Baltoceratidae or less likely from the Troedssonellidae. Evencoceras, Rossoceras, and Padunoceras have their probable origin in the Proterocameroceratidae and are retained with the endocerids. References * Flower, R.H. 1976.

It was the first sound film in the Soviet Union, and the first to be win a Best Director award at any film festival.  Plot summary  In Moscow operates one of the countless gangs of street kids - Zhigan's gang. The boys who belong to it have been living on the street for a long time. In December 1923 police forces conduct a raid, and catch about a thousand homeless children. Almost all of them are distributed to orphanages. But there are several dozen minors who run away from all the orphanages to which they are sent. For example, Mustafa has escaped 8 times and had to be returned 15 times by the authorities. What is one supposed to do with them? This leads to a decision to send them over to a house of correction, that is, a prison for minors. Sergeev offers another solution: to create a labor commune. The children will work as carpenters, shoemakers, carpenters, remain free citizens, they will feed themselves. But not with theft, instead with work ... Good intentions as always, are good only in theory. In practice, the former street kids do not immediately become honest hard workers ...

The arrival of street children in the labor commune, as well as scenes of street rebellion, were all filmed in the village of Kolomenskoye. The Church of the Ascension in Kolomenskoye is also shown in the film. This is the first appearance in film of actors Rina Zelyonaya and Georgiy Zhzhonov. Old residents of the city of Dzerzhinsk (Lyuberetsky District) believe that the film tells the story of a labor commune located in the area of the Ugresha Monastery. They say that at Lyubertsy Dzerzhinsky on a single-track is a place where Zhigan killed Mustafa.  Awards  The film's director Nikolai Ekk was named as the best director by a poll of viewers of the 1st Venice International Film Festival (1932).  Legacy  While Genrikh Yagoda served as a comissar, Bolshevskaya commune being dedicated to him brought it certain advantages. After the arrest Genrikh Yagoda in April 1937, the commune was broken and dispersed, Matvei Pogrebinsky shot himself, his books (\\"Factory of people\\", edited under Maxim Gorky, and others) were removed from libraries and destroyed. However, the film, due to its high international acclaim, was not withdrawn from circulation, but all mention of the commune itself were excised from the footage.

Lewis Carroll was a children’s author, mathematician, and clergyman. He had a stammer that was said to have affected his job. The 1861 census shows that Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was staying at Ore House in 1861 and being treated by Dr Hunt a psellismolligist. Since his book was published in 1865 it is quite possible that some of it was written during his stay. His other main interest was in anthropology and in 1863 he established the Anthropological Society of London, which after his death merged with the more established Ethnological Society of London to become the Royal Anthropological Institute. Career James Hunt was born in Swanage, Dorset, the son of the speech therapist Thomas Hunt (1802–1851) and his wife Mary. He was trained by his father in the art of curing stuttering by means of breath exercises, muscle control and building the patient's confidence. He bought a doctorate from the University of Giessen in Germany and set up a practice in 1856 in Regent Street, London. He dedicated his first Manual on the subject to Charles Kingsley who spent three weeks with him in 1859. He moved to Hastings where ran residential courses during the summer season with his sister Elizabeth's husband, Rev. Henry F. Rivers. Anthropology In 1854 he joined the Ethnological Society of London because of his interest in racial differences and from 1859 to 1862 was the honorary secretary. However many members of this society disliked his attacks on humanitarian and missionary societies and the anti-slavery movement. George W. Stocking, Jr., Victorian Anthropology, New York, The Free Press, 1991 (1987), p. 247. So in 1863 with the help of the explorer Richard Burton he set up the Anthropological Society of London, becoming its first president. His paper The Negro's place in nature was greeted with boos and hisses when given at the British Association meeting in 1863 because of its defence of slavery in the Confederate States of America and belief in the plurality of the human species. He established the Anthropological Review as the organ of the society and by 1867 the membership of the Society had reached 500. However, by 1867 allegations by one of the members Hyde Clarke of financial irregularities in his running of the society caused his temporary resignation as president, though he returned in 1868 when Clarke was expelled. This took a toll on his health and in 1869 he died of an inflammation of the brain. The society shortly afterwards started discussions to merge with the Ethnological Society. He left a widow, Henrietta, and five children and left his books to his nephew W.H.R. Rivers who refused them, though, through unconnected means, he later became an anthropologist himself.

Although the amount of the payment depends on a number of factors, it usually matches an employee's monthly salary and can be paid in one or more installments (depending on country).  History  Early information about a thirteenth salary came from the Philippines in December 1975, where there was a problem with updating the minimum wage. The minimum wage had not been raised for five years, and no longer matched the cost of living. Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos created a law paying a thirteenth salary to improve the situation. It paid a bonus to workers, which could be saved or spent. Compensation based on annual work was paid in addition to the basic salary on the basis of the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on October 4, 1965 (\\"On improving planning and enhancing economic incentives for industrial production\\"). Paid from the material incentive fund, the amount of funds was determined by the administration in conjunction with the Central Committee. If a company fulfilled (or exceeded) annual plans for the sale of products (or profits) and estimated profitability, the thirteenth salary could be paid from funds earmarked in the budget and other cash reserves. If a company did not meet the targets, a reduced amount was paid.  Details  A number of countries followed the Philippines, enacting similar thirteenth-salary laws, and some have passed laws about fourteenth- and fifteenth-month pay. Some regions have a compulsory fourteenth salary. Brazil has a mandatory fourteenth-month salary, which is treated as a holiday bonus. The payment varies by country. Some have one payment at the end of the year, and others pay in two installments: one in the first half of the year, and the second at the end. This could motivate people to travel or otherwise enjoy summer holidays. Corporations which fail to make the payments may be fined.  Taxation  The thirteenth salary is normally tax-exempt, although some countries have restrictions; if the payment exceeds one month's salary, it could be taxable.  Computation  The thirteenth salary is most frequently expressed as a one month's salary, or one-twelfth of the annual salary. Not all workers are guaranteed this amount, however; in Mexico, most people receive at least 15 days' wages.  Europe  = Mandatory = * Armenia: paid before the New Year holidays * Greece: 14th- month and holiday bonuses are paid on Christmas, Easter, and summer vacation * Portugal: paid by December 15th * Spain: mandatory 14th-month bonuses (pagas extraordinarias) paid in summer and at Christmas. They can be prorated into the twelve monthly salaries. = Customary = * Austria: End of June; a 14th- month bonus is paid at the end of November. * Belgium: Paid at the end of the year; mandatory holiday bonus * Croatia: Paid at Christmas or Easter * Czech Republic, France, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Switzerland: Paid at the end of the year * Finland, Germany: Paid before Christmas * Italy: customary 14th-month bonus, both paid in December * Netherlands: paid in November or December  Germany  In Germany, a legal distinction is made between a thirteenth salary and a Christmas bonus; in most other countries, the terms are used interchangeably. The Christmas bonus (usually paid with the November salary) is intended to pay additional holiday expenses and retain employees. The thirteenth salary is paid by an employer for ongoing work at the end of a calendar year. An employee is entitled to a prorated thirteenth salary if they leave their employer before the end of the calendar year, unless the parties to the employment contract have agreed otherwise. Special payments for regular work performance (a requirement fulfilled by the thirteenth salary, and the Christmas bonus in certain cases) can be counted towards the minimum wage. For example, a person works full-time and earns per hour until a minimum wage of €8.50 per hour is introduced. Their employment contract stipulates that they are entitled to a half-month Christmas bonus and an annual holiday payment, totaling one month's salary. To meet the minimum wage of €8.50 (required by law in Germany since January 2015), the employer consolidates the holiday payment and Christmas bonus and pays one-twelfth of the amount to the employee every month. The employee's hourly wage would increase to €8.69, meeting the minimum wage. The Christmas bonus is part of the other-remuneration category, in accordance with §39b Abs. 3 of the EStG. The Christmas tax allowance was abolished with the Tax Reform Act of July 25, 1988. Since July 2008, federal officials have no longer received Christmas bonuses; the special payments (Christmas and holiday bonuses), amounting to five percent of the annual salary, were integrated into the officials' base salary.  Switzerland  Most Swiss employers pay their employees' annual salary in 13 instalments, rather than 12. An employee usually receives two months' salary in December, which helps pay end-of-year and holiday bills. Sometimes they receive half in July and half in December, however, similar to Germany's Christmas bonus and holiday payment. The thirteenth monthly salary is not a bonus, but a delayed payment. Whether or not a thirteenth salary is paid is part of an employment contract; some companies pay a higher monthly salary instead of the additional payment. In the first and last years of employment, the thirteenth salary is prorated for partial years. Some employers pay an additional annual bonus based on employee performance or employer profits. When an employee pays direct income tax and the 13th month's salary and bonus are paid in the same month, a higher tax rate is paid.  Latin America  In Latin America, the thirteenth salary is commonly known as aguinaldo or prima in Spanish (bonus). = Mandatory = * Argentina: two equal instalments, by June 30 and December 18 * Bolivia: tax-free, up to one month’s wages. A 14th-month bonus is mandatory as a holiday bonus if the GDP is over 4.5 percent. * Brazil: paid in two equal parts, by November 30 and by December 20. A mandatory 14th-month bonus is a holiday bonus. It is one-twelfth of the wage paid in December per month worked previously (if the worker was hired less than one year ago), or equal to the December wage.Law 4090, of 13 July 1962.Law 4749, of 12 August 1965 * Colombia: two halves, paid during the first 15 days of June and the first 20 days of December * Costa Rica: paid during the first 20 days of December * Dominican Republic, Mexico: paid by December 20 * Ecuador: A mandatory 14th-month bonus is paid in parts or in a lump sum. * El Salvador: Christmas bonus, based on years of service * Guatemala: paid at mid-year.

It follows that the restriction Z\\\\vert_Q\\\\, to Q splits into a tangent vector field Z_K\\\\, on Q and a transverse vector field Z_G,\\\\, being a section of the vector bundle \\\\mathcal M(Q)\\\\to Q.\\\\, Definition Let \\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M)\\\\to M be the oriented orthonormal frame bundle of an oriented n-dimensional Riemannian manifold M with given metric g\\\\,. This is a principal {\\\\mathrm S\\\\mathrm O}(n)\\\\,-subbundle of \\\\mathrm FM\\\\,, the tangent frame bundle of linear frames over M with structure group {\\\\mathrm G\\\\mathrm L}(n,\\\\mathbb R)\\\\,. By definition, one may say that we are given with a classical reductive {\\\\mathrm S\\\\mathrm O}(n)\\\\,-structure. The special orthogonal group {\\\\mathrm S\\\\mathrm O}(n)\\\\, is a reductive Lie subgroup of {\\\\mathrm G\\\\mathrm L}(n,\\\\mathbb R)\\\\,. In fact, there exists a direct sum decomposition \\\\mathfrak{gl}(n)=\\\\mathfrak{so}(n)\\\\oplus \\\\mathfrak{m}\\\\,, where \\\\mathfrak{gl}(n)\\\\, is the Lie algebra of {\\\\mathrm G\\\\mathrm L}(n,\\\\mathbb R)\\\\,, \\\\mathfrak{so}(n)\\\\, is the Lie algebra of {\\\\mathrm S\\\\mathrm O}(n)\\\\,, and \\\\mathfrak{m}\\\\, is the \\\\mathrm{Ad}_{\\\\mathrm S\\\\mathrm O}\\\\,-invariant vector subspace of symmetric matrices, i.e. \\\\mathrm{Ad}_{a}\\\\mathfrak{m}\\\\subset\\\\mathfrak{m}\\\\, for all a\\\\in{\\\\mathrm S\\\\mathrm O}(n)\\\\,. Let i_{\\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M)} \\\\colon \\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M)\\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathrm FM be the canonical embedding. One then can prove that there exists a canonical Kosmann decomposition of the pullback bundle i^{\\\\ast}_{\\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M)}(T\\\\mathrm FM) \\\\to \\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M) such that :i^{\\\\ast}_{\\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M)}(T\\\\mathrm FM)=T\\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M)\\\\oplus \\\\mathcal M(\\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M))\\\\,, i.e., at each u\\\\in \\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M) one has T_u\\\\mathrm FM=T_u \\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M)\\\\oplus \\\\mathcal M_u\\\\,, \\\\mathcal M_{u} being the fiber over u of the subbundle \\\\mathcal M(\\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M))\\\\to \\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M) of i^{\\\\ast}_{\\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M)}(V\\\\mathrm FM) \\\\to \\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M). Here, V\\\\mathrm FM\\\\, is the vertical subbundle of T\\\\mathrm FM\\\\, and at each u\\\\in \\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M) the fiber \\\\mathcal M_{u} is isomorphic to the vector space of symmetric matrices \\\\mathfrak{m}. From the above canonical and equivariant decomposition, it follows that the restriction Z\\\\vert_{\\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M)} of an {\\\\mathrm G\\\\mathrm L}(n,\\\\mathbb R)-invariant vector field Z\\\\, on \\\\mathrm FM to \\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M) splits into a {\\\\mathrm S\\\\mathrm O}(n)-invariant vector field Z_{K}\\\\, on \\\\mathrm F_{SO}(M), called the Kosmann vector field associated with Z\\\\,, and a transverse vector field Z_{G}\\\\,.

Since April 2016, he has been the leader of the Socialist Party. Life and times Bonfatti was born in Rosario in 1950. He enrolled at the National University of Rosario and was accepted into the School of Medicine. There, he developed an interest in politics, and in 1972, co-founded the Popular Socialist Party with activists Guillermo Estévez Boero and Hermes Binner. He earned a Medical Degree in 1974, and for the next two years, worked with Binner in a slum clinic outside Rosario. The March 1976 coup prompted him to relocate to Las Parejas, a small town west of Rosario. He would remain in Las Parejas, working as a physician in a provincial SAMCo clinic and for the Steelworkers' Union in the field of occupational medicine. Upon the return of democracy in 1983, he was elected Mayor. Bonfatti's term expired in 1989, at which time he was elected to the City Council for a four-year term. He maintained his medical practice during his tenure as mayor and councilman, and in 1993 earned a postgraduate degree in healthcare administration. The election of Hermes Binner as Mayor of Rosario in 1995 was followed by Bonfatti's appointment as Municipal Secretary of Public Health. He was named Secretary of Government by Mayor Binner in 1997 and remained in the post until the end of Binner's term in 2003, when Bonfatti was elected to the Provincial Legislature. His entry into the legislature coincided with Binner's election as governor, and the Socialist Party caucus elected Bonfatti as its leader. Governor Binner, who was re-elected in 2007, appointed Bonfatti Minister of Government and State Reform. Bonfatti streamlined the bureaucratic and electoral process in the province during his tenure, and was endorsed by Binner as candidate for governor in 2011 on the Progressive, Civic, and Social Front, whose nomination he sought without opposition. He was elected governor on July 24 with nearly 40% of the vote; followed by Republican Proposal candidate, actor Miguel del Sel, with 36%; and Congressman Agustín Rossi of the FpV, with 23%.

Almario (30 August 1886 – 11 March 1933) was a prominent Filipino writer in the Tagalog language. He was a respected journalist, editor, nationalist, politician, newspaper manager, and a proponent of anti-graft practices. Almario's works revealed his inclination to nationalism, revolutionary ideas, tradition, and customs. He supported the development of writing literature using Tagalog and the other languages of the Philippines. As a writer, Almario used pen names such as R.O. Noel, Batang Simoun, Matanglawin, Ric A. Clarin, Raxa Soliman, Petronio, and El Satirin. Family Born in Tondo, Manila, Almario was the third among nine children. He was the son of Estanislao Almario and Rosalia Cagne. Estanislao Almario was a cabeza de barangay (barangay captain or head of the barrio) who once served as a clerk in the Spanish military, while Rosalia Cagne was a seamstress. Almario’s father died when Almario was only around ten years of age. He married Leonor de Ocampo, with whom Almario had five children, namely the twins Generoso and Amalia, Bonifacio, Liwayway, and Simoun. Generoso Almario was a lawyer and Simoun Almario had an executive position at a local radio station. Education He was taught by two teachers during his childhood. One was by the teacher known as \\"Maestro Sevilla\\". The other teacher was Eugenio de Lara. De Lara was a lawyer and a Tondo school supervisor who taught Almario elementary Latin. Almario studied the Spanish language and the English language at the Liceo de Manila. He wanted to become a lawyer but was not able to complete his studies for the degree. Career =Political career= Almario worked for the Bazar Siglo XX, a place owned by Luis R. Yangco. After passing the second-grade civil service examination, Almario began working as a clerk at the Bureau of Education on 10 August 1904. By 6 July 1909, he started working for the Bureau of Prisons, and then moved to the Bureau of Posts on 18 January 1911. He became chief of the Office of the Mayor in Manila on 1 August 1918. In 1919, Almario became the assistant secretary of Mayor Justo Lukban. On 6 July 1920, Almario became the secretary of Mayor Ramon Fernandez. Apart from being Mayor Fernandez's secretary, Almario acted as the supervisor of Manila's reformatories, asylums, and playgrounds. Both Fernandez and Almario resigned, as a sign of protest, upon the reinstatement of Governor-General Leonard Wood to the secret service of the City of Manila. He won a seat for the City Council of Manila in 1925. Although a known graft-buster, Almario was convicted for libel and was exiled to Lolomboy, Bulacan in February 1927. The case made him a popular figure among the masses. In 1928, he won the City Council elections in Manila. In 1930, Almario became president of the City Council of Manila. =Literary career= Almario was the editor of Pagkakaisa, a daily newspaper. He later became the general manager of the La Opinion newspaper. Among his works as a writer was the Tagalog-language essay Ano ang Ligaya sa Ibabaw ng Lupa? (What is Happiness on the Surface of the Earth?) written in 1907 and the award-winning Spanish-language essay Que Es Pueblo (What is [a] Town).

It used to be part of the former municipality of Belčišta. Geography and Location There are three villages named Slatino in North Macedonia, one in Tetovo, one in Brodsky, and one in Debarca. Slantino village is located in Debarca, on the eastern slopes of Ilinska Mountain. , which got its name from the village, sits to the south, supplying the Slatina River. Slatino is considered a hilly region. Slatino Village History The oldest written record of the villagers is the \\"Verbose census defter the Sandzak of Ohrid\\" written in 1582, which tallied the population of Slatino at 327 residents, all Christians. According to the researcher Milivoj Kosteski, in 1953 Slatino had 1,016 people living in it. Since then, the population has steadily declined, today having about 100 residents. Slatino has historically been a poor mountain village, with immigrant workers leaving the village for work abroad well into the second half of the 19th century. Most migrant workers left in the spring for Wallachia, Serbia and Bulgaria, and returned in the fall. The largest wave of emigration affected the village from 1909 to 1912 when passenger ships opened transport to Canada and Argentina. Those that immigrated to Canada later left for Australia due to lack of work. The second great wave of emigration lasted from 1960 to 1970, though emigration continues to this day. Current migrant workers bring with them and their families to Australia, where today over 120 families make their home. Several families now work in the Iron Grinvil and Port Kembla. In the village there are two churches, both of which were built in the 19th century as a monastery. The High Church \\"Holy Mother\\" was secretly built, as there was no permit for its construction available. It was painted after the Ilinden Uprising in 1912 by brothers Dimitri Mijak and George Colak. The lower church is called \\"Old Saint weeks.\\" Work began on the lower church in 1808, and was completed in 1858. The monastery of St. John the Baptist is also thought to have been built nearby. 127 villagers participated in World War II, of which seven were killed and nine wounded. There is a memorial at the village entrance. Demographics According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 161 inhabitants. Ethnic groups in the village include:Macedonian Census (2002), Book 5 - Total population according to the Ethnic Affiliation, Mother Tongue and Religion, The State Statistical Office, Skopje, 2002, p. 68. *Macedonians 160 *Others 1 Government and Politics Currently the village falls within the expanded Municipality of Debarca, which was created after the former municipalities Belcista and Meseista merged during the new territorial division of Macedonia in 2006. From 1996-2006, the village was within the former Municipality Belcista. The villages has gone through several reclassifications through the past century, from 1965 to 1996, the village was located within the municipality of Ohrid, and until 1965 the village was part of the former Municipality Belcista, while from 1952 to 1955, the village was contained within the Municipality Izdeglavje, which also containted the villages of Slatina, Izdeglavje, Ozdoleni, Slatinski Chiflik and Soshani. For a short time, 1950-1952, the village was part of the former municipality Slatina Chiflik, which also contained the villages Izdeglavje, Ozdoleni, Slatina, Slatina Chiflik and Soshani.

Housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it shows Luke the Evangelist, patron saint of artists, sketching the Virgin Mary as she nurses the Child Jesus. The figures are positioned in a bourgeois interior which leads out towards a courtyard, river, town and landscape. The enclosed garden, illusionistic carvings of Adam and Eve on the arms of Mary's throne, and attributes of St Luke are amongst the painting's many iconographic symbols. Van der Weyden was strongly influenced by Jan van Eyck, and the painting is very similar to the earlier Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, usually dated to around 1434, with significant differences. The figure's positioning and colourisation are reversed, and Luke takes centre stage; his face is accepted as van der Weyden's self-portrait. Three near contemporary versions are in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Groeningemuseum, Bruges.van Calster (2003), 465 The Boston panel is widely considered the original from underdrawings that are both heavily reworked and absent in other versions. It is in relatively poor condition, having suffered considerable damage, which remains despite extensive restoration and cleaning. The painting's historical significance rests both on the skill behind the design and its merging of earthly and divine realms. By positioning himself in the same space as the Madonna, and showing a painter in the act of portrayal, Van der Weyden brings to the fore the role of artistic creativity in 15th-century society. The panel became widely influential with near copies by the Master of the Legend of Saint Ursula and Hugo van der Goes.

Groeningemuseum, Bruges There are no surviving contemporary archival documents for Rogier van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, but art historians agree that it was almost certainly painted for the Brussels painters' guild, for their chapel at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula,van Calster (2003), 465 where van der Weyden is buried.\\"Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin \\". Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Retrieved 27 December 2014 It may have been commissioned to celebrate the artist's appointment as city painter for Brussels. Luke the Evangelist was thought to have been a portraitist, and Northern European painters' guilds were considered to be under his protection.Bauman (1986), 5 In the 15th-century images of Luke painting the Virgin were more commonly found in Northern rather than Italian art.Smith (2004), 16 Luke was credited with painting the original of the immensely popular Italo-Byzantine Cambrai Madonna, to which numerous miracles were attributed.Ainsworth (1998), 104 The original of that work was taken to France from Rome in 1440, and within four years at least 15 high quality copies had been made.Harbison (1995), 102 It was regarded as an example of St Luke's skill, and contemporary painters strove to emulate him in their depictions of Mary. Popular belief held that the essence of the Virgin was captured in Luke's portrait of her.Ainsworth (1998), 139 After van Eyck Van der Weyden closely follows van Eyck's c. 1435 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, though there are significant differences. The landscape in the van der Weyden is less detailed, and its top gives less of an illusion of openness than van Eyck's. The most obvious similarity is the two figures standing at a bridge, who may not carry specific identities;Campbell (2004), 54 those in the van der Weyden are sometimes identified as Joachim and Anne, the Virgin's parents. In van Eyck's painting the right hand figure wears a red turban, a motif widely accepted as that artist's indicator of a self-portrait; similar images can be found on the London Portrait of a Man and the reflection in the knight's shield in the Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele, Bruges.Ridderbos et al. (2005), 68 Jan van Eyck, Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, c. 1435. Louvre, Paris Van der Weyden reverses the positioning of the main figures; the Virgin appears to the left,Campbell (2004), 21 a positioning that became predominant in later Netherlandish diptychs. The colours in this work are warmer than those in the van Eyck. Van der Weyden switches the colours of their costumes; Luke is dressed in red or scarlet, Mary in the more typical warm blues. The Virgin type has further been changed, here she is depicted as a Maria Lactans (\\"Nursing Madonna\\"). This is one of the standard depictions of her, different from the Hodegetria (Our Lady of the Way, or She who points the way) Virgin type most usually associated with Byzantine and Northern 15th-century depictions of St Luke. This depiction of Mary's motherhood stresses the \\"redemption of mankind by Christ as human ... [and] spiritual nourishing\\".de Vries, Annette. \\"Picturing the Intermediary. Artistic Consciousness in Representations of Saint Luke Painting the Virgin in Netherlandish Art: The Case of Van der Weyden's Saint Luke \\". Historians of Netherlandish Art, 2006. Retrieved 27 December 2014 Description The panel contains four individual pieces of oak, painted over a chalk ground bound with glue.Newman (1997), 135 The preparation wood is dated to around 1410, giving an estimated date for the Van der Weyden in the mid-1430s. The dominant pigments are lead white (often used in the panel to highlight blue and green passages), charcoal black, ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, verdigris and red lake.Newman (1997), 136 There has been some discolouration – some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.Newman (1997), 142 The folds in Mary's dress Mary sits under a brocade canopy or cloth of honour, painted in brown hues which have since discoloured to dark green.Newman (1997), 1423 The canopy hangs down to a wooden bench attached to the wall behind her.Borchert (1997), 64 Mary's hair is loose and she wears an embroidered dress lined with fur. Around her neck is a light veil, and she is shown in the act of nursing. Her dress is a centrepiece of the panel, composed of a variety of blues overlaid with lead white and deep blue lapis lazuli highlights. The inner parts of her robe contain violet coloured fabrics, lined with greyish blues and purples. Luke is positioned on a green cushion, between the heavenly figure and the small study behind him. He is either rising from a kneeling position or about to genuflect. His eyes fix on her attentively, and he seems near hypnotised. Jesus is similarly transfixed.Hall (2014), 58 Hall describes Luke's hands as floating before him, holding the tools \\"with the same delicacy that an angel might hold a lily or sceptre\\". Mary has turned her face so that he can depict her in near full profile, a rare honour, while Luke's kneeling position is closely analogous to that of a typical donor portrait in the presence of the Virgin. Luke is beardless and in his early 40s, close to van der Weyden's age in the mid-1430s.Marrow (1999), 54 His face is not idealised; he is middle- aged with light stubble and greying hair.Blum (1997), 107 The room behind him contains his attributes including an ox and an open book representing his Gospel. He is painted with more naturalism than Mary; his eyes in particular are more realistically drawn. Christ's conform to the then idealised form, as simple crescents. Mary's are formed from curved lines typical of late Gothic ideals of feminine beauty.Ishikawa (1990), 54 Compared to contemporary paintings of this type, the work is unusually free of inscriptions; they appear only on items in Luke's study, dimly perceived on his right: on a book, on an ink bottle, and on a scroll emanating from the mouth of his ox, beneath the small desk.Acres (2000), 98–101 The scene is set within a rather narrow interior space,Campbell (1980), 14–5 with a barrel vault ceiling, patterned floor tilings, and stained glass windows. The outer wall opens to the midground, with a patch of grass and plants, and has a view of a river or inlet.Nash (2008), 157 Art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith notes how the transition between the grounds establishes a \\"complex spatial space in which [van der Weyden] achieved an almost seamless movement from the elaborate architecture of the main room to the garden and parapet of the middle ground to the urban and rural landscape behind\\".Smith (2004), 21 Jan van Eyck, Madonna of Chancellor Rolin (detail) Two figures in the mid-ground stand at a battlement wall overlooking the water, their backs turned against the viewer, the male pointing outwards.Acres (2000), 25 They are framed by columns, and are looking towards the detailed city and landscape in the background.Kleiner (2008), 407 The figures seem preoccupied with \\"looking\\", which Carol Purtle believes, to van der Weyden, was a form of devotionalism; through meditating on an image, the \\"beholder experienced visions of transports of ecstasy\\".Purtle (2007), 8 Technical analysis shows that both figures were heavily reworked both in the underdrawing and the final painting;Borchert (1997), 78 the hood of the figure on the right was originally red, but over- painted as black, amongst many other differences.van Calster (2003), 481 Detail of figures in the midground The positioning of these figures closely resembles that of two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing at him to look outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent a tribute to the artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s.van Calster (2003), 477 A red headdress was an indicator of self- portraiture for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir,van Calster (2003), 476 in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.van Calster (2003), 478 Examination of the underdrawing shows that the artist intended a van Eyckian angel crowning the Virgin, but this was omitted from the final painting.Borchert (2001), 213 He heavily reworked the positions of the three main figures even towards the end of completion.Ishikawa (1990), 57 The draperies of the mantles were at first larger. Christ's body at first faced Luke, but was later tilted in the direction of his mother. The mother and child were brought closer together. Luke's head was at first level with the Virgin's, but in the final painting is raised slightly above.Ishikawa (1990), 53 The differences extend beyond those in the foreground. The fortifications of the inner courtyard have been enlarged, while the two figures looking out over the river were smaller, the river itself narrower. Self-portrait Luke's face is widely considered to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration, and is normally used only for preparation.Rothstein (2005), 4 The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.\\"Head of the Virgin\\". Louvre. Retrieved 5 December 2014 After van der Weyden, The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald, detail from a lost painting, tapestry copy. This head is considered another probable self-portrait.Campbell (2004), 8 Van der Weyden appears intelligent and handsome, but weather-worn.White (1997), 43–4 He inserted a self-portrait into one other work; the lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald, known through a tapestry copy in the Historical Museum of Bern.Koerner (1997), 128 Later northern artists followed his lead, using self-portraits in their own depictions of Luke.Brush (1994), 19 What biographical details are available place the artist as a devout Catholic, deeply influenced by mystical and devotional texts, familiar with 12th and 13th century female theologians such as Mechthild of Magdeburg and Hildegard of Bingen.Apostolos-Cappadona (1997), 8 They believed that contemplating devotional images whilst meditating might lead to a vision or a state of ecstasy. It is possible from these teachings that van der Weyden developed a set of devotional motifs such as The Magdalen Reading. The importance of St Luke in Christian art is underscored in St Luke Painting the Virgin, while affirming \\"the role of art within the context of meditation and contemplation\\".Apostolos-Cappadona (1997), 9–10 The self- portraiture achieves a number of purposes. It acts as a tribute to his own ability, as a measure of his skill against van Eyck, and as a case for the legitimacy of the craft of painting. By portraying himself as St Luke in the act of drawing rather than painting, De Vries believes van der Weyden reveals an \\"artistic consciousness by commenting upon artistic traditions and by doing so presents a visual argument for the role and function of the artist and his art, one at that time still predominantly religiously defined\\". Smith describes the panel as an \\"exposition of the art of painting\\", observing that van der Weyden records the essential skills any successful artist should master while claiming to be an heir to St Luke. He works in silverpoint – and thus is unencumbered with the paraphernalia of painting; an easel, seat or other items which might clutter the composition, or more importantly place a physical barrier between the divine and earthly realms.Nash (2008), 158 Iconography Van der Weyden's small Virgin and Child Enthroned, c. 1430–1432. Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza The painting is rich in both actual and implied iconography. Van der Weyden presents Mary as the Maria Lactans virgin type, a symbol of \\"Mother Church\\" especially popular at times of plague or famine, the implication being that she cares for all and no one will go hungry. This notion ties in with Luke's dual roles of physician (and thus healer) and artist.Apostolos-Cappadona (1997), 10 Van der Weyden had earlier portrayed Mary breast-feeding in his Virgin and Child Enthroned, which depicts equally detailed carvings carrying significance, but is reduced in size and in its cast of characters, and omits the act of beholding.Apostolos-Cappadona (1997), 11 The architecture of the enclosed space suggests a church. The Virgin sits beneath a canopy, perhaps symbolic of the sacred space, and the spatial separation between the celebrant and the congregation, usually by a Rood screen. The small room to the right could symbolize the vesting chamber. The arms of her throne are painted as carved with figures including Adam, Eve and the serpent before the fall from Paradise. The room faces towards an enclosed garden, another emblem of the Virgin's chastity. Though Mary is positioned by a throne and under a canopy, indicating her role as Queen of Heaven, she sits on the step, an indication of her humility.Harbison (1995), 7 Carvings on the Virgin's throne The Virgin occupies an earthly space as opposed to a sacred one, but remains aloof. This approach is emphasised by secondary midground figures who are out in the open air, while the main figures are positioned in an elevated room containing a throne, grand arches and wood carvings. Van der Weyden's setting is less artificial than van Eyck's; here Luke and Mary face each other as equals, rather than in van Eyck's painting where, as Blum describes \\"a divinity and a mortal\\" face one another. Van der Weyden omits the winged angel holding a crown hovering above the Virgin; the figure was included in the underdrawings, but eventually abandoned. The landscape is more secular than van Eyck's, which is dominated by church spires.Blum (1977), 105 In the late-13th century, many of the newly emerging painter's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art,Hornik; Parsons (2003), 16–7 along with a similar work, a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child, as suggested by the realistic contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. Yet he infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography. Attribution and dating During the 19th century the painting was at times associated with Quentin Massys and Hugo van der Goes. In the early 1930s, based on X-radiographs, art historian Alan Burroughs attributed the Boston painting to Dieric Bouts \\"under the supervision\\" of van der Weyden.MacBeth; Spronk (1997), 108 He later revised his opinion to van der Weyden, but art historians remained unsure as to which of the four panel versions was the original or prime version and which were copies.Eisler (1961), 73–4 Infrared reflectography has revealed underdrawing in the Boston version which contains heavy redrafting and re-working. This is absent in the other versions, strong evidence the Boston panel is prime.Spronk (1996), 26 The approach to the underdrawing is very similar to the paintings where attribution to van der Weyden is established, such as the Descent from the Cross in Madrid, and the Miraflores Altarpiece in Berlin. They are built up with brush and ink, with the most attention given to the outlines of the figures and draperies. Hatching is used to indicate areas of deep shadow. In each, the underdrawing is a working sketch, subject to constant revisions, which continued even after painting had begun.Ishikawa (1990), 51 The drawing of Mary is similar to the Louvre's silverpoint drawing of 1464 attributed to his circle. Both are of a type van der Weyden was preoccupied with, showing \\"an ongoing refinement and emphasis on [Mary's] youthfulness ... [which is] traceable throughout his work\\". Art historians gradually revised their dating from 1450 to the currently accepted 1435–40, earlier in the artist's career. This estimate is based on three factors; the dating of the Rolin Madonna, van der Weyden's opportunity of viewing that panel, and his ability to produce his own work after such a viewing. He is known to have visited Brussels – where van Eyck kept his studio – in 1432 and again 1435. Erwin Panofsky suggested c. 1434 as the earliest possible date, and that the Rolin panel was completed in 1433 or 1434. Julius Held was sceptical of this early dating, noting that if true we are \\"forced to assume that within one year of Jan's work Rogier received a commission which gave him an opportunity to adopt Jan's compositional pattern while subjecting it at the same time to a very thorough and highly personal transformation, and all this in Bruges, under Jan's very eyes\\".Held (1955), 225 Held, as a lone voice and writing in 1955, argues for a date between 1440 and 1443, seeing the work as more advanced than other paintings by the artist from the mid-1430s, and believes it contains \\"considerable differences\\" when compared to other early works, especially the Annunciation Triptych of c. 1434. He further observes that although the painting became highly influential, copies did not appear until the mid-century.Held (1955), 226 Dendrochronological examination of the growth rings in the panel's wood suggests that the timber was felled around 1410. In the 15th century, wood was typically stored for around 20 years before use in panel painting, giving an earliest date in the mid to late 1430s. Analysis of the Munich version places it in the 1480s, around 20 years after van der Weyden's death.Ishikawa (1990), 58 The panel in Bruges is in the best condition and of exceptional quality, but dates from c. 1491–1510.van Oosterwijk, Anne. \\"After Rogier Van der Weyden: Saint Luke drawing the Madonna\\". Museums of Fine Arts of Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent. Retrieved 18 January 2015 Provenance and conservation October 1914 photograph of the panel in its old frame. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Despite the eminence of the painting and its many copies, little is known of its provenance before the 19th century. It seems likely that it is the painting Albrecht Dürer mentions in his diary recollection of his visit to the Low Countries in 1520.Campbell; van der Stock (2009), 254 It is probably the same work recorded in a 1574 inventory of Philip II, kept at the Escorial. The painting is recorded in 1835 in the collection of Don Infante Sebastián Gabriel Borbón y Braganza, a grandnephew of Charles III of Spain and himself an artist. Gabriel's inventory notes described the panel in detail, attributed it to Lucas van Leyden, and suggested an earlier restoration. It was donated to the Museum of Fine Arts in 1893 by Henry Lee Higginson after his purchase at a New York auction in 1889. Photographs from 1914 show it in an ornate, decorative frame which is probably the same as in Gabriel's 1835 description.MacBeth; Spronk (1997), 103–4 The panel is in poor condition, with substantial damage to its frame and surface, despite at least four restorations. The earliest recorded restoration was in 1893, the year it was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, but there are no surviving records of the treatment. In the early 1930s, the museum's curator of paintings, Philip Henry, described the painting as an original van der Weyden, but gave the opinion that its poor condition was hindering wider acceptance of the attribution. On this basis, it was sent to Germany in 1932 to undergo conservation. The effort was led by the restorer Helmut Ruhemann, who described the panel as \\"structurally sound\\", and removed layers of discoloured varnish and \\"crude overpainting\\", while filling in some areas of paint loss. Ruhemann believed he had found evidence of at least two major 19th-century restorations, one of which was probably that carried out in Boston in 1893. Ruhemann's cleaning and restoration was widely praised, and contributed to the acceptance of the panel as the original by van der Weyden.MacBeth; Spronk (1997), 105–6 The MFA undertook a third restoration in 1943, when some yellowing of the glaze was repaired.MacBeth; Spronk (1997), 107–8 Most recently, the painting was cleaned in 1980 when small amounts of grime were removed, some losses were filled in, and a light coat of varnish was applied. Influence Master of the Legend of St. Ursula, Virgin and Child, late 15th century If the painting was in the Guild of Saint Luke's chapel in Brussels, then many near-contemporary artists would have been able to view it. Van der Weyden's interpretation was hugely influential during the mid-15th and early-16th centuries, both in free and faithful adaptations and copies, examples of which are in Brussels, Kassel, Valladolid and Barcelona.Hand et al. (2006), 265 This reflects its quality, and the fact that he presents an ideal image of an artist as a self-portrait, legitimising and elevating the trade. Also influential was his Madonna type, which he used again for the c. 1450 Diptych of Jean de Gros. That painting features a 'Virgin and Child' wing directly modelled on his St Luke panel, extending the devotional aspect to include a donor who appears in the same panel with her. In combining the patron with the Virgin, the \\"artist has made that personal devotion an integral part of the image\\".Bauman (1986), 49 Hugo van der Goes, Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin, c. 1470–80. National Museum of Ancient Art, Lisbon Depictions of Luke drawing the Virgin rose in popularity in the mid-to-late 15th century, with van der Weyden's panel the earliest known from the Low CountriesWhite (1997), 39 – Campin's earlier treatment was by then lost.Sterling; Ainsworth (1998), 73 Most were free copies (adaptations) of van der Weyden's design. The anonymous painter known as the Master of the Legend of St. Ursula incorporated the Maria Lactans type for his Virgin and Child, now in New York. Other artists producing works directly influenced by van der Weyden's portrait include Hugo van der Goes, Dieric Bouts, Derick Baegert and Jan Gossaert. Some artists copied van der Weyden by placing their own likeness in place of St Luke, notably Simon Marmion and Maarten van Heemskerck.Ainsworth (1998), 82 By representing themselves as Luke, artists implied a depiction of the Virgin based on first hand contact and thus giving her true likeness.Bauman (1986), 58 Van der Goes's is the earliest extant autographed version, and one of the most important. This panel was originally a diptych wing of which the accompanying panel of the Virgin and Child is lost, and was probably made for a guild. Luke is dressed in a heavy red robe, draws a preparatory sketch in silverpoint, and wears a melancholy expression.White (1997), 40 Building on van der Weyden's theme of the role, practice and craft of an artist, van der Goes places pieces of charcoal, a knife and the feathers of a small bird in front of the saint.White (1997), 42–3 The similarities to the van der Weyden are many and striking, and include the painting utensils, red robes, physician's cap and blue mantle. The figure has the same middle-aged facial type and his pose, kneeling on a green cushion, although reversed compared to van der Weyden's, is the same. Van der Goes's adaption both increased van der Weyden's standing in the eyes of the later artist's followers, and led to a new group of copies that were modelled on the later painting. A tapestry version woven in Brussels c. 1500 is now in the Louvre.Smith (2004), 19 It was probably designed using a reversed drawing of the painting.Delmarcel (1999), 52 = Left panel = File:Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin detail5.jpgDetail of the view beyond the head of the Virgin File:Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin detail2.jpgDetail of the town in the distance File:Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin3.jpgDetail of figures walking in the far background References =Notes= =Sources= * Acres, Alfred. \\"Rogier van der Weyden's Painted Texts\\".

Camano was later known as Tolo. As Tolo the vessel was sunk in 1917 as a result of a collision at sea. Four people died as a result. Design and construction Camano was built by Capt. H.B. Lovejoy, doing business as the Island Transportation Company to run on the Everett – Coupeville, Washington shipping route as a replacement for the sternwheeler Fairhaven. As built, Camano was longNewell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at 119, 135, 173, 189, 209 and 293. In 1910, Camano was rebuilt, after which the vessel had the following dimensions: , beam, and depth of hold. The vessel was kept on the Everett-Coupeville route however. In 1911, when the steamer Calista was built for Island Transportation Co., at Dockton, Washington, Camano towed the new steamer to Seattle for completion. Operations From 1906 to 1912 Camano ran on a route from Coupeville to Everett. H.B. Lovejoy's son, F.E. Lovejoy (1889–1940) served on board as a deckhand. He had also carved the nameboard for the ship.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats – A Legend on Puget Sound, at pages 183-184. Camano burned oil a fuel which was just coming into use among the Puget Sound steamboats when Camano was built. Originally the oil fuel for Camano was supplied on barrels brought to Coupeville by Fairhaven, a woodburner like most of the older vessels. In November 1906, an iron tank, measuring by by was installed on the Coupeville dock to refuel Camano. Refueling was later done at Clinton and Edmonds, Washington.Sherman, Roger, \\"Coupeville Wharf History\\" (April 2009) (accessed 06-04-11), at page 3. Every day except Sundays, Camano would depart Coupeville at 7:00 am southbound, stopping at Oak Harbor at 7:30 am, Camano Island at 8:15 am, Langley at 9:15 am, Clinton, Washington at 9:45 am, arriving in Everett at 10:15 am. Camano would depart Everett headed northbound at 3:00 pm. Stops were made depending on call at Brown's Point. San de Fuca, and Saratoga.Prasse, and Stanwood Historical Society, Camano Island, at page 81. Camano was too small to have sleeping quarters or a galley. The crew's work day began 6:00 am, and they ate breakfast in the morning before work. The crew didn't it dinner until after the work day was complete, which was at 11:30 pm. Lunch was a cold meal, with coffee heated up on the head of the high-pressure steam cylinder. In March 1907, Camano towed the sternwheeler Fairhaven off the beach. Fairhaven had been blown onto the dock at Coupeville during a gale, and then on to the shore, suffering substantial damage. Camano was also placed on a route running from downtown Seattle to Alki Point. It cost 10 cents to ride the boat on this run.Faber, Steamer's Wake, at 162. Sale to KCTC Camano was sold to the Kitsap County Transportation Company and renamed Tolo. In November, 1915, Kitsap County Transportation Company purchased Camano for $15,000.Public Service Commission of the State of Washington, Annual Report (1916) (accessed 06-04-11)], at page 150. Accidents Camano was involved in several accidents. In one instance, on August 16, 1912, the much larger steel-hulled steamship Sioux, coming in from Seattle, was approaching the Everett dock. From the bridge, Capt. William Thorton of Sioux signaled the engine room for \\"half astern\\" to slow the vessel down. Instead the engine room gave him \\"half ahead\\" which caused the steamer to ram into the dock. Captain Thorton then signaled for \\"full astern\\". Another mistake was made and the Sioux went full ahead, smashing into Camano's stern, driving Camano forward into the gasoline launch Island Flyer which in turn struck the newly built motor launch Alverene. Island Flyer was sunk as a result and Alverene was seriously damaged. Camano then sank at the dock. The small launch Arrow was demolished and the steam launches Ranger and Daphne suffered lesser damage.Newell, Ships of the Inland Sea, at pages 172 and 182-83. The total damage was valued at $30,000. It turned out that an engine room assistant, known as an oiler had been left in charge of the telegraph. No one was killed although there was at least one close call. On March 1, 1914, in Elliott Bay, Camano collided with Modoc not far from the piers of the central Seattle waterfront. The collision was ruled to have been Modoc′s fault.The Modoc, 216 Fed. Supp. 445 (U.S. Dist. Ct. Western Wash. July 31, 1914). Sinking In November, 1917, under the command of Capt. George Benson, Tolo was en route from Seattle to Bainbridge Island in a heavy fog with eight crew and 53 passengers on board. The tug Magic (67 gross tons) collided with Camano, and Camano sank in less than eight minutes. Magic sent off distress signals. H.B. Kennedy responded. The skillful crew of the Kennedy, with the aid of Magic, was able to rescue most of the people from Camano. Four people died however, two women and one man from the passengers, and from the crew, the Chinese cook.

The Greek language however, has several different dialects or denominations. This required several different translations done by several different individuals and groups of people. These translations can be categorized into translations done before and after 1500 A.D.  Before AD 1500  The first known translation of the Bible into Greek is called the Septuagint (LXX; 3rd-1st centuries BC). The LXX was written in Koine Greek.Porter, S. E., “Septuagint/Greek Old Testament” in Porter, S. E. & Evans, C. A. (2000), Dictionary of New Testament background : A compendium of contemporary biblical scholarship (electronic edition, Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press). It contains the Hebrew Bible translated from Hebrew and Aramaic. It also includes several other documents which are considered to have differing levels of authority by various Christian churches. Some of these other documents are believed to have been written originally in Greek. The LXX contains the oldest existing translation of Holy Scripture into any language. It was widely disseminated among ancient Hellenistic Jews, and was later used by Greek-speaking Christians for their Old Testament (refer canon). The LXX is the source of the majority of quotations from the Old Testament by writers of the New Testament. It is studied along with Hebrew and Aramaic texts as an ancient source of information about the Old Testament. Other early Greek translations of Hebrew Scripture that survive only in fragments are those of Aquila of Sinope (2nd century AD), Theodotion (2nd century AD), Symmachus (3rd century AD) and Fragments of the Samareitikon.  After AD 1500  The New Testament part of the Christian Bible was originally written in Koine Greek, as most of the Church and scholars believe, and is therefore not a translation (notwithstanding that some reference material may have been from Aramaic). However, like other living languages, the Greek language has developed over time. Therefore, various translations have been completed over the centuries to make it easier for Greek speakers to understand Holy Scripture. Translations of the Old Testament, which is the other part of the Christian Bible, have been completed for similar reasons. Agapius of Crete translated and published in 1543 the book of Psalms into modern Greek.. A Greek and polyglot edition of the Pentateuch commonly called \\"Constantinople Pentateuch\\" published in Constantinople in 1547 by Romaniote Jews has the Hebrew text in the middle of the page, the Aramaic on the base, with a Yevanic translation on one side and a Judaeo-Spanish translation on the other.. The Greek text is published in . At the initiative of the pro-Reformed Patriarch Cyril Lucaris of Constantinople, Maximos of Gallipoli (or Kallioupolites, died 1633) translated a vernacular New Testament from 1629 which was printed at Geneva in 1638. An edition of the New Testament into Modern Greek translated by Seraphim of Mytilene was edited in London in 1703 by the English Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. This translation was formally condemned in 1704 by the reigning Patriarch Gabriel III of Constantinople. Frangiskos Soavios publishes in the year 1833 the Pentateuch and the Book of Josua translated from the Hebrew Original into the Modern Greek Language.ΣΟΑΒΙΟΥ ΦΡΑΓΚ., Πεντάτευχος (Ο) του Μωϋσέως και το βιβλίον του Ιησού του Ναυή, Εν Λόνδρα 1833.

A translation of the Bible (Old and New Testaments) in literary Katharevousa Greek (Καθαρεύουσα) by Neofytos Vamvas (Νεόφυτος Βάμβας) and his associates was first published in 1850 following nearly 20 years of work. Vamvas was dean and a professor of the University of Athens.. In 1901, Alexandros Pallis translated the Gospels into Modern Greek. This translation was known as Evangelika (Ευαγγελικά). There were riots in Athens when this translation was published in a newspaper. University students protested that he tried to sell the country to the Slavs and the Turks in order to break Greek religious and national unity. All translations were confiscated. The Holy Synod of the Greek Orthodox Church resolved that any translation of the Holy Gospels is “profane” and redundant. It also “contributes to scandalising the consciousness [of Greeks] and to the distortion of [the Gospels’] divine concepts and didactic messages. In 1967 a team of academic staff of the University of Athens led by Basil (Vasilios) Vellas (Βασίλειος Βέλλας) translated the New Testament, with support from the Hellenic Bible Society. This translation was based on the Textus Receptus.. A revision of the Vamvas translation of the Bible into the modern vernacular (Demotic Greek) by Spyros (Spiros) Filos (Σπύρος Φίλος) was first published in 1994. This translation is used in the Greek Evangelical Church. and is also recognized by the Orthodox Church. Meanwhile, a team of 12 professors from the theological schools of the Universities of Athens and Thessaloniki had been working since the mid 1960s on another translation into the modern vernacular (Demotic Greek), with support from the Hellenic Bible Society. The translation of the New Testament, first published in 1985, was based on a critical text of the Koine Greek (κοινή) in which the New Testament was originally written. The translation of the Old Testament from Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic texts of the Jewish Scriptures was first published in 1997. This translation has the blessing and approval of the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece. and is also used in Evangelical and Charismatic churches.. It is known in English as \\"Today's Greek Version (TGV)\\". In 2002, with the latest edition be published in 2012, a New Testament translation by professor Nikolaos Sotiropoulos was published after he revisioned many hundreds of New Testament passages's interpretations in his 4 volumes work: «Ερμηνεία δύσκολων χωρίων της Γραφής» (Interpretation of difficult passages of the Bible) . The new interpretations were judged positively and by professors including Ioannis Karmiris, also Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Demetrios I as it published in the second volume of «Interpretation of difficult passages of the Bible», p.12-28. The Bishop and professor Gortynos (Ieremias Foundas) described it as the best of all translations.

It was released on January 7, 2014 on OS X and Linux through the Humble Indie Bundle X. The game involves a young Brazilian boy Quico who, while hiding from his abusive, alcoholic father, finds himself taken to a dream-like favela, and meeting a normally docile creature, Monster. The player, as Quico, can interact with Monster and manipulate the buildings of the favela in unique ways, such as by stacking individual shacks on each other, to complete puzzles and progress in the game. Papo & Yo was designed by Vander Caballero, who created the story based on his own past in dealing with an abusive, alcoholic father.  Gameplay  The game takes place in an unspecified Brazilian favela which the player has to navigate. The player takes on the role of Quico, a young boy who has run away from his home to escape his abusive and alcoholic father. Quico has the ability to turn the environment into a magical and dream-like world. For example, tugging a glowing thread can pull a stairway out of the side of a building, lifting a cardboard box can cause an entire building to come unmoored from its foundations, shacks can sprout legs and scuttle into place to provide a handy bridge. According to Ars Technica's website \\"there's a sense of childlike imagination at play in the way the game adds a layer of magic into the rundown world, and it's likely to make you look at your own surroundings a little differently after you play\\". One of the key elements of the game is Monster, a giant that Quico discovers while navigating through the slums. Monster at first appears to be very kind and helpful. He can be made to hold down pressure plates and his belly can be used as a super-trampoline to reach rooftops. Monster has an addiction for eating frogs and if he eats one he becomes a fiery, raging beast that will damage anything around him, even Quico if he cannot get away quickly enough. The player can use a fruit to calm him.  Plot  Quico is a young Brazilian boy that has been abused by his alcoholic father. While hiding in his closet during one of his father's drunken rages, clutching his favorite toy, a robot doll named Lula, Quico discovers a strange chalk mark on the wall, and touching it, finds himself taken to a dream-like world. There, a young girl named Alejandra initially sees Quico as a threat, but comes to be a guide. Lula also becomes animated and helps guide Quico through the world. Quico eventually comes upon a giant lumbering creature, simply known as Monster. Alejandra and Lula warn Quico about the dangers of Monster, but Quico finds the creature docile and playful. However, when Monster eats a frog, it becomes enraged, chasing after Quico until he can calm it with a rotten fruit. They proceed through the dream world, but during one episode when Monster is enraged, it damages Lula. Alejandra directs Quico to a temple where they can use the anger from Monster to revive Lula, but this requires luring the creature into giant traps meant to hurt it. Quico completes this task, and Lula is successfully revived, but the three are now chased by Monster. Alejandra is eventually caught and eaten by Monster, but not before she directs Quico to go to the Shaman to help cure the Monster. During these scenes, there are brief periods where Quico awakes in a dream and witnesses a past memory: that of his father accidentally running over a person with his car in a dark rainstorm. One such scene shows his father's shadow as that of Monster. Quico guides Monster to a sky-tram like device but Lula is forced to stay behind to operate it. The tram ends at the Shaman, but Quico finds there is no Shaman, only the memories of his father, and showing that he had fallen into his alcoholic and abusive state after the accident; Monster represents Quico's imagination of his father, while the frogs are a substitute for his father's alcoholism. A voice warns him that Monster cannot be cured and Quico must let him go.

Monsignor Andrew Arnold Lambing or Rev. A. A. Lambing (1842–1918) was an American Roman Catholic priest and historian. He was one of the nation's foremost priest-historians, having founded the first Catholic historical society in the United States (The Ohio Valley Catholic Historical Society, in February 1884) as well as the first Catholic historical quarterly. Born in a hamlet that became Manorville, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Ford City, he worked as a boy on his family's farm. As an adolescent he labored in a brick yard and in the pioneering oil business of Samuel Kier on the Allegheny River. At age 21 Lambing entered St. Michael's Preparatory and Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh, was ordained in 1869 by Bishop Michael Domenec, and was briefly assigned to teach history at St. Francis College, Loretto. Thereafter, during forty years of Pittsburgh's post- Civil War, industrial and population boom, he ministered to thousands of the city's Catholic immigrants from Europe. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, he was credited with calming some strikers intent on destroying a freight depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the city's rail yards. Lambing was among the first academically-trained historians of Western Pennsylvania and the first to document the beginnings of the Catholic Church there. Two of his most important contributions were the first English translation, from the French, of the 1749 journal of Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville and the publication of the register of baptisms at Fort Duquesne. He wrote numerous articles for newspapers and magazines on historical and religious subjects, including a majority of two early and significant regional histories: History of Allegheny County and the Standard History of Pittsburgh. He served as president of the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania. Andrew Carnegie appointed Lambing a trustee of both the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh and the Carnegie School of Technology. In 1883 the University of Notre Dame conferred on him the honorary degree of Master of Arts and in 1886 the Doctor of Laws. He died Christmas Eve, 1918, and is buried in the priest’s section at St. Mary Cemetery in the city's Lawrenceville neighborhood. His headstone is in the shape of a large open book.

Plot Four friends are seen at a high school house party drinking and gossiping in a private room. Their fun is cut short when a pair of identical twins - classmates of the friends - enter the room with a video camera. The twins force the friends to play Russian roulette, the game ending only when all four friends are dead. The next day, Detective Lampkin launches an investigation. He interviews classmates of the dead boys, and one student named Katie mentions having seen the twins, Jonah and Seth Trimble, at the party. It is revealed that the twins had once forced Katie to have sex with another boy on camera. Lampkin summons the twins for interrogation, but they maintain their innocence. It is also revealed that Lampkin is a haunted man, traumatized by his inability to save his beloved wife from a house fire. The twins torture their Headmaster for the name of the person who told Lampkin that they were at the party; they eventually force their Headmaster through telepathy to stab himself to death. They then force Katie to kill herself as well, and then a pedophile whom they meet at a park. Lampkin deduces that the twins possess telepathic powers, and in his search for a cause, he learns that their mother had submitted herself to experimentation at a fertility clinic in order to get pregnant with the twins. Meanwhile, Jonah falls in love with another student named Eve. As Jonah grows closer to Eve, he pulls away from Seth, finally telling Seth that he wants nothing more to do with the mysterious \\"project\\" that they have been conducting. In anger, Seth impersonates Jonah and has sex with Eve to \\"prove\\" that Eve cannot tell them apart and therefore must not really be in love with Jonah. The twins brawl at school. Jonah goes home, only to be confronted by Lampkin. Seth returns home shortly after, and it is suddenly revealed that their parents are disfigured and their house is in ruins; as children, the twins forced their parents, who had become suspicious of the twins, to stab each other in the face. Although he had been compliant until now in their charades, Jonah decides that he no longer wants to force people to hurt themselves. After knocking out Lampkin, Seth attacks Jonah and sets the house on fire. Eve shows up to the house and tries to intervene by shooting Seth in the leg. She flees upstairs, but Seth follows and chokes her. Jonah rescues Eve; as Jonah and Seth struggle, the burning floor gives way and the twins fall through onto the dining room table. Lampkin wakes up and saves Eve from the fire; although he dies from his burns, it is insinuated that Lampkin has redeemed himself for the death of his wife. The twins lie paralyzed on the dining room table as the house burns around them. Understanding that they will die, the twins finally experience fear for the first time - the ultimate goal of their \\"project\\".

In some cases, science and technology are depicted without much concern for accuracy. = Characteristics = Themes related to science, technology, space and the future, as well as characteristic plots or settings include: * Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction * Biopunk — centered around biotechnology and genetic engineering in general, biopunk uses some both (post)cyberpunk elements and post-modernist prose to describe a typically dystopian world of biohackers, man-made viruses, mutations, designer babies, artificial life forms, bio-genetic engineered human-animal hybrids and bio- genetically manipulated humans. * Cyberpunk — uses elements from the hard- boiled detective novel, film noir, Japanese anime, and post-modernist prose to describe the nihilistic, underground side of a cybernetic society * Climate fiction — emphasizes effects of anthropogenic climate change and global warming at the end of the Holocene era * Dying Earth science fiction * Military science fiction * Steampunk — denotes works set in (or strongly inspired by) an era when steam power was still widely used — usually the 19th century, and often set in Victorian England — though with otherwise high technology or other science fiction elements * Time travel * Space colonization * Space opera — emphasizes romantic adventure, exotic settings, and larger-than-life characters * Social science fiction — concerned less with technology and more with sociological speculation about human society * Mundane science fiction = Movements = Genres concerning politics, philosophy, and identity movements include: * Christian science fiction * Feminist science fiction * Gay/lesbian science fiction * Libertarian science fiction = Eras = Genres concerning the historical era of creation and publication include: * Scientific romance — an archaic name for what is now known as the science fiction genre, mostly associated with the early science fiction of the United Kingdom. * Pulp science fiction * Golden Age of Science Fiction — a period of the 1940s during which the science fiction genre gained wide public attention and many classic science fiction stories were published. * New Wave science fiction — characterised by a high degree of experimentation, both in form and in content. * Cyberpunk — noted for its focus on \\"high tech, low life\\" and taking its name from the combination of cybernetics and punk. = Combinations = Genres that combine two different fiction genres or use a different fiction genre's mood or style include: * Alternate history science fiction—fiction set in a world in which history has diverged from history as it is generally known * Comic science fiction * Science fiction erotica * Adventure science fiction—science fiction adventure is similar to many genres * Gothic science fiction—a subgenre of science fiction that involves gothic conventions * New Wave science fiction—characterized by a high degree of experimentation, both in form and in content * Science fantasy—a mixed genre of story which contains some science fiction and some fantasy elements * Science fiction opera—a mixture of opera and science fiction involving empathic themes * Science fiction romance—fiction which has elements of both the science fiction and romance genres * Science fiction mystery—fiction which has elements of both the science fiction and mystery genres, encompassing Occult detective fiction and science fiction detectives * Science fiction Western—fiction which has elements of both the science fiction and Western genres * Space Western—a subgenre of science fiction that transposes themes of American Western books and film to a backdrop of futuristic space frontiers. * Spy-fi a subgenre of spy fiction that includes some science fiction.

In 1574, the Kimotsuki clan of Ōsumi Province was defeated and in 1577, Ito of Hyūga Province was also defeated and the Shimazu clan unified the southern treeh provinces of Kyushu.Kagoshima Prefecture, Unification of three countries In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi won over the Shimazu clan and the Shimazu clan survived only in Satsuma and Osumi areas. Near the end of the 16th century, Japanese feudal leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the Ryukyu Kingdom to support Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea with men and arms. On August 25, 1543 a gun was imported into Tanegashima, which revolutinalized warfare in Japan. Murashukusha and Kirishimota in a Chinese document Conquest of the Ryukyu Kingdom With the approval of the Tokugawa shogunate, the Satsuma Domain conqured the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1609. The Tokugawa shogunate decided to keep the small polity as a separate entity, with intent to make it work as a broker in the shogunate's failed attempt to establish diplomatic relations with China. After several twists and turns, Ryūkyū's position within the shogunate was finalized in 1634. Ryūkyū, with its kokudaka assessed as 123,700 koku, was officially recognized as part of the Satsuma Domain. As a result, Ryūkyū became Japan's one of four gateways to foreign countries. Under the direction of Satsuma, Ryūkyū's rulers continued to regularly pay tribute to the Chinese emperors, under the title of King of Chūzan of the State of Ryūkyū, concealing its vassalage to Satsuma. Satsuma Ware (Porcelain) and history A Satsuma ware bowl from the Meiji or Taishō period (19th-early 20th century) Satsuma ware or porcelain was originally developed by Korean potters, who came to Japan following the Japanese Invasion of Korea in the 17th century. The Prince of Satsuma brought potters from Korea, where they established a now famous kiln for making pottery. The ongoing patronage of the prince's family, the Shimazu family was the daimyōs (feudal lords) at the time that resulted in the great popularity of Satsuma porcelain. Production of Satsuma pottery is no longer limited to one area of Japan. The Shimazu family introduced the world to their beautiful earthenware pieces at the Paris International Exposition of 1867. Hōreki Age River Improvement Incident The Hōreki Age River Improvement Incident or Nōbi Plain River Improvement Incident was a big project of Satsuma han which intended to divide the rivers into Kiso River, Nagara River and Ibi River, in Nagoya district between 1754 and 1755. These rivers were three big rivers which flowed in the Nōbi Plain with complicated geographical features and frequent floods. Tokugawa Ieshige, the 9th Edo shōgun ordered the river improvement construction works to be done by the Satsuma han, in order to weaken the Satsuma han. Hirata Yukie (1704–1755) a karō (house elder), accepted the construction works with 947 people. The works were tremendously difficult and 51 samurai died and 33 people died of disease during the construction works. Hirata Yukie committed seppuku for the great burden to the Satsuma han. Ironically, floods increased after the works and modern technology completed the works in the Meiji period under the direction of Johannis de Rijke (1842–1913) a Dutch civil engineer and advisor to Japanese government. Shimazu Nariakira Shimazu Nariakira Shimazu Nariakira (1809–1858) was an influential daimyō of Satsuma. After he became daimyō of Satsuma, Nariakira had Minayoshi Hotoku, a Satsuma physician, to build the Iroha-maru, one of the first Western-style ships built in Japan. It was based on Minayoshi's 6-foot-long (180 cm), 3-foot-wide (91 cm) model. Nariakira then built a shipyard for Western-style shipbuilding at Sakurajima. He also began enacting educational changes in Satsuma geared at bringing in Western science and technology. Nariakira established the Rangaku Koshujo, a school for the study of the Dutch language and Western culture. He would frequently visit schools and ask students to explain the meaning of the Confucian texts, to ensure that their Western learning did not corrupt their sense of nationalism. So strong was Nariakira's desire to raise well-educated youths that he set aside four koku annually to feed starving scholars, essentially a form of financial aid or scholarship. The Shūseikan (集成館) industrial area established by Shimazu Nariakira in 1852 in Iso, Satsuma Province. Shōhei Maru (Japanese: 昇平丸) was Japan's first Western-style warship following the country's period of seclusion. She was ordered in 1852 by the government of the shōgun to the southern fief of Satsuma in the island of Kyūshū, in anticipation of the announced mission of Commodore Perry in 1853. Tokugawa shogunate, powerful Satsuma clan and Satsuma rebellion Bombardment of Kagoshima Toward the end of the Tokugawa shogunate, namely the bakumatsu in which the Shimazu clan played an important role, there have been a chain of events such, bombardment of Kagoshima, also known as the Anglo- Satsuma War (Satsu-Ei Sensō), which took place on 15–17 August 1863 during the Late Tokugawa shogunate, Meiji Restoration (1868), abolition of the han system (1871) and Satsuma Rebellion (1877). In 1872, the Ryukyu islands were made the Ryukyu han. The Sword Abolishment Edict and the abolishment of the Samurai system were issued in 1876, and samurai were angered and became furious. Saigō Takamori, the hero and leader of Meiji Restoration left the central Meiji Government and returned to Kagoshima, with dissatisfied samurai. In 1877, Satsuma Rebellion army went up to Kumamoto, but could not invade the Kumamoto Castle and Saigō committed seppuku at his native place Kagoshima. In 1883, Kagoshima Prefecture was founded after the re-establishment of Miyazaki Prefecture. In 1914, Mt. Sakurajima erupted and the island of Sakurajima connected with the Osumi Peninsula. Saigō Takamori The city of Kagoshima was covered by deep ash during the 1914 eruption of the Sakurajima volcano, in the distance across the bay. World War Ⅱ and after On June 17, 1945, Kagoshima city was attacked by B-29 bombers with 2316 persons killed, while in the same year, suicide attack planes departed from Kagoshima Prefecture. At the end of the war, the islands souther of 30th parallel north, or the Tokara and Amami Islands, were separated from Japanese administration and went into American military occupation. The Tokara Islands were return to Kagoshima Prefecture in 1952, which was followed by the Amami Islands in 1953. In 1972, Kamoike Airport was abolished and a new airport was established in Kirishima City. In 1993, 1993 Kagoshima Heavy Rain occurred, with the death toll of 71, but about 2,500 people who were either in 1200 cars or buses, including those on the trains and inhabitants were saved by fishing boats and ferries which carried them to Kagoshima through the Sakurajima Bay. In 1996, the Kagoshima Prefectural buildings were completed in the present place. In 2004, Kyushu Shinkansen partially opened between Shin-Yatsushiro and Kagoshima-Chūō Station which opened fully in 2011.

The series is presented without explanation or narration as a showcase of surreal footage arranged around a single loose theme (expressed in the episode title) and blended without pause into a single continuous presentation. The series premiered Adult Swim on January 1, 2011, 4:00 am New Year's Day. Hughes, a former employee of MTV Animation, first pitched it to Mike Lazzo at Adult Swim after producing a video mixtape for the network's 2010 Carnival Tour event. As a result of its 4 a.m. graveyard slot and small selection of episodes, the series remains relatively unknown on the network, but has been received positively and dubbed a cult phenomenon by critics and Adult Swim itself. The series has aired 36 episodes and 3 specials over the course of 10 seasons, including two episodes, \\"Technology\\" (by Wham City) and \\"Paradise\\" (by Ghosting.tv), that Adult Swim announced on October 13, 2017, would air in late 2017. On December 31, 2019, Dave Hughes tweeted that the episode \\"Patterns\\" was the \\"last [one] for now\\", indicating that the series has been put on hiatus until further notice.https://twitter.com/cheesepapa/status/1212120206216253442 On June 9, 2020, the show came back with season 10. https://twitter.com/cheesepapa/status/1270221802724352002 Synopsis Screenshot from the pilot episode \\"Animals\\", showing morphing psychedelic imagery between two clips The series is presented without explanation or narration as a showcase of surreal footage—animations, short films, music videos, viral videos, film and TV clips, stock footage and morphing psychedelic imagery—arranged around a single loose theme (expressed in the episode title) and blended without pause into a single continuous presentation. Production Series creator Dave Hughes first started working for Adult Swim in 2003 after an eight-year stint with MTV Animation, where he had edited series such as Beavis and Butt-head and Celebrity Deathmatch. Hughes, who saw Adult Swim \\"slipping away from its more experimental roots\\" as it got popular, had the concept for Off the Air in mind before, but never thought he would be the one to make it. While living in New York, 120 Minutes, Concrete TV, Liquid Television and Night Flight were among some of the experimental programming that exposed him \\"to a whole new world of ideas, music and people that I just didn't see anywhere else on television.\\" Hughes first pitched the series to the network through Mike Lazzo at Adult Swim sometime after late 2009, after producing a video mixtape that would be projected behind musical performers for the network's 2010 Carnival Tour event. He compiled footage for the mixtape using the Prelinger Archives, as well as various online sources, and applied visual effects to them \\"until you didn't quite know what you were looking at.\\" He originally imagined for it to exist as a \\"bizarre collection\\" of Internet and archival footage intertwined with clips from Adult Swim shows, \\"set to good music.\\" He ultimately had to omit the latter material, however, as the network would still have to acquire licenses for their own series in derivative works. He found that once they were gone, \\"the show really opened up.\\" In putting an episode together, Hughes seeks clips \\"with some kind of truth or integrity to them\\", opting for both viral videos in addition to ones with fewer view counts. Tracking down licensees for clips proves to be the most difficult aspect of the process, he stated, with co-producers Cody DeMatteis and Alan Steadman assisting him in pursuit of material hard to obtain. When asked if getting consent for other's work posed a challenge, Hughes noted it to be helpful working under the \\"Adult Swim banner\\", with only a few artists responding with reluctance. He wrote that each piece of the episode is treated with protection, not \\"trying to exploit anyone or make fun of anything or anybody.\\" Each episode is edited using Final Cut Pro, along with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe After Effects for further manipulation (often employing data-moshing techniques). Hughes observed a large portion of producing episodes to stem from \\"finding the right music to go with the visuals, or vice versa\\", and found transitions to \\"really help keep it moving.\\" Likewise, Hughes digressed from Liquid Television use of longer segments in order to make the series a \\"larger event rather than a series of smaller events\\", and found visual effects and transitions to be \\"a huge part\\" of his theory in making an episode. Starting in Season 7, the series began airing episodes produced by guest curators. A compilation of videos that were once considered to be featured in the first season had been published on the network's official blog. These videos, extending into its second season as well as hosting various other supplemental material, have since been published onto Network Awesome. A compilation of material from the first season and additional shorts was given a theatrical release at Cinefamily on August 25, 2012, which Hughes attended. In 2018, Hughes started Smalls, a complementary series on Adult Swim's website featuring original shorts from the artists featured on Off the Air as well as new talent. Hughes has said he intended for the series to include \\"more traditional shorts, [with] a little more character and a little more comedy,\\" as opposed to the more abstract material on Off the Air.https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/dave-hughes-adult-swim-off-the-air- smalls-animation-film-161219 The series includes both weekly online short films and full 11-minute shorts for the network proper.https://www.adultswim.com/videos/smalls The shorts and TV episodes also air on the Off the Air marathon stream on the network's website.https://www.adultswim.com/streams/off-the-air Broadcast and reception Its pilot episode, \\"Animals\\", premiered on Adult Swim on New Year's Day 2011 at 4 a.m.; it was broadcast twice in a row, back-to-back. Episodes have continued to air in this time slot—considered a graveyard slot in broadcast programming—and as a result of this and its small selection of episodes, the series remains relatively unknown on the network. However, Austin McManus of Juxtapoz noted word of mouth to be \\"gradually spreading\\" about it. He and the network also described the show as a cult phenomenon. Three specials have been produced: \\"Dan Deacon: U.S.A.\\", broadcast July 6, 2013, consists of surreal footage of American landscapes, with music from the last four tracks of the album America by Dan Deacon. A second special—the second-season episode \\"Nightmares\\" played in literal reverse—aired after Halloween night on November 1, 2014. The third special is a music video of Deacon's song \\"When I Was Done Dying\\" from his album Gliss Riffer animated by nine directors featured previously in Off the Air, that broadcast March 24, 2015. It has received positive critical reception, with McManus conducting an eight-page interview and profile of Hughes in appreciation of the series. The magazine had previously published a special issue centered on the network and its shows in July 2012, but overlooked Off the Air, presenting an \\"opportunity to shed a little insight and background on an extraordinary unique show.\\" Speaking from the first time he watched it, McManus praised it for not being \\"your typical try-too-hard-to-be-weird production.\\" In Adweek, Sam Thielman ranked it second place out of 18 other programs on the network. He tied it with the network's parody infomercial specials and wrote that it was \\"in the same category as King Star King among things that are so cool and strange that they look like they should probably be part of a video installation in an art gallery somewhere.\\" For Neon Tommy, Jeremy Fuster called it \\"a dark, unspeakable corner of television where no light can reach and only the sleepless and drug-addled dare to venture.\\" Amanda McCorquodale of the Miami New Times joked that, for artists featured on the show, \\"nothing compares to the prestige of sharing a network with Tim & Eric and Brak, right?\\" Ultimately, she saw it as the \\"already bizarre network's foray into out-there visual experimentation.\\" Writing for The Fader, Matthew Trammell regarded it as \\"when things get really interesting.\\" PQ Ribber of The Overnightscape Underground dubbed the series a \\"modern version\\" of Liquid Television and called it \\"really kinda spiffy, and trippy, and cool.\\" Casper Kelly sought inspiration from the show during the production of his short film for the network, Too Many Cooks. Ratings-wise, several episodes have surpassed one million views according to Nielsen Media Research. Hughes added that he follows the series' ratings when it occurs to him, but does not receive further analytics. He found it to trend on Twitter during the weeks of its airing, and likes viewing user's statuses regarding it. In particular, he enjoys reactions from people who wake up to it after falling asleep to the network, and judged from the online response that its audience would be \\"pretty young, late teens, early 20s\\" and \\"strangely positive and engaged.\\" The network has broadcast praise of the show written by viewers in the form of bumpers, often hinting at further episodes being produced. Episodes have been distributed to sites like YouTube, while a continuous online stream of the show was launched by the network on September 5, 2014. On December 19, 2014, the show's Facebook page announced that additional exclusive material will be added to the livestream.

In Argentina's affected cities, people have been recommended to stay indoors. On 5 June the ash rain in Bariloche ceased. There were reports that the ash had caused power outages and prompted the local airport to be closed. The Bariloche Atomic Centre reported that the ashes contain no crystal phases of quartz or cristobalite. On 9 June ash clouds from Puyehue reached Uruguay, forcing most flights to be cancelled. On 11 June the ash clouds reached the southern tip of New Zealand, with unusual sunsets reported in Invercargill. Further disruption was caused by ash in October 2011, with airports at Mendoza, Bariloche and Buenos Aires closed and flights to Buenos Aires and Montevideo cancelled. This was ash from the earlier eruption which had been deposited across Patagonia and stirred up by high winds. Some areas of Argentina close to the Chilean border still had ash falling almost daily four months after the June eruption.

Chubut and Río Negro Provinces had suffered five years of drought, and the ash destroyed the little pastureland still serviceable. 750,000 sheep suffered the consequences, and Rio Negro officials said 60,000 head of cattle also were \\"at risk.\\"Agriculture emergency is Argentine Patagonia because of the volcanic ash The Livestock had suffered major heart attacks and many of which contracted throat cancer, resulting in death. Whereas there appears to be no published support for the existence of heart attacks or throat cancer as a consequence from the exposure to ashes and causing death, there are at least 2 phenomena which play a role. For one, the physical reduction of available forage (on top of the prevailing general drought conditions) has resulted in lack of forage, and therefore, starvation with all its consequences. This was accelerated by the rapid wear of teeth from the abrasive action of ashes, and thus a reduced efficiency to forage. The second reason is that these ashes cause fluoride intoxication in herbivores, with many different symptoms, and confirmed in sheep, cattle and horses.Flueck WT. 2013. Effects of Fluoride intoxication on teeth of livestock due to a recent volcanic eruption in Patagonia, Argentina. Onl J Vet Res., 17 (4): 167–176. =Wildlife and forests= However, besides livestock, also wild species are strongly affected by the ashes. Fluoride intoxication was first discovered in red deer (Cervus elaphus), with pronounced dental fluorosis. The result is formation of abnormal teeth both in physical form as well as in reduced hardness. It reduces foraging efficiency, eliminated pregnancies in subadults, and will reduce longevity by 50–75%.Flueck WT, Smith-Flueck JM. 2013. Severe dental fluorosis in juvenile deer linked to a recent volcanic eruption in Patagonia. Journal of Wildlife Diseases, 49(2):355–366. While the rate of fluoride intake exceeds the capacity to eliminate it, animals continue to accumulate fluoride. Before the eruption, fluoride levels in adults was about 50–60 ppm. On average, deer were judged to accumulate about 1,000 ppm per year under similar exposure to ashes, which remains the situation for many drier sites, where the winds constantly redeposit the ashes. Some deer accumulated more like 3,700 ppm per year and reached 5,175 ppm by the year 2012.Flueck WT, Smith-Flueck JM. 2013. Temporal kinetics of fluoride accumulation: from fetal to adult deer. European Journal of Wildlife Research, 59:899–903. This trend has remained for some areas as the most recent deer examined had adults which had reached 10,396 ppm. Flueck, W.T. 2014. Continuing impacts on red deer from a volcanic eruption in 2011. European Journal of Wildlife Research, 60:699–702. These high levels of fluorosis likely affect the skeleton, and a first case in deer with severe osteological pathology has been described in March 2015. A study along Chile Route 215 showed that in places with ash falls of 10 cm about 8% of the trees died while at locations with 50 cm of ash 54% of the trees died. Ashes did not cause any significant abrasion of the canopy. Transport disruption The images show the density of particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) as measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on the Aura satellite. The series starts on 5 June 2011, the day after the eruption began, and continues through 13 June. Ash poses a significant threat to aircraft because once sucked into engines, it can be transformed into molten glass by the high temperatures and potentially cause an engine to fail. On the ground lava, ash and volcanic stone can impede vehicle movement. =Chile= Initially, because of the wind direction (to east), the flights within Chile were not interrupted and only the highway Route 215-CH and the \\"Cardenal Samore Pass\\" was reported to be covered by 10 to 15 cm of \\"volcanic stone\\" by Chilean authorities.Erupción de Cordón Caulle: Aún no hay fecha fija para el regreso de los evacuados, Emol and closed down on 4 June. The Chilean government increased the frequency of barges on the Pirihueico Lake in Huahum Pass to transport passengers traveling between Chile and Argentina. Huahum Pass is approximately 100 km north of the closed \\"Cardenal Samore Pass\\". On 22 June, as the ash cloud rounded the world and returned to Chile, the Chilean airline LAN cancelled flights to Temuco and Valdivia in the south of the country.Puyehue Volcano Expels Lava =Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil= On 4 June at approximately 4:30 pm local time, Neuquén Airport was closed due to the ash cloud.

Passengers were strongly recommended to travel LAN Airlines as the ash cloud did not cover the route over Punta Arenas.Article Falklands rations seats on the UK airbridge forced by the volcanic ash in Mercopress on 10 June 2011 retrieved on 15 June 2011 =South Africa= On 14 June the South African Civil Aviation Authority released a statement saying that the ash cloud was being monitored and that there was no operational impact to the airlines. However, two local airlines, South African Airways and Kulula.com, cancelled some flights to and from Cape Town International Airport and East London Airport on 18 June; operations later returned to normal. = Australia and New Zealand = MODIS Aqua image of the ash cloud over Tasmania At its greatest extent, strong winds had carried the ash cloud from Puyehue a great distance at high altitude, and the ash remained present for several days at distinct altitude bands between 20,000–35,000 feet over New Zealand and southern Australia, disrupting flights between Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth, and all of Tasmania and New Zealand. Initially Air New Zealand managed to avoid cancellations by flying their aircraft at lower altitudes (20,000 feet) in order to avoid ash, requiring 10% more fuel. Cancellations started by 15 June. Subsequently, Rob Fyfe of Air New Zealand hit back at malicious rumours from Australian airlines that continuing to fly was unsafe. Virgin Australia resumed flights to southern Australia by 13 June, but Qantas and its subsidiary Jetstar did not resume flights until 14 and 15 June because the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in Australia did not have the technology to determine the thickness of the plume. Losses for the airlines are expected to be in the millions. Flights to and from Perth were disrupted by the approaching plume of ash, extending from 15,000 to 35,000 feet. On 20 June flights were once again cancelled at Adelaide and Mildura airports. On 21 and 22 June flights to Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Newcastle, Wagga Wagga and Albury airports were cancelled due to the ash cloud. the ash cloud was expected to move from Australia to New Zealand. Economic and financial impact Macquarie Equities placed the cost of disruptions to airlines at A$21 million for Qantas and $11 million for Virgin Australia. The tourism industry was also impacted, costing A$15 million during the two-week period, with CEO John Lee of lobbying group Tourism & Transport Forum stating a daily cost of at least A$10 million as a result of complete closure of Sydney and Melbourne's main airports. The government of Neuquen province, Argentina, declared an economic emergency as the ash cloud was harming tourism and threatening livestock. The decree by provincial governor Jorge Sapag allowed those affected to claim for tax and other benefits. In Argentina ashes from Puyehue were advertised for sale and some were also used for making handicrafts. The intendant of Villa La Angostura assured that there were plenty of ideas of what to do with the ashes, among them bricks. In addition ashes were used to improve gravel roads around San Carlos de Bariloche.Las ingeniosas soluciones para deshacerse de las cenizas del cordón Caulle The president Cristina Fernández announced on national television plans to supply $2.41 billion to 1,400 farmers and businesses in the area affected by the ash cloud. They also plan to spend $7 million on the cleanup operation, and double social benefits, and defer tax payments for the hardest hit regions.

The BRAT called the Associated Press and took credit for the attack claiming it was protesting apartheid.Transnational Terrorism: a chronology of events by Edward F. Mickolaus Westport, Conn; Greenwood Press, 1980 p.258 BRAT's second and final action took place on September 20, 1971, when it placed bombs at the UN Missions of Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) and the Republic of Malawi. The Congo bomb was placed at the top of a stairway outside the door of the second floor office of the mission. The 11:33AM blasts' main force was downward and jolted a glass panel door off its hinges and sent flying glass onto three passers-by. Nobody in the mission was hurt, but Jodie Della Femina, the three-year-old daughter of Jerry Della Femina, was struck by the flying glass and suffered six facial lacerations to the eyelid, cheek, lip and chin, necessitating 2 hours of surgery and 75-100 stitches. She also lost an upper front tooth. Her nine-year-old brother Michael and mother Barbara sustained minor injuries. Shortly after the blasts the United Press International received a telephone message: > The Black Revolutionary Assault Team has just bombed the Congo mission. We > bombed it because it refused to allow our freedom fighters to cross their > country to get to Angola. The caller also claimed that the group had planted a bomb at the Malawi mission four blocks from the Congo site. The Malawian mission was evacuated as police found and defused a low-grade pipe bomb. Minutes before the Congo bomb exploded Larry Pearson, and eighteen-year-old black Louis Brandeis High School student rushed into a taxi operated by Marvin Ellias. Ellias noted that the youth was nervous and \\"acting suspiciously\\", and then he heard the explosion. The cab driver alerted his dispatcher through his car radio and then drove around until he found a traffic cop who arrested Pearson. After more than five hours of questioning, Pearson was charged with arson, possession of a bomb and a loaded weapon, and criminal mischief, and held on $50,000 bond.

It covers the area from the Laguna Cartegena to the north, to the Caribbean Sea to the south. From the Boqueron Forest to the west, to La Parguera to the east. It consists of a combination of volcanic rocks, completely crossed by serpentinite and amphibolite faults, which could well be the oldest known rock in Puerto Rico. The mountains were used by the Taíno people as refuge from the Spanish, and then by smugglers during the Spanish colonization. The Sierra Bermeja is the nesting place of many species that feed in the Laguna Cartegena. These hills are among a few forested areas of the southwestern coastal plain, characterized by its aridity. As a result, the Sierra provides the requirements for a large quantity of wildlife established in the area, many of it endangered. In 2015, volunteers searched the area for a meteorite that, according to NASA, may have landed in Sierra Bermeja. Development in the region had become a threat to the area, despite being one of the most important natural areas in Puerto Rico. In June 2018, funds were earmarked for universities in Puerto Rico to use for research of the Sierra Bermeja region.

It is one of the largest Muslim centres in Europe. The mosque is open to all, and its main prayer halls currently hold between 2,500 and 3,000 people during a Friday service, with over 15,000 worshippers walking through the Mosque's doors during the multiple services held on the religious festivals of Eid. History The North Manchester Jamia Mosque was started in 1975 by Qamaruzzaman Azmi, an Islamic thinker, orator, and writer. In 1975, Azmi began giving Dars-e-Quran at Shah Jalal Mosque (1A Eileen Grove, Rusholme) near Wilmslow Road, Manchester by travelling from Bradford every week. At that time, there were few Sunni Mosques in Manchester. Within a short period of time, the Victoria Park Mosque appointed a Sunni Imam. In 1979, the North Manchester Jamia Mosque started off under the leadership of Azmi at 25 Bellot Street, Cheetham Hill, Manchester which was a house converted into a mosque. As the facilities at this building were very limited and the growing population of Muslims needed facilities for Islamic activities on a larger scale, a plot of land was purchased in 1982 and the first phase of the mosque, consisting of the main prayer hall providing prayer facilities for 1,200 men and women, was completed in 1984. The second phase consisting of a College of Islamic Studies and additional prayer facilities for 1,200 people was built in the 1990s. The current third phase of the project is a major complex that will allow the mosque to hold prayer facilities for up to 10,000 people, a community hall, Imams' residence, a mortuary, office, library, and guest rooms. Impact Since its establishment, North Manchester Jamia Mosque remains the primary Muslim organisation in the north of Manchester and a focal point for the Manchester Muslim community, providing education for children and adults, lectures and seminars, mortuary, library along with daily prayer facilities. Professor Waqar Ahmed, who is the Chair of Nanotechnology and Advanced Manufacturing and Head of Institute of Nanotechnology and Bioengineering as well as Leader of Nanomedicine and Nanoengineering Research Group at the University of Central Lancashire, wrote in the book Tajjaliyat-e-Qamar: Prime Minister David Cameron along with Faiths Minister Baroness Sayeeda Warsi met with Chief Imam of the North Manchester Jamia Mosque, Allama Qamaruzzaman Azmi. It was his first visit to a UK mosque since he took power. Baroness Warsi said: “Jamia Mosque is a fantastic example of a model Mosque that reaches out to its community, providing vital services to the local Muslim population.\\" Students of the College There are well over 200 students enrolled at different levels.

She is described as an \\"apostle of Divine Mercy,\\" as is Saint Faustina Kowalska.Mamma Carmela - A Testimony of Love; Divine Mercy Publications; Australia, 2nd Edition, 2007.Mamma Carmela - Una testimonianza d’amore (in Italian) Biography =Early life= Carmelina Negri was born in the May 9, 1910,the daughter of Gaetano Negri and Teresa Galbiati. She was integrated in the Catholic Action movement, in which, through its enormous enthusiasm and eventually influenced by some members of her family, who accompanied her on the growth of living the faith in the spirit of prayer, the love for Jesus in the Eucharist, the devotion to Our Lady and service to the Catholic Church. In 1926, she completed her studies and began work in a bank. She met Giuseppe Carabelli, a virtuous and modest young man whom she married on January 23, 1935. They had both always wanted a large family who could convey the \\"Good News\\" of a higher love, like that of God. Within her large family she came to be called by the diminutive and tender name of \\"Mamma\\" Carmela. The Church-Shrine and the Convent of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina in San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy. In mid-September 1950, Carmela Carabelli made a trip to the convent of San Giovanni Rotondo where she met the supposedly stigmatized Capuchin friar and priest Padre Pio of Pietrelcina. She defined this trip as being \\"memorable\\" and it further increased her love for prayer and desire to do good. Carabelli became soon after one of Padre Pio's spiritual daughters. In January 1957, the first signs of disease were seen in her husband. In March 1959, Giuseppe Carabelli died. The Archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Giovanni Montini (later Pope Paul VI) pointed out the virtues of this unique and uplifting man, giving him his blessing.Note biografiche su Mamma Carmela (in Italian) =Mystic life= On March 14, 1968, thirty years after the death of Sister Mary Faustina Kowalska and in the year when the process of beatification of this nun was formally opened by the Vatican, Carabelli felt an \\"interior call\\" in her heart. From then until her death, she reported several interior locutions received directly from Jesus Christ, while \\"Merciful Jesus\\" and Our Lady under the title of \\"Mother of Divine Love\\".Mamma Carmela - A Testimony of Love; Divine Mercy Publications; Australia, 2nd edition, 2007. =Spiritual writings= Carabelli in her spiritual writings revealed her interior locutions with Jesus in which He allegedly supplied some mysteries about his life, about God the Father as the father of all mankind; about Our Lady, who in turn will spoke on the person of St. Joseph, among other divine mysteries. Through this privileged personality, Carabelli began to travel the world. Her writings were already translated into major languages and distributed in several countries. In a letter from Monsignor Pietro Santoro, Bishop of Termoli and later Archbishop of Campobasso-Boiano, addressed to the publication Fidelitas on January 9, 1972, he says of the spiritual writings of Carabelli: \\"These writings are truly rich in faith and holy ardor for the Divine Cause (...)

Attack The attack began when two Black September operatives infiltrated a party being held at the embassy.

It is also called the Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark, due to its musical representation of the American pioneers. It was composed for the Nebraska Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commission, the Lied Center for Performing Arts, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts. It is included as one of the concerti in Glass' Concerto Project, a four-volume collection of commissioned works. The work itself deals with the journey of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, interpreting the stages of their expedition progressively in each movement. Instrumentation The work is scored for the following Classical-size orchestra: * One Native American flute, one clarinet, one oboe, one bassoon * One trumpet, two horns in F * Bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, tambourine * Strings and solo piano Note that this orchestration is relatively small-scale in comparison to much of Glass' other symphonic work. Structure The work is in the standard three-movement concerto format, with the traditional fast- slow-fast tempo changes. As he discussed in regard to his earlier Violin Concerto, Glass did not use the conventional format as a cession to tradition, but rather as a tool for depiction of the specific concerto theme. = First movement: The Vision = The opening movement begins with a broad statement by the piano and orchestra, working in unison to form a collaboration of orchestral minor chords and a whirling series of piano triplets shifting between minor and major modes. The agitated introduction settles onto a simple but expressive main theme punctuated by the tambourine. After a short while the piece quietens into a quick piano solo, which soon develops into a mellow exchange between the piano and woodwinds. The movement builds in intensity with characteristic Glass octave leaps into a rhythmic and repetitive climax sponsoring a calling trumpet supported by rapidly shifting piano undertones. Gradually the climax declines until the snare and piano share two major-key progressions, signalling a short but fluid exit of instruments. The last to leave are the strings; the piano then concludes the movement alone in soft minor resolutions (in some ways similar to those finishing the cadenza of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto.) The subject matter of the first movement concentrates on the possibilities of the Lewis and Clark Expedition; Glass intends to indicate an amount of raw energy required for a \\"remarkable expedition\\" like that of the two men. Glass also wishes to convey a sense of structure and order, symbolizing the resolve of travelers; he does so by strictly controlling the energy expressed in the music, but allowing it to spark the thoughts of the listener beyond the confinement of rhythm.www.philipglass.com = Second movement: Sacagawea = Sacagawea, the subject of the second movement. Sculpture in Washington Park (Portland, Oregon), designed by Alice Cooper. The second movement is characterized by a soft flute theme representing Sacagawea, the Native American girl who aided the travelers during the harsh winter during their trek through the United States midwest. The movement opens with piano repetitions; the flute, joining quickly in the movement, proclaims an eerie theme. This suddenly shifts into a mild, playful exchange in which the piano and flute form a quick duet; this in turn develops into a climax, where shimmering strings support the flute, which continuously plays a growingly frantic two-note combination without resolution. Abruptly ending, the climax turns into a recapitulation of the original \\"Sacagawea\\" theme. The second part concludes with the lonely flute performing long, simple notes, and the piano playing almost indiscernible C major chords. The second part is only scored for flute, snare, strings, and naturally piano. Not only does Glass attempt to make an audible representation of Sacagawea, but he also makes a clear effort to emphasize the relationship between the figures. The times of playfulness are distinct from those of sombre exchange; these are meant to symbolize the productivity of the relationship as well as potential disagreements (both logistical and cultural) that the party may have had, respectively. The second movement is also notable in that it shows a distinct change in Glass' style, a statement supported by the fact that the piano mentions the characteristic triplet construction used by Glass in most of his work only once; this is stated as a connector into the final touches of the movement. = Third movement: The Land = The final movement begins quietly. All of the instruments excluded from the preceding movement are reintroduced. After a series of sullen string lengths, as well as quick woodwind undertone, the piano enters the movement uncommonly late-more than two minutes into play. After some time, the work begins to escalade until it reaches a climactic moment in the concerto, a point of unforeseen energy and enthusiasm. This is recapitulated multiple times before the movement reverts to its original minor mode introductory material. The concerto finishes with piano solo, sadly playing low F minor chords. The final part of the work is, perhaps, its most important. Glass comments: \\"I wanted this final movement to reflect also the expanse of time - what the land was before the expedition and what it became after.\\"www.philipglass.com/piano concerto no. 2 Glass emphasizes progression in this movement; this may be interpreted, in light of Glass' words, to be a movement of the country in and of itself, its successes and failures, and most importantly its Western expansion which was begun by the Lewis and Clark expedition. Premiere The concerto premiered in 2004 at the Lied Center for Performing Arts in Lincoln, Nebraska. The pianist was Paul Barnes. Playing the prominent flute part of the second movement was R. Carlos Nakai. The Omaha Symphony Orchestra provided for the rest of the scoring commands; the orchestra was conducted by Victor Yampolsky. The premiere was a success, although, due to its youth as a concerto, the work has not received the full scope of musical attention given to that of Glass' earlier work. Part of The Concerto Project The Concerto Project is a series of concerti written and collected by Glass in four volumes. This concerto was chosen to be included in Volume II of the collection. It is paired with the Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra on that disc. The recording of the work on the program is as follows: * 2004: Paul Barnes (piano) and Ralf Gothóni (with Northwest Chamber Orchestra), recorded 2006, released 2006 on The Concerto Project Vol. II (Orange Mountain Music) as \\"Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark\\" (35:26). Analysis = Relation to minimalism = Although Philip Glass dislikes the term \\"minimalist,\\" most of his work is categorized that way by the public; the Piano Concerto No. 2 is an example of a break from minimalism, in accordance with the composer's opinion of his own music (which he calls \\"classicist\\"). Although the repetitiveness which is associated with Glass' branch of minimalism (particularly in that of the triplet) is present in the concerto, there are, as in the progressively separatist Concerto for Cello and Orchestra written three years before, many differences. For example, the abovementioned flute involvement in the second movement displays almost no pertinence to minimalism: the part is varied and unpredictable, a clear distinction between the assumed minimalist norm and the actual piece. Similarly, the opening movement makes heavy use of abruptness and unclear musical expression; although this is arguably a decisively modern musical trait, it is incongruous with the current mode of minimalism. The piece is also considered to be an experimentation with World music; this is manifested in the frequent use of long, distant chords. = Representation of the expedition = The concerto is in such a format so as to convey a sense of movement, both in the music and its depiction, the expedition. The soloist premiering the piece, Paul Barnes, comments: \\"'The Land' is a gloriously expansive theme and variation reflecting the great vastness of the land explored by Lewis and Clark.\\"www.philipglass.com/piano concerto no. 2/\\"third movement\\" Glass wishes to describe the nation's nineteenth century stance of \\"manifest destiny\\", a policy largely initiated, if only indirectly, by the team's journey. Glass achieves this goal by infusing into the third movement a fully energetic high-point, with possible variation on American folk songs, a tradition from which the composer sometimes takes influence. The common use of long, sweeping major and minor chords can be interpreted as a tactic used to create the \\"distant\\" feel of the expedition, as well as the comparative strangeness of the world explored by the travelers. This stratagem is also employed as a conveyance of the apprehension the Americans probably felt, in addition to their presupposed feelings regarding the cultural differences of Western and Native American societies.

The tall dam, to be designed and constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the canyon between Huckleberry Mountain and Glacier View Mountain, would have flooded in excess of of the park. In the face of determined opposition from the National Park Service and conservation groups, the dam was never built. Proposal The Glacier View project was proposed after an earlier proposal by the Corps of Engineers and the Bonneville Power Administration to raise the level of Flathead Lake by increasing the height of Kerr Dam at its outlet was rejected, following local protests. Located in a relatively unpopulated area, the Glacier View reservoir would have flooded lower Camas Creek and would have raised the level of Logging Lake by , inundating much of the winter range for the park's white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer and moose.Corps of Engineers 1950 Columbia River and Tributaries Report 1950, p. 153 The proposed reservoir was to extend nearly to the Canada–US border, at an estimated cost of $94,962,000.Corps of Engineers 1950 Columbia River and Tributaries Report, p. 15 The dam was supported by Montana Representative Mike Mansfield and Flathead Valley interests, but was opposed by former Senator Burton K. Wheeler, local ranchers, the National Park Service, the Glacier Park Hotel Company, the Sierra Club, Society of American Foresters and the Audubon Society. Public hearings were held in 1948 and 1949. Turnout at the 1948 hearings at Kalispell was influenced by extensive flooding then occurring in the Flathead Valley.Corps of Engineers 1950 Columbia River and Tributaries Report, p. 152 Exploratory drilling took place in 1944 and 1945 at Glacier View and Foolhen Hill. The project was terminated by a joint memorandum between the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army on April 11, 1949, but Mansfield introduced an unsuccessful bill later in the year directing the Corps of Engineers to proceed with the dam, stating that the dam \\"would not affect the beauty of the park in any way but would make it more beautiful by creating a large lake over ground that ... has no scenic attraction.\\" The Corps of Engineers report on the project noted: > The park lands that will be inundated and required for freeboard of 5 feet > above normal pool elevation amounts to , or about 1 percent of the total > Glacier National Park area. This area does not lie within the rugged, > glacier-covered portion of the park for which it is noted, but rather is on > the western boundary line, in a little-used valley.

Although there would be some effect on the wildlife in the > area, the construction of Glacier View Reservoir would inconvenience but > relatively few people as it is situated in a sparsely populated area. Park Service Director Newton B. Drury responded: > The effects of the proposed impoundment of the North Fork of the Flathead > River upon Glacier National Park would be extraordinarily serious upon the > very values with the National Park Service is obliged by law, and expected > by the public, to protect ...

Drury went on to state that of land would be flooded, including virgin Ponderosa pine. In order to show that the area was of recreational value, the Park Service constructed the Camas Creek Road through the area. The dam was opposed by the Park Service and conservation organizations on principal as an intrusion into lands that had been made inviolate by their inclusion in a national park, with about a third of the reservoir located on Park Service lands.Corps of Engineers 1950 Columbia River and Tributaries Report, p. 150 The precedent established at Hetch Hetchy in Yosemite National Park was not to be repeated. A similar, more difficult fight followed over the proposed Echo Park Dam in Dinosaur National Monument. Related projects A related project, the Paradise project on the Clark Fork River just below its confluence with the Flathead, was opposed by local interests. The Paradise project was considered by the Corps of Engineers to be a more desirable project than Glacier Point, but was considered by the Corps to be difficult to develop compared to Glacier View, given the developed nature of the flooded area proposed at Paradise versus the relatively unpopulated Glacier View region. Other proposed dams were the Smoky Range, Canyon Creek and Spruce Park dams, none of which were built. Hungry Horse Dam was, however, completed in 1953 by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on the South Fork of the Flathead. The Spruce Park reservoir to the south of the park was proposed to have been connected to the Hungry Horse reservoir, with a power generation plant at the conduit's discharge. Paradise Dam is described by the Corps of Engineers as preferable from the point of view of the overall plan, standing on both the Clark Fork River and the Flathead, but the flooding of towns and productive agricultural lands stirred intense local opposition.Corps of Engineers 1950 Columbia River and Tributaries Report, p. 330 The 1950 Corps of Engineers report that detailed the Glacier View project also mentioned the potential of the Middle Fork Flathead River for development, and projected a dam at Belton, with a reservoir behind a dam developing of hydraulic head, for a potential generating capacity of 152 MW. As the Middle Fork forms the southwest boundary of Glacier National Park, any reservoir on the Middle Fork near Belton would necessarily flood portions of the park. With the rejection of the Glacier View project, the Belton project never progressed beyond its listing as a potential project.Corps of Engineers 1950 Columbia River and Tributaries Report, p. 303 Description Plans for the proposed dam The proposed Glacier View Dam was to be a high, long earth embankment dam, impounding a reservoir with a capacity of and covering an area of about . A gated spillway was to be built to the north side, feeding a tunnel through the abutment. A powerplant at the toe of the dam was planned to house three 70 MW generating units, fed by an intake tower and equipped with a surge tank.Corps of Engineers 1950 Columbia River and Tributaries Report, \\"Glacier View Project Plan and Sections\\" The chosen site was to be at river mile 176.5. Alternate sites at Fool Hen Hill (river mile 167) and Bad Rock Canyon (river mile 150) were rejected. The Fool Hen Hill site was found to have a permeable alluvial channel in the right abutment. The Bad Rock Canyon site would have been on the main stem of the Flathead and was also determined to have poor abutment rock, as well as alluvial deposits on the valley floor reaching up to deep. It would have flooded the Hungry Horse damsite, which was under construction, as well as Lake McDonald in the park. Present The Camas Road joins the Outside North Fork Road just to the east of the damsite. The Forests and Fire Nature Trail is just upstream from the site. The Logging Creek Ranger Station and the small town of Polebridge lie within the proposed reservoir. Within the park, the lower reaches of Camas Creek, Quartz Creek, Bowman Creek and Akokala Creek would have been flooded, along with most of Logging Creek and Logging Lake.

Death of Baby On April 11, 1989, teenage mother Sabrina Butler rushed her nine-month-old son, Walter Dean Butler, to the hospital after he suddenly stopped breathing. Doctors had attempted to resuscitate the child for thirty minutes, but failed, and Sabrina's baby died the same day. On April 12, 1989, the day after her son died, Sabrina was arrested and charged with Capital Murder. There were bruises left by her resuscitation attempts and the resuscitation attempted by the hospital. Trial Sabrina Butler's murder trial commenced on March 8, 1990. At the trial, prosecutors sought to prove that Sabrina's account of the events leading to her son's death were false, and that she had inflicted the fatal wounds intentionally. Sabrina Butler did not testify at her trial. Sabrina was convicted of both murder and child abuse following her trial, and even though she was only a teenager, she became the only woman on Mississippi's Death Row in 1990, condemned to die by lethal injection. Appeal Following her conviction, Sabrina filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Mississippi on several bases. The courts reversed and remanded her convictions on August 26, 1992. The court said that the prosecution had failed to prove that the incident was anything more than an accident. Retrial In 1995, Sabrina Butler's case went to retrial. By this time, more evidence emerged about how Sabrina did not murder her son. At the trial, one of Sabrina's neighbors had come forward with evidence that corroborated her account: that the injuries to her son occurred during the course of an unsuccessful attempt to administer CPR. In addition, the medical examiner changed his opinion about Walter's cause of death, which he now believed occurred due to a kidney malady. On December 17, 1995, Sabrina was acquitted and exonerated. Today When Sabrina was acquitted of murder, she had spent more than five years in prison and thirty-three months on death row. She is the first of two women in the United States to be exonerated from death row, the other being Debra Milke in Arizona. Today, she is living in the same Mississippi town in which she was convicted, has remarried, and is raising three children. She is now hoping to be a criminal investigator.

C. Tirulokchander. An adaptation of the Bengali novel Ulka by Nihar Ranjan Gupta, it stars Sivaji Ganesan in three roles and Jayalalithaa, with Sundarrajan, M. N. Nambiar, Nagesh, V. Nagaiah and Pandari Bai in supporting roles. The film is about a scarred man who attempts to reconnect with his estranged family. Following the 1957 film of the same name, Meri Surat Teri Ankhen (1963) and Thayin Karunai (1965), Deiva Magan is the fourth film adaptation of Ulka. Its screenplay is largely different from those of the earlier films, which were poorly received. The film was produced by Periyanna of Shanthi Films, photographed by Thambu and edited by B. Kanthasamy, and the dialogues were written by Aaroor Dass. Deiva Magan was released on 5 September 1969; it received critical acclaim, primarily for Ganesan's performance, and was a commercial success, running for more than 100 days in theatres. It won the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards for Third Best Film and Best Actor (Ganesan), and was the first Tamil film to be submitted by India in contest for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 1985, the film was remade in Kannada as Thayi Mamathe.  Plot  Shankar is a successful businessman who has an inferiority complex due to his scarred face. When his wife Parvathi gives birth to a son who is also scarred, Shankar asks the doctor Raju to kill the child to prevent him from experiencing the same pain Shankar has experienced throughout his life. Rather than kill the baby, Raju takes him to an ashram, where he is raised by its Baba and named Kannan. Shankar and Parvathi are oblivious to Kannan's existence. Kannan receives little affection growing up at the ashram. Meanwhile, his younger twin brother Vijay is raised with much fondness and pampering. Vijay falls in love with a girl named Nirmala, who rejects him. Vijay's friend Ananth regularly extracts money to construct a hotel, which Vijay manages to get for him. When Baba is dying, he tells Kannan he is not an orphan and to meet Raju to learn more about his past. Nirmala is revealed to be Raju's daughter. Kannan meets Raju, who is shocked to see his resemblance to Shankar. At first, Raju refuses to tell Kannan about his parents but consents after Kannan guarantees he will only see his parents without revealing his identity. Kannan enthusiastically goes to see his parents at night but Shankar shoots him, thinking he is a thief. Nirmala later reciprocates Vijay's love. Kannan has a chance meeting with Parvathi at a temple, but she does not recognise him. Parvathi tells Shankar what happened at the temple; Shankar believes it must be his firstborn and meets Raju, who confirms it. Shankar meets Kannan; he offers Kannan a large amount of money so he can live prosperously but does not invite him to live with them. Kannan rejects the money, saying he is content to know his parents. Vijay comes and asks his father for money; Kannan, who is hiding in a cupboard, gestures Shankar to give the rejected money to Vijay. In the meantime, Ananth wants more money from Vijay, so he kidnaps Vijay and demands a large ransom from Shankar. When Shankar is about to leave with the ransom money, Kannan asks to go instead. Shankar refuses so Kannan knocks him out and goes to the planned meeting disguised as Shankar. Kannan rescues Vijay and kills Ananth but is mortally wounded in the process. Shankar, Parvathi and the police arrive at the scene of the shooting. Kannan dies in the arms of his mother, who accepts him as her son.

Nagaiah as the Baba * Pandari Bai as Parvathi * Vijayasree as Julie  Production  = Development = The Bengali novel Ulka by Nihar Ranjan Gupta had been adapted for the screen three times; a 1957 Bengali film by the same name, a Hindi film called Meri Surat Teri Ankhen (1963) and a Tamil film titled Thayin Karunai (1965), all of which failed commercially. Despite the films' poor performances, director A. C. Tirulokchander was interested in adapting the novel and wrote a screenplay that was largely different from those of the previous films. The film was produced by Periyanna of Shanthi Films, and the dialogues were written by Aaroor Dass. The cinematographer was Thambu, the editor was B. Kanthasamy, and the art director was A. Balu. The film's working title was Uyiroviyam before it was retitled Deiva Magan. Sivaji Ganesan portrayed three roles; Shankar and his sons Kannan and Vijay. This was the second time Ganesan has portrayed three roles in one film; the first occasion was Bale Pandiya (1962). For the characterisation of Kannan, he drew inspiration from Quasimodo, the protagonist of Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (1831), making Kannan aggressive with \\"roughness and brute strength\\", while Vijay's body language was taken from that of C. V. Sridhar. = Filming = Periyanna initially wanted to the film to be made in colour but it was filmed in black and white at Ganesan's suggestion. The makeup for the scarred characters portrayed by Ganesan was done by R. Rangasamy and his son Jayanth Kumar. Rangasamy gave Ganesan's characters different looks; Shankar's look is sophisticated while Kannan was given a slightly darker skin tone than Vijay's. The original idea was for Kannan to resemble Quasimodo in the 1939 adaptation of The Hunchback of Notre Dame but Ganesan insisted the filmmakers reduce the character's unattractiveness after trying out prosthetics. He wanted viewers to sympathise with Kannan for his shortcomings without feeling repulsed by the character. Kannan is a sitar player but Ganesan did not know how to play the instrument; he pretended to play it instead. There were difficulties in filming the scene in which Kannan is hiding in a cupboard and gestures to Shankar to give a cheque to Vijay; the scene required Ganesan to change his look between takes because the camera could not be moved, meaning he had to stand in one spot, mouth his lines, quickly change his attire and makeup to play the second character, stand in the same place and act. To ease the process, he asked Tirulokchander to stand in for him. Kanthasamy told Tirulokchander this seven-minute-long scene needed trimming but after re- watching it several times, Tirulokchander refused because he could not find what to cut and liked the way Ganesan performed as the three characters. The final cut of the film was initially ; after five cuts by the Censor Board, it was brought down to .  Music  The soundtrack to Deiva Magan was composed by M. S. Viswanathan and the lyrics were written by Kannadasan. The song \\"Deivame Deivame Nandri Solven\\" is Ganesan's homage to politician C. N. Annadurai, which is evident when it is played over a scene where Kannan screams \\"Anna\\". Kannadasan wrote the pallavi for a song. Tirulokchander and the others liked it, so Kannadasan completed writing the song and had a meeting where they listened to it. When an office boy came to serve them coffee, Kannadasan asked him whether he liked the song. The boy said though the song sounded good, he did not understand the meaning. Immediately, Kannadasan told Viswanathan to compose a different tune so he could write different lyrics. Despite those present objecting, Kannadasan persisted, resulting in the creation of the song \\"Kettadhum Koduppavane Krishna\\". The song, like many of Kannadasan's other songs, praises the Hindu god Krishna as \\"a simple god that responds to a poor man's prayer\\". The songs \\"Kaadhal Malar Kootam\\" and \\"Kaathalikka Katrukollungal\\" also became popular.  Release  Deiva Magan was released on 5 September 1969. Despite being released just four weeks after another Ganesan film, Nirai Kudam, it was a critical and commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres. The release of Ganesan's films Thirudan and Sivandha Mann in the following months also did not affect Deiva Magan theatrical run. It was later remade in Kannada as Thayi Mamathe (1985). = Reception = According to the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan, most films in which one actor portraying multiple roles often have problems like impersonation and identity confusion, but the lack of these problems in Deiva Magan was an achievement for the director. The reviewer praised Ganesan's triple-role performance, mainly that of Vijay, and also appreciated Jayalalithaa's performance but said Pandari Bai was under-used. The reviewer concluded the filmmakers had tried to build a hall with only one pillar and that pillar was Ganesan. The Indian Express reviewer praised Ganesan's performance as Shankar, along with the performances of Pandari Bai and Nagesh, but said the latter had \\"little to do with the story\\". The reviewer praised the set designs, Thambu's cinematography, and Viswanathan's music, concluding that Tirulokchander \\"can relax for having directed a successful commercial melodramatic film\\". After watching the film, C. V. Sridhar appreciated Ganesan's performance as Vijay, saying only he \\"could have done it so beautifully\\". = Accolades = At the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, Deiva Magan won the Third Best Film award and Ganesan won the Best Actor award. The film was selected as India's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film nomination for the 42nd Academy Awards; it was the first Tamil film to be submitted by India in the Best International Feature Film category.

Former Transportation History curator at the Smithsonian Institution William L. Withhuhn described the locomotive's historical and cultural significance: > Sierra Railway No. 3 has appeared in more motion pictures, documentaries, > and television productions than any other locomotive. It is undisputedly the > image of the archetypal steam locomotive that propelled the USA from the > 19th century into the 20th. Built in 1891, the locomotive returned to operation in July 2010 after a fourteen-year absence from service and a three-year-long overhaul, requiring the replacement of its original boiler. History Sierra Railway #3 on the P&AC.; The locomotive, a 4-6-0 ten-wheeler, was built by the Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works of Paterson, New Jersey. Construction of the locomotive was completed on March 26th, 1891, and it was given Rogers construction number 4493. It has cylinders, driving wheels and weighs in working order. It was built for the Prescott & Arizona Central Railway (P&AC;) as their locomotive #3 and named W.N. Kelley after the company's treasurer. The P&AC; went bankrupt in 1893 and its owner, Thomas S. Bullock, relocated to California bringing much of his railroad equipment, including the No. 3. He then entered into a partnership with Prince André Poniatowski and William H. Crocker, and together in 1897 they incorporated the Sierra Railway Company of California to connect Oakdale, California with the timber producing regions of Tuolumne County and Calaveras County. The locomotive became Sierra No. 3 (dropping the W. N. Kelley name) and played a key role of the construction of the railroad to Jamestown, California in 1897, Sonora, California in 1899 and Tuolumne, California in 1900. It was the primary locomotive pulling freight trains on the railroad until 1906, when the Sierra Railway purchased a new Baldwin Locomotive Works 2-8-0 locomotive. It played a significant role in logging, mining and dam building operations in the Sierra foothills. Originally built to burn coal, the locomotive was converted to burn oil sometime between 1900 and 1902. Sierra No. 3 was involved in several wrecks. In February 1898, a switch mishap killed conductor William G. Bailey. In September 1899, its tender derailed while backing up on a trestle, causing it to collapse. No. 3's 1918 derailment that destroyed the original wooden cab. The locomotive turned on its side in 1918 just above Sonora, destroying its original wooden cab, which was replaced with a second-hand steel Southern Pacific Railroad cab in February 1919. Two years later, Sierra No. 3 made her first known Hollywood film appearance, in a silent film The Terror starring Tom Mix. During the Great Depression, the Sierra Railway went into bankruptcy, and was reorganized as the Sierra Railroad Company in 1937. Sierra No. 3 was taken out of service in 1932, and sat on a siding in the Jamestown yard for 15 years. It managed to avoid being scrapped during World War II, and again received attention from Hollywood in 1946, when David O. Selznick, the producer of Duel in the Sun being filmed on the Sierra Railroad, proposed to destroy her in a train wreck scene for the movie. The Sierra Railroad's Master Mechanic Bill Tremewan persuaded the railroad ownership not to consider a notion so \\"ridiculous\\", and instead shop crews restored the locomotive to operation for potential charter and movie service. Damaged smokestack used in the locomotive explosion scene in Back to the Future Part III. Inspection of the boiler proved it was in serviceable condition, however the resulting work required a reduction of the Maximum Allowable Working Pressure from . The rebuild was completed in 1948, and the locomotive officially returned to service heading a Railway and Locomotive Historical Society sponsored excursion train on May 30. Over the next half-century, Sierra No. 3 pulled tourist excursion trains and appeared in dozens of films, TV shows, and commercials. Among them were High Noon in 1952, for which Gary Cooper won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and Unforgiven, starring and directed by Clint Eastwood, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture for 1992. The locomotive was often redecorated for various movie and television appearances, one of its most famous roles being the Hooterville Cannonball from the mid-1960s series Petticoat Junction. False smokestacks were also often installed to alter the appearance of the locomotive. In 1979, Crocker and Associates announced their intention to sell their interest in the railroad to Silverfoot, Inc. based in Chicago, but the deal did not include the locomotive facilities in Jamestown. The complex, including Sierra No. 3, was acquired by the State of California as a result of legislation passed in April 1981, and signed by Governor Jerry Brown. The acquisition was completed on September 15, 1982, and since then, the locomotive has been the property of the State of California. In 1995, the Federal Railroad Administration issued new safety standards for steam locomotive boilers. In order to comply with these revised regulations, Sierra No. 3 was removed from service until a complete evaluation of the locomotive's condition could be made. 21st-century renovation Sierra Railway No. 3's original boiler that was replaced during a rebuild, photo taken 2011 Preliminary repairs were completed in 2000–2001 with deferred maintenance funding from the State of California. This included dismantling the locomotive. The project progressed very slowly until 2007, when a major fundraising campaign began. At that time, the budget for the project was estimated at US$600,000, based on the assumption that the existing boiler could be saved. In a fundraising appeal, Clint Eastwood described Sierra No. 3 as \\"like a treasured old friend.\\" Eastwood had ridden the locomotive early in his career on the TV series Rawhide, and later used the locomotive in his own movie productions Pale Rider and Unforgiven. Eastwood wrote, \\"Sierra No. 3 resides at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park. It is housed in the original roundhouse which is still in use. Together these two assets provide a rare opportunity to experience history just as it was 109 years ago.\\" Funding for the renovation project was provided by the California Cultural and Historical Endowment, the Irving J. Symons Foundation, the Sonora Area Foundation, the California State Parks Foundation, the Teichert Foundation, DuPont and many individual donors. Sierra No. 3. hauling its first train on July 3, 2010, after its overhaul The rebuild included boring out the cylinders and turning the drive wheel tires on a lathe. When work on the disassembled locomotive resumed, and the boiler was inspected thoroughly by ultrasound testing, it was discovered that a new boiler was necessary. Its old lap seam design made retrofitting it to modern standards too costly, and the risk of the boiler losing its historical integrity was a risk Railtown staff decided not to take. Engineering drawings and other technical assistance needed to build a new boiler were provided by the Strasburg Rail Road in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The old boiler was shipped to be used as a pattern to the Chelatchie Boiler Works of Camas, Washington, which fabricated a new welded boiler at a cost of US$600,000. The boiler was then shipped to the historic Southern Pacific shops in Sacramento, California and fitted on the original frame. The locomotive was then trucked back to Jamestown, California for final assembly. The current configuration of the locomotive represents her appearance during the year 1929, when the movie The Virginian was filmed and provided the first known evidence of the presence of \\"3-spot's\\" steel cab.

An anonymous caller had warned police Arrests and prosecution Police made their first arrest in connection with Cuban Power when they arrested Ricardo Morales Navarrette on February 14. Navarette was a veteran of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and allegedly worked with the CIA to aid the anti-Communist underground in Cuba and had even been sent to the Congo to help anti-Communist forces in 1964. On August 13, police raided a Johnsonburg, New Jersey farm seizing a half ton of dynamite, automatic weapons and ammunition, as well as a uniform of one of the guerrilla groups involved in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Michael A. DeCarolis, 32, was arrested.Mickolaus pg. 96 A federal grand jury handed down an indictment for nine Cuban exiles on Thursday, October 10 in Miami. They were arrested and charged the next day. The testimony of Navarette was reportedly key to breaking the case. Three of the exiles, Orlando Bosch, Jose Diaz Morejon and Barbaro Balan Garcia were charged with the September 16 shooting of the Polanika. Bosch was also charged with making terroristic threats in a June 6 cable sent to Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Francisco Franco and President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz of Mexico threatening to blow up their countries ships if they continued to trade with Cuba. The six others were indicted for conspiracy to violate the neutrality acts of the US. J. Edgar Hoover announced this was the group connected with the bombings, but none were charged with crimes relating to the bombing. The other six were Aimee Miranda Cruz, Andres Jorge Gonzalez Gonzalez, Marco Rodríguez Ramos, Paulino Mariono Gutierrez Vidal, Jorge Luis Gutierrez Ulla and Jesus Dominguez Benitez. A second arrest of nine other exiles took place in New York on October 23. The nine arrested in New York were indicted for arson, reckless endangerment, criminal mischief and Illegal possession of weapons and explosives. According to the indictment the bombing were only the first phase of their plot. They planned to seize arms from the 16th Infantry armory in Brooklyn and use them for an assassination and bombing campaign that would have included the assassination of Ambassador Ricardo Alarcón. Those arrested included Oscar Avecedo, Gabriel Abay (both veterans of the Bay of Pigs), Guillermo Miguel, Arturo Rodríguez Vives, Jose Rodone, Ivan Acosta, Ramiro Cortés, Edgar Rives and Carlos Fernández.

Prather (b. 1868), a prominent businessman of the Whidbey Island cooperative community of Freeland, Washington.LeWarne, Utopias on Puget Sound, 1885-1915, at page 119. Shortly after Alverene was completed, the vessel was seriously damaged in a docking accident that occurred on August 16, 1912, at Everett. The accident caused by the much larger steel-hulled steamship Sioux. In 1914 Alverene was providing regular service to the community of Greenbank, Washington. After World War I (1914-1918), Alverene was operated by Capt. William H. Kasch (1872-1926), president of Kasch Transportation Company out of Anacortes, Washington, on routes to points I the San Juan Islands. In 1920, the vessel was repowered with a Fairbanks-Morse oil engine. Another source describes Alverene as being powered with a semi-diesel engine. In the mid-1920s, ferries began to be operated on the San Juan routes. These ferries, backed first by Crosby Marine Corporation, and later by the powerful Puget Sound Navigation Company presented a serious challenge to the companies operating small passenger and freight vessels, such as Kasch Transportation, that had been servicing the islands since the early 1900s. Eventually the small companies were driven out of business.Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats – A Legend on Puget Sound, at pages 133 and 150.

It is a Fourier-space method so devices and fields are represented as a sum of spatial harmonics. Floquet's theorem The method is based on Floquet's theorem that the solutions of periodic differential equations can be expanded with Floquet functions (or sometimes referred as Bloch wave, especially in solid-state physics community). A device is divided into layers that are each uniform in the z direction. A staircase approximation is needed for curved devices with properties such as dielectric permittivity graded along the z-direction. The electromagnetic modes in each layer are calculated and analytically propagated through the layers. The overall problem is solved by matching boundary conditions at each of the interfaces between the layers using a technique like scattering matrices. To solve for the electromagnetic modes, which are decided by the wave vector of the incident plane wave, in periodic dielectric medium, the Maxwell's equations (in partial differential form) as well as the boundary conditions are expanded by the Floquet functions and turned into infinitely large algebraic equations. With the cutting off of higher order Floquet functions, depending on the accuracy and convergence speed one needs, the infinitely large algebraic equations become finite and thus solvable by computers. Fourier factorization Being a Fourier-space method it suffers several drawbacks. Gibbs phenomenon is particularly severe for devices with high dielectric contrast. Truncating the number of spatial harmonics can also slow convergence and techniques like fast Fourier factorization (FFF) should be used. FFF is straightforward to implement for 1D gratings, but the community is still working on a straightforward approach for crossed grating devices. The difficulty with FFF in crossed grating devices is that the field must be decomposed into parallel and perpendicular components at all of the interfaces. This is not a straightforward calculation for arbitrarily shaped devices. Boundary conditions Boundary conditions must be enforced at the interfaces between all the layers. When many layers are used, this becomes too large to solve simultaneously. Instead, we borrow from network theory and calculate scattering matrices. This lets us solve the boundary conditions one layer at a time. Almost without exception, however, the scattering matrices implemented for RCWA are inefficient and do not follow long standing conventions in terms of how S11, S12, S21, and S22 are defined. A paper was recently published that identified this problem and presented a correct and efficient formulation of scattering matrices for both RCWA and the method of lines. See S-matrices Other methods exist like the enhanced transmittance matrices (ETM), R matrices, H matrices, and probably more. ETM, for example, is considerably faster but less memory efficient.  Applications RCWA analysis applied to a polarized broadband reflectometry measurement is used within the semiconductor power device industry as a measurement technique to obtain detailed profile information of periodic trench structures. This technique has been used to provide trench depth and critical dimension (CD) results comparable to cross-section SEM, while having the added benefit of being both high-throughput and non-destructive. In order to extract critical dimensions of a trench structure (depth, CD, and sidewall angle), the measured polarized reflectance data must have a sufficiently large wavelength range and analyzed with a physically valid model (for example: RCWA in combination with the Forouhi-Bloomer Dispersion relations for n and k). Studies have shown that the limited wavelength range of a standard reflectometer (375 - 750 nm) does not provide the sensitivity to accurately measure trench structures with small CD values (less than 200 nm). However, by using a reflectometer with the wavelength range extended from 190 - 1000 nm, it is possible to accurately measure these smaller structures. RCWA is also used to improve diffractive structures for high efficiency solar cells. For the simulation of the whole solar cell or solar module, RCWA can be efficiently combined with the OPTOS formalism.

In 1996, Imamoglu et al. proposed such a novel type of coherent light source and explained the concept based on an effect closely related to Bose–Einstein condensation of atoms: A large number of bosonic particles (here: polaritons) form a condensate in a macroscopically occupied quantum state via stimulated scattering. The condensate of polaritons finally provides coherent emission of light. Thus, it is a coherent light source that owns a different working mechanism compared to conventional laser devices. Owing to its principle, a polariton-laser promises a more energy- efficient laser operation. The typical semiconductor structure for such a laser consists of an optical microcavity placed between distributed Bragg reflectors. An early demonstration of polaritonic lasing and a comparison to conventional lasing was achieved in 2003 by H. Deng et al. at Stanford University under optical excitation (Polaritonic condensation was later fully linked to dynamical Bose–Einstein condensation in 2006 by Kasprzak et al.). However, electrical pumping of a polariton laser—crucial for a practical use of polaritonic light sources—was not demonstrated until 2013. Eventually, one decade later, the first and unambiguous demonstration of an electrically pumped polariton-laser was recently presented by a team of researchers from the University of Michigan and by a team from University of Würzburg together with their international partners using the similar techniques. At this stage, the electrically driven device operates at very low temperatures around 10 K and needs a magnetic field applied in the Faraday geometry. In 2007, even room temperature operation of an optically pumped polariton laser was demonstrated,Johnston, Hamish (27 May 2007). \\"Polariton laser reaches room temperature.\\" Physics World. promising the development of future electrically pumped polariton lasers for room temperature application. It is important, and challenging, to distinguish polaritonic lasing from conventional (photonic) lasing, owing to the similar emission characteristics. A crucial element of the success by both teams lies in the hybrid nature of polaritons whose matter component (excitons) exhibits a sensitive response to an external magnetic field. The Michigan team led by Pallab Bhattacharya used a combination of modulation doping of the quantum wells in the active region, to enhance polariton-electron scattering, and an external magnetic field to enhance the polariton-phonon scattering and the exciton -polariton saturation density. With these measures they achieved a comparably low polariton lasing threshold of 12 A/cm2 (published in Physical Review Letters in May 2013). The investigations performed by the team in Würzburg, having started with the idea of engineering an electrical device in 2007, led to the desired effect after a few years in cooperation with their international partners from the U.S., Japan, Russia, Singapore, Iceland and Germany. Finally, their studies were complemented by a crucial experiment in a magnetic field: an unambiguous verification of the emission-mode's matter component in the polaritonic laser regime was given, yielding a first-time experimental demonstration of an electrically pumped polariton laser by C. Schneider, A. Rahimi-Iman and co- authors in the team of S. Höfling (published in Nature in May 2013).

They are distinct from coherent light sources (lasers) and thermal light sources such as incandescent light bulbs. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that a state with an exact number of photons of a single frequency cannot be created. However, Fock states (or number states) can be studied for a system where the electric field amplitude is distributed over a narrow bandwidth. In this context, a single-photon source gives rise to an effectively one-photon number state. Photons from an ideal single-photon source exhibit quantum mechanical characteristics. These characteristics include photon antibunching, so that the time between two successive photons is never less than some minimum value. This is normally demonstrated by using a beam splitter to direct about half of the incident photons toward one avalanche photodiode, and half toward a second. Pulses from one detector are used to provide a ‘counter start’ signal, to a fast electronic timer, and the other, delayed by a known number of nanoseconds, is used to provide a ‘counter stop’ signal. By repeatedly measuring the times between ‘start’ and ‘stop’ signals, one can form a histogram of time delay between two photons and the coincidence count- if bunching is not occurring, and photons are indeed well spaced, a clear notch around zero delay is visible. History Although the concept of a single photon was proposed by Planck as early as 1900, a true single-photon source was not created in isolation until 1974. This was achieved by utilising a cascade transition within mercury atoms. Individual atoms emit two photons at different frequencies in the cascade transition and by spectrally filtering the light the observation of one photon can be used to 'herald' the other. The observation of these single photons was characterised by its anticorrelation on the two output ports of a beamsplitter in a similar manner to the famous Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment of 1956. Another single-photon source came in 1977 which utilised the fluorescence from an attenuated beam of sodium atoms. A beam of sodium atoms was attenuated so that no more than one or two atoms contributed to the observed fluorescence radiation at any one time. In this way, only single emitters were producing light and the observed fluorescence showed the characteristic antibunching. The isolation of individual atoms continued with ion traps in the mid-1980s. A single ion could be held in a radio frequency Paul trap for an extended period of time (10 min) thus acting as a single emitter of multiple single photons as in the experiments of Diedrich and Walther. At the same time the nonlinear process of parametric down conversion began to be utilised and from then until the present day it has become the workhorse of experiments requiring single photons. Advances in microscopy led to the isolation of single molecules in the end of the 1980s. Subsequently, single pentacene molecules were detected in p-terphenyl crystals. The single molecules have begun to be utilised as single-photon sources. Within the 21st century defect centres in various solid state materials have emerged, most notably diamond, silicon carbide and boron nitride. the most studied defect is the nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that was utilised as a source of single photons. These sources along with molecules can use the strong confinement of light (mirrors, microresonators, optical fibres, waveguides, etc.) to enhance the emission of the NV centres. As well as NV centres and molecules, quantum dots (QDs), functionalized carbon nanotubes, and two-dimensional materials can also emit single photons and can be constructed from the same semiconductor materials as the light-confining structures. It is noted that the single photon sources at telecom wavelength of 1,550 nm are very important in fiber-optic communication and they are mostly indium arsenide QDs. However, by creating downconversion quantum interface from visible single photon sources, one still can create single photon at 1,550 nm with preserved antibunching. Exciting atoms and excitons to highly interacting Rydberg levels prevents more than one excitation over the so called blockade volume. Making small ensembles and crystals could act as a single photon emitters.  Definition  In quantum theory, photons describe quantized electromagnetic radiation. Specifically, a photon is an elementary excitation of a normal mode of the electromagnetic field. Thus a single-photon state is the quantum state of a radiation mode that contains a single excitation. Single radiation modes are labelled by, among other quantities, the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation that they describe. However, in quantum optics, single-photon states also refer to mathematical superpositions of single-frequency (monochromatic) radiation modes. This definition is general enough to include photon wave-packets, i.e., states of radiation that are localized to some extent in space and time. Single-photon sources generate single-photon states as described above. In other words, ideal single-photon sources generate radiation with a photon- number distribution that has a mean one and variance zero.  Characteristics  An ideal-single photon source produces single-photon states with 100% probability and optical vacuum or multi-photon states with 0% probability. Desirable properties of real-world single-photon sources include efficiency, robustness, ease of implementation and on-demand nature, i.e., generating single-photons at arbitrarily chosen times. Single-photon sources including single emitters such as single atoms, ions and molecules, and including solid- state emitters such as quantum dots, color centers and carbon nanotubes are on-demand. Currently, there are many active nanomaterials engineered into single quantum emitters where their spontaneous emission could be tuned by changing the local density of optical states in dielectric nanostructures. The dielectric nanostructures are usually designed within the heterostructures to enhance the light-matter interaction, and thus further improve the efficiency of these single photon sources. Another type of source comprises non- deterministic sources, i.e., not on demand, and these include examples such as weak lasers, atomic cascades and parametric down-conversion. The single-photon nature of a source can be quantized using the second-order correlation function g^{(2)}(\\\\tau). Ideal single-photon sources show g^{(2)}(0) = 0 and good single-photon sources have small g^{(2)}(0). The second-order correlation function can be measured using the Hanbury-Brown–Twiss effect. Types The generation of a single photon occurs when a source creates only one photon within its fluorescence lifetime after being optically or electrically excited. An ideal single-photon source has yet to be created. Given that the main applications for a high-quality single-photon source are quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters and quantum information science, the photons generated should also have a wavelength that would give low loss and attenuation when travelling through an optical fiber. Nowadays the most common sources of single photons are single molecules, Rydberg atoms, diamond colour centres and quantum dots, with the last being widely studied with efforts from many research groups to realize quantum dots that fluoresce single photons at room temperature with photons in the low loss window of fiber-optic communication. For many purposes single photons need to be anti-bunched, and this can be verified. = Faint laser = One of the first and easiest sources was created by attenuating a conventional laser beam to reduce its intensity and thereby the mean photon number per pulse. Since the photon statistics follow a Poisson distribution one can achieve sources with a well defined probability ratio for the emission of one versus two or more photons. For example a mean value of μ = 0.1 leads to a probability of 90% for zero photons, 9% for one photon and 1% for more than one photon. Although such a source can be used for certain applications, it has a second-order intensity correlation function equal to one (no antibunching). For many applications however, antibunching is required, for instance in quantum cryptography. Heralded single photons Pairs of single photons can be generated in highly correlated states from using a single high-energy photon to create two lower- energy ones. One photon from the resulting pair may be detected to 'herald' the other (so its state is pretty well known prior to detection). The two photons need not generally be the same wavelength, but the total energy and resulting polarisation are defined by the generation process. One area of keen interest for such pairs of photons is QKD. The heralded single-photon sources are also used to examine the fundamental physics laws in quantum mechanics. There are two commonly used types of heralded single-photon sources: spontaneous parametric down-conversion and spontaneous four-wave mixing. The first source has line-width around THz and the second one has line-width around MHz or narrower. The heralded single photon has been used to demonstrate photonics storage and loading to the optical cavity. References Bibliography * R.

Best known for its horror- inspired lyrics, Ice Nine Kills formed in its earliest incarnation in 2000 by high school friends Spencer Charnas and Jeremy Schwartz. The group originally pursued a style of ska-punk but have since shifted into a style which has been described as theatricore, metalcore, melodic hardcore, post-hardcore, heavy metal, symphonic metal. Charnas is currently the only remaining founding member. To date, Ice Nine Kills has released three EPs: The Burning, 2 Song Acoustic and The Predator. Five full-length studio albums: Last Chance to Make Amends, Safe Is Just a Shadow, The Predator Becomes the Prey, and their most successful albums to date; Every Trick in the Book, which peaked at #122 on the US Billboard 200 and their most recent, The Silver Scream which peaked at number #29, released on the fifth of October 2018. Their band name is derived from the fictional substance ice-nine from the science fiction novel Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut.  History  = 2000–2009: Formation and Last Chance to Make Amends = Ice Nine Kills was founded in 2000 under the name \\"Ice Nine\\" by high school friends Spencer Charnas and Jeremy Schwartz, before later recruiting drummer Grant Newsted in 2003 and swapped out their then- bassist (Patrick Morse) for Hobie Boeschenstein in 2004, but changed their name to Ice Nine Kills just before releasing their debut independent album Last Chance to Make Amends on April 20, 2006. However, they did record a demo, entitled \\"The Pop-Punk-Ska Years\\", in 2002, which would eventually be released in 2009. The following year on November 20, 2007, Ice Nine Kills released their EP, The Burning through Red Blue Records. The band then set out on several national tours in support of the EP including opening slots on tours with I See Stars and Eyes Set To Kill among others. By 2008, the group had been invited to open for well-known acts such as As I Lay Dying, A Day To Remember, Thursday, Paramore and a one off performance on the Taste of Chaos 2009 tour. That same year, Ice Nine Kills released 2 acoustic tracks (\\"The Simple Act of Giving Up\\" and \\"Lifetime in a Week\\") on an EP titled 2 Song Acoustic. In mid 2009, Schwartz decided to leave the band after struggling with life on the road, leaving Charnas as the only original member. Charnas then recruited former members of the Rochester NY based post-hardcore band Remember Tomorrow which had recently disbanded and stopped playing rhythm guitar. This shifted Ice Nine Kills' sound into more of an experimental metalcore sound to which Ferret Music took notice and signed the band in the spring of 2009 and after their appearance on Warped Tour 2009 the band began writing and recording their next record. = 2010–2013: Safe Is Just a Shadow and The Predator = Former guitarist Justin Morrow (left) and deceased bassist Shane Bisnett (right) performing live in 2011. Ice Nine Kills released their second full-length album Safe Is Just a Shadow on July 12, 2010. Vocalist Dave Sieling, who has since left the band, contributed clean vocals along with Spencer Charnas. The album received praise from heavy metal magazine, Revolver in the 2010 Hottest Chicks in Rock Issue and subsequently the band was invited to attend the Revolver Golden Gods awards in Los Angeles CA on April 20, 2010. The band supported Safe Is Just a Shadow with a two-week appearance on Warped Tour 2010, and a supporting slot with Michigan-based nu metal band Taproot. The band performed on a headlining tour in the summer of 2011 as well as a performance at the Darien Lake NY stop of Warped Tour 2011 on the Dzambo Stage.

In 1910, Ermolenko-Yuzhina returned to the Mariinsky, where she performed from 1910 to 1913, and again, from 1915 to 1920. She performed at the Bolshoi in 1913, 1916, and 1919, and she also with Sergei Diaghilev’s enterprise, and in various European opera houses, before the First World War. For her performance in the Marina Mnizhek (opera Boris Godunov; 1908, Paris, Opéra national de Paris) she was presented with the Legion of Honour. Ermolenko-Yuzhina was considered to be the leading Russian lyric-dramatic soprano of her day, with a repertoire of more than thirty roles, including Brunnhilde, Norma, Violette and Carmen.

He grew up a man of Russian culture. From childhood he liked music and especially opera. He received the profession of engineer, but a passion for opera has won and he decided to open an opera troupe. In 1896/1897, Alexey Tsereteli opened an opera enterprise in Kharkov. Theater critic once noted the successful staging of the new company. Very soon, he continued to work in St. Petersburg and creates a New Opera (ru: «Новая опера») and, despite competition from the Mariinsky Theatre, his productions are popular. Worked there not only well-known Russian singers, but the famous European singers came. In 1905, Titta Ruffo came to participate in several performances. In 1907/08 A. Tsereteli organized tours of Feodor Chaliapin in America. In 1917, A. Tsereteli left Russia. In 1921 he began to create an opera-ballet troupe in Barcelona, then - in Paris. In his company worked many famous Russian singer-emigrants. In 1926 he organized a performance of The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya at the Opéra national de Paris. In 1929 he joined his company with a troupe of Russian opera of Maria Nikolaevna Kuznetsova and her husband Alfred Massenet (Jules Massenet's nephew).

In one of the productions of the opera Prince Igor in London in 1933 Feodor Chaliapin played two roles at once: Galitsky and Konchak (Russian sources call another date of this representation: June 5, 1931, Lyceum Theatre, London ru: Biographical Encyclopedia // Marya Davydova). However, the owners of company quarreled and filed their claims in court, causing Private Company to eventually disband. After this happened, Tsereteli tried to work with other partners, but failed to rebuild his success. Before his death, Tsereteli bequeathed all the props of his troupe to the \\"theater of the future of a free Georgia\\". But his will was not recognized as valid and the property went to auction.

The Vancouver Canucks started play in the 1970–71 season as an expansion team and the Calgary Flames started play during the 1980–81 season as a relocated team from Atlanta (Atlanta Flames). This rivalry is notable in that both teams have played each other in three overtime game sevens in the playoffs, more than any other pair of teams in the NHL. History The Canucks and Flames first met in the first round of postseason play in , which was the first playoff series victory by the Canucks, en route to the Finals, , , during the Flames championship season of , and 1994, with Calgary holding a one game lead. The latter two series were decided in seven games by overtime goals (Joel Otto for Calgary and Pavel Bure for Vancouver) and coincidentally both managed to reach the Stanley Cup Finals during those seasons (with Calgary winning the cup in ). In the early and mid-90s, the rivalry was considered among the most intense in the NHL, with the two teams often battling for top spot in the Smythe and later Pacific Division. However, it started to fade soon afterward as both teams started to sink in the standings in the late 1990s. It was during the season when the rivalry re-ignited, with the Canucks and Flames constantly battling for the top spot in the Northwest Division along with the Colorado Avalanche. When Canucks captain Markus Naslund and Flames captain Jarome Iginla developed into two of that era's greatest players, the rivalry became one of which team had the better overall leader. Between the beginning of the century and Naslund's departure from the Canucks in 2008, the spotlight would often be featured on both he and Iginla whenever the teams matched up. During the season, the two found themselves competing for the Art Ross Trophy for the league's highest point scorer. The following year, both players were featured in a Nike commercial promoting the rivalry between them. These two teams met again during the first round of the 2004 postseason, and, just like in 1989 and 1994, the series-winning goal was scored in overtime in game seven, this time by Calgary's Martin Gelinas (who incidentally was a member of the 1994 Canucks team that reached the Stanley Cup Finals). The Flames advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, becoming the first Canadian team to reach that far since the 1994 Canucks. However, unlike 1989, but alike Vancouver in 1994 by the New York Rangers, they were defeated by the Lightning in seven games. The subsequent trade by Vancouver for netminder Roberto Luongo in June 2006 gave the Canucks a capable opponent to Calgary's Miikka Kiprusoff, who had already established himself as one of the top goalies in the NHL. Players from both teams bring out their best when they play against each other, resulting in games of high entertainment value. In addition to the duel between Luongo and Kiprusoff, matchups between former Vancouver defenceman Willie Mitchell and Flames captain Jarome Iginla were also noteworthy. The two teams reignited the rivalry on January 18, 2014 at Rogers Arena when the game started with a line brawl after the opening faceoff. Flames coach Bob Hartley started his fourth line that included tough guys Brian McGrattan and Kevin Westgarth. Interpreting it as a danger to his usual first line, Canucks coach John Tortorella sent his own fourth line onto the ice in response. As soon as the puck dropped, all ten skaters on the ice paired up and began fighting. It lasted several minutes before the referees got it under control with 8 players being ejected including Canucks forward Kellan Lain who was playing in his first NHL game. While the players fought, Tortorella and Hartley had a heated verbal exchange across the benches. During the first intermission, Tortorella angrily confronted the Flames in the hallway and continued to berate them as they went to their dressing room before players and staff from both teams broke it up. The Canucks would end up winning the game 3-2 in a shootout. In 2015, the two teams met in the playoffs for the first time since 2004. Game 2 of this series saw multiple fights break out with 1:17 left in the third period resulting in a total of 132 penalty minutes. Deryk Engelland of the Flames was given the instigation penalty as well as 3 game misconducts, however the League retracted the penalty and instead fined Bob Hartley $50,000 for instigating the fight. The Canucks would win the game 4–1, but it was the Flames who came out victorious in the series, winning in six games. Later that year, enforcers Micheal Ferland (Flames) and Derek Dorsett (Canucks) fought immediately after the opening faceoff of the . The Flames' Brandon Bollig and Canucks' Brandon Prust squared off eight minutes later. A few years later, in the opener of the , the Flames’ Travis Hamonic fought the Canucks’ Erik Gudbranson. Hamonic suffered a facial fracture and was placed on IR, but returned later in October.

Formed in 2007 it currently consists of Adrian Gougov (main songwriter, lead guitar, lead vocals, and piano), Dimo Mezekliev (bass and backing vocals) and Matey Hristoskov (drums and backing-vocals). The style of the band could be defined as \\"aggressive, energetic, progressive rock with a melodramatic twist in it.\\" The band has played at festivals in Bulgaria and the UK, as well as in most of the big venues in their home country, with over 50 performances to date. Viperfish have released one EP - Viperfish EP - and three singles - \\"Explosive\\", \\"Right Where I Belong\\" and \\"Hope of Relief\\". History Although the band has had a number of different line-ups, the realistic and proper starting point would be the arrival of Matey behind the drums in 2007. With only a couple of rehearsals behind their backs, they entered a battle of the bands competition in Sofia and won second place, therefore winning themselves a spot at the big annual Bulgarian festival \\"Tzvete za Gosho\\". In 2008, the band claimed the Grand Prix and two more awards at the Nessebar Pop & Rock Competition, defeating over 40 other bands and performers. Since then Viperfish (previously performing as 'Evolution') began playing frequently in most of Sofia's clubs and made a name for themselves in the underground scene as one of the most aggressive and energetic live bands around. In December 2009 the band recorded six tracks and put them together into Viperfish EP. One of the songs, \\"Stain\\", topped Z-Rock Radio's Main chart for 12 consecutive weeks. The band was featured in the Bulgaria edition of Rolling Stone as one of the four most prominent rock acts in the country at that time. In 2010, a music video was shot for \\"Explosive\\". The trio decided that this event was just what they needed to change their name to Viperfish and give a fresh start to everything. Two years later they won another award at the Nessebar Pop & Rock Festival for best original music. In the beginning of 2011 the band recorded and released two new songs which can be found on their website. In the summer of 2011 Viperfish played at the biggest international festival in Bulgaria: Spirit of Burgas, along with Deftones, Moby, Skindred and many others. In the summer of 2012 Viperfish made a memorable performance at Vasil Levski National Stadium as the opening act for the Sofia Rocks 2012 festival. Unfortunately this would be their last gig to date as Adrian would come to suffer from a vocal cord infection that has left him unable to sing. Following that concert the band has gone on an indefinite hiatus with no clarity on whether a reunion is ever taking place. Releases =Album= Viperfish EP was Viperfish's debut EP, having been recorded in 2009 and released on Christmas Day the same year. The songs included are what the band thought were their most representative tracks at the time. Stanislav Donev (who produced the album) considered that 'Stain' best captured the full spectrum of styles present on the EP and therefore it was selected as the first single. The track stayed at the top of the Bulgarian Kamenitza Top 40 Rock Chart on Z-Rock radio for nearly four months. The EP consists of: * Explosive * Me vs Me * Nothing to Gain * Something Someone * Stain * Invisible =Singles= \\"Explosive\\" is the second single to be released from Viperfish's debut EP. (\\"Stain\\" was released as the first single). It was made available on a single CD backed with a remix, a radio edit, the \\"Live @ Swingin' Hall\\" video and an interview the band did specifically to include on the single. \\"Explosive\\" is arguably Viperfish's most popular track, largely due to the accompanying video. \\"Right Where I Belong\\" and \\"Power of Love\\" are two tracks that were recorded in January 2011. The idea behind the recordings was to experiment working in a different studio and to explore the heavier, more brutal side of the band. While \\"Power of Love\\" was a relatively old track, having been played throughout the whole of 2010, \\"Right Where I Belong\\" was a brand new track, which Adrian wrote less than a month earlier. The initial idea wasn't to make the sound as heavy as it turned out to be, but it was eventually decided to do so just to see what the fans' reaction would be. \\"Hope of Relief\\" is a song that was inspired by and devoted to the victims of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan. The track was once again recorded with Stanislav Donev at Retro Studios, and so far this is the only Viperfish track that has never been performed live. \\"Hope of Relief\\" marks the first time the band released a song for digital distribution. =Other= \\"Celebrity\\" is a track created as a home record in 2008. It has never been professionally re-recorded or, in any way, remastered, but it has been a constant part of the bands setlist between 2008 and 2012.

Among some of the most important achievements of the expedition were the discovery and subsequent introduction in Europe of a number of new plants that did not exist in the Old World, but that quickly gained acceptance and become very popular among European consumers, such as the Pineapple, Cocoa, Corn, and many others. Expedition In 1570 Hernández was appointed Archiater physician for the New World and commended by the King to embark on a scientific expedition to study the region's medicinal plants. Hernandez set sail for the New World in August 1571, taking along his son, and landed in February 1572 in Veracruz. For three years he toured Mexico and Central America together with a geographer, painters, botanists and native doctors, collecting and classifying botanical specimens. He also studied the culture and medical achievements of the native Nahua peoples, taking notes and preparing numerous illustrations assisted by three indigenous painters who had been baptized as Antón, Baltazar Elías and Pedro Vázquez. Pineapple fruit Among the botanical specimens the expedition discovered were the Pineapple, Cocoa (known by the locals as Cacahuatl), Corn, Guaiacum officinale, Smilax regelii, Strychnos nux-vomica (known by the locals as Mahuatl Quauhtlepatli), sweet granadilla, passionfruit, and several plants with hallucinogenic properties used in rituals such as the Peyote, Maguey, Datura or the Devil's weed. From March 1574 until his return to Spain in 1577, Hernandez lived in Mexico where he carried out medical tests using the plants he had gathered and put together a large botanical collection and studied local medicinal practices and archeological sites. In 1576 during the epidemic (referred to as cocoliztli, Nahuatl for \\"pest,\\" during the colonial-period population decline of the Aztecs,) Hernández performed autopsies in the Hospital Real de San José de los Naturales in collaboration with surgeon Alonso López de Hinojosos and physician Juan de la Fuente. Hernandez described the gruesome symptoms of with clinical accuracy. These included high fever, severe headache, vertigo, black tongue, dark urine, dysentery, severe abdominal and thoracic pain, large nodules behind the ears that often invaded the neck and face, acute neurologic disorders, and profuse bleeding from the nose, eyes, and mouth, with death frequently occurring in 3 to 4 days. Alt URL He also worked on Castilian translation of a treatise on natural history by Pliny the Elder. The result was an impressive work, composed of 24 books on plants, one about the fauna, one on minerals, and ten volumes of paintings and illustrations that were brought to Spain to be published. José de Acosta calculated that the total cost of the expedition represented about 60,000 ducats, an enormous sum at the time. Publications Hernández returned to Spain in 1577 carrying with him a large number of seeds and live plants. He prepared a brief introduction that was printed, but died before he could see his complete work published. All the material had been preserved at the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo del Escorial, where a large part of his original manuscript was lost in a fire almost a century later. Because Hernández's work included numerous descriptions of unknown plants and names that appeared incomprehensible, King Philip II appointed Nardo Antonio Recchi, Archiater physician of Napoles, to prepare a compilation of the texts for publication. Recchi grouped all descriptions of plants into eight groups according to their common morphology and differentiated those plants that were believed to be useful to cure what was then known in Spain as \\"The French Disease\\" that had infected millions in Europe. However, after Recchi died his work remained unpublished and was ultimately purchased by Federico Angelo Cesi, an Italian scientist, naturalist, and founder of the Accademia dei Lincei. The compilation was finally published in Mexico in 1615 as Quatro libros de la Naturaleza, y virtudes de las plantas y animales que están reunidos en el uso de Medicina en la Nueva España, y el Método, y corrección, y preparación, que para administrallas se requiere con lo que el Doctor Francisco Hernández escribió en lengua latina by the Dominican priest Francisco Ximénez, who had managed to obtain a copy of the Latin manuscript prepared by Recchi. Rerum medicarum Novae Hispaniae thesaurus Federico Cesi published a heavily redacted a compendium of Recchi's Latin version in Rome on 1628, titled Rerum medicarum Novae Hispaniae thesaurus, with notes and additions by Johann Schreck, Fabio Colonna, Johann Schmidt, and Cesi himself. After Cesi's death another edition was published in 1648 by Johannes Schreck and Fabio Colonna as Nova plantarum, animalium et mineralium mexicanorum historia a Francisco Hernández in indis primum compilata, de inde a Nardo Antonio Reccho in volumen digesta. Another compilation by physician Casimiro Gómez Ortega, based on additional material found in the Colegio Imperial de los Jesuitas de Madrid was published in 1790 under the name Francisci Hernandi, medici atque historici Philippi II, hispan et indiar. Regis, et totius novi orbis archiatri. Opera, cum edita, tum medita, ad autobiographi fidem et jusu regio. The finding of the material greatly helped convince King Charles III of Spain, to authorize a major botanical expedition that was to be known as the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Spain led by Martín Sessé y Lacasta. His works were also translated to English in 2000 under the title The Mexican Treasury: The Writings of Dr. Francisco Hernández, accompanied by Searching for the Secrets of Nature: The Life and Works of Dr. Francisco Hernández that contains information about the life and works of Hernández.

Description and ecology Red-headed ash borers typically reach adult length, have long antennae which are thickened towards the tips, and have the rear and middle pairs of legs elongated. The reddish-brown coloration with four bands of contrasting yellow stripes and the general body shape mimics wasps, which is a common survival tactic among cerambycids. Adults emerge from infested trees in early spring, typically ash, hickory and oak, but also use other hardwoods and sometimes shrubs and woody vines. The larvae feed on the sapwood of the dead tree, with several generations possible over the summer before overwintering again, probably in the pupal stage.  Significance  The red-headed ash borer usually develops in recently dead or dying hardwood trees, so the most common impact on humans is damage to felled trees intended for hardwood lumber or firewood. These insects are commonly brought into homes with firewood and may emerge, but do no physical damage to the home. This species has been known to infest weak or newly planted living trees and is a pest of nursery stock in some areas. The feeding of the larvae may cut off sap flow, and in some cases weaken the trunk of young trees making them more susceptible to wind damage. In natural settings, red-headed ash borers contribute to healthy forests by hastening the decomposition of dead and dying timber, making more nutrients and space available for healthy plants.

It was the chief city of a district Cibyratis. Strabo Strabo writes that the Cibyratae () were called descendants of the Lydians, who once occupied the Cabalis, but also of the neighboring Pisidians. He also mentions that the Cibyratae spoke four languages: Pisidian, Solymian, Greek, and Lydian.Strabo, Geography, § 13.4.17 History It grew powerful under a good constitution, and the villages extended from Pisidia and the adjoining Milyas into Lycia, and to the Peraea of the Rhodians. When the three neighbouring towns of Bubon, Balubura, and Oenoanda were joined to it, this confederation was called Tetrapolis. Each town had one vote, but Cibyra had two votes; for Cibyra alone could muster 30,000 infantry and 2000 cavalry. It was always under tyrants, but the government was moderate. The tetrapolis formed under the leadership of Kibyra during the 2nd century BC, was dissolved by the Roman general Lucius Licinius Murena in 83 BC, at the time of the First Mithridatic War. Balbura and Bubon were assigned to the Lycians. The conventus of Cibyra, however, still remained one of the greatest in Asia. The Cibyratae had four languages, the Pisidian, the Hellenic, the language of the Solymi and of the Lydians. It is also the place where, according to Strabo, the Lydian language was still being spoken among a multicultural population around his time (1st century BC), thus making Kibyra the last locality where the culture, by then extinct in Lydia proper according to extant accounts, is attested. It was a peculiarity of Cibyra that the iron was easily cut with a chisel, or other sharp tool.see Groskurd's Note, Transl. Strab. vol. ii. p. 633, where he unnecessarily make a distinction between τορεύεσθαι and τορνεύεσθαι). Location Strabo does not fix the position of Cibyra precisely. After mentioning Antiochia on the Maeander as being in Caria, he says, to the south the great Cibyra, Sinda, and the Cabalis, as far as Taurus and Lycia. Ptolemyv. 3. places Cibyra in Great Phrygia, and assigns the three cities of Bubon, Balbura, and Oenoanda to the Cabalis of Lycia, which is consistent with Strabo. The place is identified by inscriptions on the spot. The ruins cover the brow of a hill between 300 and 400 feet above the level of the plain. The material for the buildings was gotten from the limestone in the neighbourhood; and many of them are in good condition. One of the chief buildings is a theatre, in fine preservation: the diameter is 266 feet. The seats command a view of the Cibyratic plain, and of the mountains towards the Milyas. On the platform near the theatre are the ruins of several large buildings supposed to be temples, some of the Doric and others of the Corinthian order. On a block there is an inscription, , from which it appears that in the Roman period the city had also the name Caesarea. The name appears on some of the coins of Cibyra. A large building about 100 yards from the theatre is supposed to have been an Odeum or music theatre. There are no traces of city walls.

The hill side was partly excavated to make room for it; and on the side formed out of the slope of the hill were ranged 21 rows of seats, which at the upper extremity of the stadium turned so as to make a theatre-like termination. This part of the stadium is very perfect, but the seats on the hill side are much displaced by the shrubs that have grown up between them. The seats overlook the plain of Cibyra. The seats on the side opposite to the hill were marble blocks placed on a low wall built along the edge of the terrace, formed by cutting the side of the hill. Near the entrance to the stadium a ridge runs eastward, crowned by a paved way, bordered on each side by sarcophagi and sepulchral monuments. At the entrance to this avenue of tombs was a massive triumphal arch of Doric architecture, now in ruins.

It produces corn. The sites of Balbura, Bubon, and Oenoanda, which is on the Xanthus, being now ascertained, we can form a tolerably correct idea of the extent of the Cibyratis. It comprised the highest part of the basin of the Xanthus, and all the upper and probably the middle part of the basin of the Indus, for Strabo describes the Cibyratis as reaching to the Rhodian Peraea. The great range of Cadmus (Baba Dagh), said to be 8000 feet high, bounded it on the west, and separated it from Caria. The upper part of the basin of the Indus consists of numerous small valleys, each of which has its little stream. Pliny's brief descriptionv. 28. has been derived from good materials: the river Indus, which rises in the hills of the Cibyratae, receives sixty perennial rivers, and more than a hundred torrents. Livy Cibyra is first mentioned by Livyxxxviii. 14. in his history of the operations of the consul Cn. Manlius, who approached it from the upper part of the Maeander and through Caria. He probably advanced upon it by the valley of Karaook, through which the present road leads from the Cibyratis to Laodicea on the Lycus. Manlius demanded and got from Moagetes, the tyrant of Cibyra, 100 talents and 10,000 medimni of wheat. Livy says that Moagetes had under him Syleum and Alimne, besides Cibyra. This Alimne may be identified with the remains of a large town on an island in the lake of Gule Hissar, which island is connected with the mainland by an ancient causeway. This lake lies in the angle between the Caulares and the river of Cibyra. The last tyrant of Cibyra, also named Moagetes, was the son of PancratesPolyb. xxx. 9. He was put down by L. Licinius Murena, probably in 84 BC, when his territory was divided, and Cibyra was attached to Phrygia. Pliny Pliny states that twenty-five cities belonged to the Jurisdictio or Conventus of Cibyra; and he adds that the town of Cibyra belonged to Phrygia. This, like many other of the Roman political arrangements, was quite at variance with the physical divisions of the country. Laodicea on the Lycus was one of the chief cities of this Conventus. Under the Romans, Cibyra was a place of great trade, as it appears (Hor. Ep. i. 6. 33). Its position, however, does not seem very favourable for commerce, for it is neither on the sea nor on a great road. We may conclude, however, that the Roman negotiatores and mercatores found something to do here, and probably the grain of the valley of the Indus and the wool and iron of Cibyra might furnish articles of commerce. Iron ore is plentiful in the Cibyratis. We know nothing of any artists of Cibyra, except two, whom Cicero mentions (Verr. ii. 4. c. 13), who were more famed for their knavery than for artistic skill. Cibyra was much damaged by an earthquake, in the time of Tiberius, who recommended a Senatus Consultum to be enacted for relieving it from payment of taxes (tributum) for three years. In this passage of Tacitus (Ann. iv. 13), it is called civitas Cibyratica apud Asiam. Inscriptions Three Greek inscriptions from Cibyra are printed in the Appendix to Spratt's Lycia. All of them contain the name of the city, and all belong to the Roman period. One of them seems intended to record a statue, or some memorial set up in honour of Lucius Aelius, the adopted son of Hadrian, and it mentions his being in his second consulship dating the inscription to 137.Smith, W.

In the 2017 National Student Survey, NCH achieved student satisfaction scores above Russell Group universities and London universities, beating London members of the elite Russell Group in 26 out of 27 categories. In May 2014 it was reported that independent research that replicated the annual HEPI academic experience survey showed that the College's academic experience had exceeded the expectations of 63% of its students. This was more than twice the comparative statistic (28%) for Russell Group university students of humanities and social sciences in the HEPI 2014 annual student experience survey. The same research also showed that NCH students experienced 40% more contact time than their peers at Russell Group universities, that they completed twice as many assignments, and that they received feedback on their assignments in person more than twice as often.

The Economist wrote that there is a market for the idea because of the increasing number of qualified British students who fail to get into their university of choice, in part because of pressure on the top universities from the Office for Fair Access to increase the number of students from state schools; they added that \\"a 'toffs’ college' of well-heeled Oxbridge near-misses is a provocative concept.\\"\\"One very New College, at a price\\", The Economist, 9 June 2011.

Simon Jenkins wrote that the country's professors, lecturers and student trade unionists were \\"united in arms against what they most hate and fear: academic celebrity, student fees, profit and loss, one-to-one tutorials and America.\\" Grayling responded to the criticism by arguing that NCH is trying to keep humanities teaching alive. He said he felt persecuted by the negative reaction: \\"My whole record, everything I have written, is turned on its head. Now I am a bastard capitalist. It is really upsetting. ...

Bickley Founder's Award for his pioneering and lasting contribution to the theory, practice, and education of insurance and risk management. Kahane is active in both the academic and business areas. He is a professor of insurance and finance, Faculty of Management, and Head of the Akirov Institute for Business and the Environment, Tel-Aviv University. He founded and served as dean of the first academic school of insurance in Israel (now a part of Netanya Academic College). At Tel Aviv University he directed the Erhard Insurance Center, the actuarial studies program, and coordinated the Executives Development Programs. He is a life and non-life actuary. Since 1966, Kahane has taught at universities around the globe, including, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Texas at Austin, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the University of Florida, and the University of Toronto. He founded and directed the Israel CLU Program. He has organized and lectured in hundreds of seminars and conferences. Kahane, the author of several books and numerous articles, was ranked among the most prolific researchers in insurance (JRI, June 1990). Risk Management for Enterprises and Individuals, 2009 (coauthored with E. Baranoff and P. Brockett, Flat World Knowledge) is becoming the leading textbook in the area. His studies in risk management, and his practical business experience, led him to realize the importance and urgency of environmental risks issues. In the late 1960s, H. Levy and Kahane were among the pioneers who applied multiple regressions for insurance rate-making. In the early 1970s, he developed the concept of balancing assets and liabilities of financial intermediaries, in works that are still quoted 35 years later. These studies laid the foundations of theories of insurance rate making, solvency, insurance regulation, and to the vast area which is now known as ERM – Enterprise Risk Management. He has made major contributions to the theory and practice of loss reserving, agriculture and crop insurance, and the use of data mining in insurance. In 1982, he consulted a project to increase food production in Latin American countries. The pivot to the plan was developing the then practically non- existent agricultural reinsurance plans, that enabled to supply insurance protection for the farmers' crops. The coverage was then used to guarantee the financing that was needed for acquiring better agricultural technologies. This helped to increase the agricultural reinsurance market from about $15 million to multiple billions, and at the same time to drastically increase the agricultural output of the entire continent, to better feed hundreds of millions people. Kahane also has a rich entrepreneurial experience. He is a co-founder, director, and major shareholder in Ituran Location and Control (NASDAQ:ITRN). He was a co-initiator of the concept of “new” balanced pension funds in Israel, and was the co-founder and co-owner of the managing firm of the first fund (Teshura), that became the fourth largest fund in Israel. He is highly involved in the formation and management of start-up companies in a variety of advanced and high-tech areas, specializing in seed money investments. He owns the Weizman Hi-Tech Incubator, and is a co-owner of Capital Point Ltd. (traded on TASE) which owns Ofakim and Katzrin technological incubators. In addition he is involved in many voluntary NGOs activities (e.g., Chairman of the Association of Visually Impaired People in Sharon District, the PIBF - Palestinian International Business Forum, etc.). He started his business career in a large multinational corporation, and in the management of various businesses. In addition he served as a consultant on risk management, insurance and actuarial and financial topics to the government, large organizations, and major companies both in Israel and internationally. Kahane has served on the Israeli Insurance Council and on several government committees on a variety of insurance topics. Kahane earned a bachelor's degree in economics and statistics in 1965, a master's degree in business administration, cum laude, in 1967, and a PhD in finance in 1973, all from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He has served as an associate editor of the leading journals on risk and insurance. He has taught courses in technological forecasting (the first teacher of this subject in Israel), finance, insurance, risk management, and actuarial topics. His research focus is on the portfolio implications for insurance, rate-making, automobile insurance, natural hazards, pension and life insurance, reserving, and environmental risks. Summary Kahane is an influential figure in the insurance industry and in the actuarial profession, as seminal thinker, a prominent insurance educator and researcher, an entrepreneur (in both academic, insurance, and technological areas) and as advisor to companies. He is an internationally renowned pioneer of new concepts and ideas (e.g., in the area of balancing asset and liability portfolio, new rate making and reserving techniques, insurance under inflationary circumstances, insurance of natural risks in agriculture, etc. ). He was involved in the foundation of actuarial groups in Israel, Portugal, and in the former Soviet Union countries, and he has a unique impact on the insurance industry in Israel – through the establishment of new insurance schools, and through the involvement in almost any important insurance issue for more than four decades. He is also a celebrated author and speaker who challenged the industry to implement innovations, and has been ranked among the most prolific researchers in insurance. Accomplishments Kahane is an active entrepreneur in both the academic and business worlds. His activities have had a substantial impact on the insurance industry, especially in Israel. His main contributions lie in the following areas: *Pension Plans in Israel. He was involved in reforming the capital markets in Israel, which had a great impact on pension funds and providence funds. He was among the first to draw attention to the accumulating actuarial deficits of the pension funds, and to show ways to solve the problem. Following that, he was among the initiators of new non-union pension schemes for large segments of the population (e.g., for the members of the kibbutz movements). This led to the establishment of the new concept of “balanced pension funds.” Kahane was a co-founder and owner of the first managed balanced pension fund (“Teshura”) at the end of the 1980s (this fund became the fourth largest fund in Israel in 1995). The idea had been copied by other newly formed funds, and was adopted by the Commissioner of Insurance as the leading model for the post-1995 pension reform in Israel. *Location and Prevention of Car Theft. He co-founded Ituran Location and Control, a firm that uses cellular communication technology to track any object (e.g., car) or person. Its products are used to prevent car theft and hijacking, and to locate people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. The firm was established in 1995, and is now traded on the major list of Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and on Nasdaq (ITRN). The system is used in Argentina, Brazil, Florida, and Israel, where it has been a major factor in fighting auto theft. *No Fault Automobile Insurance. A driving force in the introduction of a pure no-fault automobile insurance system (for bodily injuries only) in Israel (1976), Kahane conducted the first feasibility study and the setting of the initial rate structure for this line of business, and provided counsel to a parliamentary committee that was studying the topic. Later, he was in charge of determining the loss reserves for this line by employing modern and sophisticated actuarial techniques that have been the key for setting no-fault automobile insurance rates in Israel for three decades. *Natural Risks in Agriculture. He served as a consultant in a large project to increase food production in Latin America in the 1980s (in IICA Costa Rica, financed by the US AID). Part of the project involved insurance that enabled farmers to obtain financing for improved agricultural technologies. A key issue was to set up national agriculture insurance companies in most Latin American States, and to obtain reinsurance (at the undeveloped agriculture reinsurance market in those days). Besides its impact on food production, this led later to the development and growth of the world agriculture insurance and reinsurance markets. Through his activities at the PIBF (Palestinian International Business Forum) Kahane initiated the adoption of a similar approach for the Palestinian Authority, and this project is now in its implementation stages. He had a substantial impact on the setting of rates and terms of the insurance coverage for IFNRA (the Israeli Fund for Insurance of Nature Risks in Agriculture – now named “KANAT”) - for the entire agricultural sector in Israel - as a director for 10 years, and as a consulting actuary since then. *His studies on portfolio approach for the balancing of assets and liabilities of financial intermediaries, set the foundations for the concept of ERM (Enterprise Risk Management). *Shaping the Israel Social Security System. Kahane twice served as the chairman of strategic committees for the National Insurance Institute (Israel's social security), which determined the financing of the social security system. *Membership in National Committees. *Israel Insurance Council (a statutory appointment) *National committee on earthquake risks *National pension policy committee (Shtessell Committee) *Research and database committee for the prevention of traffic accidents. *Committee on the status of the Israeli Social Security System (Brodet Committee) Insurance Education Kahane is recognized as a leader of insurance education worldwide. Some have called him “the Israeli Huebner” for activities such as the following: *Established the Israel Academic School of Insurance (1995) with the Israeli Association of Insurance Companies, and served as its first dean. This is the only accredited insurance BA program in Israel. The school is now a part of Netanya Academic College and has hundreds of graduates. *Participated in forming the actuarial group in: **Portugal: conducted the first two actuarial programs for the Association of Portuguese Insurers. **Former Soviet Union countries: taught in the Actuarial Summer School at the University of Warsaw. *One of the founders of the CLU (Israel) program in 1984, and director of the program for twenty years. Created under a license from the American College (USA) and set up as a joint venture of the Insurance Agents' Association of Israel and the College of Insurance (a branch of the Association of Insurance Companies). *Participated in the first programs on Social Security, health insurance, and insurance portfolio management at Ljubljana University in Slovenia, immediately after Slovenia became independent. *Taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1966–73, 1975–77), Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (1970-2), the University of Florida (1973-4), The University of Toronto (1974-5), IESA in Caracas, Venezuela (1979, 1981), The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania (1981-2), and the University of Texas at Austin - where he served as the visiting Blades Professor of Risk Management and Insurance. He has also presented courses in other schools outside Israel. *For many years has chaired the only Risk and Insurance Department in Israel, at Tel Aviv University, and directed the Erhard Insurance Center. The Graduate School of Business of Tel Aviv University was ranked for years among the top business schools outside the USA. The Insurance Department has been ranked among the top ten in the world, according to several publications (Journal of Risk and Insurance, June 1990), despite its small faculty. *He directed the actuarial program at Tel Aviv University 1977-79. Approximately a third of the actuaries in Israel were his students. * For more than three decades he has organized many seminars (typically 3-10 every year), on a variety of specific insurance topics, often with guest speakers from abroad. *He has presented hundreds of lectures in a large variety of forums: universities, government organizations, trade unions, insurance and non-insurance firms, pension funds, banks, etc. He presented invited lectures in many countries besides Israel (excluding international scientific conferences), including Canada, Japan, Portugal, Slovenia, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Venezuela, United Kingdom, and the USA. *Served as a moderator in some International Insurance Society meetings since 1979, and presented papers at the IIS Research Round table. *The recent textbook Risk Management for Enterprises and Individuals (co- authored with E. Baranoff, P. Brockett) is the first risk management textbook that can be read freely on the internet (published in 2009 by FlatWorldKnowledge.com NY, NY), http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/printed- book/1635 Leading Researcher in Insurance Kahane’s contribution in research and the theory of insurance since the early 1970s has mainly been on the borderline between finance and actuarial studies. Following are his major areas of contribution. References to articles described below are found in his vitae at: http://recanati.tau.ac.il/~kahane =Financial and Portfolio Models in Insurance= Kahane has been among the developers of the concept of balance sheet immunization in non-life insurance. (See, for example, B-5, B-9, B-10, B-16, B-17, B-21, B-30, B-35, B-36, B-41, B-45, B-52, B-55, B-57, B-61, B-62, and D-1 Reference numbers to the resume in the web site). Due to the correlation between the performance of investment activities and the underwriting results, the investment and underwriting activities (portfolios) have to be managed simultaneously. The portfolio models developed by him have many implications for the managements of insurance company, the selection of the optimal product mix, ratemaking and solvency. A paper written jointly with Dave Nye on this topic (JRI 1975), received an award for being an article that withstood the test (and teeth) of time. Some of these articles are still quoted after 25–30 years. Other papers in this group deal with sophisticated theoretical financial problems: optimization of life insurance company operation, competitive and complementary relationships between insurance policies and financial instruments (which explain the strong competition expected between insurance and banking industries), optimal consumption investment and insurance decisions, etc. =Investment income in insurance ratemaking= The development of the concept and theoretical formulae which show how investment return and risk should affect insurance rates (B-12, B-14, B-24, D-13). One of the immediate implication of insurers’ assets and liabilities portfolio management is in the area of ratemaking. The insurers practically “borrow” money from the insureds. If the insurance transaction was risk-less, the loading should have been negative and equal to the risk-free interest rate. However, since the transaction is risky, the loading formula has to be adjusted to the risks. Kahane has been writing and presenting papers on this topic since 1975. The first became the focus of ASTIN (the international actuarial association in general insurance) 1978 meetings in Taormina, Sicily. A later joint paper with Biger (Risk Considerations in Insurance Ratemaking, JRI 1979) received ten years later the award for a paper that withstood the test of time, and is still quoted until today. =Ratemaking in general insurance= Perhaps the first application of multiple regression techniques for rate making. Determination of the automobile insurance rates for all companies in Israel (with H. Levy, 1969). An English summary was published only several years later (JRI March 1975). However, partial translations were brought to the attention of leading world re-insurers much earlier, and affected their methods (e.g., B-4 in the list). He developed rate making in other lines of business e.g., natural risks in agriculture insurance (B-53). More recently he was involved in insurance data mining for rate making purposes (B- XX). =Theoretical microeconomic insurance problems= Optimal insurance consumption (B-57), consumption and insurance decisions (B-62), new theoretical developments concerning risk taking behavior and attitude towards risk and return with Brockett (B-61) (this article was ranked amongst the best articles in Management Science). =Automobile insurance= Kahane has been among the driving forces behind the Israeli 1975 no fault reform. Many studies relate to automobile insurance (B-8, B-17, B-19, B-32, B-56, C-2, C-4, F-3, F-4, and F-5) and many studies focus on the no fault concept and its application. =Solvency regulation= Theoretical papers, demonstrating some problems in insurance regulation and especially the limitations of capital adequacy rules (e.g., B-13, B-22, B-28, D-2, D-8). =Inflation in Insurance= One of the areas in which Kahane has a special expertise. (B-6, B-11, B-23, B-34, B-37, B-40, B-46, B-48, B-49, C-5, C-6). Many articles dealing with various effects of inflation and exchange rate fluctuations on insurance companies and insurance contracts. Among these: how to optimize the operation of insurance company in inflation (balancing asset and liability portfolios, tax implications, etc.). =Natural hazards A study of earthquake risk in Israel, and implications for national policy (B-50)= Studies of natural risks in agriculture (B-53, D-12). Certain parts of these studies, which have commercial or strategic national values, have not been published. =Options in insurance= Some of the first applications of option theory in the area of insurance. (B-23, B-26, B-39, B-43, H-9). How to deal with exchange rate risks. Sophisticated option utilization in reinsurance. =Reinsurance= Theoretical studies of the structure of world insurance markets. Why do we have insureds, insurers and reinsurers, rather than a direct market with only insureds and insurers? (D-9, B-54). =Tax aspects of insurance= Taxation of bodily injury benefits (B-27). Taxation and optimal operation of insurance company in inflationary periods (B-37). Taxation and the Social Security system (H-22), etc. =Health insurance (C-8)= A report (testimony) on the recommended health insurance system. This study was used by a national committee on health insurance in Israel, which adopted the recommended approach, and led to the enactment of a National Health Insurance Law in 1995. =Historical aspects of insurance= (B-29, D-4, D-6). Old forms of insurance. Existence of ancient insurance arrangements. Studies of ancient documents. These studies show the origins of insurance in the ancient world, and relates to the origins of modern insurance in the Iberian Peninsula. =Pension programs= (B-1, B-33, B-44, B-47, and D-7). Their actuarial balance. Biases and general problems. Pensions and National savings. =Risk management problems Discussion of optimal risk management (B-45)= The handling of the risks of large computer centers. Theoretical and practical problems with pools of computer centers (D-10, B-51, B-59). =Insurance and the capital market= Kahane has published many articles on financial reporting, the role of insurance and pension funds in the capital market, the need for reforms in the market, etc. (B-3, B-7, B-15, B-20, B-31, B-37, B-42, C-1, C-7, D-3, D-5, F-1, F-2, and F-6). =Mutual Insurance= Discussion of sophisticated problems of mutual insurance. The trade-off between capital, the number of participants in the mutual arrangement, and the risk level. =Environmental risks= Recognizing the importance and urgency of the environmental and sustainability issue Kahane devotes much time to these issues, He heads the Akirov Institute for Business and the Environment. Due to the need to bring in immediate changes in the business sector, he now publishes in media which are more accessible to the public, and lectures in business executive conferences and seminars.
