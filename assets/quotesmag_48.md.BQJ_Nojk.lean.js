It was developed by Dan Smith from the age of 15, over a five-year period. The game was made noteworthy by the young age at which Smith was able to develop the game and secure a publishing deal. Plot Alex awakens in the Penrose hotel, finding it to be completely empty. With no memory of his arrival, and the hotel being run by few robotic assistants, he eventually finds a circular phone, connecting him to 'Cooper'. During breakfast, the world slowly begins to distort around him. Cooper contacts him soon afterwards, initially attempting to lead him to the rooftop, explaining that he is trapped within a simulation against his will. However, due to the system rejecting Alex's credentials, it is forced upon him to explore each individual floor of the hotel, where the main mechanics of the game and puzzle elements are found. Throughout his exploration of the floors and its authentication protocols, he begins to remember events leading up to his \\"checking in\\" at the Penrose. Prior to the beginning of the game, his son, Robin, succumbed to an unknown illness. Due to changes in health care by Senator Crow, Alex and his wife Maggie ran up enormous medical bills, and despite numerous tests, Robin eventually died. In his grief, he proceeded to meticulously plan the murders of Matthews, the insurance underwriter to denied them coverage, Dr Wright, who failed to cure his son, and Senator Crow, who had radically changed medical care in the state. Maggie found out the plan after Alex murdered Matthews, forcibly committing him to the Penrose as both therapy and to protect him. Alex eventually reaches the roof, meeting the AI manager who confides that this is not the first time that Alex has tried to check out, and implores him to stay, and pleads that he will change the simulation once more to better fit his needs. At this, the player has the option to either stay within the Penrose, much to Cooper's horror, or to finally leave the Penrose and accept his fate. Gameplay The main mechanic of the game focuses around colours of blocks, swapping them around to bypass, or stand upon, different coloured gates. Eventually, the player is given the opportunity to use these colours to teleport around the levels using specifically placed panels. During these puzzles, snippets of the plot are revealed to the player. After the bulk of levels are completed, the player must sleep, listen to Cooper and piece together the story happening around them, and repeat the cycle. Reception An early version of the game was nominated for and won the BAFTA Young Game Designer Game Making Award (ages 15-18) in 2016 from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.http://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/scholarships/daniel-smith-young- game-designer Critically, the game was polarizing. Often both praised and criticized for having two distinct art styles and gameplay sections. It received favorable reviews from sites such as Gamereactor and PassTheController, giving it a 9/10 and 10/10 respectively. The game received an aggregated score of 72/100 on Metacritic, indicating generally favourable reviews.

She was born Gladys Bux at Cummeragunja Reserve in Yorta Yorta country, near Moama on the New South Wales side of the Murray River and the border with Victoria. Her mother, Alice Campbell, was a Djadjawurrung and Baraparapa woman, while her father, Meera Bux (Baksch), was a Punjabi Indian merchant who ran a general store in Barmah on the Victorian side of the Murray. Gladys attended school on the reserve, and worked in her father's store, then later as a dairy maid. At the age of 19, she married Herbert \\"Dowie\\" Nicholls, whose family was also from Cummeragunja. In 1939, the couple moved to Barmah after many residents staged a mass walk-off from the reserve due to its authoritarian management and poor conditions. They then moved to Melbourne, where Gladys worked in a munitions factory. In 1942, Dowie died from head injuries sustained after he was hit by a car, leaving Gladys a widow with three children. Dowie's brother, Douglas Nicholls, an Australian rules footballer and pastor, supported the family, and married Gladys in December 1942. After the end of World War II, Nicholls worked voluntarily to address rising poverty and social problems in the urban Aboriginal community in Melbourne. She taught in Sunday school, and founded a series of opportunity shops in Fitzroy, recognising the need for community fundraising due to the dearth of government support. In 1956, Nicholls opened and managed a hostel for Aboriginal girls in Northcote, which was originally named \\"Cummeragunja\\" after her birth place, but was later named the Lady Gladys Nicholls Hostel after Nicholls herself. Nicholls was inducted onto the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2008.

His career was associated primarily with Athletic Bilbao, winning the national championship twice as a player in the 1980s and later serving as the club's director of football and the co-ordinator of its youth system. Playing career =Athletic Bilbao= Born in Bilbao, Biscay, Basque Country, Noriega was a graduate of Athletic Bilbao's youth system, having supported the club as a child. He made his senior debut with the reserve team, Bilbao Athletic, in the regionalised third tier during 1977‚Äì78. Towards the end of his third season featuring regularly for the reserves, he made his debut for the Athletic senior team on 16 March 1980, a 1‚Äì0 win away to Atl√©tico Madrid in La Liga. He was promoted at the start of the following campaign, and would feature in the majority of the team's matches for the next six seasons (232 appearances and 54 goals in all competitions), albeit often appearing from the bench or himself being substituted. Those years under coach Javier Clemente were one of the most successful periods in Athletic Bilbao's history, in which they were champions of Spain in 1982‚Äì83 and 1983‚Äì84, before finishing third in the next two seasons. They also won the 1984 Copa del Rey Final and were runners-up the following year ‚Äì Noriega did not take part in either final but was involved in earlier rounds. He did play in the first leg of the 1983 Supercopa de Espa√±a which Athletic lost to Barcelona (they were awarded the same trophy automatically the following year after winning the double). He also featured in the European Cup against the likes of Liverpool and was involved in further defeats to Barcelona at the semi-final stage of the cup in both 1981 and 1986, scoring in the former. In 1986‚Äì87, Noriega's contribution was significantly diminished due to injury, not playing at all until April and registering only 267 minutes (scoring twice) in the league. He did manage to complete 90 minutes in what would be his final appearance for the club, a 2‚Äì1 win away to UD Las Palmas on 20 June 1987. =Tenerife= Noriega began the 1987‚Äì88 season with Athletic but did not play any competitive fixtures and soon moved on, dropping down to the second level to join newly-promoted CD Tenerife on the eve of his 29th birthday. Injuries again hampered his progress during two seasons in the Canary Islands, but in the latter campaign he contributed 22 regular league appearances plus one in the playoffs as the club defeated Real Betis and returned to the top tier after a 28-year absence. Tenerife also praised his \\"nobility and professionalism\\" during his spell, after which he retired from playing professionally at the relatively young age of 30. Post- playing career After his playing days ended, Noriega remained working in football, although it was more than a decade later when he was hired in a prominent position. After spending the 2003‚Äì04 season as the manager of Barakaldo CF in the third tier, in September 2004 he was appointed as Athletic Bilbao's director of football with special responsibility for the club's Lezama academy, after the appointment of Fernando Lamikiz as president. Although credited for his involvement in bringing players such as Javi Mart√≠nez and Iker Muniain to the club, his three-year term was also associated with disappointing results on the field, with several coaches hired and dismissed, in addition to the 'Zubiaurre affair' where Athletic's approach to sign a player was ruled to be illegal, all of which led to Lamikiz's resignation halfway through his scheduled term. Noriega remained in post during the interim presidency of Ana Urkijo but was replaced when Fernando Garc√≠a Macua became president in the 2007 elections. He later expressed his disappointment that his efforts to add a winning mentality to the youth coaching at the club ‚Äì by appointing experienced personnel such as former teammates Luis de la Fuente and Patxi Salinas ‚Äì were derided as cronyism.

The building was granted the status of regional significance on the 31st of December 1987 (decision No. 535 by the executive committee of Sverdlovsk oblast Council of People's Deputies). The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661720975770005.  History  The construction date of the first wooden church building is the end of the 17th century. The second wooden church was laid in 1786. The construction of the stone building began in 1796. In 1810 the side-altar was consecrated in honor of the St. Paraskeva. In 1822 the main church was consecrated in honor of St. Michael the Archangel. Around the church a stone fence with an iron grid was built in 1864.. The clergy of the parish consists of a priest, a deacon and a psalm-reader. The chapel in Zaimka village and the chapel in Melnichnaya village were included in the parish. In 1934 the chimes were banned. The church was closed on the 9th of July 1935(the decree of the Presidium of the Regional Executive Committee No. 1629). In 1941 the evacuated children from the Orphanage No. 14 (from the Bucha railway station;the suburbs of Kiev) stayed in the buildings of the church. Since 1935 to 1965 the average county school had been functioning in the church. The school was closed in 1965. The building was given to the collective farm for storage facilities. Now the building of the church houses a warehouse of spare parts for agricultural machinery of the collective farm: equipment for the cattle- breeding complex, greenhouses, spare parts for cars and tractors. The building is not being restored.  Architecture  In the original construction plan the building had an even three-part structure: a church with a pentahedral apse, a refectory and a bell tower stretching along one axis. At the beginning of the 20th century the western part was significantly expanded by the addition of side chapels. The altars partially covered the bottom of the church dimension. A quadrangle church is divided by a cornice at the apse level and a refectory. The windows of the lower tier are given flat ledged window surrounds. In the upper tier there are two rows of windows. Here in the piers both to the right and to the left of the corners are drawn rustic pilasters-thrusts, and at the end of the walls - a false multi-layered cornice. The side-altars have triangular forceps and smooth walls with high arched windows. The belfry consists of massive four-sided tiers and is completed with a low eights, a dome and a spire. Inside the temple room is covered with a four-clot closed dome without a lantern. The refectory is communicated with the aisles with wide arches.

History  The initiative to create the monument belongs to the head of the Leninsky district of Rostov-on-Don Sergey Suhariev. In his interview, he noted that at the initial stages of the development of the project, he wanted the final sculpture to resemble something of the Kid's character from the story of \\"Baby and Carlson, who lives on the roof\\". The city authorities decided to hold a competition among pupils of grades 7-9 to create a better sketch of the monument. In total, dozens of sketches were presented. The winner of the contest was Anna Nikolaeva - a student of 9 \\"B\\" class of gymnasium ‚Ññ 36. Money for the creation of the monument was provided by sponsors and Dmitry Lyndin was selected as a sculptor. He created a sculpture on the pencil sketch of the student. It took about six months to create the monument, it was cast in one of the workshops of Rostov-on-Don. The solemn ceremony of opening the monument took place on September 1, 2011 on the Knowledge Day in the courtyard of the gymnasium ‚Ññ 36, at the opening ceremony of the monument was attended by Mayor Mikhail Chernyshev.  Description  The monument is made of bronze, its height is about 2 meters, weight is half a ton. The monument depicts a laughing first-grader boy dressed in school uniform.

She graduated from Massey Agricultural College in 1941, becoming the first woman graduate from that institution. Bassett was also one of the first two women students accepted into Canterbury Agricultural College (now Lincoln University).  Early life and education  Bassett was born in remote Menzies Bay on Banks Peninsula in the South Island of New Zealand, on 15 July 1918. Her parents were Francis Thorpe, a farmer who later became an Anglican clergyman, and Constance (Connie) Menzies. She grew up on the family farm and was initially taught by a governess, although she later went to Okains Bay Primary School. Bassett was sent to boarding school in Timaru, where she attended Craighead Diocesan School and excelled in Latin and French. The school did not offer science subjects though, and as Bassett had decided to become a vet, after completing high school she enrolled for two years of intermediate study at Canterbury College, Christchurch (now University of Canterbury). However the nearest place to study veterinary science was Sydney, Australia, and Bassett decided to change her plans and study agriculture. She applied to Lincoln Agricultural College (now Lincoln University), however the university did not accept women students at the time. Instead, she enrolled at Massey Agricultural College and became its first female student. On arrival at Massey, she changed her name to Paddy as she had always disliked her first name. Bassett graduated with a Bachelor of Agricultural Science in 1941, and took a position as assistant research officer in the Animal Research Division of the Department of Agriculture. She wanted to continue her studies however and, along with Daintry Walker, Massey's second woman agricultural science graduate, convinced Lincoln College's Campbell McMeekan to accept them as the first women students at the College. The topic of her master's thesis was the relationship between cattle pituitary glands and ovarian dysfunction. On 5 October 1943, she married Colin Holman Bassett at Holy Trinity Church in the Christchurch suburb of Avonside.  Career  Bassett next moved to Hamilton, in the North Island of New Zealand, to continue her research under McMeekan at the newly-formed Ruakura Animal Research Station. In 1954 she enrolled at the University of Cambridge for her doctoral studies, spending two years studying and researching under John Dixon Boyd. Her PhD thesis, titled Observations on the anatomy of the ewe: with special reference to pregnancy and parturition, was completed in 1957. On her return to New Zealand, she settled in Dunedin and worked in the Medical Research Council's Endocrinology Unit at the University of Otago's Dunedin Medical School. She also lectured on connective tissue to medical students at the School. In 1980, Bassett moved to Nelson and took a position as honorary research fellow to the Nelson Hospital Board. Much of her research while in Nelson was collaborative, with researchers at the University of Otago's Wellington School of Medicine. While in her 80s, she was appointed an honourable staff member of the pathology department at the School, and moved to Wellington to continue her research into connective tissue change. Bassett retired from research in her 90s, having published more than 20 research papers. Bassett died on 20 July 2019 at the age of 101.  Awards and honours  In 2002, Bassett received a Massey University Anniversary Medal for her special contribution to her field.

Description  The island has the form of a crescent. It is long and wide. On the island there is only a small brick building and a sandy well. There is no bushy and woody vegetation there, only the short thyme, wormwood and fescue. Horse skulls and bones are scattered all over the area.–û–¥–∏—á–∞–≤—à–∏–π –º–∏—Ä The Vodny Island was formed only in 1948. In 1936, the government launched the construction of the \\"River of happiness\\" - similarly, in the propaganda materials that called upon the citizens to join the people's construction, was called the Nevinnomyssk Canal, through which the Kuban and Egorlyk rivers were supposed to be connected. In 12 years the project was implemented, and the water flowed into the neighboring areas, flooding large fields. On the surface there were left only a couple of islands, with Vodny being the largest of them. It has also been presumed that the island was formed in 1954, when water was discharged from the neighboring Proletarian Reservoir, with the aim of softening the arid climate of those places.–û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –¥–∏–∫–∏—Ö –ª–æ—à–∞–¥–µ–π There is an urban legend that the horses appeared on the island during the time of Batu Khan, who supposedly put the loot in the valley of the Western Manych River, and buried the most valuable treasure on the island and put the horses on guard. According to another version, these horses are the descendants of the animals abandoned by the Red Army, which mostly used the Don breed because of their strength.–î–∏–∫–∏–π –æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—ã However, both these stories are fiction. According to an eyewitness, the water came so unexpectedly that separated from the main herd a couple of hundred sheep and a dozen horses. Initially, the shepherds tried to take the sheep by boat but later decided to return for the remaining livestock, when the water would be covered with ice. But unlike the sheep, the horses became too wild. In the 1950s, the state farm decided to use the island as a pasture.–û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –º—É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–≥–æ–≤: —ç–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞–æ–±–æ—Ä–æ—Ç Five thousand sheep and a couple dozen horses were on the island from spring to autumn, wolves could not get them, and there was no need to pay for food. For transportation of cattle, a ferry crossing was organized, which sent animals twice daily. However, a problem arose later: due to intervention in the hydrological regime, the salinity of the water began to increase rapidly. According to local reports, by the mid-1950s, it had lost its drinking qualities. As a result, the state farm dug a self-pouring artesian well for watering the cattle. Cattle grazing on Vodny Island was stopped in the late 1980s. From that time on there were only horses. Wells with fresh water eventually became clogged, the ferry stopped working. Then the local authorities decided to organize on the basis of the old sanatorium a building for a new one, for this purpose they tried to remove the horses from the island. However, the horses were too wild and could not be moved. As a result, the project was abandoned.

In November 2007, Brynd√≠s tore a cruciate ligament in her knee, resulting in her missing the rest of the season. In the four games she had played, she averaged 20.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists. In August 2009, Brynd√≠s signed with Belgian club Royal SPIRO Monecu Charleroi but left the club in November and rejoined Keflav√≠k. Brynd√≠s was selected as a starter to the 2011 All-Star game. She averaged 14.0 points, 8.1 rebounds and 3.4 assists during the 2010-2011 regular season and 15,1 points in the playoffs. She was named to the √örvalsdeild Domestic All-First Team and was a strong candidate for the Domestic Player of the Year award. In May 2011, Brynd√≠s unexpectedly left Keflav√≠k and signed with Reykjav√≠k powerhouse KR. KR started well, blowing out Keflav√≠k, 84-49, in the Supercup.

Howe represented Windham County in the Vermont Senate from 1874 to 1875, and he was a delegate to the 1876 Republican National Convention. In 1880, Howe accepted a federal government position as a pension examiner, which required him to travel throughout New England to verify the details of applications and adjudicate claims. In the last years of his life, Howe's health began to fail and he retired to Vernon. Death and burial Howe died in Vernon on February 21, 1888. He was buried at North Vernon Cemetery in Vernon. Family In 1850, Howe married Mary Ann Willard (1824-1905) of Westminster. They were the parents of a son, George E. Howe (1862-1920), who graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School and became a successful attorney in Boston.

The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661710842510005.  History  The Pyshminsky plant related to the Cathedral of The Great Martyr Saint Catherine parish in Yekaterinburg until 1765. After the arrival of the Beryozovsky plant the independent parish was founded in 1809. The same year the church building was laid. The first church building and the bell tower were wooden. The funds for construction were allocated from the donations of the Perm diocese. Also the manager Ivan Gavrilovich Shevkunov donated money to church building. On the 9th of February 1810 the building was consecrated in honor of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary by Father John Popov. By 1844 the parish included Stanovaya and Sarapulka villages. In 1882 the construction of a new stone building began. On the 5th of July 1887 the temple was consecrated by the Ekaterinburg bishop Nathaniel in honor of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The wooden church was not dismantled, it remained ascribed. By 1904 the church parish had almost 2300 parishioners. The clergy of parish consisted of a priest and a psalm-reader. In 1938 the building of a wooden church burned down. The stone building continued working until 1941. On the 7th of March 1941 the church was closed (the decision of Sverdlovsk Regional Executive Committee No. 633). Later there was a Youth club.  Architecture  It is located in the central part of the village. The church has Russian- Byzantine art features. It is distinguished by the monumental composition. The building is made of stone. The main part of the building is octagonal with a semicircular altar. From the western part there are a refectory and a wide porch. In the center the bell tower stands. The walls of the church are decorated on the joints with pilasters between which is a complex multi-brass cornice. The keeled arches are also attached to the portals and framing of the lower windows. The upper windows on the northern and southern sides are doubled, inscribed in semicircular arches. The church is crowned with a large bulbous head on a drum-eight. Elements of decoration of the refectory and porch are similar to the church ones.

Federal Labor retained some seats in the Parliament of Australia but was a minor party in state elections. The dispute was healed in 1936. History The Australian Labor Party was badly divided over how to respond to the Great Depression in Australia. In 1931 the federal government of James Scullin and most of the state premiers agreed the Premiers' Plan, a deflationary economic policy. However Jack Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, opposed the plan and instead advocated defaulting on debt payments and an inflationary approach. Lang was highly dominant in the New South Wales branch of the party and thus much of the organisation supported him in disputes with the federal leadership. In early 1931 Eddie Ward, a supporter of Lang, won a by-election for Labor but was refused entry to the federal Labor caucus; in response Ward and other Lang supporters formed a \\"Lang Labor\\" group on the crossbenches. Labor had also split on the right, with Joseph Lyons leading a section into the new United Australia Party. In November 1931 the Lang Labor MPs joined the opposition in defeating the Scullin government in parliament, causing the 1931 federal election. At the election the state and federal branches fielded rival candidates, with the state pro Lang candidates known as Australian Labor Party (New South Wales) and the federal pro Scullin candidates known as Federal Labor and headed by future Prime Minister Ben Chifley. Labor was heavily defeated at the election, losing most of its seats in New South Wales. Of the survivors, four supported Lang and three Scullin. In the state Labor party, Lang had secured heavy support and thus the entire state caucus remained loyal. Lang was controversially dismissed from office in May 1932 and Labor would not return to power until 1941. Federal Labor candidates contested the 1932 and 1935 state elections but won no seats. In February 1936 new federal Labor leader John Curtin oversaw a reunification of the rival Labor parties.

Dar al Kuti (‚ÄòDar al-Kuri‚Äô in some sources) was an Islamic state in the centre and northwest of the present Central African Republic which existed from around 1830 until 17 December 1912. From around 1800 the name Dar al-Kuti was given to a stretch of the frontier to the southwest of Wadai, a sultanate in the region of Lake Chad. The term ‚Äúdar‚Äù signifies ‚Äúabode‚Äù in Arabic, while the term ‚Äúkuti‚Äù in the local language denotes a forest or densely-wooded area.Cordell D., Dar El Kuti and the last years of trans-saharan slave trade, The University of Wisconsin Press, pp. 7-8 History =Origins and the rule of Djougoultoum (c.1830-1870)= Both Wadai and its western neighbour the Sultanate of Baguirmi (1522-1897) sent slaving expeditions Into the lands of the Sara, a Nilotic people to the south of Chad. By the early nineteenth century these expeditions had reached into the present day Central African Republic. At this time, the ruler of Baguirmi was the Mbang Bourgomanda, who had two sons, Abd el-Kader and Djougoultoum. When Abd el-Kader became sultan in 1826, he sought to distance his brother from power, and Djougoultoum fled to Wadai. The Kalak (sultan) of Wadai sent Djougoultoum to the Dar Runga, governed by a sultan who was his tributary. Dar Runga was a military frontier between the Azoum and Aouk rivers. Djougoultoum married Fatme, daughter of Boker, the sultan of Dar Runga, and in 1830 settled in a still more southerly frontier region, Bilad al-Kuti, a zone for slave raiding south of the river Aouk. Bilad al-Kuti, or Dar al-Kuti, became a tributary region of Dar Runga, which in turn remained a tributary of Wadai. Ch√°, on the river Diangara, a tributary of the Aouk, became the capital of this new province and Djougoultoum was appointed by Wadai as governor of Dar al-Kuti, which enjoyed a high degree of independence. The dates for his reign (1830-1870) are probably not exact, but he was the first governor of Dar al- Kuti. Its territory comprised fourteen villages (probably only its most significant settlements) and could be traversed in two days from east to west, indicating that it was small. =The rule of Kobur (c.1870-1890)= In the late 1860s or early 1870s, a respected trader and faqih named Kobur was made governor of Dar al-Kuti (according to some sources he was the son of Djougoultoum). His wealth and power probably derived from the ivory trade. While he was governor, groups of Wadai horsemen would appear in Dar al-Kuti from time to time to gather tribute and collect slaves from the regions of the Nduka and Banda peoples, which bordered on Kobur's domain. Kobur was careful to maintain good relations both with the larger Muslim realms to the north, as well as with his non-Muslim neighbours, the Nduka. Dar al-Kuti took part in the slave trade to a limited extent, but large-scale raids did not take place in the time of Kobur. The greatest threat to Dar al-Kuti was posed by Rabih az-Zubayr, a Sudanese commander and slave trader who was active in the central and northeastern regions of the modern Central African Republic, capturing many of the Banda people. In 1874 Rabih's lieutenants seized Kobur's capital, Ch√°, and the following year he was attacked on his other flank by the Banda. In 1880 Rabih agreed to stop his attacks on Dar al-Kuti in return for free passage across its lands to attack the Banda. =The rule of Muhammad al- Sanusi (1890-1911)= Muhammad al-Sanusi rallying his troops by the fortified tata at N'D√©l√©. In 1890, seeking a more compliant prot√©g√©, Rabih deposed Kobur and installed Kobur's nephew Muhammad al-Sanussi as sheikh of both Dar al-Kuti and Dar Runga, Al-Sanussi, born around 1850 in Wadai, was a member of the Sanusiyya order. His daughter Khadija was married to Rabih's son Fadlallah. In the years that followed, Rabih continued to consolidate and expand Sanussi's authority. Any potential threats to his rule from Kobur were neutralised and Dar al-Kuti's sphere of influence expanded to include much of the modern Central African Republic. Dar al-Kuti had been a tributary of Wadai before 1890, and its former overlords did not accept Rabih's seizure of control without resistance. In October 1894 the aguid of Wadai, Cherfeddine, attacked and destroyed Ch√°, the capital, forcing Sanussi to maintain an itinerant court for two years until he eventually founded a new fortified settlement, or tata, at N'D√©l√©. In the 1890s Dar al-Kuti began to come under pressure from France. Various explorers ventured into this part of Africa, seeking routes to link the basins of the Ubangi and Shari Rivers. A number of them, including L√©on de Poumayrac and :fr:Alfred Fourneau, reached areas close to Dar al-Kuti, and in 1891 Paul Crampel was killed together with his companions by Sanussi. On 28 August 1897, Sanussi agreed to the establishment of a French protectorate over Dar al-Kuti through a treaty of trade and alliance signed by Mohammed el- Sanussi and √âmile Gentil. The treaty was revised twice, on 18 February 1903 and 26 January 1908, but Dar al-Kuti retained its independence until the death of Sanussi on 12 January 1911. He left behind at least two sons, Kamun, who took the throne, and Kangaya, as well as the daughter, Hadia, who had married Fadlallah. =French annexation= The French decided the time had come to take most of Dar al-Kuti under direct control. Kamun fled east to Ouanda Djall√©, and continued resisting French forces until December 17, 1912, when Ouanda Djall√© fell to Captain Souclier and Kamun went into exile in Sudan. After absorption into the French colonial territory of Ubangi-Shari, Dar al- Kuti became an administrative division (circonscription) and, between 1937-1946, a d√©partement. Since 1946 the region has been known as the Autonomous District of N'D√©l√© (1946-1961), the Autonomous Prefecture of N'D√©l√© (1961-1964), and, after 1964, as the Prefecture of Bamingui-Bangoran.

The short film was the first production to be shot entirely in Manx Gaelic, and was financed by Culture Vannin, CinemaNX and Isle of Man Film. It premiered at the Isle of Man Film Festival in September 2013 and was distributed online in November 2017 by Culture Vannin.  Production  The screenplay was one of thirty-two screenplays submitted to the MannIN Shorts Screenplay Contest in January 2011 and was selected as one of three screenplays eligible for a production-budget as part of the MannIN Shorts scheme. Andy North, lecturer of film and digital media at the Isle of Man College and Chester University, was hired to direct the short film and helped developed the screenplay throughout a six-month period of pre-production. North decided to translate the screenplay‚Äôs dialogue into the period-accurate Manx Gaelic Language, a decision which attracted the financial support of Culture Vannin. The opportunity to support emerging talent excited the Isle of Man Government's film investment partner CinemaNX, who co-financed the production with a view to acquiring the rights to an English-language commercial remake. CinemaNX's successor Pinewood Studios optioned the rights and developed the commercial remake as a Halloween origins story in 2013. Principal photography took place over a five-day period in July 2012, at national heritage sites Castle Rushen, Cregneash Village, and the Niarbyl Fault. Manx National Heritage donated use of their sites without charging a location fee, due to the historical nature of the piece. None of the locations featured in the film were the real-life locations of the 1617 witch-hunt, as they are now too ruined or modern to play themselves in a low-budget period drama. Experienced non-Manx-speaking actors were cast in the lead roles, and learned their Manx dialogue parrot fashion via a CD recorded by a dialect and language coach. Fluent Manx-Speakers were cast in minor roles.  Reception  Adrian Cain, Manx Language Development Officer for the Manx Heritage Foundation commented that ‚ÄúSuch a high profile and professional production illustrates what a vibrant position the language finds itself in at present‚Äù and Gaelic-enthusiasts noted that the filmmaker‚Äôs decision to shoot in the Manx language marked a huge step forward for a language once considered extinct by UNESCO. Solace in Wicca was the first short film to receive funding support from Isle of Man Film, who have since annually supported talent- development in the craft of film and entrepreneurship by committing funding to micro-budget projects under the banner of the MannIN Shorts scheme.

Also in other Upper Austrian cities, this designation is customary for residential buildings from the Nazi era, for example in Steyr- M√ºnichholz.  History  Residential construction is a consequence of the industrial settlement in Linz during the Nazi era, which aggravated the housing shortage that had existed since the interwar period. The population of Linz increased from 112,000 inhabitants in 1938 to just under 200,000 in 1945. At the same time 11,000 new apartments were built. For the construction work also forced laborers and prisoners of war were consulted and the material in the KZ-Mauthausen and subcamps. Large courtyards with green areas are typical of the Hitler Buildings. In addition to the large housing blocks for the workers, which are architecturally the Heimatschutz architecture based on the shape of Upper Austrian square farmstead (Vierkanthof), also single and multi- family houses for senior employees, officers, etc. were built in settlements. The unfinished or war-damaged buildings were completed after the war. The general planning was largely the responsibility of the architect Roderich Fick. The buildings were executed by various planners, such as Armin Sturmberger, Fritz Fanta, Herbert Rimpl and Hans Arndt as well as by Roderich Fick himself Buildings are listed buildings.Sylvia Necker, Elisabeth Kramer: ‚ÄûHitlerbauten‚Äú in Linz.

Description  The island has an area of 660 hectares and the form of a triangle, which resembles human's heart. The island was formed due to a fault in the geological crust. It stands on a plate of the North-Donetsk ridge; this fact explains the geomagnetic phenomena that affect the flora and fauna. On the territory of the island there are two lakes, which are almost dried up due to the warm climate. The island has very diverse landscapes. There are zones of steppe and savannah, deserts and forests. Here are habitat white-tailed eagle and cormorant which are listed in the Red Book. In 2000 the island was included in the list of archaeological monuments of Rostov Oblast, but still it hasn't been put under official state protection. The scientists began to explore the island in the 1990s. Landscapes of Porechny Island are depicted in the paintings of Vasily Surikov.

The island was the first military center of the Don Cossacks. In the island town were held meetings of atamans, where they discussed where to go on next a military campaign. And during the reign of Ivan the Terrible there was the idea to build a proper city: the atamans wrote about the fact that the island had enough construction timber for the purposes of urban development. Historians in the archives of the times of Ivan the Terrible found his correspondence with the Don Atamans. One of the oldest documents dates back to 1570. The tsar sent a letter to the atamans, proposing a military alliance and service to the Moscow state, for which he promised a reward.–ì–∞–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –û–Ω–æ–ø—Ä–∏–µ–Ω–∫–æ –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –ü–æ—Ä–µ—á–Ω—ã–π —Å—Ç–∞–ª –∂–µ—Ä—Ç–≤–æ–π —á–µ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ–ø–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π  Archaeological site  Matyukhin hillock is of the greatest archaeological value on the island.

The peculiarity of the find is that the funeral set of the warrior remained untouched - iron armor, bow with bone trim, decorated with a pattern, a two- handed sword, and a quiver with arrows. The handle of the sword is decorated with a blue stone. Later, the researchers concluded that this two-meter knight was the main commander of Khan Asparuh. In addition, on the Matyukhin hillock the researchers found several twin burials of men and women. However, in recent years, the island has often become a victim of black diggers, which excavated most of valuable materials.

Noted for their western outlook and loyalty to the Dutch authorities during the colonial period, the family nonetheless fought on both sides of the Indonesian Revolution (1945‚Äì1949). History Prince Mangkunegara VII and K.P.A. Hoessein Djajadiningrat with their wives, Ratu Timur and Partini, as well as their children (circa 1922). The family is of Baduy and Bantenese extraction. According to Nina Consuelo Epton, the family's oral history recounts that in the middle of the seventeenth century, their ancestor, the renegade son of a Baduy chieftain, sought shelter at the court of the Sultan of Banten. He was subsequently admitted into the inner circle of the Sultan's court and was allowed to marry one of the Sultan's daughters, thereby becoming the founder of the Djajadiningrat family. Memorial statue of Hoessein Djajadiningrat in Leiden, Netherlands Later marriages into the Javanese reigning dynasties further cemented the Djajadiningrat family's hold on power, as was shown by the career of R. T. A. Natadiningrat and his eldest son, R. T. Sutadiningrat, who both ruled in succession as Regents of Serang. The latter was succeeded by his younger brother, the progressive Raden Bagus Djajawinata. In the late nineteenth century, the family benefited from the patronage of the Dutch scholar and educator Snouck Hurgronje. Hurgronje, who believed in coopting the Indonesian elite by giving their children a Dutch education, ensured the admission to the prestigious of the brothers Achmad (1877‚Äì1943) and Hossein Djajadiningrat (1886‚Äì1960), sons of Raden Bagus Djajawinata. Achmad, the elder son, went on to succeed his father as Regent of Serang (1901‚Äì1924), then of Batavia (1924‚Äì1929), and served as a member of both the Volksraad (Indonesia's colonial parliament) and the Raad van Indi√´ (Council of the Indies). Hoessein, the younger son, completed his PhD at Leiden University in 1913, and became a distinguished scholar of Sundanese, Bantense, Malay and Islamic studies. The family, like most other native Sundanese and Bantense families, originally had no surname; the Dutch-educated Achmad Djajadiningrat adopted the surname 'Djajadiningrat' in the late nineteenth century. Other prominent members of the family include Achmad Djajadiningrat's son, Idrus Nasir Djajadiningrat (1920‚Äì1980), and the latter's cousin Maria Ulfah Santoso (1911‚Äì1988), both of whom were important figures in the Indonesian Revolution.

History  It is known that in the autumn of 1674 a voivode was sent from Moscow to the Don, Prince P. I. Khovansky-Snake for the construction of a fortress on the Miyus River. This idea was not realized then because they did not find a good place to build the fortress. The fortress was built later in 1698 and became known as Mius. Later it was renamed the Semyonovsky Fortress. The structure was built in the form of an irregular rectangle with 4 bastions and 2 half-bastions. There was created one gate which from the steppe side was protected by a half-bastion. The earthworks was 3.5 meters high, its depth was 2 meters, and the width was 6 meters. The size of the square was 600x500 meters. As of 1699, the garrison had 421 men among whom were spearmen, riders and soldiers. At the same time, the Cossacks began to be in the fortress who were inspecting merchant vessels passing through. In 1711 the fortress was partially destroyed. In the 21st century, the outlines of the fortress are seen on the banks of the Miusskiy Liman. Part of the fortress is washed by the coastline. At times, archaeological research and excavations are carried out on the territory of the former fortress. During the research, elements of ceramics and smoking pipes were found.

In 2014 the district began whole grade-sharing, in one school district sent its children to another school district to attend schools there all day. Walnut had pressure to merge as its student enrollment had one of the most significant student population declines in Iowa in the early 2010s; it was reduced by about 25% between 2010 and 2014. In 2015 A-H-S-T was three times larger than Walnut. If the Walnut district did not merge, in the following school years its spending could have increased beyond the amount permissible under Iowa law. The election for the school district merger was scheduled for September 8, 2015 after the Green Hills Area Education Agency approved of the merger proposal and election, as it had received enough signatures on the merger petition.

Biography  After attending the P. Colonna Gymnasium in Galatina (province of Lecce) and the G. Palmieri Lyceum in Lecce, Garzya studied Classical Philology at the University of Naples. He took his degree with a thesis on Andromache by Euripides. In 1953 he started his teaching career, which he pursued from 1954 until 1966 in state secondary schools. In 1960 he became an instructor of Byzantine Philology and Papyrology at the University of Naples. From 1965 until 1966 he was a school principal and then interrupted that activity from 1966 to 1968 to be Professor of Byzantine Studies at the University of Macerata, where, at the same time, he taught Latin literature. From 1969 to 1980 he was a professor of Byzantine Philology at the University of Naples. At the same time, from 1973 to 1983, he taught Philology of Medieval and Modern Greek and in 1976 was a guest professor of Byzantine Studies at the University of Vienna. He was a professor of Greek literature beginning in 1981 at the University of Naples and from 1984 to 1988 was Associate Professor of Medieval Greek at the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1993 he became a member of UPRESA 8062 ‚ÄúM√©decine grecque‚Äù (formerly URA 1255) des CNRS in Paris. Garzya published the journal ŒöŒøŒπŒΩœâŒΩŒØŒ± and the series Speculum (D‚ÄôAuria, Naples) as well as Hellenica et Bizantina Neapolitana (Bibliopolis, Naples) and Classici greci: Sezione tardoantica e bizantina (UTET, Turin). He was a member of the publishing boards of Revue des √©tudes grecques (Paris), of Cuadernos de filolog√≠a cl√°sica (Madrid), of Rivista di studi bizantini e neoellenici (Rome), of Bizantinistica (formerly Rivista di bizantinistica, Bologne), of Archivio di storia della cultura (Naples ) and of Magna Graecia (Cosenza). Garzya's awards include an honorary doctorate from the University of Toulouse in 1967, membership in the Accademia Pontaniana in Naples in 1970 (then chairman of that institution in 2002 and then chairman emeritus) and, in 1981, membership of the Accademia di Archeologia, Lettere e Belle Arti della Societ√† Nazionale di Scienze Lettere e Arti in Naples and subsequent chairman of that institution from 1997 to 2000. In 1974 he became a corresponding member in the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in 1980 an honorary member in the ŒïœÑŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒØŒ± ŒíœÖŒ∂Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩœéŒΩ Œ£œÄŒøœÖŒ¥œéŒΩ (Athens), in 2001 an ordinary member of the Accademia delle Scienze (Turin), and in 2001 a member in the Academy of Athens. From 1980 he was vice-president of the International Association of Byzantine Studies and from 1993 honorary president of the Association of Studies of Late Antiquity. Garzya was married to Jacqueline Maguy Peeters (b. 1924 in Belgium - ‚Ä†2012 Naples). The couple had 2 children: Giacomo (b.1952) and Chiara (b.1955).  Research  Garzya was primarily concerned with literary criticism of ancient Greek, of the Greek of Late Antiquity, and Byzantine Greek. His focus in ancient literature was on archaic Choral poetry (Alcman) and Elegies (Theognis), classical tragedies (Euripides) and their place in Ancient Greek Comedy (Menander) and in the Roman comedies of (Plautus). At the end of the 1950s Garzya turned his attention to the works of Late Antiquity (Synesius, Procopius of Gaza) and Byzantine literature (Nikephoros Basilakas, c. 1115‚Äì shortly after 1182; Theodoros Prodromos). He was also concerned with isolated texts such as a treatise by the otherwise unknown Dionysus of Philadelphia on bird catching and the Voskopula, an anonymous pastoral poem from the time of the Cretan Renaissance. In the 1990s he turned to the study of the medicine of ancient Greece and of Late Antiquity (Oribasius, A√´tius of Amida, Alexander of Tralles, Paul of Aegina, Cassius Iatrosofista) and of the Middle Ages. He placed critical editions on the works of many of these authors at the disposal of the Bibliotheca Teubneriana and Association Guillaume Bud√©.

Early life and education  Pleasonton earned her Bachelor's degree at Bryn Mawr College. She was an editor of the Bryn Mawr College yearbook. She went on to teach at Winsor School, Girls Latin School of Chicago and Brearley School. She returned to Bryn Mawr College for her Master's degree, working as a Warden at Pembroke East, and graduated in 1943. She was demonstrator-elect in physics and took a leave of absence for government service in 1942. During her Master's degree she identified the crystal structure of Rochelle salt.  Research  Pleasonton was an active researcher in neutron decay. There were several attempts to measure neutron half-life before the second world war, all of which failed due to the lack of availability of intense neutron sources. Arthur Snell and Leonard Miller built the Oak Ridge Graphite Reactor, which could focus beams of neutrons and allow scientists to observe their decay. They measured the half-life of a neutron in 1951. Pleasonton was supported by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and published broadly. In 1958 they examined the decay of helium-6, Pleasonton and Snell monitoring the directions of neutrinos and electrons. This result confirmed the electron-neutrino theory of beta decay. In 1973 she authored several sections of the report for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pleasonton's laboratory was visited by the Queen of Greece and the King of Jordan. Pleasonton went on to study the ionisation of xenon x-rays. Pleasonton remained in Tennessee after her retirement from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and was involved in citizens groups to protect the environment.

The house was built from 1895 to 1896. It is also known as Moonbi Retirement Homes. The property is owned by the Freemasons Institution of NSW and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Through the process of \\"squatting\\" on Crown land, squatters had occupied most of the Peel Valley and adjacent Moonbi Ranges by the late 1830s. By 1848 Henry Dangar had formed the \\"Moonbi\\" run of . Henry Dangar was company surveyor for the Australian Agricultural Company and was the influencing factor in convincing Edward Parry (company agent for the Australian Agricultural Company) to exchange the coastal and mountainous lands at Port Stephens for the better pastoral lands of the Peel Valley. Pastoral runs were open range country, with a head station that was the heart of the enterprise. Moonby House was erected by the Gill family, which had made their money both from mail contracting and from pastoralism. This was the expression of that wealth at the end of the nineteenth century. Robert Alfred Orvill Gill built the house during 1895-96, of double brick made near the river, on the property Tangelwood. In 1970 Moonby House was restored by \\"Artificial Breeders Ltd.\\" who made it the administrative headquarters of a cattle artificial insemination centre. In 1977 the Masonic Lodge conceived to change it to a retirement village. In 1978 the Freemasons Benevolent Institution of NSW purchased the property to establish the Northern Inland Masonic Retirement Centre - as a residential aged care facility. At the time of the study Moonbi House was still being utilised for that purpose.  Description  It is well- sited with views across the countryside to the Moonbi Ranges.NTA (NSW), 1974. Moonby House is now located within a retirement village. Moonby House has a long driveway leading onto Churchill Drive, included as part of its curtilage. Moonby House, constructed between 1895 and 1896, is representative of the development of the pastoral expansion of the Parry Shire, and is also an outstanding example of a pastoral manor house in the Federation Filigree style. It is important to the local community as a landmark item and is associated with the historical figures Henry Dangar (original lease holder) and the Gill Family (original owners of the house). It is also developing additional social and cultural importance associated with its current use as a retirement village.

As the secretary of the Pune branch of the Bombay Art Society he organised the annual ‚ÄòMonsoon Art Exhibitions‚Äô in Pune. His art was collected by English civil servants and army officers of colonial British India. He is the maternal grandfather of Artist Mumbiram. Early life Shankar Hari Godbole was born around 1885 in Wai in Maharashtra. Wai was an important religious center on the bank of the Krishna river. Godbole's ancestors worked in traditional priestly occupations, and were well-versed in the Vedas. Godbole's father was Hari Ganesh Godbole. His scholarly works ‚ÄòAatmavidyaa‚Äô and ‚ÄòJeevitavidyaa‚Äô remain popular today. Hari Ganesh Godbole educated himself in the British colonial education system and became the headmaster of government high schools in Pune, Nasik. S.H.Godbole was married as a teenager to Varanasi Vartak, the eldest daughter of Vishnu Vartak, chief engineer of the Bombay Presidency. From this marriage, Godbole had four artistically gifted daughters. Varanasi died of tuberculosis around 1935. Godbole married a second time around 1940. His second wife was a widow who was introduced to him by the social reformer Dhondo Keshav Karve. From this marriage he had one son. Artistic path =Art Teacher at St. Vincent High School and Secretary at the Bombay Art Society of Pune= Godbole joined Mumbai's Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy School of Art against the wishes of his parents around 1910. There he befriended Narayan Eranna Puram and the two became lifelong friends. Both of them dropped out of J.J. School to follow independent paths. Godbole became a teacher in St. Vincent's High School in Pune's army cantonment area. His watercolour paintings found many admirers among the English and Parsee communities of Pune. In the 1930s, Godbole became the secretary of the Pune branch of the Bombay Art Society. In that capacity he organised the annual Monsoon exhibitions of the Bombay Art Society under the patronage of the governor of the Bombay presidency. Contemporaries have reminisced about the pomp and circumstances of the grand opening ceremony of the exhibition in which the governor was the chief guest. Godbole never entered any of his own works in these exhibitions. =Institute of Modern Art= Puram and Godbole founded the ‚ÄúInstitute of Modern Art‚Äù in Pune in the 1930s. This later evolved into Puram's ‚ÄúBharatiya Kala Prasarini Sabha‚Äù, the parent body of Pune's first art and architecture college, Abhinav Kala Vidyalaya. For many years Godbole's son-in-law, Ramdas Paranjpe, was a member of the executive committee of the Sabha. Along with Sayajirao Silam, Ramdas Paranjpe contributed to the fund-raising activities of the institute. Later in the 1960s Ramdas Paranjpe became the president of the Bharatiya Kala Prasarini Sabha. Ramdas Paranjpe was an admirer of Godbole and his work. =Early works= The painting of \\"Young Men with Ganesha on Ocean Beach\\" is an idealised version of a Ganapati Visarjan procession. This is one of several renditions on this theme Godbole made in the 1930s. It is unlike any procession that has taken place in Pune or Mumbai at any time in the last 100 years. This is Godbole's own vision that he obviously cherished very much. There is no pretense at showing anatomical accuracy or virtuosity of technique. Yet the artist is successful in communicating his vision of an intimate emotional experience. The painting is reminiscent of early Bengal School of Art such as Kshitindranath Majumdar, Jamini Roy and even some early Rabindranath Tagore paintings. Another unorthodox feature about this painting is the androgynous quality that the bodies and souls of these Ganesha devotees exude. =Life on Idyllic Farmhouse= After retirement around 1942, Godbole established his art studio in a farm house on the outskirts of Pune on the Puna Bombay road. There he created an idyllic atmosphere and continued to make watercolour masterpieces. His grandson, Mumbiram, described the romantic atmosphere that prevailed in that farm house art studio. Mumbiram wholeheartedly credits Godbole for the early influences and training that he received. Godbole was famous for painting Indian rural scenes. Many of them involved bullock carts a favorite theme of his paintings in the 1940s. An example for this period of his life is the painting \\"Bullock Cart Caravan returning home at sundown\\" which Godbole made when he was residing at his farm house. Godbole developed an impressionistic hands-on approach. Through blobs of the brush an impression is created. Indian movie maker K. Narayan Kale had hung this painting on top of his bed in his house in Pune. Last years Much of Godbole's work was damaged during the great floods that inundated Pune when the Panshet and Khadakwasla Dams broke in July 1961. Godbole's daughter Anjani and grandson Mumbiram salvaged and restored some of his great body of works. In the second half of the 20th century Indian art came under the western influence of abstraction and distortion lead by the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group. Classical art was relegated to oblivion. Artist Godbole's last years were spent in indebtedness. He was forced to sell his farm house. He died in 1972 unknown to the art world. Art works =Unique interpretation of mythological themes= In the 1930s, Godbole was experimenting with a fusion of Indian mythological themes depicted in a western classical painting style. This was also the period when his friend Puram was creating illustrations for the monumental Mahabharata edition created by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute of Pune. A rare surviving example of that period is ‚ÄúRavana‚Äôs encounter with Sita in Panchavati‚Äù a painting based on the defining moment of the epic Ramayana. Godbole's depiction of Ravana's encounter with Sita is entirely different from traditional understanding of that meeting. The clever Ravana is seen approaching Sita neither as a sanyasi to be respected nor as a fearful demon who can scarcely disguise his real self. Ravana is seen here as a youthful, courteous, even likable wanderer of the forest. Ravana seems to have an acute understanding of the mental state of an overprotected young women approached by an exotic stranger with unclear intentions. This depiction seems to suggest that Ravana lured Sita to cross the Laxmana Rekha rather than blackmailing her. Godbole has given this a unique interpretation that depicts Ravana as a charming young man and Sita as an innocent beautiful girl. It's indeed a very unusual display of the much adored and celebrated Sita typically shown as a demi-goddess as in many other depictions. Clearly this interpretation comes out of a deep understanding of the cleverness of Ravana as well as the out-of-character, all-too-human sentiments exhibited by Sita that disrupted the idyllic life that Rama and Sita were living in Panchavati. This also set the stage for the ultimate confrontation of all-out war between Rama and Ravana that led to the annihilation of Ravana, along with his invincible Lanka. =Master of watercolor= Godbole created a transparent feeling in his portraits and landscapes in watercolor paintings, both portraits. Mumbiram has described this treatment of watercolors as \\"Highlights and bright areas are created by leaving the paper white or let it shine through, rather than by adding white pigment to the colors. The artist has to have a good judgment of the light effects before dipping the brush in the colours.\\" The painting \\"Midday Feast for the Village Deity in the Forest\\" is a rendering made around 1950 when the artist was at the height of his creative genius. Most of Godbole's landscapes are given context by the people who populate them. The vibrant ‚Äústill life‚Äù of ‚ÄúAntique Japanese Vase\\" was produced by Godbole around 1950. He had no connection with the Bombay Art Society which he once steered under the close patronage of the governor of Bombay Presidency. In the name of modernity Indian artists were coming under increasing influence of ‚Äúwestern‚Äù art movements of the first half of 20th century. Godbole was now a free man with no pressing need to align with any movement or any society. He was 65 and had the experience of a life time with his favorite medium: watercolor.

She was one of hundreds of the African students who attended a US university in the 1980s on a scholarship aimed at identifying leaders of government, education and business post-Apartheid. She received the Southern African Scholarship Program set up by James Freedman, President at the University of Iowa. She moved to Iowa in 1985, starting a Master's degree in Geography. During her degree she worked in the University of Iowa Office of Affirmative Action and cleaned houses. She formed a band (Imilonji) with five other students from South Africa who would perform around campus, in churches and the local hospital. Dlamini remained at the University of Iowa for her PhD, researching the education of homeless children in South Africa, and graduated in 1992.  Career  Dlamini returned to South Africa in 1993 and voted in the 1994 South African election - the first non-racial democratic election. She was appointed head of the Northern Cape Province Education Department. She left in 1996 to form her own consultancy, advising governmental agencies in rural development and education. In 2005 she was appointed Republic of South Africa Chief Delegate for the Lesotho Highlands Water Commission. In October 2015 Nomvula Mokonyane removed Dlamini from her position as Republic of South Africa Chief Delegate for the Lesotho Highlands Water Commission. This was a controversial decision - Dlamini has over ten years experience in water management, and Mokonyane and the African National Congress have a relationship with the newly recruited LTE Consulting. There were no explanations given for her removal.

In hundred years the city authorities made capital repair of obelisks: spheres and two- headed eagles, the crowning pyramids, removed and anew applied gilding, stone columns and the bases upon which they were based, plastered cement mortar. In the Soviet period, in 1920, all heraldry was removed from columns of a barrier. Two styles of a barrier continued to stand till 1969.

The building is located on Universitetsky Lane, 46.  History of theater  Rostov State Puppet Theater is one of the oldest in the country. Its history began with a group of puppeteers, who had started to perform for children in 1920s. Among these puppeteers were: M. Kushnarenko, N. Smirnova, A. Dora, and others, and worked with such success, inspiration, and enthusiasm, that the Azov-Black Sea Regional Committee of Komsomol (Young Communist League) resolved to establish them as a puppet theater. The theater first opened its doors in 1935. Several generations of young spectators of the Don land grew up watching its performances, and to this day, as adults, bring their children and grandchildren to the theater as well. Over the years, the puppet theater has been headed by numerous famous directors: Boris Sakhnovsky - student of Konstantin Stanislavsky, Leonid Stelmakhovich - student of Vsevolod Meyerhold. For over 35 years the art director of the puppet theater was Vladimir Bylkov, student of Sergei Obraztsov. The history of theater remembers all the actors at its origins: S. Isaeva, Merited Artist of Russia; M. Kushnarenko, her grand-daughter Elena successfully works in the theater today; S. Ulybashev, L. Chubkov, G. Pidko, A. Derkach, and many others. More than 5000 plays were staged in the history of the Rostov Puppet Theater. In the repertoire of the Rostov state puppet theater, there are such performances as \\"Turnip\\", \\"Ivan Tsarevich and the Grey wolf\\", Buzzy-Wuzzy Busy Fly, Teremok, \\"Maryyushka and the baba-yaga\\", \\"Fear Takes Molehills For Mountains\\", \\"Gold tea\\", \\"Pirate sweet tooth\\", \\"Little Mermaid\\", \\"A wolf and kids\\", Buratino, \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" and many others. Moreover, since 2016 work began on the Theatrical drawing room \\"Magic of a theatrical behind the scenes\\". It is the new project of the puppet theater in which the main objective is to show children and their parents the theater from within. These are informative meetings at which actors of theater tell everything about it, train them in actor's exercises and even allow guests to operate a real theatrical doll.  Building  The present building of theater was built in the mid-sixties on the place of the destroyed Annunciation Greek Church that had been here since 1909 and converted to the children's technical station in the 1930s. Construction of the puppet theater was executed on the church base with partial use of the church walls that were kept at demolition.

Charlton Athletic were given the dream start after just two minutes of play, as Eniola Aluko's low cross was slotted in at the far post by Katie Holtham. Arsenal were level within five minutes, as Kelly Smith curled home a 25-yard free-kick after being hacked down by Charlton's right-back Maria Bertelli. The Gunners were in front by the quarter hour after winning a free kick near the corner flag: Jayne Ludlow was the quickest to get to Lianne Sanderson's near post cross and she steered her shot underneath goalkeeper Toni-Anne Wayne. Ludlow then claimed her second goal in first-half stoppage-time with a 30-yard strike which flew into the top corner of the net. Charlton's best chance of the second half came when Aluko broke away and shot through Emma Byrne's legs, but the shot was diverted wide of the post by the goalkeeper's leg.

Construction of the church took almost 100 years. It is dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary and belongs to the Archdiocese of S√£o Salvador da Bahia. The church was listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1938 and is part of the Historic Center of Salvador UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Ceiling painting of the nave Slaves and freeman, like the Portuguese, organized themselves into brotherhoods, confraternities, or mutual aid societies, known as irmandades. Afro-Brazilian brotherhoods began to congregate at the side altars of parish and other churches; the brotherhood in Salvador was known, formally, as the Irmandade de Nossa Senhora do R√≥sario dos Homens Pretos de Pelourinho. Slaves and freedman worshiped at a side altar of Our Lady of the Rosary in the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, Salvador from the beginning of the seventeenth century. The Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Rosary of Salvador first received the consent of the Jesuit provincial Jo√£o Pereira and statutory confirmation by Archbishop of Salvador da Bahia Jo√£o da Madre de Deus Ara√∫jo (1621-1686) in 1685. Its charter followed that of similar orders established in Olinda (mid-sixteenth century), Rio de Janeiro (mid-seventeenth century), Recife (1654) and Bel√©m do Par√° (1682). Our Lady of the Rosary was the subject of particular devotion to slaves and freedmen of African descent in colonial Brazil. Saint Benedict, Saint Ephigenia of Ethiopia, and Saint Elesb√£o (Saint Kaleb of Axum) were also venerated in the Our Lady of the Rosary churches. By 1704 the Brotherhood raised sufficient funds to construct a church. The organization petitioned and received permission to build a church from Archbishop Dom Sebasti√£o Monteiro de Vide for the construction of a proper church. Membership to the Brotherhood was strictly limited by an agreement with the Archbishop to Africans born south of the Equator, referred to as Banto; there were generally from Congo and Mozambique. Membership was extended only to people of Bantu background and their descendants. The Brotherhood petitioned the crown in Lisbon in 1786 to celebrate the mass using \\"masks, dances in the Angolan language with the relevant instruments, songs, and praises\\", as was done \\"in many countries of Christendom.\\" The petition was rejected. Additionally, despite its role in the ministry and social support of Afro-Brazilians, members of the Brotherhood were also slaveholders. Restriction to membership of the Brotherhood to those of Bantu background led to the establishment of the Brotherhood of Quinze Mist√©rios (Irmandade do Quinze Mist√©rios), which accepted only people of Yoruba background. The Brotherhood of Quinze Mist√©rios subsequently established their own church, the Church of Quinze Mist√©rios in the 19th century. The distinction in ethnic background became obsolete with the abolition of slavery in Brazil under the Lei √Åurea in 1888. Membership to the Brotherhood was and extended to all Brazilians of African descent in 1896. Construction Construction of the Church of the Rosary was a slow process and continued for one hundred years. Members of the irmandade were poor and the building was constructed by members of the brotherhood in their free hours: it required the labor of skilled carpenters, masons, and iron workers. From 1718 the church was also the headquarters of the newly-created parish of Senhor do Passo, a situation that continued until about 1740. The square church structure of the nave was constructed first. The elaborate fa√ßade and church towers followed in 1780 under the direction of Caetano Jos√© da Costa. Two lateral corridors were added in the same period that correspond to the tower structures. The interior of the church was renovated in the late 19th century; two new altars in the Neoclassical style were added, in addition to numerous paintings. Location The church is located in the old Rua das Portas do Carmo in a triangular- shaped square. The square emerged from the demolition of the \\"knight\\" and a gate that served as a defense to the city. The punishment and execution of slaves dates to the period of Dutch occupation of Brazil. The Dutch hanged 50 slaves accused of espionage for the Spanish. The Largo do Pelourinho, with its 19th century townhouses, is \\"one of the most interesting urban spaces in Salvador.\\" The square sits in the middle of the historic center that extends from the Pra√ßo de S√© to Passo, first designated by IPHAN, and later as part of the Historic Center of Salvador UNESCO World Heritage Site. Structure The Church of the Rosary of the Blacks is an imposing structure accessed from the sloping Rua do Carmo by a patio. The patio, which serves as the churchyard, has a low iron fence. The fa√ßade has a central body of two floors, crowned by a pediment of gable wreaths, and flanked by bell towers whose finish has superimposed bulbs covered with tiles. There are five doors at the ground floor. The central door is broad, imposing, and framed by a separate frontispiece. The fifth door, at the base of the right tower, provides access to the oratory; this design is also seen in the church of Santo Ant√¥nio Alem do Carmo and the Church of Boqueir√£o. Above the five doors are five windows of delicate design. The design of the facade, built after 1780, is attributed to the master craftsman Caetano Jos√© da Costa. The frontispiece of the Church of the Rosary is highly complex. It is similar to that of Parish Church of Saint Bartholomew in Maragogipe, constructed in the second half of the 17th century. The two church towers are in plain stone masonry, in contrast to the blue limestone of the facade. The towers have rectangular belfries with oculi on four sides below the church bell windows. The belfries are surmounted by tiled bulbous structures. Each cornier of the belfry has a stylized torch√®re. A graveyard is located to the rear of the church. Alterations and additions The renovation of 1870/1871 introduced significant changes to the church. Tribunes of the chancel were altered to become balconies. Conservation works carried out by IPHAN in 1943; the facade was stabilized between 1951 and 1952. The City of Salvador painted the exterior of the church in 1969 without the authorization of the IPHAN. The church was seriously damaged in 1998 when a concrete mixer truck went down Ladeira do Pelourinho uncontrolled and in reverse. It hit the church severely damaged the protective iron railing of the church steps and the right-side portal of the fa√ßade. They were subsequently repaired. Access The church is open to the public and may be visited.

It was designed by the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet and built by W. C. Cains. The property is owned by Australia Post and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  = Background = The first official postal service in Australia was established in April 1809, when Sydney merchant Isaac Nichols was appointed as the first Postmaster in the Colony of New South Wales. Prior to this, mail had been distributed directly by the captain of the ship on which the mail arrived; however, this system was neither reliable nor secure. In 1825 the colonial administration was empowered to establish a NSW Postmaster General's Department, which had previously been administered from Britain. In 1828 the first post offices outside of Sydney were established, with offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839 there were forty post offices in the colony, with more opening as settlement spread. The advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network began to be established throughout NSW from the 1860s. Also, in 1863, the Postmaster General W. H. Christie noted that accommodation facilities for postmasters in some post offices was quite limited, and stated that it was a matter of importance that \\"post masters should reside and sleep under the same roof as the office\\". The appointment of James Barnet as Acting Colonial Architect in 1862 coincided with a considerable increase in funding to the public works program. Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architect's Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 post offices and telegraph offices in NSW. The post offices constructed during this period were designed in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \\"different patterns\\". The construction of new post offices continued throughout the depression years under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, who retained office from 1890 to 1911. While twenty-seven post offices were built between 1892 and 1895, funding to the Government Architect's Office was cut from 1893 to 1895, causing Vernon to postpone a number of projects. Following Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for post, telegraph and telephone offices, with the Department of Home Affairs Works Division being made responsible for post office construction. In 1916 construction was transferred to the Department of Works and Railways, with the Department of the Interior responsible during World War II. On 22 December 1975 the Postmaster-General's Department was abolished and replaced by the Postal and Telecommunications Department, with Telecom and Australia Post being created. In 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Act established Australia Post as a self-funding entity, which heralded a new direction in property management, including a move towards smaller, shop-front style post offices away from the larger more traditional buildings. For much of its history, the post office has been responsible for a wide variety of community services including mail distribution, as agencies for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, electoral enrolments, and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. The town post office served as a focal point for the community, most often built in a prominent position in the center of town close to other public buildings, creating a nucleus of civic buildings and community pride. = European history of Tamworth = Europeans first crossed the Peel River Valley and Tamworth district in 1818, when John Oxley explored the area during his second expedition north from Bathurst. Despite his favourable assessment of the areas' rich grazing land it was another nine years before the first pastoralists began to settle in the district. In 1832 the Australian Agricultural Company (AA Co) took up two large plots of land in exchange for land they already held in Port Stephens. One of these plots equalling 313,298 acres (121,410 hectares) included the site that would be selected for the settlement of Tamworth. In July 1834 the first buildings were erected by the AA Co to house their employees, their stores and their two hundred assigned convicts. The site chosen was in what is now Ebsworth Street. Initially the AA Co provided all the essential community services including doctor, hospital and school; however, by the close of the 1830s, several shops and hotels had been built privately to service the Company's employees. This constituted the beginning of the township of Tamworth. In November 1835, James White opened a store on the east side of the river in what is now Peel Street. His was the first building on the east side. White traded for eighteen months before selling the business to Richard Stubbs and his partner J. J. C. Irving. In 1839 they too sold the store, this time to Thomas Byrne, who in 1840 became Tamworth's first Postmaster. In 1847 the AA Co Commissioner, Phillip Parker King, suggested to the Commissioner for Crown Lands, Roderick Mitchell, that Tamworth be laid out as a town. Surveyor John Gorman submitted his plan for a Tamworth Reserve on 31 July 1849, after which Sir Thomas Mitchell, Roderick's father, began laying out the design for the town and named its original streets. The first sale of building blocks in the Government town took place in July 1850, with most of the land being sold by 1853. However, the town was slow to develop, with only 600 residents by the end of the 1850s. =Establishment of Tamworth Post Office= Tamworth continued to grow steadily through the 1860s. In 1861 the telegraph line was extended to Tamworth with a new telegraph office being built in 1866. Within this office a room was set aside for use as a post office but soon proved to be too small. Following agitation from the local residents, ¬£1,000 was set aside in 1876 for the construction of an extension. Despite objections from the Postmaster as to the positioning of the new extension, close to a stable, water closets and cowyard, the room was completed in October 1881. Measuring at a cost of ¬£345, the room was only a temporary measure and was soon viewed as too small to operate effectively. In March 1881, before the new extension was even completed, a public meeting produced a petition from Tamworth residents calling for the erection of a new Post and Telegraph Office to replace the 1866 building and extensions. The railway was extended to East Tamworth in 1882, which initiated a building boom as a newfound confidence settled over the town. Also in 1882, ¬£4,000 was assigned and plans were commenced for a new office. The tender was awarded in November 1883 to J. Conlon for a cost of ¬£4,845. Still deemed too small, two further land purchases in late 1883 were made to accommodate the planned building, which included a colonnade to both Peel and Fitzroy Streets. The Colonial Architect's Office drew up the final plans in 1884 with the tender for construction going to W. C. Cains from Sydney for ¬£6,859. The Hon J. Norton, Postmaster General, laid the foundation stone on 23 January 1886 and the new building was occupied by the Post Office on 31 May 1886. The clock was not ready for installation at the official opening but was installed late in 1886. In December 1870 the Post Office and Telegraph Office were combined while in December 1871 a branch of the Government Savings Bank was opened in the Post Office. In February 1900 the Telephone Exchange was opened, with 80 subscribers by 1902. The exchange went automatic in March 1939, the first country automatic exchange apart from Canberra. During the 1960s the first major alteration was undertaken at a cost of $160,000. This work included doubling the length of the facade in Fitzroy Street with a new colonnade constructed to the ground and first floors matching the original 1886 work. The extension increased the floor space by . In 1986 a further $355,200 was spent on renovations, alterations and repairs including an increase in the public space and business area and a total refurbishment of the first floor office space and reception areas.  Description  The Tamworth Post Office is a two-storey Victorian Italianate building constructed in ashlar pattern rendered brickwork, with a four-storey corner clock tower. The building is painted an apricot colour with off-white detailing and dark green window and door frames. It has a predominantly hipped corrugated iron roof behind a balustraded parapet wall that encloses the building and it is punctuated at the centre of the front-hipped roof by a rendered and painted chimney. The tower is capped by a cast concrete cupola with iron finial at the apex, housing the striking hour bell, and it retains four clock faces to the level below. It is the dominant feature of the building and streetscape and is accessed internally via an elegant cast iron spiral stair and fixed timber ladder leading up to the clock mechanism at the third-floor level from the first-floor level. Paired narrow sash windows beneath each face light the level below. There are three arcaded and balustraded facades fronting Peel and Fitzroy Streets and the laneway to the north. The two storey arcades comprise solid masonry elements and round arches to the ground floor with a wrought iron balustrade, and round arches supported by slender classical concrete columns to the first floor with a masonry balustrade. There is a timber boarded soffit and asphalt lined floor to the first floor verandah and a shallow barrel vaulted plaster soffit with moulded cornice and concrete tiled floor to the ground floor verandah. There is a textured soffit to the western end addition of the southern ground floor verandah. The main addition to the Post Office is the 1966 Telephone Exchange western addition fronting Fitzroy Street, in sympathetic style and scale to the original building, comprising the western six arched bays. Roofing to this area could not be seen behind the parapet, but is presumably hipped similar to the original. Fenestration of Tamworth Post Office is regular, with windows and doors spaced between arches of the verandahs. To the ground floor original section of the building fronting Peel Street, there are two pairs of French doors at the centre, with fanlight and arched window over each and paired, side hung windows either side with arched fanlights over, of matching proportions to the doors. The 1966 addition to Fitzroy Street has modern automatic sliding glass doors to the Post Office and modern shop windows either side. The first-floor openings comprise French doors and modern flush doors to the original openings fronting Peel Street and to the eastern end fronting Fitzroy Street. There are false doors and smaller windows to the extension at the western end addition of the Fitzroy Street facade, all located at regular intervals between arched bays. All openings are square cut and simply detailed. The ground floor of Tamworth Post Office comprises three main areas, including the large carpeted public retail area fronting Fitzroy Street to the west and the narrow, tiled public post boxes area on the northern side. The carpeted post office storage and sorting areas are combined with offices at the centre and there is a large, open, carpeted commercial premises fronting Peel Street, separate from the post office, with a grey/blue colour scheme. The ground floor Australia Post retail area to the western end fronting Fitzroy Street has the standard Australia Post fitout of display wall panelling, laminated counters and carpet in the grey colour scheme. Ceilings to the ground floor are predominantly false without a cornice and set back from the outer wall fabric, or plasterboard with a coved cornice. Air conditioning vents and ducting are located throughout. Lighting consists of fluorescent tubes and large pendant lights to the verandahs. Architraves to the ground floor appear to be original, to the original section of building fronting Peel Street and there does not appear to be any original skirting material retained. Internal doors to the largely partitioned spaces are modern. Windows to the northern wall of the commercial space have been mostly blocked, with small arched windows remaining high in the wall. The ground floor has a series of plasterboard partitioned offices to the western side of the building occupied by the Post Office, as well as a small plasterboard office within the eastern commercial space. There is original rendered masonry wall fabric to the post office and commercial space, while the 1966 addition southern wall is a stud wall with ashlar patterned sheet lining to the exterior facade. There is one chimney breast evident to the ground floor centre of the commercial space that has been bricked in. The later terrazzo stair to the first floor has a simple steel balustrade and is located at the start of the 1966 addition. It can be accessed from the Post Office, exterior and the commercial space. The first floor of Tamworth Post Office comprises the concrete and vinyl tiled former telephone exchange, tiled staff amenities and carpeted lunch room, storage and former offices, the front \\"meeting\\" room having sheet vinyl flooring. Excepting the staff amenities and lunchroom, the upper floor is currently vacant. Ceilings to the first floor are as for the ground floor, being suspended ceilings without cornices and later plasterboard with coved cornices. Air conditioning vents are located within the ceilings and there are banks of fluorescent lighting to the spaces, with pendant lights to the verandah. Some original architraves are retained to the first floor original section of building; however, the rest of the first floor has modern architraves and there is a plain black modern skirting strip to the entire floor. Some of the verandah doors are original and are fixed closed, with non- original louvred fanlights. Usable doors to the verandah are modern, as are all internal doors. Walls to the first floor are rendered brick and asbestos cement sheet partitioning, with some timber and glass partitioning to the southwestern corner of the original section of building. A bricked in fireplace is located within the front \\"meeting\\" room and there are some air conditioning units fixed to walls. Signage to the building comprises Tamworth Post Office 2340 lettering across the eastern facade below the balustraded parapet and a standard Australia Post sign to the southern facade. There are smaller signs attached to the ground floor Peel Street facade related to the commercial premises and temporary Australia Post banners are currently located below the street fronting clock faces. Tamworth Post Office, with its prominent clock tower, is a landmark feature in the streetscape of Tamworth's Civic Centre. The building is set within a predominantly two-storey modern and historic streetscape. To the west of the Post Office is the three-storey s-70s Telstra building abutting the Post Office addition and to the north, with a narrow laneway between, is the two-storey, classically-influenced Commonwealth Bank. The Post Office site complex is fully developed, and there are no smaller associated outbuildings or structures remaining. The hard street edges of Tamworth's Civic Precinct have been softened with landscaping including large palm trees, one located at the front corner of the Post Office, flower beds, cast iron bollards, pedestrian islands and crossings, and sympathetic \\"heritage\\" street lighting. = Condition = As at 3 August 2000, the Tamworth Post Office was in very good condition. There is some archaeological potential. Little original internal fabric remains, excepting a few walls and the clock mechanism. The exterior is in very good condition and is intact to its original form excepting the sympathetic addition to the west, fronting Fitzroy Street. Tamworth Post Office still retains the features which make it culturally significant, including the prominent clock tower, arcaded loggia, stucco wall finish and the cast-iron spiral staircase. = Modifications and dates = Historic photographs and plans indicate that the original 1886 building comprised the corner tower, four arched bays west and seven bays to the north of the main body of the building. Records report that the clock faces were not installed until later in 1886. Extensions were undertaken in 1966 to the Fitzroy Street facade to accommodate a telephone exchange and additional mail box facilities. These additions were extensive, but constructed in a sympathetic style and continue the essential architectural elements of the original building. The original Peel Street facade and the corner tower appear to remain as originally constructed. Extensive internal modifications have occurred over time, including the relocation of the Post Office to the rear addition ground floor and the creation of the isolated commercial premises at the front of the building, possibly during the 1986 alterations.

The lake provides a space for swimming, kayaking, small boat sailing, and canoeing for those staying at the camp. The lake's surrounding woods also provide many hiking trails that are available to both campers and non-camper visitors. The lake is also home to several species of freshwater fish and aquatic fauna, and hosts a large amount of fishing on a catch-and-release basis.  J. Bulow Campbell  J. Bulow Campbell (1870‚Äì1940) was a businessman, philanthropist, and an early supporter of the building of Bert Adams Scout Reservation. He is attributed as the namesake of Lake Bulow Campbell. Campbell was born on December 15, 1870. He founded and headed the Campbell Coal Company, an Atlanta area based company that delivered both ice and coal. Campbell also served as a director of The Coca-Cola Company (similar to many of the early supporters of Boy Scouts in the Atlanta Area) and the Trust Company of Georgia. He also was a member of the Atlanta Rotary Club (also similarly to many early supporters of Boy Scouts in Atlanta). In the 1920s, he acted as a major advocate for the construction for a new permanent summer camp for Boy Scouts in the Atlanta Area Council. This advocation aided in the ultimate building of the Bert Adams Scout Reservation. For this advocation, and other work he completed in the early attempts to build the camp, in 1960, when the camp moved to its current location south of Covington, Georgia, the new reservoir lake that was constructed was named after Campbell.

He was also a leading figure of the Association G√©n√©rale des Baluba du Katanga (BALUBAKAT). Mwamba was born in 1921 in Vunga, Belgian Congo to a Luba family. After completing his education he took up work at the √âlisabethville Parquet. He later co-founded and became secretary-general of BALUBAKAT. He served in the Coll√©ge Ex√©cutive G√©n√©ral transitional government before being elected a senator of the newly independent Republic of the Congo in 1960. Mwamba was subsequently appointed to serve as Minister of Justice in the first government under Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. On 5 September he and Lumumba were dismissed by the President. Following harassment by the new authorities, Mwamba fled to Stanleyville and joined a rival regime. Negotiations led to the creation of a new government in August 1961 under Cyrille Adoula and he resumed his work as Minister of Justice. Following his dismissal in July 1962, Mwamba joined the parliamentary opposition. He died in 1967.  Early life and entry into politics  R√©my Mwamba was born in 1921 in Vunga, Belgian Congo. He was a Muluba and a direct descendant of Mutombo Mukulu. He underwent six years of primary education before studying at the Institut Saint-Boniface in √âlisabethville for four years, followed by two years of secondary education. Mwamba eventually became chief clerk of the √âlisabethville Parquet and a member of the council of the Kenya commune. He also co-founded the Association G√©n√©rale des Baluba du Katanga (BALUBAKAT) party in 1957 and became its secretary-general. He was a friend and confidant of BALUBAKAT leader Jason Sendwe. Mwamba attended the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference of January‚ÄìFebruary 1960 in Brussels as delegate of the BALUBAKAT cartel. The Congolese delegates accepted the offer of the independence of the \\"Republic of the Congo\\" on 30 June 1960 from the Belgian government. Mwamba was appointed to a commission established to determine whether Belgium should retain any powers or official responsibilities in the Congo after 30 June. Ultimately the commission decided that the Congolese state should assume all responsibilities of governance. One of the resolutions adopted at the Round Table called for the establishment of a Coll√©ge Ex√©cutive G√©n√©ral (General Executive College), a body composed of six Congolese (one from each province) designed to share power with the Governor-general until independence. Mwamba served in it on behalf of Katanga. In May 1960 Mwamba went to Brazzaville at the invitation of Congo-Brazza President Fulbert Youlou to listen to a proposal for the incorporation of the Republic of the Congo and Congo-Brazza into a larger federation. He unsuccessfully competed for a seat in the Chamber of Deputies in the general elections that preceded independence. However, on 12 June he was elected as a non-customary member of the Senate by the Katangese Provincial Assembly. That month he investigated the legitimacy of the elections in Katanga.  Minister of Justice  Mwamba was appointed to serve as Minister of Justice in the first government of the independent Congo under Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. The government was invested by Parliament on 24 June 1960. He competed with Minister of Interior Christophe Gbenye to assert his authority over the S√ªret√© Nationale (security police) until Lumumba attached the chief of the organisation to his own office. On 5 July the Congolese garrisons in L√©opoldville and Thysville mutinied, triggering a domestic crisis. On 8 July the Council of Ministers convened to discuss reorganisation of the army. Several ministers wanted Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu to become the new Commander-in-Chief. Mwamba believed he was too young and suggested Victor Lundula for the role. The ministers eventually compromised, accepting Mwamba's recommendation and making Mobutu the army chief of staff. Three days later Mwamba ordered the Procureur g√©n√©ral to launch inquiries into the actions of soldiers against Europeans in the province of Kasai. On 28 July he was made a member of a cabinet committee established to coordinate government actions with those of United Nations officials. In early August he went to New York as part of a Congolese delegation to address the UN Security Council. On 5 September President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Lumumba, Mwamba, and several other members of the government from office. first Congolese government (pictured). The government was paralyzed by the political battle that ensued, and on 14 September, Colonel Mobutu announced a military takeover and the installation of his own administration. Two days later, Lumumba was placed under house arrest. By October, Lumumba's supporters were convinced that few of their goals could be achieved through the new government. In November Mobutu's troops arrested and harassed several of them, including Mwamba. Antoine Gizenga, the former Deputy Prime Minister, fled to Stanleyville to set up a new pro-Lumumba regime. Mwamba attempted to escape to the city with Lumumba and Pierre Mulele. At the Sankuru river Lumumba was separated from his wife and youngest child and, against Mwamba's and Mulele's advice, went back for them and was arrested. Mwamba and Mulele spent several days in the bush before reaching Stanleyville. Once there the former was made Minister of Justice in Gizenga's government. In January 1961 Lumumba was executed in the secessionist State of Katanga. His death brought negative opinion of both Katanga and the central government to a climax. Hoping to defuse the situation, the L√©opoldville authorities opened serious negotiations with Gizenga's regime. The following month Mwamba toured the declared \\"Province of Lualaba\\" in northern Katanga. On 2 August a compromise between the central government and Gizenga's regime resulted in the installation of a new national coalition government under Cyrille Adoula. Mwamba returned to his post as Minister of Justice. In late December he accompanied Adoula to Kitona to negotiate with Katangese President Mo√Øse Tshombe. In July 1962 Adoula shuffled his cabinet and Mwamba was dismissed.  Later life  Following his removal from the government, Mwamba entered the parliamentary opposition and worked to dislodge Adoula. In 1963 he criticised the creation of Nord-Katanga, a Luba-dominated province split off from the rest of Katanga. Mwamba also called for the BALUBAKAT to revert to the use of one of its earlier names, Parti Progressiste Katangais, to change its ethnic nature and allow it to become a \\"Pankatangais\\" party. In March 1964 BALUBAKAT formed a cartel with two other political parties, CONAKAT and AFEKER, to become the ABC. Mwamba was elected its president in July. He died of a heart attack in Kinshasa in 1967 at the age of 45.

The genus contains three members: Acrocnida brachiata, Acrocnida semisquamata, and Acrocnida spatulispina. There has also been observed hybridization between both Acrocnida brachiata and Acrocnida spatulispina. It is a fairly common genus, usually found along the coasts of Northwestern Europe, but with some species like semisquamata appearing around West Africa. Members of this genus primarily prefer intertidal and sub-tidal habitats, and they are they are less likely to be found in intertidal areas by comparison. This genus was not officially classified until 1926, by T. Gisl√©n. One study found that due to the increased calcification that Acrocnida brachiata causes could be a potential source of Carbon Dioxide for not only the warm, shallow environments they live in, but also for the atmosphere. Species The World Register of Marine Species lists the following species. * Acrocnida brachiata (Montagu, 1804) * Acrocnida semisquamata (Koehler, 1914) * Acrocnida spatulispina (St√∂hr & Muths, 2010) The species, Acrocnida brachiata, was recently found to be two species, Acrocnida brachiata and Acrocnida semisquamata, by St√∂hr & Muths in 2010.  Distribution  This genus can be found spread around Northwestern Europe and off the Western coast of Africa. Acrocnida members generally prefer the sandy bottoms (specifically fine or muddy sand) of shallow coastal zones for their habitats. Acrocnida brachiata is a fairly widespread member of this genus in terms of distribution. While it was discovered in 1808 by George Montagu, their spread was still being recorded as far as the 1970s, with it being found in the North Sea. In recency, Acrocnida brachiata has been found in the Aegean Sea for the first time in 2007, after only being noted on the Mediterranean Sea facing coast of Turkey in 1995. Acrocnida semisquamata is primarily located off of the coast of Ghana, and Acrocnida spatulispina has only been observed in the English Channel.  Morphology  Acrocnida follows the body plan of other Amphiuridae, as they possess central disks surrounded by five long, thin arms. They only possess one outer mouth papilla, which is removed from the infradental papillae. Members of Acrocnida possess mucous glands described as \\"multecellular aggregations of pyriform cells with elongate necks\\" Like other members of Ophiurida, Acrocnida can part with limbs and regenerate a new limb.  Reproductive Cycle  These sea stars mainly follow an annual schedule for their reproductive cycle. Looking at Acrocnida brachiata, gonads begin forming in late Summer and Autumn, with the spawning taking place within a range of March to May. This places Acrocnida brachiata and other members of the genus in the category of \\"discreet annual breeder.\\" Eggs created by Acrocnida brachiata lie in a range of 180 to 350 micrometers. This size places Acrocnida with an \\"intermediate level of fecundity\\" and a larval development similar to other genera of sea stars.  Common Behavior  Acrocnida and other Amphiuridae practice very similar behaviors. In order to avoid predation, these organisms dig a semi-permanent hole, which they reinforce using the mucus they naturally produce. They then dip their disk into the hole, and leave the arms just poking out enough so that they may still explore and interact with the area outside of their burrow. Members of the genus Acrocnida utilize their Water vascular system to ventilate their burrows. Acrocnida brachiata is usually seen with Echinocardium cordatum, commonly known as the Sea Potato.

The railway bridge was designed by John Whitton as the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and built during 1882 by J. S. Bennett, with iron work by J. & C. Brettell, Worcester, England. The bridge is also known as the Tamworth rail bridge over Peel River and the Tamworth Lattice Railway Bridge. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The bridge was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 and was added to the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate on 18 April 1989. The bridge is located from Sydney Central station.  History  During the 20-year period 1873-1893 there was a massive programme of public works in New South Wales, particularly in expanding the road and rail networks. It was a boom period that ended with a severe economic depression. Despite the boom conditions, the respective Chief Engineers, for Roads (William C. Bennett) and for Railways (John Whitton) were constrained to economise by using as much local material as possible, consequently an enormous amount of hardwood timber was used for bridgeworks, mostly timber beam and timber truss bridges. However, there were many major rivers to be crossed, requiring long span bridges, for which no form of timber bridge was suitable. These large bridges had to be metal and supplied from England, a very expensive import cost to the successive colonial governments. Both Chief Engineers were British so they chose the widely used wrought iron lattice truss bridge in the half-through form. Twelve of these were built for the railways and 24 for roads. These two sets of iron lattice bridges are the most significant group of bridges of the colonial period. A high percentage are extant and still in use, eleven on railways and eighteen on roads. The current railway lattice bridges are: *1876Macquarie River railway bridge at Bathurst *1881Murrumbidgee River railway bridge at Wagga Wagga *1881Macquarie River at Wellington *1882Peel River at Tamworth *1882Macdonald River railway bridge at Woolbrook *1884Murray River railway bridge at Albury-Wodonga *1884Macquarie River railway bridge at Dubbo *1885Murrumbidgee River railway bridge at Narrandera *1887Lachlan River railway bridge at Cowra Two former railway lattice bridges (1885 Georges River railway bridge at Como and 1886 Parramatta River railway bridge at Meadowbank) were converted for use by pedestrian/cycle ways. The 1871 lattice railway bridge over the Hunter River at Aberdeen was replaced by steel girders and demolished.  Description  A single-span wrought iron lattice bridge. The span is to centres of piers and the lattice work has seven triangulations. The piers are pairs of cast iron cylinders, supplied by the Stockton Forge Co., England. The bridge carries a single railway, with transomes on timber stringers on metal cross girders, which frame into the sides of the lower chords. The main trusses are simply supported, through type lattice trusses. They are of constant depth with seven triangulations and are connected together above the track by characteristic arched latticed braces. The trusses rest on twin, cast iron cylinder piers. There are extensive approaches, particularly on the south side. The superstructure was fabricated by J. and C. Brettell, Worcestor, England; A. and R. Amos were the principal contractors. It was load tested on 16 November 1881 and placed in service on 9 January 1882. = Condition = As at 16 March 2006, the physical condition was good. Apart from relatively minor technical works of repair and strengthening, all the iron lattice railway bridges retain their original fabrics.  Heritage listing  As at 16 March 2006, this bridge was a member of the most significant group of colonial bridges in New South Wales. Collectively, as items of railway infrastructure, they contributed significantly to the history and development of New South Wales. Each bridge is an imposing structure at its site. In terms of contemporary bridge technology the wrought iron lattice bridge was among the best for major bridgeworks. The bridge built in 1882 is one of the original iron lattice Whitton bridges and is an important surviving element from the most significant period of railway development. It is an excellent example in an important railway town. The building of such a relatively large structure on this cross country line reflects the importance that the railway administration gave to this line to provide an outlet for coal from Lithgow, and produce from central NSW, to reach the south and Victoria and vice versa. Tamworth rail bridge over Peel River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Twelve wrought iron lattice railway bridges were built in New South Wales during the boom period for railway construction 1871-1887, starting at Aberdeen and ending at Cowra. Nine of the survivors are owned and managed by the RailCorp. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. All nine iron lattice railway bridges are imposing structures. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Every iron lattice railway bridge crossed a major river which made it possible for the railway extension to develop the districts reached, socially and commercially. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The iron lattice bridge was a technically sound structure for the bridge technology of the late colonial period. Its strength and durability have shown it to have been a very cost-effective form of bridge. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Collectively, the iron lattice railway bridges represent a significant class of bridge structure.

He consolidated French control over Vietnam, and developed the city of Saigon as a major port. Early years (1807‚Äì40) The La Grandi√®re family originated in Anjou and was involved in the navy from the 18th century. Pierre-Paul de La Grandi√®re's grandfather, Charles Marie de La Grandi√®re (1729‚Äì1812), fought in the American Revolutionary War, and during 64 years of service rose to the rank of Naval Commander in Brest. One of his uncles died on the Esp√©rance while serving under Huon de Kermadec during the search for the lost expedition of Lap√©rouse. His father, Joseph Auguste Marie de La Grandi√®re (1770‚Äì1845), emigrated in 1792 during the French Revolution, returned to the navy with the Bourbon Restoration and ended his career as a frigate captain in Lorient. His mother, Anne-Marie Chaillou de l'√âtang (1780‚Äì1860), was from an old family of Breton magistrates. La Grandi√®re's parents married in Redon, Ille-et-Vilaine, in 1802. Pierre Paul Marie de La Grandi√®re was their third child, born in Redon on 28 June 1807. In 1820 he entered the Angoul√™me naval school, and in May 1823 he embarked on the Circ√© on a voyage from Brest to R√©union, the West Indies, Newfoundland and then back to Brest. In 1827 he was a lieutenant on the Trident in the Battle of Navarino in which an Ottoman Empire fleet was defeated by an Anglo-French-Russian coalition fighting for the independence of Greece. In 1837 he served under Admiral Louis Fran√ßois Jean Leblanc(fr) in the French blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata and distinguished himself in the attack on Mart√≠n Garc√≠a Island and the blockade of Buenos Aires. He explored the Paran√° and Uruguay rivers. Captain (1840‚Äì61) In 1840 La Grandi√®re was promoted to frigate captain (capitaine de fr√©gate). He was made a member of the committee on artillery equipment. He held several commands in the Levant and then off Brazil. He was posted to the Indret Foundry(fr) near Nantes in 1844. In 1846 he was aide-de- camp and chief of staff to Admiral Leblanc, who had been appointed Maritime Prefect of Brest. On 20 July 1847 he married Augustine Marc'hallac'h (1823‚Äì68). Their children were Augustin (1849‚Äì1918), M√©lanie Mathilde (1857‚Äì1913) and F√©lix Palam√®de Pierre (1859‚Äì1923). In 1849 La Grandi√®re commanded the M√©l√©agre off Newfoundland, and that year was promoted to ship captain (capitaine de vaisseau). La Grandi√®re was given command of the corvette Eurydice during the Crimean War. It was rumored that La Grandi√®re had shown cowardice on 31 August for not bringing the Eurydice to assist the Forte in engaging the Russian shore batteries. He violently refuted this aspersion. He participated in the Kamchatka expedition against Russia, where he distinguished himself although the operation was unsuccessful. He returned to France in 1856 and joined the Department of Maps and Plans in Paris and was then briefly in charge of the Mechanics Examination Committee. In 1859 he took command of the Breslaw in the Adriatic Sea. The French under Napoleon III assisted the Italians led by Cavour's Kingdom of Sardinia in their war for unity against the Austrians. In October 1860 La Grandi√®re was head of the Syrian Station. Admiral (1861‚Äì76) The French ship Duperr√© French Indochina. Cochinchina is the southernmost province. La Grandi√®re was promoted to rear admiral in December 1861, and in 1862 was major general in Cherbourg and then in Brest. T·ª± ƒê·ª©c, the Nguy·ªÖn emperor of Vietnam, ceded control of Saigon and the adjoining provinces of Bi√™n H√≤a, Gia ƒê·ªãnh and ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng to the French under the Treaty of Saigon of 5 June 1862, which they organized as the colony of Cochinchina. He also gave the French control of his trade and foreign relations and accepted French advisers, in effect becoming a French puppet. Admiral Louis Adolphe Bonard ensured that in the Treaty of Hu√© of 14 April 1863 T·ª± ƒê·ª©c confirmed the 1862 Treaty of Saigon under which Tonkin became a protectorate. In May 1863 Prosper de Chasseloup-Laubat, Minister of Marine and Colonies, named La Grandi√®re Governor General and commander of the Cochinchina naval station, with the Duperr√© as his flagship. La Grandi√®re proved to be a capable administrator and economist. He developed the port of Saigon with a refit basin, a floating dock and various other facilities to make the port a major site for reception and repair of ships. At first he prohibited the export of rice to ensure the supply of the local population and improve crops so they could again be exported. He developed French and indigenous administrations, created more schools, recruited and trained Indochinese troops and abolished corporal punishment. He supported Ernest Doudart de Lagr√©e and Francis Garnier in their Mekong expedition of 1866‚Äì1868. In 1866 La Grandi√®re initiated collection of artifacts from ancient Khmer and Ch√†m sites to be exhibited in Saigon, but they had to be stored until a suitable building could be made available. La Grandi√®re made Achille-Antoine Hermitte head of his architectural department, as recommended by admirals Pierre-Gustave Roze and Gustave Ohier. His priority was to design a new Governor's Palace since the existing wooden building was in disrepair. La Grandi√®re laid the cornerstone for this building on 23 March 1868, a block of blue granite from Bi√™n H√≤a containing a lead coffer that in turn contained newly-minted gold, silver and copper coins of Napoleon III. In 1868 La Grandi√®re gave precise orders for collection and classification of dossiers, the origin of the French archives in Indochina. He recruited M. A. Petiton, a mining engineer from La Grand-Combe, Gard, as Chief Engineer of the Cochinchina Mines Service, with the mandate of undertaking geological and mining studies throughout Indochina. Petiton arrived in October 1868, after La Grandi√®re had left Saigon. On 11 August 1863 Admiral de La Grandi√®re signed a Treaty of Friendship, Trade and French Protection with King Norodom of Cambodia. La Grandi√®re visited Siem Reap and the ruins of Angkor Wat, then in Siamese territory, but he treated it as if it were part of Cambodia. La Grandi√®re was promoted to vice admiral in September 1865. He supervised the 1866 French campaign against Korea by Rear Admiral Roze following the massacre of several French Catholics by the regent of the Kingdom of Korea. La Grandi√®re was concerned that the Vietnamese provinces to the west of Cochinchina would be trouble spots, and secretly organized an expedition that occupied Vƒ©nh Long, Sa ƒê√©c, Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc and H√† Ti√™n on 20‚Äì24 June 1867. Phan Thanh Gi·∫£n, former envoy of Tu Duc in Paris and now governor of these provinces, told the mandarins to avoid bloodshed and submit. He then committed suicide. The French now controlled the whole of southern Vietnam. La Grandi√®re wrote, La Grandi√®re returned to France in April 1868. He was named Maritime Prefect of Toulon in 1870. He retired to Finist√®re and died in Quimper on 25 August 1876.

Raised in western Pennsylvania in September 1864, the regiment initially served with the Army of the James during the Siege of Petersburg, holding trenches at Bermuda Hundred. In late November it transferred to the Army of the Potomac and during the northern hemisphere spring campaign fought in the counterattack during the Battle of Fort Stedman and the Union breakthrough at Petersburg. During the last days of the Appomattox Campaign it guarded trains, and participated in the Grand Review of the Armies following the end of the war before mustering out.  History  = Formation and Army of the James service = The 211th Pennsylvania was raised in western Pennsylvania during September 1864 in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for 500,000 men. A large number of its soldiers were veterans on their second enlistment. Company A was composed of men recruited in Crawford County, Company B in Jefferson County, Company C in McKean and Jefferson Counties, Company D in Mercer County, Companies E, H, I, and K in Westmoreland County, Company F in Erie County, and Company G in Warren County. The ten companies of the regiment moved to Camp Reynolds near Pittsburgh, where they were organized on 16 September under the command of volunteer officer Colonel James H. Trimble. After completing its organization, the 211th Pennsylvania was sent to the front and took up positions in the trenches at Bermuda Hundred, Virginia on 20 September; it joined the Provisional Brigade of the Defenses of Bermuda Hundred of the Army of the James in the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia. Soon after its arrival at the front, the regiment mounted the parapets of its trenches and exposed itself to Confederate fire to divert attention from the successful Union attack on Fort Harrison; two men of Company F were killed by a single shell during this action. The regiment held a picket line from the James River opposite Dutch Gap through dense woods to its camp in a cleared area whose apex projected near the Confederate line. Fraternization between the opposing pickets was routine, but this state of affairs ended when Confederate division commander George Pickett launched a night attack on 17 November that captured 54 Union pickets and the angle, where a redoubt was constructed. Union commander Ulysses S. Grant considered retaking it inadvisable, and from this point hostilities in earnest resumed in the regimental sector, forcing its soldiers to remain under cover while in the trenches. = Army of the Potomac service during late 1864 and early 1865 = The regiment and the rest of the Pennsylvania regiments which formed the Provisional Brigade were relieved by a United States Colored Troops brigade on 27 November and transferred to the IX Corps of the Army of the Potomac, holding positions on the southern bank of the Appomattox River. The brigade was organized during December into the 3rd Division of the corps, commanded by Brigadier General John F. Hartranft. The 211th became part of the 2nd Brigade of Colonel Joseph A. Mathews alongside the 205th and 207th Pennsylvania. During the northern hemisphere winter of 1864‚Äì1865, the regiment spent most of its time training. This routine was broken by its participating in several forays without being involved in fighting, supporting the Weldon Railroad expedition between 7 and 11 December and the Battle of Hatcher's Run from 5 to 7 February 1865, doing much fortifying in the latter. Trimble resigned on 18 March, and was replaced in command by Lieutenant Colonel Levi A. Dodd. The regiment encamped in the rear of IX Corps halfway between Fort Howard and Fort Alexander Hays on the Army Line Railroad, a supporting position on the far left of the division. = Fort Stedman = bombproof at Fort Stedman When Fort Stedman was captured by a Confederate attack before dawn on 25 March, the regiment was in camp almost four miles away. Command devolved on Captain William A. Coulter of Company D as Dodd was sick in hospital and Major Augustus A. Mechling was absent. The regiment was ordered to march to the division headquarters, arriving there by 06:30. Having formed up on the high open ground near Meade Station to the rear of Fort Stedman, the relatively large regiment with almost 600 men advanced in line in accordance with Hartranft's plan to use it to draw Confederate artillery fire. Hartranft led the advance, which was the signal for the attack of the rest of the division. The fort was quickly recaptured after the Union counterattack resulted in the retreat of the exhausted Confederate troops; the 211th Pennsylvania lost one killed and ten wounded in the fighting while capturing the rear of the fort. = Petersburg breakthrough and Appomattox = Confederate defenses of Fort Mahone at Petersburg, Virginia, 1865, where the regiment fought on 2 April A map of the 2 April actions at Petersburg; the 211th was part of Parke's IX Corps The regiment fought in the Appomattox Campaign between 28 March and 9 April, during which it participated in the Union breakthrough at Petersburg on 2 April. The regiment prepared for the assault along with the rest of the division on the night of 30 March, but it was postponed until the morning of 2 April. After marching to the camp of the 207th Pennsylvania just before midnight on 1 April, the 211th moved to the front at 03:30 on 2 April, and took positions alongside the brigade with its left on the Jerusalem Plank Road. Lieutenant Albert Alexander of Company D commanded a detail of pioneers from the brigade, which cut down the abatis and chevaux de frise in front of the Confederate positions despite artillery fire. Behind the pioneers, the division advanced, with the 211th closely behind the 207th and 205th Pennsylvania in the column of the brigade. Dodd led the 211th and elements of the 207th towards Fort Mahone after the initial breakthrough and captured it, then brought artillerymen up to turn the guns around. The regiment repulsed multiple counterattacks in fierce fighting, suffering a total of 135 casualties: four officers and seventeen men killed, four officers and 89 men wounded, and 21 missing. Among the dead were Lieutenant Colonel Charles McLain and Alexander, while Major Elias B. Lee was mortally wounded. Privates John C. Ewing of Company E and Amzi D. Harmon of Company K were awarded the Medal of Honor for capturing the flags of the 61st Alabama and the 45th North Carolina, respectively. On the night of 3 April, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia retreated from Petersburg, which the division entered on the following morning, meeting little resistance. The 211th picketed the bank of the Appomattox River and saved the railroad bridge and part of the foot bridge from fires started by Confederate forces before marching back to camp in midday. During the pursuit of the Confederate forces it guarded the trains as the army advanced along the Southside Railroad, receiving news of the Confederate surrender at Nottoway Court House on 9 April. The 211th remained there until 20 April, then moved to City Point and lastly Alexandria between 20 and 28 April, where it remained until mustering out. After participating in the Grand Review of the Armies on 23 May, it mustered out on 2 June. During its service, the regiment lost six officers and 38 men killed or mortally wounded, and 53 men to disease, for a total of 97.  Monuments  The designation of the 211th Pennsylvania is inscribed on the monument to Hartranft's division on the site of Fort Mahone in Petersburg.

Characterized by being a catamaran with a single sail of type marconi without boom and the peculiarity of not having rudder nor centreboard. The steering of the boat is carried out with the movement and distribution of the weight of the skipper along the length and width of the deck of the ship and with the sheet, which holds the sail. It is specially designed to be used on the beach, this is the reason for not having centreboard or rudder.  History  Designed by the Catalan brothers Mong√© in 1942, it is the formal and advanced development of a concept that was born in the beach of Badalona at the first quarter of the century. At the beginning, there was no sail and the propulsion was done by rowing, but it was very rudimentary and heavy. Subsequently a mast was added. Finally the definitive creators of the class lightened it up and added the transversal steel bar conforming the boat exactly as we know it today. It suffered minor modifications until the year 1943 when entered in the definition of monotip, starting to be known as \\"Pat√≠n a vela\\" http://www.adipav.org and after a certain period of time, finally has received the surname of \\"Pat√≠n catal√°n\\" (Catalan catamaran). Its basic characteristics are those of a catamaran and it's the only boat that is steered without a rudder; with a sail without battens and no boom. A simple and light sailing boat that is steered by displacing the skeeper's body over the length of the deck. What is most striking is its uniqueness, because nothing similar is known around the world. The history of this unique catamaran, is linked to the existence of the Catalan coast, it is documented and recognized in the minutes of ADIPAV's board , in the chronicles of historians, in the bulletins of Club Nataci√≥n Barcelona and others that reflect at the same time agreements referring to it as \\"Pat√≠n a Vela\\".  Constructive characteristics  Pat√≠n a vela \\"Fortuna\\", stranded in the alt= Its structure is made of plywood and solid wood, although some units are also manufactured in fiberglass. It is formed by two hulls (buoyancies) that fulfill the function of antiderivative planes. The hulls are linked together by the deck, composed of five independent \\"stands\\" (transversal planks) that provide rigidity to the structure and are used as a support for the rigging, as well as a support for the skipper. Has a single mast of aluminum whose inclination and bending can be varied during the navigation by means of the stays. The triangular sail is maneuvered by a sheet that slides freely on a steel rod installed between two stands fully aft of the boat.Reglament 2018.

It occurs on the seabed in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, living semi-buried in the sand with only its arm tips projecting. Description Acrocnida brachiata has a flat disc up to in diameter and five slender, clearly-demarcated, articulated arms up to in length. It is greyish-brown in colour. It can be distinguished from other similar species by the transverse furrows in the plates at the bases of the arms, the ventral scales bearing small tubercles and by the presence of an outer mouth papilla which is quite distinct from the paired papillae inside the mouth. The arms, which like other brittle stars flex sideways rather than up and down, have a pair of tentacle scales on each joint as well as numerous spines. Distribution and habitat A. brachiata occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and North Sea. It is common round the coasts of the British Isles where its depth range is from the lower shore down to about . It is a benthic species, living on sandy bottoms and burying itself in the sediment, with only the tips of its arms projecting. It often occurs in association with the burrowing sea urchin Echinocardium cordatum, commonly known as the sea potato. Taxonomy There is a marked difference in morphology between populations in the intertidal zone and those thought to be the same species living in the subtidal zone. Study of these differences led to the describing of a new species Acrocnida spatulispina by Sabine St√∂hr and Delphine Muths in 2009, for the deeper water individuals. The brittle stars in the genus Acrocnida show morphological affinities with Amphiura chiajei, but less with Amphiura filiformis.

Biography Marjorie Hasler was born around 1887 in Ireland, with nothing else known about her early life or family. She joined the Irish Women's Franchise League (IWFL) in July 1910. On 18 November 1910 Hasler was one of the Irish deputies who travelled to London to support Emmeline Pankhurst with her petition to H. H. Asquith, the British Prime Minister. In the ensuing violence of this day, which became known as \\"Black Friday\\", Hasler suffered a head injury when she was knocked against a wall. As a result she suffered headaches intermittently, as well as some damage to her spine. This did not dissuade Hasler from her militant action, returning to London the next year when she was imprisoned for 14 days for breaking government windows. In June 1912, Hasler was imprisoned with Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and 6 other women in Mountjoy Prison for her part in breaking the windows of the General Post Office, Dublin. These 8 women were the first to be convicted and imprisoned in Ireland for militant suffragette action. She was fined ¬£10 and sentenced to 6 months, which was the longest sentence of any of the 8 convicted suffragists. Hasler compared suffragists to Land Leaguers in an article for The Irish Citizen on 22 June 1912: \\"We don't like smashing windows any more than men like smashing skulls, but in both cases there is, I believe, a strong feeling that something must be broken before a wrong can be righted.\\" She was released on 10 November 1912 after serving 4 months following the submission of a petition signed by 10 of the jurymen who convicted her. Sheehy-Skeffington claimed that Hasler refused to let the IWFL to also petition on her behalf. Marjorie Hasler, First Martyr Upon leaving prison, Hasler's health was damaged, however this is in contrast to Sheehy-Skeffington's testimony of Hasler's athletic stunts whilst in prison. Hasler died suddenly on 31 March 1913 after contracting measles. Her death has been described as from heart failure. Her fellow suffragists and The Irish Citizen maintained that it was her imprisonment and police brutality that had damaged her health in the year proceeding her death.

History The Arnold Drive Bridge was built in 1930 over Sonoma Creek to replace a collapsed bridge made of concrete. The bridge is maintained by the County of Sonoma. On average, 13,900 cars travel over the bridge daily. The bridge had fallen into disrepair by 2000 and the County of Sonoma planned to tear the bridge down and replace it with a concrete bridge. Glen Ellen resident Jim Berkland, who used to play on and around the bridge as a child in the 1940s, collected signatures and filed a petition to the county, who agreed to maintain the bridge rather than tear it down. While the bridge is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, the bridge is recognized as historic by the Sonoma League of Historic Preservation and is listed as historic landmark #169 by the County of Sonoma.

On October 21, 1907, at the second Gordon Bennett Cup in St. Louis, Erbsl√∂h and his companion Henry Helm Clayton won first place, traveling 1403.55 kilometers over 40 hours in his balloon Pomerania. In 1908 Erbsl√∂h turned from ballooning to motorized air sports. Under his chairmanship was founded the Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Motorluftschiff-Gesellschaft, whose purpose was the construction of powered airships. In 1909, the company built an airship hangar 20 acres of land leased from the town of Leichlingen. Simultaneously with the construction of the hangar began the construction of the airship Erbsl√∂h. Also in 1909, Erbsl√∂h piloted the balloon Berlin in a 30-hour voyage over the Alps. He reached an altitude of 18,000 feet and experienced an average temperature of . On 13 July 1910, Erbsl√∂h died in the crash of the Erbsl√∂h, when the benzine tank of its gasoline-powered engine exploded at an altitude of 480 meters over Pattscheid. The airship had recently been refitted for passenger service. Erbsl√∂h's death came only one day after the death of his friend, British aviation pioneer Charles Rolls. The New York Times reported in July 1910 that at Oskar's funeral his own father had had a stroke and died, but this contradicts the family company's own statement (in 1914) that the elder Erbsl√∂h had in fact died ten months afterward. Honors In 1913, the city of Leichlingen asked Kaiser Wilhelm II for permission to display the airship Erbsl√∂h in the city's coat of arms. Wilhelm rejected the city's request. A monument to Erbsl√∂h stands in Leichlingen near the eponymous Oskar-Erbsl√∂h-Stra√üe. Other streets named after Erbsl√∂h are in Wuppertal, Solingen, Essen, and Langenfeld. The Langenfeld aero club is named for Erbsl√∂h. On August 24, 2011, the municipal council of Sch√∂nefeld named a street in the entrance area of Berlin Brandenburg Airport after Oskar Erbsl√∂h. Erbsl√∂h's grave is located in the Friedhof Hochstra√üe, an Old Lutheran cemetery in Wuppertal. References Vorlage ‚Äì GV/065/2011, beschlossen auf der 27.

It is located within North Cascades National Park. It rises steeply from Diablo Lake, one of the reservoirs on the Skagit River. It is part of a group of peaks that form the northern end of a chain running south through climbing destinations such as Colonial Peak, Paul Bunyans Stump, and Snowfield Peak. Like many North Cascade peaks, Pyramid Peak is more notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Diablo Lake and Skagit River. Pyramid Peak was first climbed in 1931 by William Degenhardt and Herbert Strandberg of the Seattle Mountaineers. The approach is via the Pyramid Lake Trail, starting near Diablo Dam on the North Cascades Highway. From the lake, it's route-finding up Pyramid Arm and to Colonial Glacier. Climate Pyramid Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

In the years 1874-1875 works were conducted by A.F. Vidov. Next time the building was redeveloped in 1906-1907. It was expanded by building up the third floor. The work on the project of the architect G. D. Grima was carried out by civil engineer V. A. Lipavsky. The future poetess A. A. Akhmatova (Gorenko) studied in the gymnasium during the period 1900-1905. After the October Revolution, the gymnasium became the 2nd Detskoselskaya Soviet labor school.

I can assure you my life is very entertaining and very instructive.\\" Lord Byron in conversation with Thomas Medwin Byron's Memoirs, written between 1818 and 1821 but never published and destroyed soon after his death, recounted at full-length his life, loves and opinions. He gave the manuscript to the poet Thomas Moore, who in turn sold it to John Murray with the intention that it should eventually be published. On Lord Byron's death in 1824, Moore, Murray, John Cam Hobhouse, and other friends who were concerned for his reputation gathered together and burned the original manuscript and the only known copy of it, in what has been called the greatest literary crime in history. Since the Memoirs are lost beyond recovery, only the vaguest idea of their nature can be gathered from the mutually inconsistent testimony of those contemporaries of Byron who read them in manuscript. It is hard to judge how sexually explicit they were, some witnesses maintaining that they were perfectly fit for anyone to read and others that they were far too scabrous ever to be published.  Composition  As early as 1809, while travelling in Albania with his friend John Cam Hobhouse, Byron wrote an account of his life and thoughts. Hobhouse persuaded him to destroy this document, though Byron protested that the world was being robbed of a treat. Byron again began to consider an autobiography in 1818. On 10 July he wrote from Venice in a letter to his publisher John Murray in London, > I think of writing (for your full edition) some memoirs of my life to prefix > to them ‚Äì upon the same model (though far enough I fear from reaching it) as > that of Gifford ‚Äì Hume ‚Äì &c and this without any intention of making > disclosures or remarks upon living people which would be unpleasant to > them...I have materials in plenty - but the greater part of these could not > be used by me ‚Äì nor for three hundred years to come ‚Äì however there is > enough without these...to make you a good preface for such an edition as you > meditate ‚Äì but this by the way ‚Äì I have not made up my mind. On 3 August he told Murray that he had made good progress with the Memoirs, and on 26 August that they were nearly finished, but that they were now too long and too indiscreet to be publishable as a preface: \\"I shall keep it among my papers ‚Äì it will be a kind of Guide post in case of death ‚Äì and prevent some of the lies which would otherwise be told\\". Murray, 29 October 1819: \\"I gave Moore who is gone to Rome ‚Äì my Life in M.S. in 78 folio sheets brought down to 1816.\\" On 29 October 1819 he announced that he had given the Memoirs, which took his story as far as 1816, to his friend Thomas Moore, the poet, and repeated that they were \\"[not] for publication during my life ‚Äì but when I am cold ‚Äì you may do what you please.\\" Moore accepted this restriction, and good-humouredly looked forward to bequeathing the book to his son, \\"who shall astonish the latter days of the nineteenth century with it\\". Between 1820 and 1821 Byron added a second portion, bringing the Memoirs to a length of at least 120,000 words. The complete Memoirs, all in Moore's possession, were handed out by him to a large number of readers in the fashionable world, so many indeed that the manuscripts were in danger of falling apart from overuse, so that Moore was obliged to have a copy made. In July 1821, with Byron's blessing, Moore sold the manuscript and the copy to Murray for the enormous sum of ¬£2100, but then Byron had second thoughts and the deal was renegotiated to give Moore and himself the power to buy back the Memoirs during Byron's lifetime. They still remained in manuscript when Byron died on 19 April 1824 at Missolonghi in Greece.  Destruction  Within minutes of hearing that Byron was dead Hobhouse began to plan the destruction of the manuscripts, motivated perhaps by a feeling that all memoirs were by definition slightly improper; by fear of being associated with such a libertine as Byron, now that he himself was a respectable MP; or by resentment that they had been entrusted to Moore, Hobhouse's rival in Byron's friendship. On approaching John Murray, who he supposed might want to profit by publishing them, he found to his surprise that Murray was just as keen as himself to see them burned. Moore initially favoured buying back the manuscript from Murray and handing it over to Augusta Leigh, Byron's half-sister, for destruction, but then he changed his mind and decided instead that with the excision of all improper passages Byron's reputation would be sufficiently secured. Besides, he argued, Byron had told him that he could \\"show them to the elect\\", and since he had actually done so there could be no further harm in publishing them. A meeting was held at Hobhouse's chambers in Albany to thrash the matter out. Present were Moore, Hobhouse, Henry Luttrell (a friend of Moore's, inclined to support him whatever he decided), and John Murray. All of them were under the mistaken impression, not having actually consulted the legal documents in the case, that Moore might still have some rights in the matter, whereas in fact Byron's death had rendered the Memoirs the absolute property of John Murray, to deal with as he saw fit. Murray pointed out that William Gifford, who had read the Memoirs, was of the opinion that they would make Byron's name infamous forever. They argued so fiercely that Moore even spoke of settling the matter by fighting a duel with Murray. The meeting was then adjourned to Murray's house in Albemarle Street, where Wilmot Horton, acting for Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, and Colonel Francis Doyle, acting for Lady Byron, were waiting. Moore protested that to destroy the manuscript would be \\"contrary to Lord Byron's wishes and unjust to myself\\", but Hobhouse's and Murray's view of the matter finally prevailed and, with Moore's reluctant consent, the manuscript was torn up and burned in Murray's fireplace by Horton and Doyle. This has been called the greatest literary crime in history. Some 19th-century commentators believed that one or more copies of the Memoirs still survived and would one day emerge, and indeed that hope is still nurtured by a few, but the scholarly consensus is that the book is irrecoverably lost.  Blame  John Cam Hobhouse Though most of those present at the Albemarle Street meeting were in favour of the destruction of the Memoirs, Moore was vehemently opposed to it until overborne by the others; yet for many years Hobhouse kept up a campaign of public sniping against Moore, throwing the blame onto him. Moore's account of the fateful meeting at Murray's house, recorded in his diary, gave a sympathetic view of his part in the story, but when that diary was published by Lord John Russell in 1853 he excised this entry, and it long remained unpublished. With only one side of the question being heard, the general feeling throughout the 19th century was that Moore was the man most responsible for the burning of the Memoirs. One note of dissent came from Moore's friend Walter Scott, who recorded in his diary his opinion that Moore had been ill-treated, but as late as 1937 Moore's biographer, L. A. G. Strong wrote, \\"The conclusion cannot be resisted that Moore failed his friend\\". Modern scholarship assigns the blame elsewhere. Leslie A. Marchand wrote that Hobhouse was chiefly responsible, and Terence de Vere White came to the same conclusion, adding that Murray was the second most guilty man. G. Wilson Knight brought in a verdict against Hobhouse, Colonel Doyle, Wilmot Horton and Murray as being jointly responsible, with the rider that \\"behind it all...was Lady Byron\\". Paul Douglass believes that some blame must also go to Byron himself, in that he was too careless of his Memoirs' fate, and certainly Byron did allow them to fall into the hands of John Murray, whom he considered \\"the most timorous of God's booksellers\\".  Contents  In the absence of any surviving manuscript of the Memoirs, the only direct evidence for the nature of their contents comes from comments by Byron himself, and by such friends of Moore, Murray and Byron as were allowed to read it. These readers included Lady Burghersh, Lady Davy, Lord and Lady Holland, Richard Hoppner, Washington Irving, Lady Jersey, Lord Kinnaird and his brother Douglas, Henry Luttrell, Lady Mildmay, Lord Rancliffe, Lord John Russell, William Gifford, William Maginn, Lady Caroline Lamb, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley (probably), John William Polidori (probably), Samuel Rogers (possibly), and two copyists employed by Moore called Williams and Dumoulin. Byron offered his estranged wife the chance to read the Memoirs, but she refused to have anything to do with it. Byron wrote to Murray about the first part of the Memoirs, which ended at the year 1816, that > The Life is Memoranda and not Confessions. I have left out all my loves > (except in a general way), and many other of the most important things > (because I must not compromise other people)...But you will find many > opinions, and some fun, with a detailed account of my marriage and its > consequences, as true as a party concerned can make such accounts, for I > suppose we are all prejudiced. His friend Thomas Medwin later reported that Byron had told him about the second part that it > will prove a good lesson to young men; for it treats of the irregular life I > led at one period, and the fatal consequences of dissipation. There are few > parts that may not, and none that will not, be read by women...When you read > my Memoirs you will learn the evils, moral and physical, of true > dissipation. I can assure you my life is very entertaining and very > instructive. Thomas Moore also drew a distinction between the two parts. The first part contained \\"little unfit for publication\\", and \\"on the mysterious cause of the separation [from his wife at the beginning of 1816] it afforded no light whatever\\"; but as for the second part, \\"some of its details could never have been published at all\\". Privately, Moore told Hobhouse that \\"the first part of the Memoirs contained nothing objectionable except one anecdote ‚Äì namely that Lord B. had Lady B. on the sofa before dinner on the day of their marriage.\\" On the other hand, \\"The second part contained all sorts of erotic adventures\\". When he came to write his Letters and Journals of Lord Byron: With Notices of His Life (1830), Moore silently incorporated all the incidents he could remember relating to Byron's early London life from the Memoirs, or at any rate all he considered fit to print. The disparity between the first and second parts may help to explain the very wide range of opinions from the other witnesses. Byron's discarded lover Lady Caroline Lamb thought the Memoirs \\"were of no value ‚Äì a mere copy-book\\", and Lady Burghersh is reported to have said that she found them so unobjectionable that she would have allowed her 15-year-old daughter to read them. Lord Holland thought \\"some of them were agreeable enough\\". Lord John Russell had read the greater part of the MS. His memory was that \\"three or four pages of it were too gross and indelicate for publication...the rest, with few exceptions, contained little traces of Lord Byron's genius, and no interesting details of his life. His early youth in Greece, and his sensibility to the scenes around him, when resting on a rock in the swimming excursions he took from the Piraeus, were strikingly described. But, on the whole, the world is no loser by the sacrifice made of the Memoirs of this great poet.\\" Another detail comes from Samuel Rogers, who claimed to have read in the Memoirs that \\"on his marriage- night, Byron suddenly started out of his first sleep; a taper, which burned in the room, was casting a ruddy glare through the crimson curtains of the bed; and he could not help exclaiming, in a voice so loud that he wakened Lady B., 'Good God, I am surely in hell!'\\". Lord Rancliffe thought they were \\"of a low, pot-house description\\". William Gifford, the editor of the Quarterly Review, read the manuscript for Murray and reported to him, according to Hobhouse, that \\"the whole Memoirs were fit only for a brothel and would damn Lord B. to everlasting infamy if published.\\" However, Gifford had held the same opinion of Byron's Don Juan, which was nevertheless published in Byron's lifetime.  Legacy  Thomas Moore Though the Memoirs themselves were destroyed, they, and the story of their destruction, inspired a number of responses. Thomas Moore wrote, ostensibly in Venice at the time he received the manuscript from Byron, a poem describing his feelings when about to read the Memoirs. He reflects, > Let me, a moment, think what thousands live > O'er the wide earth this instant, who would give > Gladly, whole sleepless nights to bend the brow, > Over these precious leaves, as I do now. In July 1824 the journalist Theodore Hook published what purported to be an extract from the Memoirs describing Byron's wedding night. It was certainly a forgery since it was in several respects inconsistent with what we know of Byron's marriage, but it was widely credited at the time. In, perhaps, 1842 a poem in defence of homosexuality, called Don Leon, was published under Byron's name. The poem claimed to be \\"Part of the Private Journal of his Lordship, supposed to have been entirely destroyed by Thos. Moore\\", but its authenticity can be judged by the fact that it makes reference to events that happened after Byron's death. The date of composition, the date of first publication, and the real author's name are all shrouded in uncertainty. Virgil Thomson's third and last opera Lord Byron (1972), to a libretto by Jack Larson, stages a fictionalized version of the return of Byron's body to England in 1824; the Memoirs accompany the body, and are in the final act burned in Westminster Abbey. The opera has achieved popularity neither in its original form nor in an early 1980s abridged version. There followed two novels in the form of imaginative recreations of the Memoirs. The first, The Secret Memoirs of Lord Byron by Christopher Nicole (1978), was according to Kirkus Reviews characterized by \\"erratic wit, hearty research, and excessive palaver about matters sexual\\". Robert Nye's The Memoirs of Lord Byron (1989) was praised by the literary scholar Daniel S. Burt for its \\"remarkable impersonation of Byron's voice and psychological insight into his genius\\", and by Andrew Sinclair in The Times for its \\"cascade of epigrams tumbling one after the other\\". Finally, in 1995 Tom Holland published The Vampyre, Being the True Pilgrimage of George Gordon, Sixth Lord Byron (US title: Lord of the Dead: The Secret History of Lord Byron). In this novel a search for the Memoirs results in the discovery that they were destroyed because they revealed that Byron was, and indeed is, a vampire. Patt Morrison applauded the book in the Los Angeles Times, but Kirkus Reviews wrote of its \\"attractive figures in living pasteboard\\", and would only concede that \\"as a genre work, this is better than many\\".

He is the reigning world champion in the men's single scull won at the 2019 World Rowing Championships and the current World Games champion in indoor rowing in the open men's 2000 m class. Family Zeidler was born in 1996. He was born into a rowing family, with grandfather Hans-Johann F√§rber a double-Olympic medallist (gold in 1972 and bronze in 1976, both in the coxed four boat class). His grandfather trains his sister Marie (born 1999) who has won medals at 2016 and 2017 World Rowing Junior Championships. Oliver Zeidler is trained by his father, Heino Zeidler, himself a former junior world champion rower and a senior representative rower for Germany in the 1990s. The Zeidlers live in Erding. His aunt, Judith Zeidler, is an Olympic gold and bronze medallist in rowing and his aunt is married to double-Olympian Matthias Ungemach. Swimming Zeidler measures . He started swimming at age seven. At the 2015 German year championships in Berlin, he won gold in the 100 metres freestyle event for the year 1996 competition, silver for the same performance in the open category (years 1994 to 1996), and bronze in the 200 metres freestyle. He ended his competitive swimming career in February 2017. Rowing Curious about rowing, Zeidler first tried out a single scull in September 2016 at the Oberschlei√üheim Regatta Course where his sister trains. Less than a year later, Zeidler won the open men's 2000 m class in indoor rowing at the 2017 World Games in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. The previous month, Zeidler had come third at the German under-23 championships in single scull. Zeidler's first international rowing regatta was the 2018 World Rowing Cup I in Belgrade. The heat was only his fourth race on a rowing course. In the A-final, he surprised by winning bronze in the open men's single scull, beaten by Czech incumbent world champion Ond≈ôej Synek and the Swiss Roman R√∂√∂sli. At the World Rowing Cup II race, the Czech and Swiss were not at the start and Zeidler again won bronze, this time beaten by the New Zealander Robbie Manson and the German champion Tim Ole Naske. At the World Rowing Cup III race, Zeidler won silver, again beaten by Manson. But more importantly, fellow German Naske came sixth in that race meaning that Zeidler was then selected as the German single sculling representative for the 2018 World Rowing Championships. He made the A-final at the 2018 World Championships but finished in overall sixth place. 2019 would be Zeidler's break-out year as a single-sculler. He took gold at the European Championships, won a gold medal at the World Cup II in Poznan and then placed 13th at the WRC III in Rotterdam. At the 2019 World Rowing Championships in Ottensheim he won all three of his preliminary races and then in the A final contested one of the closest and toughest world class sculling events witnessed. Zeidler led at the 500 m mark but saw his rival Sverri Nielsen and the Dutchman, Stef Broenink, have a lead over him at the next two marks where Zeidler sat fourth and then third. Zeidler stuck to his race plan and his long work through the water saw him come over the top of his rivals in the last few strokes, in a finish where the top five scullers were separated by only a 1-second spread.

In other words, the statute covers both those that provide (or offer) kickbacks and those that receive (or solicit) kickbacks. The statute is among the most important healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the United States. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony. The Anti- Kickback Statute was \\"enacted to ensure that clinical decisions and medical services are provided to patients based on their medical needs and not on the improper financial considerations of providers.\\" The illegal remuneration covered by the Anti-Kickback Statute includes \\"anything of value\\" and is therefore not limited to cash. Thus, the sorts remuneration barred by the Anti-Kickback Statute may be, for example, in the form of consulting fees, gifts (e.g., sports tickets), discounted rent, research grants, and bonuses. The Anti-Kickback Statute is a separate law from the Stark Law; however, the Anti-Kickback Statute may, in many instances, cover conduct within the scope of the Stark Law (and vice versa). A claim made to the federal government (e.g., a claim to Medicare for a patient visit) that results from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is, by its by nature, a \\"false claim\\" under the False Claims Act and thus may result in liability under the False Claims Act (including the False Claims Act's treble damages and civil monetary penalty provisions). Given this interplay between the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute have formed the basis of a great number of high value civil recoveries in favor of the federal government (and whistleblowers) under the False Claims Act.

She also took landscape painting classes with John F. Carlson in Woodstock, New York. After graduating, she returned to Canada and opened a studio in Montreal. In search of inspiring landscapes, she travelled, exploring towards the Pacific Coast (Banff in 1934, Victoria, Yellowstone Park and Wyoming in 1937) and then on the Atlantic side (Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, but also Gasp√©sie in which it stays several times). She gained notoriety for her marine paintings which were the subject of a solo exhibition at the Art Association in 1934.

History  The Gostiny Dvor in Tsarskoye Selo was established in 1818, when, on the orders of Ya. V. Zakharzhevsky, the shops from the Znamensky Church were moved to the present place, and the Konstantinov Fair from Sofia. According to the plan of Tsarskoe Selo VI Gest, a large plot was assigned from Leontievskaya to Orangareynaya Street. The wooden one-story building of the Gostiny Dvor in 1825 was built by V.P. Stasov. William Heste participated in the design. In the years 1843-1844. built stone Meat rows in the courtyard of the complex, the architect was NS Nikitin. In 1862, most of the wooden complex was destroyed by fire. Initially, it was proposed to restore only the burnt part, the project was prepared by A.F. Vidov. However, as a result, it was decided to rebuild the stone building, this was entrusted to the same N.S. Nikitin. The building was opened for trade in 1866. In 1898, under the project of architect A. R. Bach, a stone terrace was built to increase the rigidity of the foundation and prevent deformation due to the relief dip. In the years 1911-1912. the same A. R. Bach in the courtyard was built from a concrete glacier-warehouse. The Gostiny Dvor complex continues to be used for trade and now, from the yard side the Tsarskoye Selo market is located.  Architecture  All facades of the main one-story building of the complex are surrounded by an arched gallery. In the central part of the building, on the axis of Cathedral Square, there is a travel arch-portal. The outlines of arches of galleries on different facades are various. The corners and arches of the building are decorated with pavilions with attic mezzanines and bundles of twin columns of the Tuscan order. The decor of the building is complicated, which brings it closer to the Baroque style. Above the slope of the roof there are a lot of mansard windows. The building of the Meat series has a semi-circular shape. It is oriented along the main axis of the complex. Decorated in the style of late classicism. The concave facade is decorated with a gallery with pillars cross-shaped in cross-section, with shoulder blades and pilasters of the Tuscan warrant.

For example, the mandible is twice the size of any jaws referred to other lapillopsids. The most notable unique feature is an enlarged \\"pump-handle\\" shaped arcadian process at the back of the jaw. This structure is responsible for the generic name of this genus, as \\"Manubrantlia\\" translates from Latin to the English expression \\"pump-handle\\". The type and only known species of this genus is Manubrantlia khaki. The specific name refers to the greenish-brown mudstones of the Panchet Formation, with a color that had been described as \\"khaki\\" by the first British geologists who studied the formation. Lapillopsids such as Lapillopsis and Manubrantlia are part of Temnospondyli, a diverse order of tetrapods which may include the ancestors of modern amphibians. Different authors disagree on the precise placement of Lapillopsids among temnospondyls. Some place them near or within dissorophoids, a group of terrestrial insectivorous temnospondyls. However, most other authors consider lapilopsids to be unusual stereospondyls. Stereospondyls are typically large and crocodilian-like Mesozoic temnospondyls with flattened skulls and semiaquatic habits, but lapillopsids differ from this body plan and more closely resemble the dissorophoids, at least superficially.  Description  The mandible is approximately 11.15 centimeters (4.4 inches) long, about twice the size of that of Lapillopsis. This would have made Manubrantlia the largest lapillopsid by a wide margin. This has been construed as a primitive feature, as it falls more in line with the size of other temnospondyls rather than the derived minute size of more advanced lapillopsids. Like other lapillopsids, Manubrantlia had two rows of teeth on each lower jaw. The teeth on the outer row, also known as \\"marginal teeth\\", are attached to the dentary bone and are sharp and curved. They are also slightly flattened in an anteroposterior (front-to-back) direction, although not to the extent seen in capitosaurs such as Mastodonsaurus. At the front of the jaw, the dentary tooth row also twists slightly outwards. The front of the jaw also possesses an enlarged tooth known as a parasymphyseal tusk, although this tooth is less than twice as wide as the rest of the marginal teeth. A deep longitudinal groove known as an oral sulcus is visible below the marginal tooth row. This genus, Lapillopsis, was closely related to Manubrantlia. The inner row of conical teeth form out of the three coronoid bones which lie inwards from the dentary. This feature is practically unique to lapillopsids among early Triassic temnospondyls, as most other groups have much more reduced coronoid teeth. Lydekkerinids, for example, only have a patch of small denticles on the last coronoid. The only other stereospondyls with a continuous row of teeth on all three coronoid bones are the plagiosaurids. The last coronoid also extends outwards, and is visible from the outer side of the mandible just above the rear tip of the dentary. When seen in lateral or labial view (a.k.a. from the outside), a large portion of the mandible is formed by the angular bone (at the back), with a thinner portion under the dentary formed by the splenial (at the front) and the postsplenial (at the middle). On the other hand, the splenial and postsplenial are much more exposed on the inner portion of the jaw (seen in lingual or medial view a.k.a. from the inside) while the angular is less so. Prominent ridges and grooves radiate from the middle of the angular bone (as seen from the outside of the jaw), similar to the condition in most temnospondyls but unlike other lapillopsids. A large portion of the inner part of the jaw is also formed by the prearticular bone in the rear half of the mandible. A hole known as the posterior meckelian foramen is also visible from the inner part of the jaw. Unlike with most temnospondyls but in common with Lapillopsis (and a few other taxa, such as archegosauroids and Eryops), this hole has no contact with the postsplenial, instead being surrounded solely by the prearticular and angular. The most prominent and unique features of Manubrantlia lie at the rear part of the jaw, in the general area of the jaw joint. The jaw joint is formed by the articular bone, which is most visible in medial view but also wraps around to be visible in lateral view at the rear lower tip of the outer side of the bone. This lateral exposure of the articular is also known in Lapillopsis, and is believed to be unique to lapillopsids. The upper rear portion of the lateral face of the mandible is formed by the surangular bone. The rear tip of the surangular forms a bony projection known as an arcadian process. In most temnospondyls this projection is small and blunt, similar in size to the adjacent retroarticular process of the articular bone which is projects inwards and backwards. However, in Manubrantlia the arcadian process is enlarged greatly, turning into an elongated extension described as \\"resembling a pump-handle\\". The arcadian process of Lapillopsis is also elongated, although it is much more slender as well. The only other temnospondyls with arcadian processes near the size of Manubrantlia is the rhytidosteid Arcadia and lydekkerinids such as Lydekkerina. However, they also possess enlarged retroarticular processes, which contrasts with the condition in Manubrantlia. Thus, the large size of the arcadian process is believed to be an example of convergent evolution between lapillopsids and lydekkerinids, as many other factors separate the two families.  Paleoecology  The fauna and flora of the Panchet Formation is practically identical to that of the South African Lystrosaurus assemblage zone of the Karoo supergroup. This biozone is dated to the very beginning of the Triassic period about 250 million years ago, when life was still recovering from the severity of the Permian-Triassic extinction event. It is assumed that the Panchet Formation, due to its similarities with the Lystrosaurus zone, had an equivalent age. At this time the continents would have been formed into one supercontinent known as Pangaea. The Indian tectonic plate was situated in the far southern hemisphere near South Africa at this point in time, as the plate tectonics which moved India towards its modern position in southern Asia had not yet activated. This proximity explains the similarity between the South African and Indian ecosystems. Lystrosaurus murrayi was one of the most common animals of the Panchet Formation. The largest and most common animal within the Panchet Formation was the herbivorous dicynodont Lystrosaurus. Several different species of Lystrosaurus have been reported from this formation in the past, but a 2005 analysis concluded that they were all referable to only a single species: Lystrosaurus murrayi. More recently, Lystrosaurus declivis and a species close to Lystrosaurus curvatus have also been found in lower portions of the Formation. A genus of cynodont, Panchetocynodon, was also present in the formation. Fossils of Thrinaxodon, a cynodont common to the Karoo supergroup, have also been reported in the Panchet Formation, although these claims remain unsubstantiated. Other amniote remains are also known from the formation, including the dubious proterosuchid Ankistrodon (which may be synonymous with the South African Proterosuchus) and fragmentary procolophonid fossils. Apart from Lystrosaurus, the most common animals in the Panchet Formation are a diverse assortment of stereospondyls, among them Manubrantlia. These include Indobenthosuchus (a lydekkerinid), Indobrachyops (a rhytidosteid), and various trematosaurids (Gonioglyptus, Panchetosaurus, Indolyrocephalus, Glyptognathus). Many species remain poorly described and may qualify as nomina dubia (\\"dubious names\\"). Some stereospondyls from the formation, such as Pachygonia, are diagnostic yet too aberrant to be placed into a specific family. Fish scales are also known from the formation. Plant life includes remains of the seed ferns Glossopteris, Lepidopteris, and Dicroidium. However, no coal seams are present in this formation unlike the case in many other Permian and Triassic formations of India. The abundance of cryptogams (spore- bearing plants) suggests that India had a warm, humid climate during the early Triassic. However, many studies instead suggest that the climate was arid. Geological analyses have indicated that the sandstones and mudstones of the Panchet Formation were mainly formed in a fluvial environment, meaning that the formation was dominated by large rivers during the time of Manubrantlia. Some sand grains recovered from Panchet sandstones preserve the geological signatures of complex interactions between water and sand. These interactions include the formation of natural levees, tidal inlets, and beaches dominated by sand dunes. This indicates that large lakes were also present in the environment. Earthquakes also affected the area as shown by deformation in some sediments.

Siemens Mobility scoped several sites in the United Kingdom before settling on Goole with an intent to build the plant if it were successful in gaining orders for new rolling stock. After a June 2018 announcement that Siemens had won the bid to build 94 New Tube for London trains for the Piccadilly Line, Siemens confirmed it would go ahead with building the factory, though this was then subject to further delays as other rolling stock companies objected to Siemens being given the contract. In November 2018, the High Court upheld the decision to award the contract to Siemens, but allowed the other train companies to pursue claims for damages. History During a period of sustained new train building for the United Kingdom rail network, Siemens announced in March 2018 that it would build a train factory in the UK if it was successful in acquiring new contracts for trains. Siemens have already built for the UK market with their Desiro family design which includes the class 185 DMUs, and the class 350 and 450 EMUs among others. The company already employs over 4,400 people in the United Kingdom across eight sites that provide rolling stock care. These are at: Glasgow Shields, Ilford, Leeds Neville Hill, London Acton, Manchester Ardwick, Northampton Kings Heath, Southampton Northam, Three Bridges and York Leeman Road. After searching for a suitable site, Siemens acquired some land in Goole, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, stating that on winning orders, they would build a factory there. In June 2018, Siemens were awarded a ¬£1.5 billion Contract for 94 tube trains for the Piccadilly line. This triggered the plan to build the factory making Siemens the fourth train builder with an actual factory presence in the UK and the third new build factory within eight years.The Times article does not mention that this will be the fourth train factory in the UK; Bombardier have a plant in Derby, CAF are building a plant in Newport and Hitachi Newton Aycliffe is already sending out Class 800 and Class 395 trains. Previous to this, the Bombardier factory in Derby was the only UK based train builder. The plant will cost ¬£200 million and cover a area and employ 700 people in its factory. 250 jobs will created in building the factory with a further estimated 1,700 indirect jobs in the supply chain. The plant would use an existing siding in Goole that leads to a glass factory to provide access and egress for trains and will be sited on the Goole 36 industrial park adjacent to Junction 36 of the M62 motorway. There will be a manufacturing and commissioning site, offices, warehouses, stabling sidings and there is space for a test track to be installed, though what Siemens described as \\"extensive testing\\", would take place at their facility in Wildenrath, Germany. The buildings would cover and the internal lines in the complex would total . Groundbreaking for the factory is due in late 2019, with full opening in 2023. In the ¬£1.5 billion deal, the factory will build the trains in the Inspiro range already in use by other operators and is to replace old Tube stock from 1973. The contract details 564 cars to be built (which will be marshalled into 94 trains) with an option of a further 150 trains for the Deep Tube upgrade. The initial order is expected to be complete in 2026. Over 50% of the trains will be completed at Goole, with some carriages being constructed in Vienna so that the order can be started before the factory at Goole is up and running. All the outer shells of the carriages will be built in Austria and then shipped across to Goole for fitting out works. The announcement of Siemens as the winning bid led to criticism of that decision by the MP for Sedgefield, Phil Wilson. Wilson stated that it was a \\"slap in the face\\" for the workers at the railway rolling stock factory at Newton Aycliffe run by Hitachi, as they have the skills and ability to build the trains, whereas the Siemens bid has to wait on its factory to be built. Siemens was one of four train builders invited to bid for the contract to provide rolling stock for the HS2 line.At the start of the tendering process, there were five companies; Alstom, Bombardier, Hitachi, Patentes Talgo and Siemens. As Siemens and Alstom were in talks over a potential merger, the field has narrowed to four. CAF, despite having a UK facility, were not in the running. In July 2018, an announcement that Bombardier and Hitachi would combine efforts for the HS2 bid, but not in other bids, led to the UK Government inviting CAF to tender for the bid to retain competition. One of the stipulations of the contract was that if the new high-speed trains were not going to be built in Britain, then they should at least be assembled there. If Siemens/Alstom were successful, the trains could be assembled at Goole or at Alstom's plant at Widnes. In July 2018, the trainmakers Bombardier and Hitachi, who submitted a joint bid for the Deep Tube contract, filed papers with the High Court in London in an attempt to overturn the Siemens contract. Due to legal reasons, no comment was issued as to the nature of the complaint. In November 2018, the High Court gave Siemens the right to build the new deep tube trains as per the contract, but acknowledged that the other train companies involved were free to pursue claims for damages as he believed there was a case to answer. Whilst the contract is for 94 new trains, the company may extend this to 109 trains if Transport for London extend the contract. Siemens are also an interested party in bidding for other new tube train builds for the Bakerloo, Central and Waterloo & City lines. The new plant may also be used as a location to construct trains for HS2 should Siemens be successful in gaining that contract. In April 2019, Siemens submitted their plans for the factory to East Riding of Yorkshire Council. This detailed a site, of which is \\"suitable\\" for development. At the same time, Siemens stated that their UK rolling stock engineering and commissioning team would move to the site and its Digital Operations Centre will also re- locate there. Outline planning approval was granted in July 2019, with groundwork expected in spring 2020. COVID-19 related issues delayed start on the factory, with groundwork commencing on 6 July 2020.

The building is located on 16 Sadovaya Street.  History  The first structure on the arena property was a wooden building erected in the middle of the 18th century by SI Chevakinsky. The stone building was built in 1786-1788 on the by IV Neelov. The building quickly deteriorated. VP Stasov, who was entrusted with repairs, instead planned a complete reorganization, retaining only part of the walls and increasing the building. Restructuring was completed by November 1819. From September 1820, it was used as the Imperial court horse arena was used. It was intended for horse exercises by the officers of the retinue and the imperial convoy, and also by regiments of the Imperial Guard, which were quartered in Tsarskoe Selo. After the October Revolution, the arena was used as a People's Theater (in it, in particular, spoke FI Shalyapin). Later on, it held were mechanical workshops. In 1949, a gym was built there. Today the court arena hosts sporting events. Restoration was carried out in 1951 and in 2010.  Architecture  The court arena is an extended one-story building. In the center is a Doric portico of eight columns, grouped in two (it was preserved from the construction of Neelov, although Stasov reduced the height of the pediment). On the ends of the longitudinal facades are loggias. The windows after the restructuring of Stasov became semi-circular, lacking platbands. At the front facades, attics were constructed, but they no longer exist. The facades are decorated with a frieze with trigrams.

It was built from 1893‚Äì1896 as the project of architects Alexander Pomerantsev and Nikolai Durbach. The hotel is currently closed, though there are plans to reconstruct it. The building has the status of Russian cultural heritage and regional significance.  Architecture  The four-story building was constructed in eclectic style. The symmetrical facade is divided vertically into five parts. The central part initially had a large balcony-canopy that covered the entire width of the sidewalk at the main entrance, but it has not been preserved. The third and fourth floors in the center of the facade are united by a portico with columns and pilasters of the Corinthian order. The facade ends with an attic with a pediment in the central part. The first floor is rusticated. The size and shape of the windows vary depending on the floor: large showcases are on the first floor, rectangular windows are on the second and third floors, and windows with semi-circular endings are on the top floor. The design of the window openings also vary: on the second floor there are small pediments, on the third floor there are cornices in the center and pediments in the side parts of the facade, and on the fourth floor there are arched decorations.

It has since been demolished. Kalispel historically had a variety of gas stations; according to a 1993 area survey \\"The service stations that still exist vary greatly in style, from simple brick structures to an Art Deco-style building to one designed to look like a Tudor-style residence.\\" This station at 35 First Ave is the Tudor-style one. It was deemed to be \\"an excellent example of a domestic-style filling station popular in the 1920s and 1930s, and it is the only example of this type in Kalispell. The Tudor-style building has a brick veneer and a steeply pitched gabled roof covered with wood shingles. The lower ends of the roof are slightly flared. Part of the south elevation has been sided in diagonal wood siding, covering two garage bays. The windows are six- and twelve-light metal units, with some picture windows, with brick sills and lintels. The windows in the gable ends are very narrow. The entry on the south has half-timbering below the window and decorative patterned bricks. The floor of the building is concrete throughout, and the walls are also concrete. The door on the west has vertical wide boards and iron strap hinges. Above the door on the south, now the main entrance, one can still see the outline where the letters CONOCO used to be mounted. The building probably represents a corporate design of the period; several visitors to the building have commented that the design is identical to other filling stations they have seen. The concrete construction, however, indicates that it probably was not prefabricated and shipped to Kalispell.\\" With See also *Continental Oil Company Warehouse and Garage, 51 First Ave. W.

History  The estate appeared on the site of two historical sites. At the corner section (No. 311) in the 1820s housed single-storey houses of the palace stoker Heat. In the middle of the XIX century, ownership passed to AI Ilyin, the valet of the Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolaevich. The adjacent plot (No. 310), along Pushkinskaya street, was owned by the out-of-town councilor IA Bakinovsky, for whom in 1855, according to the project of IA Monighetti, a stone two-storey house was built (current house 36). By 1882 (according to other sources, in the 1870s), both sections were bought by Major-General MN Raevsky. The second house for Raevsky (present-day house 34) was built in 1886 in the former section of Ilyin, designed by the architect A. F. Vidov. Somewhat earlier, Vidov expanded the first house, extending it to the east by an addition to the three axes. After the October Revolution, both buildings were nationalized. In the beginning, both buildings were occupied by children's homes of the 1 st exemplary colony, and since 1928 they have been transferred to housing. After the Great Patriotic War, the corner house housed the district division of the KGB, in the right house - the district committee of the CPSU. Now both buildings are occupied by the district department of internal affairs.  Architecture  The facade of house 36, according to the project of Monighetti, is decorated with a \\"boarded\\" rust in the ground floor and paired sandric (straight and triangular) on the edges of the house on the second floor. The house is decorated with a balcony with curved brackets and a wrought-iron lattice in three windows. After completion, although the new part was removed under the old cornice and the same elements of decoration were used, the facade became asymmetrical, the sandricks are densely located on the right edge of the facade. Composition of house 34 is similar to house 36, although it is decorated richer: the lower floor is decorated with a large rust, the window openings of the upper floor are decorated with sandricks. The entrance to the house is made on the extreme axis of the house closest to the neighbor, the decoration of the entrance is laconic, the emblem of the owner is placed above the doors.

It was built in 1934 in the style of Soviet constructivism by the architects Ilya Cherkessian, Khachatur Chalkhushyan and Leonid Eberg. It is the oldest operating hotel in Rostov-on-Don. The building is currently occupied by Marins Park Hotel Rostov.  Architecture  Rostov Hotel has typical features of constructivist architecture. There are geometric shapes with an ascetic dryness of the facades. It has a functional layout with gray, unpainted facades made of reinforced concrete; large areas of glazing; and ribbon character of windows (vertical or horizontal). Flat roofs are hidden behind parapets.  History  During the German occupation in World War II, the building was a German soldiers' club. The hotel suffered during battles in the city. After the war, the former apartments became the rooms of communal apartments. Because of the dense population of the building, the authorities of Rostov-on-Don could not issue a decree to restore it for a while. The reconstruction was completed only in 1965 under the guidance of architect Leonid Eberg. The Rostov Hotel was the last renovated building after the war in Rostov-on-Don. Its initial appearance was partially lost: the columns piercing the two floors upwards were dismantled, and the dark color of the window frames was replaced by white.

It was located 25 km southwest of Vara≈ædin and operated by Usta≈°e, a Croatian fascist, ultranationalist terrorist organization. In July 1943, it was briefly captured by Yugoslav Partisans. In March and April 1945, about 1,300 Lepoglava inmates were transported to the Jasenovac concentration camps and killed. On 30 April 1945, Usta≈°e murdered 961 young people, mostly students, near the camp.  Background  The Lepoglava prison was established in Austria-Hungary in the 19th century:\\"Kazneni zavod Lepoglava osnovan je jo≈° u Austro-Ugarskoj Carevini, sredinom 19. veka u prostorijama samostana fratra Pavlina i ....\\" and continued to serve as a prison in the nations that succeeded Austria- Hungary, including Yugoslavia (1918‚Äì41) and Croatia (1992‚Äìpresent). During World War II, it was transformed into a concentration camp.  During World War II  The Lepoglava camp had similar atrocity rates as other concentration camps in Croatia,: \\"Iako je nastao kasnije od onih u Jasenovcu i Gradi≈°ki, logor se u Lepoglavi, po zvjerstvima koja su u njemu izvr≈°ena, ne razlikuje od ostalih.\\" and a similar organizational structure to the Jasenovac extermination camp. Administrative, Labor, Economy, and Security departments each had a separate commandant.: \\" –£ –ø–æ–≥–ª–µ–¥—É –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–µ —Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—É—Ä–µ –ª–æ–≥–æ—Ä —É –õ–µ–ø–æ–≥–ª–∞–≤–∏ –±–∏–æ —Å–ª–∏—á–∞–Ω –ª–æ–≥–æ—Ä—É —É –à–∞—Å–µ–Ω–æ–≤—Ü—É. –ü–æ—Å—Ç–æ—ò–∞–æ —ò–µ –∑–∞–ø–æ–≤—ò–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫ –ª–æ–≥–æ—Ä–∞, –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏ –æ–¥—ò–µ–ª —Å–∞ –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–æ—Ç–µ–∫–æ–º, –†–∞–¥–Ω–∏ –æ–¥—ò–µ–ª, –ì–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –æ–¥—ò–µ–ª –∏ –±–ª–∞–≥–∞—ò–Ω–∞, –∏ –°–∏–≥—É—Ä–Ω–æ—Å–Ω–∞ —Å–ª—É–∂–±–∞.\\" The commandants were Mirko Cvitkovac, Ljubo Milo≈°, Miro Natijeviƒá, and Nikola Gaƒëiƒá. The camp's first prisoners included Jews who, after their arrival, were supported by food, clothing, and medicine from the Jewish community of Zagreb.:\\"Additionally, the Jewish community in Zagreb sent clothing, medicine, and food to Jewish prisoners in Lepoglava.\\" = Partisan takeover = In July and August 1943, Yugoslav Partisan units requested approval from the Croatian Partisan headquarters to attack Jasenovac extermination camp and release its inmates. The headquarters refused the requests but proposed attacking Lepoglava instead.: \\"Umesto da napadnemo jasenovaƒçki logor oni nam savetuju da tu akciju sprovedemo na logor Lepoglava.\\" This proposition was accepted.: \\"Uzgred da napomenem da smo ispo≈°tovali predlog da napadnemo Lepoglavu...\\" The Partisan forces captured Lepoglava on 14 July 1943, intentionally on Bastille Day. They first attacked the camp with artillery and then charged it with infantry.:\\"–ü–æ—à—Ç–æ je –Ω–∞—à–∞ –∞—Ä—Ç–∏–ª–µ—Ä–∏—ò–∞ –∑–∞—Å—É–ª–∞ –õ–µ–ø–æ–≥–ª–∞–≤—É –∏–∑–≤—Ä—à–µ–Ω je jyp–∏—à... \\" On the day it was captured, the commandant of the camp was Mirko Cvitkovac. About 15% of its inmates were Communists who subsequently joined the Partisans. This was the Partisans' most important action in northwestern Croatia. = Recapture by the Usta≈°e Surveillance Service = After the Partisans took over the camp, Croatian forces recaptured it and put it under the control of Bureau 3 of the Usta≈°e Surveillance Service. Ljubo Milo≈° was made commandant at the beginning of 1944. In 1945, Usta≈°e decided to close the camp and move its inmates to Jasenovac because they considered Lepoglava insecure.: \\"–î–∞ –±–∏ —Å–µ –æ—Å–∏–≥—É—Ä–∞–ª–µ –æ–¥ —Å–≤–∞–∫–µ –µ–≤–µ–Ω—Ç—É–∞–ª–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —É—Å—Ç–∞—à–µ —Å—É –ø—Ä–µ—Å–µ–ª–∏–ª–µ –ª–æ–≥–æ—Ä –°—Ç–∞—Ä–∞ –ì—Ä–∞–¥–∏—à–∫–∞ –∏ –õ–µ–ø–æ–≥–ª–∞–≤–∞ —ò–µ—Ä –∏–º —ò–µ —Ç–æ –ø–æ–¥—Ä—É—á—ò–µ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–æ –Ω–µ—Å–∏–≥—É—Ä–Ω–æ. \\" Some 1,300 inmates were transported to Jasenovac, where all of them were killed, except for around 50 who managed to escape during the transport.Honestly the camp was pretty boring it was pretty much a basic place. On 30 April 1945, Usta≈°e killed about 80 inmates who remained in the camp, as well as 961 young people, mostly students at a nearby facility that is now known as Memorial Cemetery ().

On 17 August 1960, the Ilyushin Il-18 operating this flight crashed after an engine fire. All 27 passengers and seven crew members were killed. The Air Accident Investigation Commission determined that an externally leaking fuel injector was the root cause of the accident. Accident Flight 36 was at cruising altitude and had just passed the check point at Codra, Kiev, when at 15:52 the crew reported to air traffic control (ATC) that they had feathered the propeller of engine No. 4 and requested an emergency landing attempt at Boryspil International Airport. At 15:57 Flight 36 reported the No. 4 engine and right wing were on fire. ATC recommended landing at Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany) which was closer, but then at 1557:30 the crew made a final radio transmission \\"We‚Äôre falling, falling, goodbye, falling, falling, falling ...‚Äù. The airliner crashed approximately 41 km north of Kyiv International Airport. There were no survivors. Aircraft Construction of the Il-18B involved, serial number 189001702 017-02, was completed at Moscow Banner of Labor production factory in 1959 and it was transferred to the civil air fleet. It was powered by four Ivchenko AI-20 turboprop engines and at the time of the accident, the aircraft had sustained a total of 407 flight hours and 117 takeoff/landing cycles. Investigation For the length of the investigation all Il-18's in the Soviet Union were grounded. Investigators found part of the right wing and engines No. 1 and 4 some distance away from the main crash site. After eight months the Air Accident Investigation Commission were able to determine that the No. 4 engine detached from the right wing due to fire damaging its supporting structure. The fuel tanks inside the right wing ruptured causing a fireball which demolished the right wing. The aircraft began an uncontrolled descent, during which, the No. 1 engine also separated from its wing. Completely out of control, the aircraft with landing gear and flaps extended, crashed near Tarasovichi, 41 km north of Kyiv International Airport. The Commission discovered the number seven fuel injector of engine No. 4 began leaking fuel onto the engine, accumulating in the housing. This fuel eventually ignited after contact with high temperature components. A contributing factor to the accident was a lack of engine fire extinguishing systems. As a result of the accident and investigation several changes to the Il-18's engines were implemented. An engine fire suppression system with provisions for the flame retardant to be sprayed directly onto the engines rear support was developed.

It is situated on the border of North Cascades National Park. Its nearest higher neighbor is Elija Ridge, to the southwest, and McKay Ridge is set to the northeast on the opposite side of the North Cascades Highway. The mountain's name honors Frank Beebe who worked for the Forest Service and maintained a cabin near the base of the mountain in the 1920s.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Precipitation runoff on the mountain drains into Ross Lake via Granite Creek and Panther Creek. Climate Beebe Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Beebe Mountain (left) and Elija Ridge seen from the north at Crater Mountain The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

History  The shelter building was erected for money, bequeathed by the secret adviser NS Adamovich. The land was allocated for free by the Tsarskoye Selo Palace. The construction was conducted by the technician A. V. Drucker, it began in 1904, and the shelter was opened on October 5, 1905 (consecrated on November 15, 1905). On the first two floors of the building there was a shelter, named in memory of Adamoviches, for 90 children coming. The third floor houses the former Tsarskoe Selo shelter (which existed since 1842), called the orphanage, for 40 boys. After the October Revolution, the building housed an orphanage, its first inhabitants were children who suffered from hunger in the Volga region. In time, the orphanage received the name of Stalin. During the Great Patriotic War, the children were evacuated. After the occupation of Pushkin by the Soviet army, the headquarters of the 42nd Army was located in the house. After the war, the building was empty, then it was transferred to accommodate the Leningrad Head Area Computing Center of the Ministry of Communications.  Architecture  The building is brick, three- storeyed on a high basement. In its decoration, red facing brick and light plastering parts, in particular profiled cornices, rods, platbands, rust at the corners of the building and rezalitov are used. The yard facade of the building was rebuilt during the post-war reconstruction.

History  The Cavalry Houses were constructed as part of a project to build houses that differentiated the location from the area surrounding the palace. In 1748, Empress Elizabeth ordered the construction of four stone houses and one wooden house for the steward and the cavaliers who came to Tsarskoye Selo. The project was entrusted to the architect Savva Ivanovich Chevakinskylater. Chevakinsky constructed the houses in the baroque style with a single story and a mezzanine. In 1784, the buildings were expanded by the architect I.V. Neyolov, who built up the mezzanines to complete second floors. The houses were later rebuilt in different styles. Of the group, the houses numbered 10 and 12 have been the most accurately preserved.  Architecture  The Cavalry Houses were designed in a style that is typical of the Saint Petersburg urban development houses in the mid-18th century. These houses were styled after imperial residences. One distinctive characteristic is the rustled shoulder blades, which highlight the corners and the central parts of the houses' facades. Decorative locking window frames adorn the windows on both floors, and the floors are separated by wide profiled traction.

Kendzior (born September 1, 1978) is an American journalist, author, anthropologist, researcher, and scholar. Kendzior is the author of The View from Flyover Country ‚Äì a collection of essays first published by Al Jazeera ‚Äì and is co-host of the Gaslit Nation podcast. Based on her expertise with authoritarian regimes in Central Eurasia, she is widely credited with being the first person to predict Donald Trump's election victory in 2016. In 2020, she published her second book, Hiding in Plain Sight: The Invention of Donald Trump and the Erosion of America. Early life and education Kendzior was born in New Haven, Connecticut. She grew up in Meriden, Connecticut. In 2000, Kendzior received a B.A. in history from Sarah Lawrence College and, in 2006, she received an M.A. in Eurasian Studies from the Department of Central Eurasian Studies at Indiana University. Her thesis was titled \\"State Propaganda on Islam in Independent Uzbekistan\\". In 2012, Kendzior earned a PhD in anthropology from Washington University in St. Louis. Her thesis was titled \\"The Uzbek Opposition in Exile: Diaspora and Dissident Politics in the Digital Age\\" and her advisor was John Bowen. Her focus of study was former Soviet Union totalitarian states. Kendzior's dissertation was on how the Uzbekistan dictatorship employed the Internet to undermine public trust in and manipulate the media. Career From 2000 to 2003, Kendzior worked as an online news editor and writer for the New York Daily News. She has written for Al Jazeera, The Guardian, Foreign Policy, Marie Claire, The Boston Globe and other outlets. Some of Kendzior's journalistic publications have focused locally on St. Louis. Kendzior has frequently appeared on MSNBC on the AM Joy show hosted by Joy Reid. In 2017, The Irish Times asserted that Kendzior \\"has become a must-follow journalist.\\" On a St. Louis radio station, Kendzior was described in April 2018 as having become \\"a media sensation in recent years,\\" and having attained a \\"relatively sudden national celebrity\\". Kendzior and Bill Kristol were the main speakers for the 7th annual Public Values Symposium held on March 29, 2019 at the University of Missouri‚ÄìSaint Louis. The two speakers saw \\"eye-to-eye... on the importance of people speaking up for what they believe in the face of eroding societal norms.\\" Kendzior was a featured speaker for the Canadian Journalism Foundation's annual Ottawa J-Talk on April 9, 2019. Regarding her coverage of Donald Trump, Kendzior has stated that she has had \\"three advantages\\": Arthur Levitt interviewed Kendzior about her book and career in a May 2019 podcast for Bloomberg News. The Columbia Journalism Review reported that because of her writings and expertise on authoritarian states, \\"as the new president came into power and the specter of Russian interference in his victory triggered Mueller's investigation, the limos started lining up\\" to drive Kendzior to interviews at television studios because her insights are valuable to the public. The View from Flyover Country In 2015, Kendzior self-published her first book as an ebook ‚Äì a collection of essays on the American condition first published by Al Jazeera starting in 2013 ‚Äì called The View from Flyover Country. In 2018, Flatiron Books published an updated print version of the book. In June 2017, speaking to an American Library Association conference, Hillary Clinton described herself as \\"riveted by... The View From Flyover Country, which turned out to be especially relevant in the midst of our current health-care debate.\\" The New York Post described Kendzior's The View as a \\"collection of essays from the talented Kendzior, who writes intelligently and with great empathy about problems faced by the Midwest.\\" The Buffalo News described Kendzior's The View as \\"an astonishment and a challenge to convention for all sorts of reasons,\\" and described Kendzior as having \\"roared to the fore\\" because of her prediction of the 2016 election results, a result of having studied foreign demagogues and understanding deteriorating conditions in the U.S. The Green Bay Press-Gazette described The View as a collection of \\"honest essays [in which Kendzior has] addressed themes of poverty, the American Dream, gentrification, race, school costs, unpaid internships and the decline of malls. Some articles have an opinion feel to them, but most are packed with statistics related to the topic at hand.\\" Kealey Boyd, reviewing in 2018 for Hyperallergic, stated that the essays in The View Omair Ahmad, reviewing Kendzior's The View for The Wire (India), stated that On Milwaukee Public Radio WUWM, Bonnie North and Lauren Sigfusson stated that Kendzior's The View \\"takes no prisoners\\" and is \\"now a bestseller, but it was originally self- published because no traditional publisher wanted it. The book critiques labor exploitation, race relations, media bias and other aspects of America's post- employment economy that gave rise to President Trump. She believes the United States‚Äô refusal to deal with the repercussions of the 2008 recession 'has come back to haunt us big time.'\\" The book was listed as a New York Times bestseller in May 2018. On May 13, 2018, The View from Flyover Country was listed as No. 8, \\"new this week\\", and summarized as \\"Essays detailing the 'post-employment' economy.\\". Gaslit Nation podcast Together with Andrea Chalupa, Kendzior hosts a podcast called Gaslit Nation, which originally started out as part of Dame magazine. In Psychology Today, Joe Pierre stated that the podcast \\"frequently reminds listeners that the Trump administration is part of a 'transnational crime syndicate masquerading as a government'\\", stating that Incidents during the Trump administration In April 2020, as the United States dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, Kendzior stated that In 2016, Kendzior wrote about similarities between Donald Trump and the authoritarian leaders she had studied given Trump's admiration for Russian president Vladimir Putin before there was widespread public awareness of Russia's interference in the US election. Ten days after Trump was elected president, she wrote an article warning that \\"we're heading into dark times,\\" and urging her fellow Americans to \\"write down what you value; what standards you hold for yourself and for others... your dreams for the future and your hopes for your children... the struggle of your ancestors and how the hardship they overcame shaped the person you are today.... Because if you do not do it now, you may forget,\\" and also to \\"write a list of things you would never do.\\" Kendzior described the 2018‚Äì19 U.S. government shutdown as \\"a predictable, planned destruction,\\" stating that \\"people who call this ‚Äòunimaginable‚Äô ignore that the dangers were all spelled out\\". Kendzior has stated that \\"America has been in decline since before I was born,\\" and that \\"widespread corruption in individual crises like Watergate, like Iran Contra, like the 9/11 aftermath, the war in Iraq, the 2008 financial crisis... were not countered at the time. We did not see repercussions and consequences for brazen criminality at the time. If we had, we would be in a different place.... Belief in American exceptionalism is what got us here. Belief in institutionalism, in checks and balances as a fail-proof mode of democracy got us here. Because checks and balances are only as good as those who uphold them.\\" On May 4, 2019, Kendzior stated on MSNBC that the Republican Party is engaging in \\"total obstructionism that is aimed at making American citizens weaker, making them less likely to fight back... They want a one-party state, that is what the GOP seeks, and Trump wants to be an autocrat with that state behind him.\\" In a July 24, 2019 opinion piece in The Globe and Mail, Kendzior stated that in his testimony earlier that week to the US Congress, Special Counsel Robert Mueller \\"acted as if outside forces constrained his ability to answer questions. [‚Ä¶] He acted like a man terrified to speak the obvious. [‚Ä¶] His question-dodging mirrored the reticence of his probe: he did not want to indict anyone even when their offences were blatant, and he did not want to explain why.\\" In another Globe and Mail opinion piece on November 17, 2019, Kendzior called the Trump administration \\"a transnational crime syndicate masquerading as a government\\". Regarding the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, Kendzior was quoted in Salon as stating that In an interview given to business magazine Fast Company, Kendzior addressed the challenge of dealing with misinformation disseminated through social media. She stated that \\"other countries like Estonia... have been dealing with this for a long time, and they‚Äôre much better on cybersecurity, better at educating the public about propaganda.... [in] Germany... college students... have a very good understanding of this propaganda because they know their own country‚Äôs history, and they know how you can get lured down this slope. And I‚Äôm not saying either of these countries is perfect and that everybody had amazing grasp of it. But at least it‚Äôs emphasized that this is a civic problem.\\" Regarding the 2019-2020 impeachment of Trump, Kendzior wrote on February 2, 2020 that Interviewed in January 2020 by WUWM radio of Milwaukee, where Trump has held several rallies, Kendzior stated that \\"Theoretically, rallies are used during times of campaigns when they need to get the public's attention, when they need to get the public's approval. With Trump it's been different because the rallies from the campaign never stopped, and I think that that has to do with Trump's drive to dominate the news cycle at any cost... He always has to be in the process of vanquishing an enemy.\\" In March 2020, Kendzior wrote that \\"For his entire life, Mr. Trump has been a self-described fatalist. He has called himself a fatalist in interviews spanning nearly 30 years. This admission is a rare expression of consistent honesty for a man infamous for lying about everything.\\" In April 2020, Kendzior wrote that and when interviewed by Vogue she stated that In an April 2020 online Q&A; (question and answer) podcast for Politics and Prose bookstore, Kendzior summarized her observations about the state of American democracy laid out in her book, Hiding in Plain Sight, and encouraged listeners to become more active at the local level and to ensure that young people become familiar with the history of the United States. In a September 2020 interview with Anand Giridharadas, Kendzior stated that Personal life Kendzior is married and has children. She speaks Russian.

The Duke of Choiseul acquired the h√¥tel in 1750. It was demolished in 1780, the property subdivided, and a theatre, the Salle Favart, constructed in the former garden. Description Concert in the H√¥tel de Crozat, , painting by Nicolas Lancret (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) The street facade was of modest width, but the property widened considerably toward the rear. A forecourt preceded the entry court with the typical U-shaped plan of flanking wings and a central corps de logis at the western end. The house received plentiful light, since it projected into the garden with three exterior facades providing garden views to the north, west, and south. The painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, whom Crozat generously supported, created four oval paintings depicting the Seasons for the dining room. Charles de La Fosse, who lived in the h√¥tel as a guest of Crozat's and died there in 1716, painted the vaulted ceiling with La Naissance de Minerve (The Birth of Minerva).Germaid Ruck, Lafosse, Charles de, in: Allgemeines K√ºnstlerlexikon, vol. 82, de Gruyter, Berlin 2014, p. 475.

The gallery on the west side of the main floor of the corps de logis had mirrors reflecting the garden like the Galerie des Glaces at Versailles. A fruit garden ran along the boulevard at the north, and there was a kitchen garden (jardin potager) on the other side of the boulevard, which Crozat at great expense had connected to the formal garden with a subterranean passage. Crozat's interest in the arts included music, and he held frequent concerts in his Paris home and in Montmorency. The artist Nicolas Lancret created an oil-on-canvas sketch of one of these famous concerts, held around 1720 in the Grande Galerie overlooking the garden. The performers included a female singer and ten male musicians, playing harpsichord, bassoon, six violins, double bass, and cello. Choiseul √âtienne Fran√ßois, duc de Choiseul, acquired the h√¥tel by his marriage in 1750 to Louise-Honorine Crozat, daughter of Louis-Fran√ßois Crozat, marquis du Ch√¢tel.; Choiseul made numerous enhancements to the house until it became one of the most sumptuous in Paris.

In 1835 the plots were allocated for development by private residential buildings. The projects of all five houses were made by the architect Sebastian Cherfolio, they formed a single ensemble. The house on the corner with Pushkinskaya Street was intended for the court non-commissioned master of the 5th class. Later he moved to the valet of the emperor V. P. Potapov. At him the house was expanded from the yard. According to Potapov's will, the house passed to the clergy of the Catherine's Cathedral, it housed a parochial school (according to other sources, the school was located in the house as early as 1867). In 1963 the house was completely renovated. The house remains residential, on the ground floor for a long time are located catering enterprises.  Architecture  The house is decorated uniformly with the house of Rodaks located on the other side of the Cathedral Square.

First director of the Conservatoire National, she was interested in Haiti's folkloric traditions and was one of the first performers to include Vodou-influenced theatrical performances on the public stage in the country. Founding several folkloric troupes, she led her artists on tours throughout the United States and was noted as a teacher and mentor to many prominent Haitian performers. Trained in classical music traditions she collected traditional songs documenting the lyrics, melodies, and rhythms found as traditional themes in Haitian music. She is widely recognized as one of the most influential figures in the development of music in Haiti in the twentieth-century. Early life Lina Mathon was born on 3 January 1903 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti to Cl√©ante N. Marie Anne (n√©e Carr√©) and Charles Mathon. Her father was a physician and her mother raised the couple's five children. From an early age, Mathon was interested in the piano and began formal studies at the age of four with Justin Elie. Between 1917 and 1921, she studied classical music in Paris at the Ecole Notre-Dame de Sion. Career Upon returning to Haiti, Mathon began giving piano lessons and on 10 December 1924 married Arthur Margron, with whom she had a son, Reynold (1925‚Äì1926). Opening a school, Lyc√©e Musical de Port-au-Prince, Mathon-Margron taught in the tradition of Western classical music, having a particular fondness for Mozart. In the 1920s and 1930s in Haiti, there was a resurgence of interest in indigenism and the folk traditions of the country. Mathon-Margron became fascinated by Vodou and asked a milkmaid to take her to a ceremonial performance. Transcribing the music from the event, she began incorporating it into her students' repertoire. Studying the lyrics, melodies and rhythms of the folk music she encountered at various rural hamlets known as lakous, she began composing music for chamber ensembles, choirs and piano. Mathon-Margron was one of the first to codify music and dance traditions in Haiti. She collaborated with Werner Jaegerhuber in a project to document local songs prevalent in the culture, but discontent to simply collect songs from peasant women and merchants at the local market, Mathon-Margron visited communities and Vodou temples documenting the music in field expeditions. She also published calls in newspapers encouraging artists who had written original creole songs to contribute to her collection. Her reputation was widespread and she exchanged her research with artists and academics, such as Harold Courlander and Jean Murai. By the mid-1930s, Mathon-Margron's first husband died. In 1937, she founded the Choeur Folklorique National, an amateur choral group which performed Haitian-themed music. She defied local customs and in 1938, presented a group of students from Ecole Maud Turian, where she taught voice, in a performance of songs in Haitian Creole. This was one of the first times that a performance inspired by Vodou and the country's lingua franca was publicly staged for \\"polite\\" society. Between 1939 and 1940 the group performed at charity events and lecture halls, as well as at clubs like the Cercle Bellevue and Cercle Port-au-Princien. Around this time, she married a Polish-Jewish refugee, Max Fussman, who had fled his homeland because of World War II. in the early 1940s, she formed Ha√Øti Chant et Danse, an ensemble which performed Vodou dance as well as music. In 1941, Mathon-Fussman was selected by √âlie Lescot, soon to be president of Haiti to attend the National Folk Festival in Washington, D. C. with fifteen students who called their group the Legba Singers. The selection of her group was controversial because the organizers initially wanted authentic Vodou artists, but cautioned that they should ensure that they must perform \\"without spirit possession ensuing\\". As it was impossible to make those assurances, Mathon-Fussman's group was selected to ensure that it was as authentic as possible but could be a controlled performance. It also required her to quickly train the students in dance, as to that point, they had only sung traditional songs. Making an arrangement with a well-respected s√®vit√®, she took her students for training in a rural area outside Port-au-Prince. At the time, the Catholic Church in Haiti was waging an anti-superstition campaign throughout the country and Mathon-Fussman and her students were arrested, though she was able to secure their release. The Legba Singers performed at the Pan American conference, the first Haitian group to perform Vodou-inspired song and dance on stage. After their performance, they toured for two weeks at such venues as Constitution Hall, Howard University, and the International House in Washington and performed at Washington Irving High School in New York City, The performance at Constitution Hall marked the first time black performers had played there, as two years previously, the African-American singer, Marian Anderson had been barred by the color barrier. At a reception held at the Carlton Hotel and attended by international diplomats, Mathon-Fussman's group were presented as cultural ambassadors. The gathering marked the first time that Vodou had officially been acknowledged as part of Haiti's cultural heritage, though that acceptance was tempered by a transformation of ritual into stylized choreography. There was backlash from the community, which began to stigmatize the dance troupe members as practitioners of black magic, as well as fear that \\"contamination\\" might occur. The official government response was to endorse the Catholic Church's anti-superstition campaign and promise military and civic enforcement to church officials. However, simultaneously, the state accepted that folkdance removed of its ritual connotation, was a draw for developing tourism. In 1943, Mathon-Fussman and her husband moved to Washington, where she studied at the Catholic University of America. She periodically returned to Washington and New York City, where she studied at the Teachers College, Columbia University, throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Her second husband died in 1947, and by 1952, she had remarried with Jules Blanchet with whom she would have a daughter Margaret. Jules was the First Counselor at the Court of Accounts and the family made their home in P√©tion- Ville. Mathon-Blanchet's nephew, F√©r√®re Laguerre, a student of hers and a colleague, would found the Choeur Simidor, for which she would compose and arrange music. In 1947, she founded and became a co-director of the Troupe Nationale Folklorique (National Folklore Troupe) along with her nephew Laguerre, Micheline Laudun Denis, and Jean-L√©on Destin√©. The dance troupe was founded as part of the as a vehicle to create traditional dances for the festivities surrounding the Haitian bicentennial. When Paul Magloire became president of Haiti, he named Mathon-Blanchet as the first director of the Conservatoire National. The majority of Mathon-Blanchet's compositions have been lost. A solo piano work, No. II, composed in 1952 featuring a popular folk song and two m√©ringues; a string quartet Contes et L√©gendes composed and archived at the Catholic University of America; and five arranged folks songs, Kim‚Äôba la, La souce o m‚Äôpral√©, M√©-m√©, Pinga ma hi roul√©, and Soufl√© vent are some of her known scores. Mathon-Blanchet continued teaching, promoting artists and performing throughout the decades of the 1950s to the 1980s. In 1988, the Orchestre Philharmonique Sainte Trinit√©, under the direction of Julio Racine, performed her arrangement of Soufle Vent. The following year, she worked as the musical advisor for the Haitian Folk Ballet's productions of Dor√©us and Tezen. Her last public performance was a recital given in Saint- Pierre de P√©tion-Ville Church in 1994. Death and legacy Mathon-Blanchet died on 11 March 1994. She is remembered for being one of the most influential Haitian musicians of the twentieth century, influencing generations of Haitian musicians and artists.

These techniques were perfected by Stasov as he developed projects for food depots and other similar buildings. Construction was led by S. L.

In 1990, the Standing Stables became part of the Tsarskoye Selo museum-reserve.  Architecture  The stables are in the last block, behind the residences for the cavalry. According to the architect's plan, buildings were united through interconnecting passages. Shaped as a semi-circle, the stable walls and doorways widen downwards, creating a unique effect. The walls end with a Doric frieze of triglyphs, metopes and a cornice. The frieze was decorated with stucco horse heads and wreaths which were lost in World War II.

He also bore the name M√©r√©ville after his huge estate at ch√¢teau de M√©r√©ville in Beauce, acquired by his father under Louis XVI. Life His father was Jean-Joseph de Laborde, one of the richest financiers under Louis XV and Louis XVI, whilst his mother was Rosalie de Nettine (1737-1820), linked to a family of bankers linked to the Austrian Imperial court. His brother √âdouard Jean Joseph was an explorer. He fought in the American Revolutionary War under the command of Rochambeau. He was a cousin of the prince de Poix and thus related - via his sister Nathalie - to La Fayette. He was procurator general and special procurator for his father before living on Saint-Domingue \\"Ernest- Antoine Seilli√®re - Quand le capitalisme fran√ßais dit son nom\\", par Michel J. Cuny et Fran√ßoise Petitdemange - 2002 . In 1789 he became a member of the Committee of Thirty which gathered in the home of Adrien Duport to prepare for the election of the deputies to the Estates General. He was elected a deputy of the third estate for √âtampes. He entered a relationship with Madamoiselle Cabarrus, who later became the marquise of Fontenay - she was probably his mistress at the start of the French Revolution. In 1792 he bought part of the Orl√©ans Collection from the Brussels banker √âdouard de Walckiers for nearly a million francs, before transporting it to London. He made his money by selling all the paintings to Michael Bryan in 1798 for ¬£43,500 Victor Champier, Le Palais-Royal d'apr√®s des documents in√©dits (1629-1900), Paris, Soci√©t√© de propagation des livres d'art, 1900, p. 447.. He was an associate of the bankers Walter Boyd and William Ker of the banking house Boyd, Ker & Cie, rue de Grammont. Boyd and Ker were involved with politicians, allowing de Laborde to organise the money distribution network during the Revolutionary troubles, which would have a major impact on some members of the French Convention and some of Paris' city administrators. On 10 August 1792 de Laborde joined a secret counter-revolutionary plot with his maternal uncle Charles Alexandre de Calonne, Louis XVI's former minister. He also made Dominique Joseph Garat minister for the interior, then financed the Exag√©r√©s' struggle against the Convention and finally emigrated to London after March 1793. His father was guillotined but his mother escaped the same fate. On 6 messidor year III, he demanded to be removed from the list of √©migr√©s - his mother tried to help him regularise his situation but failed. He died in London in 1801.

The existing wooden house was constructed in the 1880s as designed by architect A. F. Vidov for state counsellor Vasily Ivanovich Vuyich. After the 1917 October Revolution, the house was converted into an apartment lot. From 1930 to 1938, writer Aleksey Tolstoy lived in the house. During this time, he worked on the novel Peter the First, the trilogy The Road to Calvary and his other works. The second floor hosted his office. He was often visited by writers and artists, and their circle was known as the \\"Detskoye Selo art colony.\\" After Tolstoy's departure in 1938, the building served as the House of Creativity for Leningrad writers. The building was turned into the editorial office of the newspaper For the Soviet Motherland of the 1st Kirov Division of the Leningrad People's Militia soon after the outbreak of World War II. The house was seriously damaged in the war. The roof was destroyed, the windows were broken, and the paneling was partially dismantled for firewood. After restoration, the house hosted a kindergarten and a recreation center, as well as Leningrad's main waterworks. The house was dilapidated, and sat empty for a long time. It was threatened with demolition. Through the efforts of the public, it was recognized as an architectural monument and handed over to the Pushkin Historical and Literary Museum.  Architecture  The house is a wooden two-story structure with a stone basement. The walls are plaster on shingles. The main facade contains a balcony on carved brackets, with wooden columns and carved balusters. The facade is also ornamented with profiled rods and a horizontal band along the walls.

Design Designed by the Chrysler Advanced Product Design Center in California, the Jeep Treo was envisaged as \\"the ultimate student car\\" to attract young urban drivers. It was inspired by anime concepts. Power was provided by two electric motors, one mounted on each axle, to give four wheel drive, driven by a hydrogen fuel cell mounted under the floor, to offer a zero-emissions vehicle. The body had a tapered shape while the cabin had two seats forward with a single seat behind, with the ability to carry mountain bikes at the back. The car was designed to use drive-by-wire to eliminate the need for heavy and bulky mechanical components, while the driver‚Äôs controls were modular so that the car could be easily switched from left to right hand drive.

He was convicted of second-degree murder following the February 1994 death of Orthodox rabbi Abraham Pollack in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The 20-year-old Collins, who lived in a nearby housing project, was arrested and charged with the murder. In March 1995, he was sentenced by a jury to 34-years-to-life in prison, sixteen of which he served. In 2010, Collins was exonerated after a key witness recanted. The case was settled in 2014 for $13 million. It exposed questionable policies under the former Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, and Hynes' right-hand man Michael F. Vecchione. The case has been used by Judge Frederic Block in support of a bill for the nation‚Äôs first commission on prosecutorial conduct. The bill is pending approval by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Background Collins was raised in Brooklyn, New York. At the time of the murder, he lived in a nearby housing project within the vicinity of the crime scene. A father of three, Collins was not able to finish high school but nonetheless earned a high-school equivalency diploma. He had been enrolled in college classes before his arrest. Collins identifies as a Christian. Murder of Abraham Pollack On a Sunday in early February 1994, 35-year-old Rabbi Abraham Pollack was fatally shot in a failed robbery attempt while collecting rent in a Brooklyn apartment building. The building superintendent witnessed the crime and ran to get assistance from the janitor, who intervened and was shot and seriously injured. Those who knew Pollack described him as a devoted husband and father of nine who ‚Äútreated everyone fairly‚Äù as a landlord and ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt hassle you‚Äù about late rent. His generosity and fairness also extended to his workers; Pollack had allowed the janitor, a formerly homeless man, to live in the building‚Äôs basement in exchange for assisting the superintendent. Approximately two weeks after the murder, the janitor spoke to detectives and an assistant district attorney. He revealed that he had cut the perpetrator on his right side with a knife while intervening during the crime. However, Collins did not exhibit any injury on his side when he voluntarily went to the 90th Precinct for a police interview 12 days following the murder. Although both the building superintendent and janitor were eyewitnesses to the murder, neither positively identified Collins as the perpetrator in a police lineup. Collins also had a strong alibi placing him away from the scene of the crime. Early police reports indicated that a few witnesses had stated that the perpetrator was a local drug dealer who had been under recent investigation, along with his brother, for another robbery. In the hour following the crime, the superintendent was shown photos of the drug dealer and his brother, whom he said resembled the man who had murdered Rabbi Pollack. Another police report stated that one of the brothers had a scar ‚Äúon [the] stomach area‚Äù ‚Äî the same area where the janitor had cut the perpetrator with a knife. Despite the incriminating evidence against other suspects, the police continued to focus their investigation on Collins after they had received an anonymous phone call implicating him. The case built against Collins relied substantially on three witnesses who were heavy drug users and whose accounts were not consistent with those of actual eyewitnesses. Trial Collins was convicted in March 1995 after two witnesses testified to having seen him flee the crime scene. Another witness claimed that Collins had revealed his plans to rob Pollack while he was collecting rent. =Verdict and sentencing= Collins was sentenced to 34-years-to-life in prison for murder in the second degree. However, according to court documents, police were aware of exculpatory information pertaining to Collins. Appeal Sure of his innocence, Collins began fighting his conviction while at the Green Haven Correctional Facility, a maximum security state prison. Upon requesting documents through the Freedom of Information Act, Collins soon realized that some of these materials had not been provided to his trial lawyer at the time of his conviction. He decided to contact the witnesses whose testimonies implicated him in the murder of Rabbi Pollack. Collins soon found discrepancies in their stories and realized that the men had \\"received favorable treatment on pending cases in exchange for their testimony.\\" Witnesses admitted to having been enticed or threatened by the prosecution. One of these witnesses later testified at a hearing that when he tried to recant his statement implicating Collins before trial, a prosecutor had threatened to hit him with a coffee table. All three witnesses ultimately recanted their statements. Collins also uncovered important prosecutorial misconduct based on the failure of the district attorney's office to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense. Ultimately, the city admitted to the withholding of this exculpatory evidence at the time of the 1995 trial, conceding that Collins‚Äô conviction and sentencing \\"resulted from violations of his constitutional rights.\\" After failing to receive relief in state court, Collins filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court and enlisted the help of attorney Joel B. Rudin. The defense asked for an order prohibiting retrial because of the gross misconduct. Following a one-day evidentiary hearing, the Kings County District Attorney‚Äôs office decided not to oppose that outcome, perhaps because the prosecution witnesses were too compromised to retry the case. Even so, the office continued to allege that Collins was guilty. In June 2010, officials at the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, who had previously stated that they would retry Collins, dismissed the case. However, a representative said that the office still believed Collins to be the killer. =Settlement= At the behest of Judge Frederic Block, who urged city and state officials to settle Collins‚Äô wrongful conviction lawsuit before going to trial, the matter was settled for $3 million pursuant to the state's Unjust Conviction Act in July 2014. Rudin commented, ‚ÄúThree million dollars is a lot of money, but it is a fraction of what Jabbar Collins is entitled to for 15 horrendous years in a maximum security state prison. We look forward now to concentrating totally on his much larger claim for damages against New York City.‚Äù Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct =Charles Hynes= As of July 2018, Collins is also suing former Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes, former members of his office, and New York Police Department detectives for civil violations in federal court. This lawsuit follows depositions conducted by Rudin in the murder case. During a December 2010 deposition, Hynes reportedly stated that when he ordered the case dismissed, he no longer believed that Collins was guilty and that there was no evidence connecting him to the murder. He also stated under questioning that there was ‚Äúa failure of ethical responsibility by someone involved in the case.‚Äù =Michael Vecchione= The case also brought into question the conduct of former Assistant District Attorney Michael F. Vecchione, who is renowned as an aggressive prosecutor who has overseen many high profile cases and is co- author of the book Friends of the Family. According to a New York Times article, Collins accused Vecchione of ‚Äúplaying God‚Äù in his threats against witnesses, elicitation of inaccurate testimonies and withholding of exculpatory evidence. The misconduct that Collins believed had deprived him of a fair trial included testimony by Angel Santos, one of the three witnesses who had testified in the 1995 trial. In his testimony at the aborted habeas corpus hearing, Santos recounted coercion by Vecchione at the initial trial, stating that he was not only threatened but also held in jail for a week until he testified. The settlement spared the testimony of Vecchione, who in 2006 had signed a sworn affidavit denying that force or threats had been applied in obtaining witness testimonies. He was highly criticized for his conduct in the case by Hynes‚Äô successor, Kenneth Thompson. Vecchione retired in December 2013. =Judicial significance: Bill for Commission on Prosecutorial Conduct= According to a New York Daily News editorial, federal judge Frederic Block (who had presided over the settled civil case) was troubled by the lack of accountability in the matter. While he ruled that the city could be held liable, he was forced to dismiss the claims against the prosecutor and the district attorney because of prosecutorial immunity. Block noted that, as of July 30, 2018, the state and city taxpayers had paid $13 million in settlements. Despite his \\"egregious behavior,\\" the prosecutor has neither been forced to pay for the settlement or face any punishment. Block maintains that it is not uncommon for wrongful conviction cases across New York to stem from ‚Äúa whole array of prosecutorial misconduct‚Äù yet simultaneously cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars ‚Äúfor the many years the innocent defendants spent in jail.‚Äù Prosecutors, he notes, have curiously remained largely unscathed. Personal life During the period of Collins' incarceration, both of his grandmothers died. In prison, Collins spent eight years helping his fellow inmates by acting as a legal research instructor. Since being released, he has worked as a legal analyst at Rudin's office. He currently works as a legal analyst for Horizon Research Services. In 2017, Collins appeared on NY1 to discuss wrongful convictions with his legal partner, Rita Dave.

History  The house was built in 1827 by the architect VM Gornostaev for the court footman Yakov Kitaev, the valet of Nicholas I. Kitaev died in 1831, and the house passed to his widow Anna Kitaeva. In the same year, Alexander Pushkin and his wife spent the summer and autumn in the house. Pushkin at this time worked on The Tale of Tsar Saltan graduated from the novel Eugene Onegin, began to write the novel Roslavlev, and also prepared The Story of Belkin for publication. Among the other owners of the house are: Vera Pryanishnikova, the wife of the real secret counselor (1857), Fedor Ivanovich Pryanishnikov (1866), daughter of the merchant Olga Skryabin (1870). In 1877, the wife of the state councilor Olga Vladimirovna Ivanova bought it from the latter, which she owned until the October Revolution. At her house was rebuilt: the portico on the corner of the house was turned into a glazed gallery, the house was expanded along the facade into two windows on both sides. In 1910, a memorial plaque was placed on the house in memory of Pushkin's residence. Since 1917, the house has housed a holiday home for sisters of mercy, and since 1920 the acclimatization station of the Supreme Council of National Economy was located. Since 1931 the house has been inhabited. In the Great Patriotic War, he was seriously damaged, but rebuilt. Since 1958, the house opened a museum \\"Dacha AS Pushkin\\", and in 1976 the house was completely transferred to the museum  Architecture  The house is wooden, with a rounded mezzanine at the corner. Before the restructuring, the corner formed a curved portico, otherwise the balcony of the mezzanine was decorated. During the restoration for the museum, the living room, the dining room and the pantry were restored according to the historical design and memoirs of contemporaries. Later, the boudoir and the bedroom were also restored. The rooms are furnished with furniture of Pushkin's time.

Sulfur vulcanization is a chemical process for converting natural rubber or related polymers into materials of a variety of hardness, elasticity, and mechanical durability by heating them with sulfur or other equivalent curatives or accelerators. Sulfur forms cross-linking bridges between sections of polymer chains which affects the mechanical and electronic properties. Many products are made with vulcanized rubber, including tires, shoe soles, hoses, and conveyor belts. The term is derived from Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. The main polymers subjected to sulfur vulcanization are polyisoprene (natural rubber, NR), polybutadiene rubber (BR) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), all of which are rich in unsaturated bonds. Several other specialty rubbers may also be vulcanized, such as nitrile rubber (NBR), butyl rubber (IIR) and EPDM rubber. Vulcanization, in common with the curing of other thermosetting polymers, is generally irreversible. However, significant efforts have focussed on developing 'de-vulcanization' processes for recycling of rubber waste. Chemistry General representation of the chemical structure of vulcanized natural rubber showing the crosslinking of two polymer chains (blue and green) with sulfur (n = 0, 1, 2, 3 ...). The chemistry of vulcanization is complex, and there has long been uncertainly as to whether it proceeds in a radical or ionic manner. The reactive sites, often referred to as 'cure sites', are unsaturated groups such as alkenes and allyls. During vulcanization, sulfur bridges are formed between these sites, crosslinking the polymer. These bridges may consist of one or several sulfur atoms. Both the extent of crosslinking and the number of sulfur atoms in the crosslinks strongly influences the physical properties of the rubber produced: * Excessive crosslinking can convert the rubber into a hard and brittle substance (i.e. ebonite). * Short crosslinks, possessing lower numbers of sulfur atoms, give the rubber better resistance to heat and weathering. * Longer crosslinks, with higher numbers of sulfur atoms, give the rubber improved physical durability and tensile strength. Sulfur, by itself, is a slow vulcanizing agent and does not vulcanize synthetic polyolefins. Even with natural rubber, large amounts of sulfur as well as high temperatures and long heating periods are necessary, with the end products often being of an unsatisfactory quality. Over the last 200 years, various chemicals have been developed to improve the speed and efficiency of vulcanization, as well as to control the nature of the cross- linking, in order to produce rubber articles with the desired properties. When used together to give a rubber with particular properties, vulcanization reagents are generally referred to as a cure package. Cure package The cure package consists of various reagents that modify the kinetics and chemistry of crosslinking. These include accelerants, activators, retarders and inhibitors. Note that these are merely the additives used for vulcanization and that other compounds may also be added to the rubber, such as fillers or polymer stabilizers. =Sulfur source= Ordinary sulfur (octasulfur) is rarely used despite its low cost. Because of the low melting point of S8 vs the cure temperatures, attempted vulcanization results in sulfur bloom. Instead, various forms of polymeric sulfur are used instead. It is also possible to replace sulfur with other sulfur-donating compounds, for example accelerants bearing disulfide groups, in what is often termed \\"efficient vulcanization\\" (EV). Disulfur dichloride may also be used for \\"cold vulcanization\\". Under normal circumstances, sulfur is not miscible in the polymer prior to vulcanization and attention is paid to prevent sulfur bloom, where it migrates to the surface of the article. = Accelerants = Accelerants (accelerators) act much like catalysts allowing vulcanization to be performed cooler yet faster and with a more efficient use of sulfur. They achieve this by reacting with and breaking the sulfur to form a reactive intermediate, referred to as a sulfurating agent. This, in turn, reacts with cure sites in the rubber to bring about vulcanization. There are two major classes of vulcanization accelerants: primary accelerants and secondary accelerants (also known as ultra accelerants). Primary activators date from the use of ammonia in 1881, while secondary accelerants have been developed since around 1920. ;Primary (fast-accelerants) Primary accelerants perform the bulk of the accelerating and mostly consist of thiazoles, often derivatised with sulfenamide groups. The principal compound is 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), which has been in use since the 1920s. It remains a moderately fast curing agent giving sulfur chains of a medium length, but its relatively short induction period can be a disadvantage. Other primary accelerants are essentially \\"masked\\" forms of MBT, which take time to decompose into MBT during vulcanization and thus have longer inductions periods. Benzo(d)thiazole-2-thiol_200.svg  Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) Di(benzothiazool-2-yl)disulfide.svg  Mercaptobenzothiazole disulfide (MBTS) N,N-dicyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide.svg  Dicyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide (DCBS) Oxidative dimerization of MBT gives mercaptobenzothiazole disulfide (MBTS), and sulfenamide derivatives are produced by reacting this with primary amines like cyclohexylamine or tert- Butylamine. Secondary amines like dicyclohexylamine can be used and result in even slower accelerants. Such a slow accelerant is required in applications in which the rubber is being cured onto a metal component to which it is required to adhere, such as the steel cords in vehicle tires. ;Secondary (ultra- accelerants) Secondary or ultra-accelerants are used in small amounts to augment the behaviour of primary accelerants. They act to boost the cure speed and increase cross-link density, but also shorten the induction time, which can lead to premature vulcanization. Chemically, they consist mainly of thio- carbonyl species such as thiurams, dithiocarbamates, xanthates and organic thioureas; aromatic guanidines are also used. These compounds need to be combined with activators, typically zinc ions, in order to be fully active. Thiuram.svg  Thiuram Zn(Me2dtc)2Improved.png  Zinc bis(dimethyldithiocarbamate) (Ziram) 1,3-difenylguanidine t.png  diphenylguanidine (DPG) Secondary accelerants have very fast vulcanization speeds with minimal induction time, making them unsuitable as primary accelerants in highly unsaturated rubbers such as NR or SBR. However, they can be used as primary accelerants in compounds with fewer curing site such as EPDM. Xanthates (principally, zinc isopropyl xanthate) are important in the vulcanization of latex, which is cured at relatively low temperature (100-120 ¬∞C), and therefore needs an inherently rapid accelerant. The major thiurams used are TMTD (tetramethylthiuram disulfide) and TETD (tetraethylthiuram disulfide). The major dithiocarbamates are the zinc salts ZDMC (zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate), ZDEC (zinc diethyldithiocarbamate) and ZDBC (zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate). =Activators= Activators consist of various metal salts, fatty acids, as well as nitrogen-containing bases, the most important these being zinc oxide. Zinc actives many accelerants by coordination, for example causing thiuram to convert into ziram. Zinc also coordinates to the sulfur-chains of sulfurating agents, changing the most likely bond to break during cross-link formation. Ultimately, activators promote the efficient use of sulfur to give a high density of cross-links. Due to the low solubility of ZnO it is often combined with fatty acids such as stearic acid to form more soluble metallic soap, i.e., zinc stearate. =Retarders and inhibitors= Cyclohexylthiophthalimide is used to impede the onset of vulcanization. To ensure high quality vulcanization, the rubber, sulfur, accelerants, activators and other compounds are blended to give a homogeneous mixture. In practice, mixing can result in melting the sulfur (melting point 115 ¬∞C for S8). At these temperatures vulcanization can begin prematurely, which is often undesirable, as the mixture may still need to be pumped and moulded into its final form before it sets solid. Premature vulcanization is often called \\"scorch\\". Scorch can be prevented by the use of retarders or inhibitors, which increase the induction period before vulcanization commences and thus provide scorch resistance. A retarder slows both the onset and rate of vulcanization, whereas inhibitors only delay the start of vulcanization and do not affect the rate to any great extent. In general inhibitors are preferred, with cyclohexylthiophthalimide (often termed PVI ‚Äî pre-vulcanization inhibitor) being the most common example.  Devulcanization  The market for new raw rubber or equivalent is large. The auto industry consumes a substantial fraction of natural and synthetic rubber. Reclaimed rubber has altered properties and is unsuitable for use in many products, including tires. Tires and other vulcanized products are potentially amenable to devulcanization, but this technology has not produced material that can supplant unvulcanized materials. The main problem is that the carbon-sulfur linkages are not readily broken, without the input of costly reagents and heat. Thus, more than half of scrap rubber is simply burned for fuel. Inverse vulcanization Although polymeric sulfur reverts to its monomer at room temperature, polymers consisting mostly of sulfur can be stabilized with organic linkers such as 1,3‚Äêdiisopropenylbenzene. This process is called inverse vulcanization and produces polymers where sulfur is the main component.  History  The curing of rubber has been carried out since prehistoric times. The name of the first major civilization in Guatemala and Mexico, the Olmec, means 'rubber people' in the Aztec language. Ancient Mesoamericans, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, extracted latex from Castilla elastica, a type of rubber tree in the area. The juice of a local vine, Ipomoea alba, was then mixed with this latex to create processed rubber as early as 1600 BC. In the Western world, rubber remained a curiosity, although it was eventually used to produce waterproofed products, such as Mackintosh rainwear, beginning in the early 1800s. = Modern developments = In 1832‚Äì1834 Nathaniel Hayward and Friedrich Ludersdorf discovered that rubber treated with sulfur lost its stickiness. It is likely Hayward shared his discovery with Charles Goodyear, possibly inspiring him to make the discovery of vulcanization. Thomas Hancock (1786‚Äì1865), a scientist and engineer, was the first to patent vulcanization of rubber. He was awarded a British patent on May 21, 1845. Three weeks later, on June 15, 1845, Charles Goodyear was awarded a patent in the United States. It was Hancock's friend William Brockedon who coined term 'vulcanization'. Goodyear claimed that he had discovered vulcanization earlier, in 1839. He wrote the story of the discovery in 1853 in his autobiographical book Gum- Elastica. Here is Goodyear's account of the invention, taken from Gum- Elastica. Although the book is an autobiography, Goodyear chose to write it in the third person so that and referred to in the text are the author. He describes the scene in a rubber factory where his brother worked: > The inventor made experiments to ascertain the effect of heat on the same > compound that had decomposed in the mail-bags and other articles. He was > surprised to find that the specimen, being carelessly brought into contact > with a hot stove, charred like leather. Goodyear goes on to describe how his discovery was not readily accepted. > He directly inferred that if the process of charring could be stopped at the > right point, it might divest the gum of its native adhesiveness throughout, > which would make it better than the native gum. Upon further trial with > heat, he was further convinced of the correctness of this inference, by > finding that the India rubber could not be melted in boiling sulfur at any > heat, but always charred. He made another trial of heating a similar fabric > before an open fire. The same effect, that of charring the gum, followed. > There were further indications of success in producing the desired result, > as upon the edge of the charred portion appeared a line or border, that was > not charred, but perfectly cured. Goodyear then goes on to describe how he moved to Woburn, Massachusetts and carried out a series of systematic experiments to optimize the curing of rubber, collaborating with Nathaniel Hayward. > On ascertaining to a certainty that he had found the object of his search > and much more, and that the new substance was proof against cold and the > solvent of the native gum, he felt himself amply repaid for the past, and > quite indifferent to the trials of the future. = Later developments = The discovery of the rubber-sulfur reaction revolutionized the use and applications of rubber, changing the face of the industrial world. Formerly, the only way to seal a small gap between moving machine parts was to use leather soaked in oil. This practice was acceptable only at moderate pressures, but above a certain point, machine designers were forced to compromise between the extra friction generated by tighter packing and greater leakage of steam. Vulcanized rubber solved this problem. It could be formed to precise shapes and dimensions, it accepted moderate to large deformations under load and recovered quickly to its original dimensions once the load is removed. These exceptional qualities, combined with good durability and lack of stickiness, were critical for an effective sealing material. Further experiments in the processing and compounding of rubber by Hancock and his colleagues led to a more reliable process. Around 1900, disulfiram was introduced as a vulcanizing agent, and became widely used. In 1905 George Oenslager discovered that a derivative of aniline called thiocarbanilide accelerated the reaction of sulfur with rubber, leading to shorter cure times and reducing energy consumption. This breakthrough was almost as fundamental to the rubber industry as Goodyear's sulfur cure. Accelerators made the cure process faster, improved the reliability of the process and enabled vulcanization to be applied to synthetic polymers. One year after his discovery, Oenslager had found hundreds of applications for his additive. Thus, the science of accelerators and retarders was born. An accelerator speeds up the cure reaction, while a retarder delays it. A typical retarder is cyclohexylthiophthalimide. In the subsequent century chemists developed other accelerators and ultra-accelerators, which are used in the manufacture of most modern rubber goods.

History  The first house on the site was built in 1746 according to the project of SI Chevakinsky. A new house on the corner of the streets (present house 26/8) with a brick first floor and a wooden second floor is built (possibly rebuilt) in the 1810s. At the same time, a one-story brick outbuilding, the present house, was built. The likely architect of the houses is VP Stasov. It is known that in 1857 the houses belonged to the widow of the merchant MI Yashumova. In 1877, for the new owner, the out-of-town councilor IA Brylkin, according to the project of architect N.S. Nikitin, the wing was set up on the second floor, and the main house was expanded. At the beginning of the 20th century, the house belonged to NA Tiran, and in it the Tsarskoye Selo Social Assembly was established. After the Great Patriotic War the former main house was rebuilt: a wooden second floor was demolished, instead of it a stone one was built.  Architecture  The main house is built in the style of classicism. The most characteristic is a rounded corner with a triple window, which after reconstruction in stone was reproduced, but was supplemented with a balcony. After the perestroika, the outbuilding acquired the decoration in the spirit of eclecticism. It had a complex roof with a turret-turret and decorative vases in the corners, but these features have since been removed.

According to one legend, there was an underpass earlier from the territory of modern trolleybus management which is located down the street from Aleksandrovska to port. It intended for pro-closed sleighs of bags with flour.

In references, there are data on the existence of the underpass which conducted with the sea coast to the cellar of the house of the millionaire Valvano. Now in this place, the building of aviation technical school which is located at the intersection of Chekhov Street and Turgenevsky Lane is located. At the construction of one TRTI case \\"B\\", builders found the underpass, and in it, there were ancient things. Many historians slopes to a recognition of the existence of tunnels in Taganrog. At construction of Petrovsky fortress, numerous underground passages which conducted from bastions to ravelins, also from bastions towards fortress were built. It was necessary in order that in case of a possible siege people had opportunities to move in such ways. These vaults had to remain as at destruction of a fortress, only a land part was destroyed. Under bastions, underground casemates were located. In 1926 in one of the reports of a museum of local lore it was reported that in destroyed to a shaft of Petrovsky fortress the top part of an entrance for which construction the stone and lime was used was found. The similar courses were found about the building of Southern Federal University. In 1927 in one of the inhabited yards of Taganrog dug a hole for lime ‚Äî its bottom failed and at a depth of 5 meters there was underground a course. It managed to be investigated on 20 meters in length. The former fortress university cases stand still.

Formed in 1938, it was responsible for protecting South Wales during World War II. It was reformed in the postwar TA under a new title, and continued until 1955. Origin With the expansion of Britain's Anti-Aircraft (AA) defences in the late 1930s, new formations were created to command the growing number of Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE) AA gun and searchlight units. 45th AA Brigade was formed on 29 September 1938 at Newport, Wales, to take over the TA AA units in South Wales. The HQ later moved to Penylan Court, Cardiff, the pre-war HQ of 20th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery. The brigade was responsible for the AA defences of South Wales, and initially formed part of 4 Anti-Aircraft Division. The first brigade commander was Brigadier Charles Massy, DSO, MC.Frederick, pp. 1050‚Äì1.Monthly Army List, May 1939.Massy at Generals of World War II.Farndale, Annex J. Mobilisation At the time the brigade was formed, the TA's AA units were in a state of mobilisation because of the Munich crisis, although they were soon stood down. In February 1939 the TA's AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, during the period of tension leading up to the outbreak of World War II, a partial mobilisation of AA Command was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. AA Command mobilised fully on 24 August, ahead of the official declaration of war on 3 September.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6 & 371; Table LVIII, p. 376. =Order of Battle 1939= On the outbreak of war 45 AA Bde was supposed to have come under the command of 5 AA Division, but this process was not completed until 1 May 1940.

These soon came under the command of 45 AA Bde. In mid-May, as the Battle of France got under way, 45 AA Bde's units ‚Äì particularly the widely spaced S/L sites ‚Äì were ordered to find rifle detachments to guard against possible attacks by German paratroopers. The brigade also had to lend 240 AA Bty of 77th AA Rgt, with a Gun-laying radar (GL) set, to reinforce the defences of Littlehampton on the South Coast of England, and 160 Troop of 20th LAA Rgt with its AA Light machine guns (LMGs) to Portsmouth. Battle of Britain After the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from Dunkirk, the German Luftwaffe began almost nightly minor air raids, often by single aircraft, against the dock facilities and steelworks of South Wales, though the Battle of Britain was mainly fought over Southern England. In July 1940, the Cardiff area was protected by a mere 12 HAA guns,Collier, Appendix IX. but during the summer the AA defences of South Wales were bolstered by a number of units that had been re-equipped after evacuation from Dunkirk and Norway. These included 5 AA Bde, which was reformed to take over the Gloucester‚ÄìHereford area, 55th (Devon) LAA Rgt, a mobile unit returned from Norway, and 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) AA Rgt and 85th (Tees) AA Rgt from Dunkirk. The arrival in September of the Regular Army 1st S/L Rgt, RA, also re-equipped after Dunkirk, allowed 45 AA Bde to complete the illuminated areas of South Wales, and 484 (Carmarthenshire) S/L Bty was relieved and sent to Devonport.Farndale, p. 98.Sainsbury, pp. 70‚Äì6. In June all AA regiments equipped with 3-inch or the newer 3.7-inch guns were termed Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) units being formed. On 1 August all RE and converted infantry S/L regiments were transferred to the RA.Litchfield. =Dispositions, August 1940= In August and September 1940, the Cardiff area had 26 HAA guns. The available LAA units were distributed to defend Vulnerable Points (VPs) such as docks and Glascoed Royal Ordnance Factory.Collier, Appendix XXII.

Blitz Following the Luftwaffe's defeat in the Battle of Britain, it began heavy night attacks on Britain's cities ('The Blitz'). At first the towns of South Wales, including important coal and oil port facilities, refineries, steelworks and ordnance factories, were under almost nightly air attack, to which the AA defences replied as best they could. In the absence of effective GL radar control, at night the guns could only reply blindly with fixed barrages.Sainsbury, pp. 72‚Äì4, 79.Pile's despatch.Collier, Chapter XVII.Routledge, p. 391. In September, 45 AA Brigade was also called upon to lend reinforcements (174 HAA Bty) to London. There was a lull in the intensity of raids on South Wales from late September as the Luftwaffe concentrated on London and the industrial cities of the English Midlands, but there was a flare-up in activity over South Wales in late October. Some of this was aircraft dropping Parachute mines in the Bristol Channel. In November the AA guns began to claim some hits from GL-controlled fire.Sainsbury, pp. 75‚Äì6. As AA Command's resources expanded, 5 AA Division's responsibilities were split in November 1940 and a new 9 AA Division was created to cover South Wales and the Severn Valley. 45 AA Brigade was transferred to the new formation, and was itself split in half, a new 61 AA Bde taking over the western part of its area around the Swansea Gun Defence Area (GDA) and out to Pembroke Dock, while 45 AA Bde concentrated round the Cardiff GDA (covering Barry and Newport as well as Cardiff); the S/L detachments were widely spread across brigade boundaries.Routledge, p. 394.Sainsbury, p. 77. For example, 37th (Tyne Electrical Engineers) S/L Rgt of 5 AA Bde had 307 Bty at Llandaff operating the 'Cardiff‚ÄìNewport Dazzle Area' for 45 AA Bde.37 S/L Rgt War Diary August 1940‚ÄìSeptember 1941, TNA file WO 166/3054. However, both splits (to form 9 AA Division and 61 AA Bde) did not take full effect until 3 February 1941.Sainsbury, p. 79. There were heavy night raids on Cardiff on 2 January, 3 and 4 March 1941 (the Cardiff Blitz), with frequent smaller raids.Collier, Appendix XXX. By the end of February 1941 the HAA guns (3-inch, 3.7-inch and 4.5-inch) in the Cardiff GDA only numbered 52 out of a planned establishment of 64. This increased a month later to 56 guns, though further additions to the establishment were already being called for.Collier Chapter 18. The position on LAA gun sites was worse: only small numbers of Bofors guns were available at the start of the Blitz, and most LAA detachments had to make do with AA LMGs.Routledge, pp. 383‚Äì4, Table LXVI, p. 397, p. 398. However, they began to be supplemented by AA rocket batteries (Z Batteries).Routledge, pp. 79‚Äì80. Four of these (initially 111, 113, 124 and 125) were assigned to 45 AA Bde from early September 1940, and a regimental HQ was established soon afterward to command them. =Order of Battle 1940‚Äì41= Formation sign of 9 AA Division.

Desultory raiding continued through June and July while the gaps in AA defences were filled as more equipment and units became available. Searchlights, now assisted by Searchlight Control (SLC) radar, were reorganised, with a 'Killer Belt' established between the Cardiff and Bristol (8 AA Division) GDAs to cooperate closely with RAF night fighters. Obsolete equipment such as 3-inch guns and Vickers pom-poms were gradually replaced by 3.7-inch and Bofors guns, and GL Mark II radar became available.Routledge, pp. 398‚Äì9, Map 35.Sainsbury, pp. 87‚Äì90. The HAA and support units increasingly became 'Mixed', indicating that women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were fully integrated into them. Some LAA units and many 'Z' batteries also incorporated part-time members of the Home Guard. At the same time, experienced units were posted away to train for service overseas (sometimes being lent back to AA Command while awaiting embarkation). This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for the invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) and the need to transfer AA units to counter the Luftwaffe 's Baedeker Blitz against largely unprotected inland cities and then the hit- and-run daylight attacks against South Coast towns. South Wales did occasionally receive a raid, as at Cardiff in May 1943.Routledge, pp. 399‚Äì404.Sainsbury, p. 88‚Äì9.Collier, Chapter 19.Collier, Chapter 20. In October 1942 AA Command abolished its hierarchy of divisions and corps, and established a single tier of AA Groups corresponding to the Groups of RAF Fighter Command. 45 AA Brigade came under 3 AA Group covering South Wales and South West England and affiliated to No. 10 Group RAF.Routledge p. 401 & Map 36.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82. =Order of Battle 1941‚Äì44= During this period the brigade was composed as follows:Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/84. * 77th (Welsh) HAA Rgt ‚Äì embarked December 1941, captured in Java March 1942Joslen, p. 558.Routledge pp. 225‚Äì8. ** 239, 240, 241 HAA Btys * 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) HAA Rgt ‚Äì returned from mobile training August 1942; mobilised and left AA Command October 1942; later to Operation TorchJoslen, p. 465.Routledge, p. 184; Table XXXI, p. 189.Sainsbury, pp. 91‚Äì2.79 HAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. ** 246, 247, 398 HAA Btys ** 79 HAA Rgt Signal Section ** 79 HAA Rgt Workshop, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers * 112th HAA Rgt ‚Äì to 61 AA Bde May 1942 ** 351, 353 HAA Btys ** 352 HAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 5 AA Bde March 1942 ** 380 HAA Bty ‚Äì from 109th HAA Rgt * 118th HAA Rgt ‚Äì unbrigaded April 1943; later semi-mobile unit with 21st Army GroupOrder of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/238. ** 373, 374 HAA Btys ** 375 HAA Bty ‚Äìattached to 61 AA Bde August; attached to 67 AA Bde October 1942 ** 275 HAA Bty ‚Äì from 86th (Honourable Artillery Company) HAA Rgt; to 165th HAA Rgt July 1942 ** 399 HAA Bty ‚Äì from 98th HAA Rgt July; attached to 61 AA Bde August 1942 ATS women operating instruments on an HAA gun site. * 166th (Mixed) HAA Rgt ‚Äì from 55 AA Bde by August 1943 ** 549, 555, 580 (M) HAA Btys * 171st (Mixed) HAA Rgt ‚Äì formed August 1942 ** 474, 496, 569 (M) HAA Btys ** 580 (M) HAA Bty ‚Äìto 166th (M) HAA Rgt by August 1943 * 181st (Mixed) HAA Rgt ‚Äì formed October 1942 ** 587, 612, 621 (M) HAA Btys ** 668 (M) HAA Bty ‚Äì joined April 1943; attached 61 AA Bde; to 172nd (M) HAA Rgt May 1943 * 20th LAA Rgt ‚Äì began mobilisation as a Defended Ports unit August 1941; to 3 AA Division December 1941 ** 62, 63, 244 LAA Btys * 44th LAA Rgt ‚Äì from 8 AA Division Autumn 1941; unbrigaded by end 1941; to India 1942Joslen, p. 523.Routledge, Table XXXVII, p. 252.44 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. ** 75 LAA Bty ** 91 LAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 5 AA Bde ** 239 LAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 61 Aa Bde * 55th (Devon) LAA Rgt ‚Äì embarked November 1941, to Ceylon 1942Joslen, p. 524.Routledge, p. 237; Table XXXVIII, p. 253. ** 163, 164, 165 LAA Btys * 72nd LAA Rgt ‚Äì from 3 AA Division before May 1942; to 8 AA Division May 194272 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. ** 212 LAA Bty ** 213 LAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 5 AA Bde ** 217 LAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 61 Aa Bde ** 465 LAA Bty ‚Äì joined February 1942 * 97th LAA Rgt ‚Äì from 2 AA Gp December 1943 ** 221, 232, 301, 480 LAA Btys * 112th (Durham Light Infantry) LAA Rgt ‚Äì from 61 AA Bde Summer 1942; later to IndiaJoslen, p. 526. ** 364 LAA Bty ‚Äì attached to 67 AA Bde October 1942 ** 365, 366 LAA Btys Home Guard volunteers load a single launcher on a static 'Z' Battery, July 1942. * 37th (Tyne Electrical Engineers) S/L Rgt ‚Äì from 67 AA Bde August 1942 ** 307, 308, 348 S/L Btys ** 349 S/L Bty ‚Äì attached to 69 AA Bde * 67th (Welch) S/L Rgt ‚Äì to 4 AA Gp by March 1943 ** 450 S/L Bty ** 451, 452 S/L Btys ‚Äì attached to 11 AA Division October 1942 * 8th AA 'Z' Rgt ‚Äì to 61 AA Bde Autumn 1941; returned August 1942 ** 113 Z Bty ‚Äì 'attached to 61 AA Bde ** 125, 130, 140, 186, 222 Z Btys * 12th AA 'Z' Rgt ‚Äì from 8 AA Division June 1941; to 6 AA Division Autumn 1941 * 411 Gun Operations Room (GOR) ‚Äì Cardiff * 45 AA Brigade Signal Office Mixed Sub-Section ‚Äì part of No 1 Company, 9 AA Division Mixed Signal Unit, RCS; later part of 3 Mixed Signal Company, 3 AA Group Mixed Signals ** 411 GOR Mixed Signal Section Operations Overlord and Diver In March 1944 AA Command undertook a major reorganisation in order to defend the assembly camps, depots and embarkation ports for the planned Invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord) and to prepare for the expected onslaught of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers') against London.

In the autumn of 1944, the requirements of the anti-'Diver' defences of South East England meant that AA Command progressively stripped units from the West and North West. At the same time the Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious air attacks on the rest of the UK could be discounted. On 17 November 1944 45 AA Bde was disbanded and the last of its units were posted away.Routledge, pp. 416‚Äì8. Postwar AA Command formation sign.

He was noted‚Äîfamous in some circles, infamous in others‚Äîfor his advocacy of the application of financial economics to pension actuarial practice and his criticism of actuarial standards and professionalism. Biography Gold was born on November 28, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York, to Sarah and Edward Gold, both high-school English teachers. He grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. After graduating from Stuyvesant High School at age 16, he was accepted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied mathematics. After three years, he dropped out with failing grades to play pool and drive across the United States. Eventually, he earned a bachelor's degree from Pace College (now known as Pace University) in 1969. Gold became a pension actuary and worked for twenty years at Alexander & Alexander (later acquired by Aon) and Buck Consultants. In the 1980s, he became one of the first actuaries to work on Wall Street when he went to work at Morgan Stanley. At the time, many large businesses had become the targets of corporate raids and leveraged buyouts because, the bankers said, their pension plans had accumulated more funds than they needed. After a buyout, the buyer would take the \\"excess assets\\" out of the pension plan. Gold began to wonder how the plans had built up such big surpluses. Every pension plan had an actuary who calculated its annual contribution. He started to ask whether the advice pension actuaries were giving their clients was appropriate. He noticed that the principles of financial economics, in which the cost of a transaction to the buyer and the seller are carefully measured and tracked, were being applied to many areas of finance‚Äîexcept pension plans. Bankers were measuring pension liabilities using financial economic tools, but actuaries were measuring them using tools that had been developed decades earlier, and they seemed unconcerned about swings in asset values and interest rates. This prompted Gold to return to school. In 1995, at the age of 53, he enrolled at the Wharton School with the aim of (in his words) \\"improving pension actuarial practice through research and intelligent criticism\\". In 2000, with his newly earned doctorate, he became an outspoken advocate for pension actuaries to adopt a model driven by financial economics. He also pushed for the actuarial profession to improve its professionalism and write stricter standards of practice. Pension actuaries and companies and governments that sponsor pension plans had mixed reactions to Gold. Slowly, however, his ideas have gained influence. Moody's Investors Service announced in 2013 that it would no longer use actuaries' calculations of pension liabilities for government-sponsored pension plans but would instead calculate the obligations themselves. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which dictates how governmental bodies account for expenses, began requiring the use of a more market-based interest rates to measure pension liabilities.

The building was repeatedly reconstructed. The first building was built on this land plot in the 1830th years by the merchant D. Petrokokino. At the end of the 1880th years it was acquired by the landowner K.N. Komneno-Varvatsi and capitally reconstructed. To the building the extension was made, the wing in the yard is connected to the main building transition, the facade is decorated according to new architectural fashion. In the building there were 62 rooms which were occupied by Komneno-Varvatsi's family consisting of the head of family and two daughters. After the events of the first Russian revolution of 1905 the landowner Komneno-Varvatsi frightened of disorders of peasants in the manor decided to sell the huge mansion in the city.

From 1909 to 1914, the city museum with art gallery was placed in one of rooms. From 17 January to 1 February 1918, the building was occupied by Council of working deputies of Taganrog. With arrival to the city of Germans in May 1918, and then denikinsky troops, the town council returned on the place again. After returning to Soviet control, the house held the Revolutionary-military committee, from 10 January to June 1920 being principal organ of the city authorities. Then here the trade-union club, the House of workers of education, Avtomotoklub were placed.

It was built in the period of 1822-1825. Nowadays it is an object of cultural heritage. The building is located on 17/16 Oranzherejnaya Street, and faces Sobornaya Square.  History  The project of the building belonged to the architect V.P. Stasov. At the same time he was busy building the neighboring the Great Greenhouse. In 1840 there was a tavern on the first floor of the house. In 1858 the owner of the house was Alexander Ivanovich Malyshev, the merchant. The house was named after him. Later, the house belonged to the Palace Administration. The palace employees lived there. In the 1870s architectural replanning of the house was made: a new front door, a staircase and a wing along the Greenhouse street (modern address: 4 Oranzherejnaya Street) were built. During the period from 1896 to 1920 on the first floor where were seven rooms, two of which were used for the office, lived the architect of the Palace of Management Silvio Danini. Half of the second floor was reserved for the priest of the palace Znamenskaya Church. After the October Revolution the house was redeveloped. The number of apartments was increased. The building still remains residential.  Architecture  The building is valuable as an example of the town planning decision of VP Stasov for the design of the street corner. The style of the building is late classicism. It is in harmony with the appearance of the Great Greenhouse. Along the Greenhouse street, both buildings had the same type of stone fence. The house has a L-shaped form, two floors, stands on a high basement. The first floor is finished with a large rust, while the window openings are recessed deep into the wall. The second-floor windows are decorated with sandricks. The building is crowned with a cornice with modulons.

He lives in San Francisco, California. Biography Aminoff is a clinical neurologist and neurophysiologist, clinical investigator, university professor, author, and editor with a special interest in medical history. He was born and educated in England, graduating from University College London in 1962 and as a physician from University College Hospital Medical School in 1965. He subsequently trained in neurology and neurophysiology at The National Hospital (Queen Square) in London, and moved to San Francisco in 1976 where he has been Professor of Neurology since 1982 at the School of Medicine of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). He was Director of UCSF's Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratories until 2004. Aminoff currently directs UCSF's Parkinson's Disease Clinic and Research Center, a National Parkinson Foundation Center of Excellence. Aminoff has received numerous honors and awards for his work as an educator and neurologist, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine in 2006, and the 2007 A.B. Baker Award of the American Academy of Neurology for lifetime achievements and contributions to medical education. From 2004 to 2012 he was a director of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, serving as chair of the board in 2011 and in 2010 UCSF awarded him the title of Distinguished Professor. He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London as well as of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Neurological Association. He has authored many medical and scientific papers, particularly on electrophysiological studies of the nervous system in health and disease. His scientific published works earned him a Doctorate in Science, an advanced doctorate in the Faculty of Science from the University of London, in 2000. He has written or edited 40 books, including several comprehensive textbooks that have gone into numerous editions. His published works have been translated into 8 languages. He was editor-in-chief of the neuroscience journal Muscle and Nerve from 1998 to 2007, was one of the two editors-in-chief (along with Robert B. Daroff) of the four-volume Encyclopedia of the Neurological Sciences, and is one of three series editors of the multivolume Handbook of Clinical Neurology published by Elsevier. Aminoff has a longstanding interest in the history of medicine and is the author of biographies of C.E. Brown-S√©quard and Sir Charles Bell. With Larry R. Faulkner he edited a volume on the history of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. Education and career Aminoff received a bachelor of science degree from University College London (1962) and his medical degree (M.B., B.S.) from University College Hospital (UCH) Medical School (London) in 1965. After internship at UCH, he trained in internal medicine at various London teaching hospitals, gained membership of the Royal College of Physicians of London (equivalent to obtaining certification in internal medicine in the U.S.) and then trained in neurology and clinical neurophysiology at the Middlesex Hospital and the National Hospitals for Nervous Diseases (Queen Square and Maida Vale) in London. He received his M.D. degree, which in England is awarded for an advanced research thesis, for his experimental studies at the Institute of Neurology (London) on the spinal integration of various inputs to respiratory motor neurons. He subsequently moved to the University of California San Francisco, where he has held various faculty positions in the department of neurology, becoming a full professor in 1982, and was awarded the title of distinguished professor in 2010. He was certified in neurology by the American Board of Psychiatry & Neurology (ABPN) in 1982 (recertified, 2004) and received subspecialty certification in clinical neurophysiology by the ABPN when this new subspecialty was created in 1992 (recertified 2002). In 2000 the University of London awarded him a doctorate in science (a higher doctorate in the faculty of science) for his electrophysiological studies of the nervous system in health and disease. Research Aminoff is a clinical neurologist and neurophysiologist whose original contributions have been in several overlapping areas, utilizing electrophysiological techniques to investigate the functioning of the nervous system in health and disease. His work has been directed at extending the clinical applications of electrodiagnostic techniques or at providing insight into the underlying pathophysiology of various disorders. His work on different aspects of the autonomic nervous system showed involvement of sympathetic fibers in entrapment neuropathies; the importance of spinal mechanisms in the control of breathing;Aminoff MJ, Sears TA: \\"Spinal integration of segmental, cortical and breathing inputs to thoracic respiratory motoneurons. Journal of Physiology (London) 215:557-573, 1971 the nature and consequences of the dysautonomia occurring in patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease; and the nature of the involuntary motor activity that follows cessation of the cerebral circulation (syncope). His studies of the physiology of sensory discrimination and motor control showed that the discrimination-response system is organized as a parallel network rather than in the serial manner often portrayed, and he provided evidence that the long- latency stretch responses have a transcerebral pathway in humans, are under some degree of voluntary control, and relate to the organization of the discrimination-response system. His studies provided electrophysiological evidence for different types of dementia and defined their electrophysiological characteristics. Aminoff's clinical studies of spinal vascular malformations (dural arteriovenous fistulas) led to a new theory on their pathophysiology. He and his collaborators suggested that increased venous pressure reduces the intramedullary arteriovenous pressure gradient and thus blood flow, leading to spinal cord ischemia. Aminoff MJ: Spinal Angiomas. Blackwells: Oxford, 1976 This is now widely accepted and has had major implications for the treatment of these lesions. His later interest in movement disorders led him to show the utility of botulinum toxin in the treatment of various movement disorders, and then to study gene therapy in managing patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease.; Aminoff has devoted many years to medical education. As a director and chair of the American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology, of the American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and of the American Board of Psychiatry & Neurology, he was concerned with syllabus development, setting national guidelines and educational standards, and assessing competence in clinical neurophysiology and clinical neurology. He lectures frequently at regional, national and international meetings, has authored or edited numerous books on neurological science and education, and in 2003 was appointed one of the series editors of the Handbook of Clinical Neurology. His teaching contributions have led to several national awards.

In 1835 this part of the land were allocated for the construction of private residential buildings. The projects of all five houses were designed by Sebastian Cherfolio, the architect. The complex of buildings formed a single ensemble. The parcel of land No. 288a was determined to Izmailova's house, the titular counsellor. Later the owner of the house became P. P. Izmailov, the collegiate assessor, then the Timofeevs lived there. In 1914 Leonov's store of colonial produce was located in the building. In the 21st century the city's prosecutor's office functioned on the second floor.  Architecture  The house has the elements of late classicism. The house appearance is symmetrically similar to Emelianov's house. The center of composition of both houses is a double arch, harmonizing with the arches of the Catherine's Cathedral. Later the same arches was reproduced on the Gostiny Dvor's facade. The facades are crowned with wide building gables.

The film stars Red Grange, Mary McAllister, Charles Stanton Ogle, George Wilson, Ben Hendricks Jr. and Lee Shumway. The film was released on September 12, 1926, by Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). Plot Red Wade is a star high school football player who hopes to attend Claxton University and play for its decorated college football team. However, his disapproving father John wants him to quit the sport and attend Parmalee University, a school that has struggled financially and athletically, to focus on his education. On the train ride to Claxton, he meets Sally Rogers, whose brother Tex is the head football coach at Parmalee, and gets into a fight with Claxton captain Biff Wheeler that knocks him out. Upon recovering, Red is inadvertently taken to Parmalee, where he reunites with Sally and elects to stay. Although he had promised to obey his father and refuses to try out for the team, the desire to do so anyway proves to be too strong and he ultimately makes the roster. With Red in the backfield, the hapless Parmalee team wins its first game in years. Meanwhile, John gives a $100,000 endowment to Parmalee, which his good friend and university president Todd accepts. However, he discovers Red has been playing football behind his back after learning of his on-field success in a newspaper sent by his roommate Tubby. The day before the Parmalee game against Claxton, he confronts Red and threatens to withdraw his endowment if he plays. Todd urges Red to play, but the latter decides to feign drunkenness later that night, prompting Coach Rogers to bench him for the game. John, who has never watched a football game, attends the game to ensure Red is not playing. By halftime, he realizes his enjoyment for the sport and changes his mind on his orders. With Parmalee trailing 6‚Äì0 in the fourth quarter, Coach Rogers is hesitant to send Red back in, but caves out of desperation for victory. With one minute remaining, Red scores a touchdown and kicks the game-winning conversion to secure the 7‚Äì6 Parmalee win.

Later in the year, he joined the National Football League's Chicago Bears for a barnstorming tour; between games in December, agent C. C. Pyle showed off a movie check worth $300,000 as a publicity stunt. The next day, The New York Times reported the Arrow Production Company had picked up the check, though Grange revealed in his 1953 autobiography that he really only received $5,000 per week for the film. On December 11, while Grange was nursing a severe arm injury he had suffered in a game earlier in the day, the Motion Picture Owners' Association of America announced Grange's film might be barred from airing in association-operated theaters if the check bounced. Production began in June 1926, an experience Grange described as \\"the worst drudgery I'd ever experienced.\\" George Wilson, a former Washington Huskies football star who had played against Grange on various occasions during the barnstorming tour, portrayed a Claxton player in the Claxton/Parmalee game. The game, as were all football scenes, were filmed at Pomona College; due to the California summer heat and the movie taking place in the Midwest during autumn, extras as appropriately-dressed fans were not readily available. Pyle proposed promoting the climax as a genuine exhibition game with fans dressed in fall attire being granted free admission; as a result, 15,000 spectators attended the filming. Reception One Minute to Play premiered at the Rialto Square Theatre on October 4, 1926. One movie critic for the Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"If you've never seen Red Grange play football, now's your chance, for he plays it like every thing in this picture.\\" Another writer called the film \\"unquestionably the most authentic and thrilling college film ever made\\", while The Minneapolis Star Agnes Taafee praised Grange's performance and the football sequences, but criticized certain scenes like the train fight for their lack of realism. In his autobiography, Grange wrote he \\"received several congratulatory wires from the top studio brass telling me how pleased they were with my work and that in their opinion the film was one of the best they had ever produced.\\" After the film was released, FBO head Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. attempted to convince Grange to retire from football and became a full- time actor for the studio, but he declined.

It was the RAF's last major action before it dissolved. At least three armed and masked men and a woman climbed a high wall and entered the guardhouse around 1 am. The terrorists tied the 10 guards and locked them in a van near a landfill. They then brought in five cargoes with 200 kg of explosives. At 5:12 am, the explosives were detonated. The Weiterstadt prison took eight years to build and cost 250 million Marks ($155 million). It was designed to be multi-use and high-tech. The blast managed to destroy the administration building and much of its security system. At the time the prison was not holding inmates yet - they were expected by May. Over $90 million in damages was caused. The prison had to be rebuilt, which took another four years when it opened and received inmates in May 1997. Fourteen years later in 2007, using DNA analysis, detectives identified three perpetrators - Burkhard Garweg, Ernst-Volker Wilhelm Staub and Daniela Klette. Klette had already been wanted over the American embassy sniper attack in 1991. However all the three suspects are at large.

It is best known for the intense and unorthodox method of music sequencing that went into the album, as well as its unique sound achieved by its microtonal tuning system. Background and composition Islets in Pink Polypropylene was created entirely on a Roland R-8, despite its incapability of being a synthesiser, through an unorthodox and complex process that according to Manning took \\"many weeks per piece\\". While in ownership of the drum machine, he took advantage of its pitch-shifting values by mapping them out in multiples of 400, listening to sounds from a PCM sound card, and consequently making a microtonal tuning system. Manning later began to note the structure of his pieces down on graph paper, drawing each track out using the Y axis for pitch and the X axis for time, and sequencing them with the R-8, similar to how one would sequence sounds within a spectrogram. After the record was finished, Manning claims \\"that [he] finally got a chance to sleep again\\"; the making of the record resulted in him experiencing severe sleep deprivation. Critical reception Islets in Pink Polypropylene received positive reception upon release. The Wire abstractly praised the album, calling it \\"a liquidy headbox of aural shapes, whose forms hardly change yet seem to encompass infinite viscosity within them, like rainbow pools of oil on water.\\" Later, upon being reissued on 12 May 2016, it also received more positive reception. Record distributor Boomkat commented that \\"it is a friendly, memorably involving listen; you might just have to work around its more autistic elements to find a way in\\". John Twells, writing for Fact, praised the album, stating that \\"it‚Äôs refreshing to hear an all-electronic album that sounds so organic yet so totally alien.\\" In 2017, Islets in Pink Polypropylene ranked at number 41 on Pitchforks list of \\"The 50 Best IDM Albums of All Time\\". Site critic Andrew Nosnitsky wrote that the album embodied the \\"find-a-machine-and-freak-it ethos\\" of 1990s IDM music, concluding that \\"for Manning, it was as if rhythm and melody had never been distinct elements to begin with, and his fusion of the two set an early precedent for the digital signal processing abuse that would come to define IDM at the turn of the century\\".

It was described in 1921 by Marukawa. N. flemingeri used to be placed in this species, likely as a form, until it was split in 1988 by Charles B. Miller. Taxonomy and etymology N. plumchrus was originally described by Marukawa in 1921. It was eventually moved by Janet Bradford and John Jillett in 1974 from the genus Calanus to its current placement in Neocalanus. The species N. flemingeri was split out of this species in 1988, where it is considered by Charles B. Miller to have been placed as f. typica. Description N. plumchrus is considered to be a large copepod, with females generally ranging from about in length. The males are usually between about in length. Stage V copepodites usually are more than in length. The females of N. plumchrus, contrasting to those of N. flemingeri, have convex first urosomal tagma. The cephalosome length to prosome length ratio is generally over 0.44. The spermatophore deposited in females lacks any coils. In males, the ratio of cephalosome length to prosome length is usually between 0.55 and 0.56. The first antenna extends beyond the caudal rami by multiple segments. In stage V copepodites, the colouration and the second from medial caudal seta (or II bristle) can be used to distinguish this species and N. flemingeri. In N. plumchrus, there is red-orange colouration along both of the first antennae, vertical stripes of colour along the sides of the thorax, and on the caudal rami. The II bristle is about in diameter from its base, and is over three times the length of the urosome when the former is in its entirety. Distribution In the Pacific, N. plumchrus is found in the Sea of Japan, the northern Pacific, and off California. It is also found in the Arctic Ocean. Ecology =Life cycle and reproduction= The timing of reproduction in N. plumchrus is variable; in the Strait of Georgia, it breeds between December and April, whereas it breeds between July and February at Station P. In both cases, it breeds at depth, usually below around in the former, and below about in the latter case. It likely utilizes lipid stores to breed, instead of recently consumed food. After reproducing, the adults die; first the males, and then the females. Copepodite stages I through V develop in the surface waters (stages II through IV are found in the top throughout the year in waters off Japan, for example) late during the phytoplankton bloom. Stage V copepodites enter diapause at depths of below during late summer. At Station P, the number of copepodites in diapause remains about the same until September, when numbers decrease due to mortality and development into adults. This contrasts to the Strait of Georgia, where diapause is from July to January, and maturation occurs during January and February. =Feeding= N. plumchrus is, as a whole, omnivorous, although there are regional variations. In the Strait of Georgia, for example, this copepod is mainly herbivorous, whereas in the ocean, omnivory is more prevalent; this affects the composition of lipids, with oceanic samples having (likely as an adaptation to lower concentrations of food) more monounsaturated fats with 20 or 22 carbon atoms. It is able to uptake glucose directly from seawater from its dermal glands and midgut, which arthropods were thought to be incapable of due to their rigid exoskeleton.

The first house in what would become Oregon was built in 1842, a log cabin built for C.P. Mosely just east of what is now the Main Street district. The house became a tavern and a general store under I.M. Bennett. James Coville built another log house in 1843, just north of the district, and operated a shoe shop in it. A community grew there, called \\"Rome Corners.\\" A post office was added in 1848, and a frame hotel called the Oregon Exchange in 1849. In 1857 Charles Waterman had a village platted and called \\"Oregon.\\" In 1864 the Beloit and Madison Railroad reached town, making Oregon a shipping point for the surrounding country. In 1883 the village incorporated, with over 500 inhabitants. The village continued to grow, adding a flour and grist mill in 1890, the first bank in 1892, a volunteer fire-fighting company in 1895, a water tower in 1898, a creamery in 1900, a telephone exchange in 1901, and paved streets in 1916. Some of the commercial buildings from this period of expansion survive, including: * The C.E. Powers building at 115 S. Main Street was built in 1877 - a 2-story commercial vernacular brick building that still has its cast-iron columns in the street-level storefront. The top of the front wall is decorated with a brick cornice. * The Cowdrey Tailor shop at 111 S. Main was built in 1878, trimmed with Italianate brickwork. In 1911 the facade was updated to a then-modern Broadfront style. * The Howe Drug Store at 121 S. Main was built in 1880 with Italianate-styled cream brick, then updated to red and white brick in 1907, and then updated again in 1940 with an orange brick veneer. * Howe Rental at 123 S. Main was also built in 1880, in a style that matched Howe's drug store next door. Its facade was updated in 1925. * The Marvin Hardware store/Masonic Lodge at 117 South Main Street is a nicely decorated Romanesque Revival building erected in 1898, described in more detail in its own article. * The Netherwood building at 104 Janesville Street (center left in the photo above) is another two-story, cream brick, Romanesque Revival building. Like the Masonic Lodge, red brick decorations contrast with the cream brick. Above the upper windows is a pressed metal cornice and a brick parapet. * The McDermott building at 109 S. Main is a 2-story red-brick building with white stone trim above the windows and above that a corbelled parapet topped with light stone trim. It was built in 1899. * The Montgomery & Martin/Observer building at 112 Janesville St. is a 2-story commercial vernacular office building with pressed metal window hoods and a pressed metal cornice. It was built in 1899. * The Hausmann Brewing Company Saloon at 116 Janesville St. is a small commercial vernacular building erected in 1900 with the front wire-cut orange brick. * The T.H. Grady Grocery at 134 S Main is a brick Modern Broadfront-style store built in 1915. * The World War I Veterans Memorial at Janesville and Main is a nine-foot column of polished Hurricane Island granite, saved from Chicago's old city hall, and inscribed: \\"ERECTED IN HONOR OF THOSE WHO SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WAR 1914-1918.\\" It was dedicated June 10, 1920, and may be the first tribute to veterans erected after the war.
