History A plaque marking the approximate location of Teedyuscung‚Äôs death Settlement Modern-day Plains Township was originally owned and occupied by the Wanami tribe of the Delaware Native Americans. Jacob was the tribe‚Äôs leader; he lived on level ground adjacent to the Susquehanna River (near the modern-day City of Wilkes-Barre). Early white settlers named the locality ‚ÄúJacob‚Äôs Plains.‚Äù As time progressed, the settlers simply referred to it as ‚ÄúPlains.‚Äùhttp://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/plainstwp.htm Roughly two hundred settlers from the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut arrived in Plains in August 1762; they established a small village of cabins just above the mouth of Mill Creek. They returned to New England in November after planting a few acres of wheat. The Susquehanna Company returned with their families, livestock, and provisions in the spring of 1763. Massacre of 1763 During the summer of 1763, the Iroquois and Delaware came together in an attempt to form a relationship. This resulted in a deadly fire which claimed the life of the Delaware chieftain (Teedyuscung). The Iroquois charged the colonists with the crime, and the aggrieved Delaware were determined to resolve the matter. On October 15, 1763, the unsuspecting pioneers were attacked by the Delaware. Twenty or thirty were killed, several were taken prisoner, and those who were not captured fled to the mountains; they had no other choice but to return to New England. The Native Americans finally burned what was left of the English settlement.http://www.joycetice.com/articles/massacre.htm Pennamite-Yankee Wars In January 1769, a group of Pennamites (who represented Pennsylvania) took possession of the land once occupied by the Susquehanna Land Company of Connecticut. They were known as the Ogden party; they established a fort in the region. The Connecticut settlers, who learned of the Pennamite occupation of the area, returned in the spring of 1769. This resulted in the Pennamite- Yankee Wars ‚Äî a struggle between the Pennamites and the Yankees (from Connecticut). After a series of minor skirmishes, the conflict ended with the land being granted to Pennsylvania. Township status The casino‚Äôs hotel Large amounts of anthracite coal rested underneath Plains. In 1808, Henry Stark of Plains succeeded in burning anthracite coal in a grate. This was the second successful attempt in the region (after Judge Jesse Fell). This resulted in the widespread use of anthracite coal as a fuel source. Throughout the 1800s, canals and railroads were constructed to aid in the mining and transportation of coal. The mining industry in Luzerne County boomed. Farming was a major way of life in Plains prior to the mining industry. Farmland was replaced by great collieries, breakers, canals, and railroads. As a result of the growing population in Plains, it was officially made a township on November 10, 1851. Plains Township was formed from sections of Wilkes-Barre Township and Pittston Township. At the beginning of the 20th century, Luzerne County was in the midst of an economic boom. Industry, which included manufacturing and coal mining, drew thousands of immigrants (mostly from Europe) to the region. By the mid-20th century, anthracite production was declining at a fairly steady rate. Consumers were gradually switching from coal to other forms of energy (e.g., oil, gas, and electricity). The Knox Mine Disaster was the final blow to the industry. On January 22, 1959, the Susquehanna River broke through the River Slope Mine in Port Griffith, Jenkins Township (just north of Plains Township). The incident claimed twelve lives. In the following months, two of the area's largest coal companies announced a full withdrawal from the anthracite business. Thousands of jobs were lost and the mining industry never recovered in Luzerne County. In the early 21st century, Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs (along PA 315) became one of Pennsylvania's first casinos. The casino features over 2,300 slots, and live tables for blackjack, roulette, and poker. The casino opened in November 2006. In November 2013, Mohegan Sun opened a hotel (which is connected to the casino floor).

It was originally part of Plymouth Township. The Pennamite-Yankee Wars were fought in the surrounding area. Plymouth is situated in the once rich anthracite coal fields of eastern Pennsylvania. Coal was first shipped in 1807. Plymouth was incorporated as a borough in 1866. Elijah C. Wadhams was elected to be the first mayor and held office until 1869. In the past, the chief products of its manufacturing establishments included mining drilling machines, miners' squibs, silk hosiery, and lumber products. Its population peaked in 1910 at 16,996. Architecture At the beginning of the 19th century, Plymouth's primary industry was agriculture, and many of its residents were the descendants of the Connecticut Yankees who first settled the town. Its early architecture resembled that of a small New England village. However, vast anthracite coal beds lay below the surface at various depths, and by the 1850s, coal mining was the town's primary occupation, attracting a more diverse population. After the arrival of the railroad (in 1857), the town's architecture became more typical of a growing industrial center.

The population was 1,812 at the 2010 census. History Built circa 1780 Settlement Plymouth Township was formed in December 1768 by the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut; it was one of the five original townships in the Wyoming Valley. Each township was five square miles. It was eventually enlarged to include what is now Hunlock, Jackson, and Plymouth Townships.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/plytwp.htm In 1769, the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut allotted lands in Plymouth Township to forty settlers. The growth of the township's population was very slow. The first settlements were in and around present-day Plymouth Borough. The township was governed by an elected board of three men. The first mills in Plymouth Township were built in 1780. In 1834, Jameson Harvey built the first schoolhouse in the lower end of the township (near the mouth of Harveys Creek).http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/plytwp.htm Conflicts Wyoming Valley in 1778: Battlefield of Wyoming (G); Plymouth Township is visible on the left Plymouth Township in 1864; Ross Hill is visible on the right From 1769 to 1785, the Connecticut settlers in Plymouth were harassed on a regular basis by the Pennamites, Native Americans, and Tories. A series of clashes, which were part of the Revolutionary War and the Pennamite-Yankee Wars, occurred between the multiple parties. During the Revolutionary War, the settlers erected a small fortification on ‚ÄúGarrison Hill,‚Äù in the lower portion of modern-day Plymouth Borough. The fort saw action in defending the colonists from Native American raids.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/plytwp.htm Nearly fifty men from Plymouth took part in the disastrous Battle of Wyoming (in 1778). Many of the men were slain in the fight. The women and children of Plymouth Township fled down the Susquehanna River on the night of the battle. As soon as the British left the region, the settlers moved back to the township. They had to rebuild what was destroyed by the British (Tories) and Native Americans. Native American raids continued well after the battle. On November 17, 1778, John Perkins was killed in the lower end of the township. At least three settlers were killed and one was captured in March 1779. Native American raids like these continued in the coming years.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/plytwp.htm In March 1783, a massive ice flood on the Susquehanna River struck Plymouth. Nearly all the buildings on ‚ÄúGarrison Hill‚Äù were swept away. Reverend Benjamin Bidlack was carried away with his house. After being tossed around by the current and huge pieces of ice throughout the night, he managed to reach higher ground on the lower end of Shawnee Flats (in Plymouth Township). After the flood, the Pennamites were determined to expel the Connecticut settlers from the territory. The colonists were driven from their homes by soldiers. Several of the Connecticut settlers died along the journey.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/plytwp.htm This cruel act aroused empathy amongst the people of Pennsylvania in favor of the Connecticut settlers. The authorities of the state directed for the settlers to repossess their lands. The settlers gradually moved back to the Wyoming Valley. However, before reentering the valley, they halted on the mountains overlooking Wilkes- Barre. They sent forward a small group of men to see if it were safe to reenter the valley. Alexander Patterson, the civil magistrate of Wilkes-Barre, detained the men, who were then beaten with iron ramrods. Despite these actions, the settlers proceeded cautiously to their homes. Once the settlers returned home, Patterson's men attacked. The skirmish occurred on the western slope of Ross Hill. It's believed that at least two settlers were killed in the struggle. The enraged settlers placed themselves under the command of John Franklin to avenge the deaths of their fellow colonists. After marching through the countryside, they successfully cleared the territory of any hostile threats.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/plytwp.htm Plunkett's Battle occurred along the riverbank of the Susquehanna (above the mouth of Harveys Creek) on December 4, 1785; it was part of the Pennamite-Yankee Wars. Plymouth provided most of the soldiers (who were under the command of Colonel Butler). The number of casualties from the battle are unknown, but it's believed that at least three men were killed in the skirmish.http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/plytwp.htm Coal mining Aftermath of the Avondale Mine Disaster Anthracite coal basin (shown in dark grey) below Plymouth Township's surface, 1858 About 1806, Abijah Smith came to Plymouth from Derby, Connecticut, intending to mine, ship, and sell coal. Smith and his business partner, Lewis Hepburn, bought a 75-acre plot (called Lots 45 and 46) on the east side of Coal Creek. In the fall of 1807, Smith floated an ark down the Susquehanna River loaded with about fifty tons of anthracite coal; it was shipped to Columbia in Lancaster County.Baltimore Patriot, May 12, 1830. As time progressed, additional coal mines and collieries were constructed throughout the township. Railroads and canals were also constructed to aid in the transportation of coal. Coal mining remained the chief industry in Plymouth Township well into the 20th century.. The Avondale Mine disaster was a massive fire in Avondale, an unincorporated community in Plymouth Township, on September 6, 1869. It caused the death of 110 workers. It started when the wooden lining of the mine shaft caught fire and ignited the coal breaker built directly overhead. The shaft was the only entrance and exit to the mine, and the fire trapped and suffocated 108 of the workers (the other two fatalities were rescuers). It was the greatest mine disaster at that point in Pennsylvania history.Ballard C. Campbell, ed. American Disasters: 201 Calamities That Shook the Nation (2008) pp 122-23BrainyHistory September 6 in History On February 9, 1935, the Glen Alden Coal Company began to dismantle and demolish the Avondale breaker and to close the mine.Sunday Independent, February 10, 1935, In 1936, no coal was produced. However, in December 1940, Glen Alden Coal Company resumed mining on a limited scale taking coal to the Lance Breaker to be processed.Sunday Independent, December 29, 1940.

Five mountains ‚Äî Newport, Knob, Lee, River, and Rocky ‚Äî encircle the creek and borough. History=Early history Shickshinny along the Susquehanna River In 1782, the families of Austin and Crossley were the first white settlers in Shickshinny. The first permanent settler in the area was Ralph Austin. At this time, Shickshinny was under the jurisdiction of Connecticut.\\"The Founding of the Shickshinny Borough\\", undated. Suburban News article posted on the website of the Historical and Preservation Society of the Greater Shickshinny Area In 1801, Shadrick Austin bought the of land. Another known settler in the area was William Koons (in the 1850s). Koons settled one mile outside of Shickshinny (where the Shickshinny Creek Bridge was later erected). The name of the area was changed to Koonsville (where the post office was later built). In 1773, Nathan Beach, also from Connecticut, settled outside of modern-day Shickshinny. The area was named Beach Haven after him. A farm, which encompassed nearly the entire current-day borough, was established by Matthias Hollenback. By this time, it was under the Pennsylvania claim. The land was later inherited by his daughter, Cist Hollenback, who married Chester Butler. In 1857, upon C. Hollenbeck's death, the land was divided and sold to the proprietors of the Shickshinny Company: George W. Search, Lot Search, Nathan Beach Crary, and Nathan Garrison. Walter Garrison bought the corner where the modern-day bank is located. Lot Search held the position of Luzerne County treasurer in 1855 and maintained it for two years. N. Garrison and Andrew J. Eldon built the first store, located outside the old storehouse, in June 1857. But a few months after the store opened, Eldon fled to China with $3,000 of Garrison's money. It was reported that Eldon was lost in a storm at sea and drowned from the weight of gold in his pockets. The business soon closed and was bought by Nathan B. Crary. A drug store opened at the same time. It was run and managed by Stephen Bond. Borough Union Street in Shickshinny Shickshinny was incorporated as a borough on November 30, 1861. It gained its independence from Salem Township and Union Township, the majority (two-thirds) being from Union. The first officers were Burgess and Enke. The council was composed of Search, Koons, Crary, Nicely, and Davenport. G. W. Search became the secretary, while Slippy became supervisor. Second was Burgess, third Knor, fourth Youlls, fifth Bear, sixth Post, seventh Hughes, eight Hartman, and ninth Bulkley. Many businesses sprung up in the next decade, including a flour mill (set up by G. W. and Lot Search in 1865), a foundry (set up by Jesse Beadle, L. T. Hartman, and Frederick Beach in 1866), and a planing mill (set up by Amos Hess in 1874). Two blacksmith shops were also built and run by Miner Brown and Henry Wagner. The first newspaper in the area, The Mountain Echo, was first issued in 1873, established by C. A. Boone and M. E. Walker. Shickshinny became a central hub for many farmers and businesses. A toll bridge was built in 1865 to Mocanaqua, the first of three up to 1920. An 1877 turnpike was built along the creek, heading towards Huntington Mills (modern- day Route 239). Coal mining Bridge across the Susquehanna River (Shickshinny, Luzerne County) Shickshinny is located at the lower end of the Wyoming Valley Coal Deposit, near a Red Ash vein that runs across the Susquehanna River. Humphrey Davenport was employed in 1830 to prospect Nathan Beach's land. He soon discovered coal on Rocky Mountain. For the next decade, coal was extracted from the mountain by teams of men. Finally in 1840, Beach's grandson, Dr. Darwin Crary, invented the first inclined chute, which was used by the coal industry. It sent coal to the canal down the mountain. Two years later, in 1842, James A. Gordon built a plane for Beach and Crary. It ran for several successful years. The mines were passed over to Truman H. Clark. In 1865, during the last year of the American Civil War, John M. Stackhouse and Matthew Wier purchased the mines. Cyrus Stackhouse bought out Wier's stock the following year. Again, in 1869, the mines exchanged hands and were bought by the Paxton Coal Company. The Salem Coal Company was formed four years later. Under their guidance, the mines produced 65,000 tons and employed just short of 200 men and boys. A nearby mountain ‚Äî Newport ‚Äî provided coal as well. It sits on the opposite side of the Susquehanna River and was found to possess superior coal. In 1857, roads and bridges were built to connect the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad, which lay on opposite sides of the river, so as to be able to mine Newport Mountain. Neither the Shickshinny nor Mocanaqua mines are in service today.

Coal mining was the chief industry in and around Swoyersville for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. The mines ceased production in the 1950s (after the Knox Mine Disaster). However, work continued at the colliery on Main Street (in Swoyersville) well into the 1960s. In 1972, the town was severely flooded by the Susquehanna River as a result of Hurricane Agnes. At the time, there was great concern that many of the flooded abandoned mine tunnels ‚Äî running underneath Swoyersville ‚Äî would cave-in. However, the cave-ins never occurred.

It is located along the Lehigh River. The population was 1,097 at the 2010 census. History=Establishment White Haven was created in 1824 by industrialist Josiah White. It was later incorporated as a borough in 1842. Coal mining and railroads A caboose in White Haven Early European explorers to the Wyoming Valley encountered a new form of coal ‚Äî anthracite ‚Äî that was abundant throughout the region. At the time, anthracite was a valuable commodity without a good use. It wasn‚Äôt until February 11, 1808, when Wilkes-Barre Judge Jesse Fell created the first iron grate in the valley to successfully burn anthracite. This invention increased the popularity of anthracite as a fuel source. This led to the expansion of the coal industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Throughout the 1800s, canals and railroads were constructed to aid in the mining and transportation of coal. The County of Luzerne witnessed a population boom with the expansion of the coal mining industry. The Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company chartered the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad on March 31, 1837, in order to link Wilkes-Barre to White Haven. Construction of the railroad began in 1839 and was completed in the 1840s. The arduous route required the construction of a tunnel and three inclined planes, which included the famed Ashley Planes. With the completion of the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad, the canal industry, which had existed for no more than one generation, faced a rapid extinction. The Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad moved Wyoming Valley anthracite from its various coal fields to White Haven; over the Appalachian Mountains that had posed such a challenge to settlers for 150 years. Once the L&SR; reached White Haven, an extensive transportation network expeditiously and economically delivered the Wyoming Valley‚Äôs ‚Äúblack diamonds‚Äù to a waiting market. By 1867, the Lehigh Valley Railroad, which was first established in the Hazleton area‚Äôs coal fields, was linked to Wilkes- Barre, and then in 1869, the Lehigh Valley Railroad was connected to other rail systems in New York State.

In 1798, Conrad Wickeiser was the first settler in the region. He was followed by James Wright, who established the first tavern and sawmill in the locality. Logging was one of the chief industries in the region at the time. Wickeiser and Wright settled in what is now Fairview Township (once part of Wright Township). In what is now Wright Township, the first settler was probably Cornelius Garrison in the 1830s. He erected a sawmill on Big Wapwallopen Creek in the southwestern portion of the township.

Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 576 The State of Wyoming is either named after this borough or the surrounding valley. History Village of Wyoming Early history By the 1700s, the Wyoming Valley was inhabited by several Native American tribes (including the Susquehannock and the Delaware). In the mid-18th century, Connecticut settlers ventured into the valley. These were the first recorded Europeans in the region. In 1768, the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut devised a plan to divide the Wyoming Valley into five townships. Each township was to be divided amongst forty settlers. Wyoming was originally part of Kingston Township. Wyoming Massacre On June 30, 1778, British (Tory) forces, under the command of Colonel John Butler, arrived in the Wyoming Valley to confront the American settlers. On July 1, the American militia at Fort Wintermute (Wintermoot) and Fort Jenkins (a Patriot stockade in present-day West Pittston) surrendered. On July 3, the British spotted the American militia near Forty Fort. Butler wanted to lure the Americans away from their fortifications. He ordered for Fort Wintermute to be set ablaze. The Patriots, believing it signified a British retreat, advanced rapidly. British soldiers, with the assistance of about 700 Native Americans, ambushed the oncoming American militia in and around the present- day Exeter and Wyoming. In the end, nearly 300 Wyoming Valley settlers were killed in what would be known as the Wyoming Massacre. On July 4, the American colonel, Nathan Denison, agreed to surrender Forty Fort along with several other posts. Wyoming Monument Today, in the Borough of Wyoming, a monument marks the gravesite of the victims from the battle; it was constructed in the early 1830s. An annual observance, sponsored by the Wyoming Commemorative Association, takes place at the obelisk grounds to honor the fallen heroes of this Revolutionary War battle. The monument has also been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Along with the Wyoming Monument, the Luzerne Presbyterial Institute and Swetland Homestead are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 904 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Anthony Township was formed from part of Lycoming Township on September 7, 1844, by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. It is named in honor of Joseph B. Anthony who was a judge in Lycoming County at the time. When colonial settlers first arrived in what is now Anthony Township they were outside the western boundary of what was then the Province of Pennsylvania. These settlers were not under the jurisdiction or protection of any type from any of the Thirteen Colonies. They became known as the Fair Play Men. These men established their own form of government, known as the \\"Fair Play System\\", with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776, beneath the \\"Tiadaghton Elm\\" on the banks of Pine Creek. A German Baptist congregation was incorporated on February 8, 1879, under the title of the \\"German Baptist Church of Anthony Township\\". It was one of the first German Baptist churches founded in America along with two other churches in Lycoming County, one on Blooming Grove Road north of Williamsport and the other in Fairfield Township near Montoursville. These churches were more commonly known as the Dunker or Dunkard Churches for their practice of immersing believers three times, once each in the names of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

The population was 717 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The first European settlers arrived in Armstrong Township in 1773. Thomas Hartley, Michael Graybill, George Leffler, and John Kern all received warrants for land on February 11, 1773. Hartley then purchased the properties of Graybill, Leffler and Kern on March 31, 1773. This was to avoid a Province of Pennsylvania law that stated that no one man could purchase more than one tract of land. Marcus Huling appears to have been the first permanent settler in Mosquito Valley, which makes up the greatest portion of Armstrong Township. Huling settled in the eastern portion of Mosquito Valley, near where Culbertson's Path crossed. Huling and family cleared land, built a cabin, a sawmill, and distillery in 1795. Huling's son, Thomas, carried on the family businesses until his death. Although the Huling's were apparently successful businessmen, they never saw fit to settle their debt on the land that they had developed. Upon Thomas Huling's death, the land was foreclosed and was left to be reclaimed by nature until the arrival of German farmers in 1832. Armstrong Township was formed from part of Clinton Township in 1842. It is named in honor of James Armstrong, a prominent lawyer. Mosquito Valley was cleared by the lumber companies that made nearby Williamsport the \\"Lumber Capital of the World.\\" Lumberjacks harvested the old-growth forests of white pine and hemlock. They then floated the logs down Mosquito Run to the sawmills close to the mouth of the creek. As the valley was cleared of trees, farmers moved into the area and began several successful orchard and dairy operations. Armstrong Township is not limited to Mosquito Valley alone. Bald Eagle Mountain runs through the northernmost portions of it. From this ridge, several mountain streams find their source. The lumber barons from Williamsport flocked to Mosquito Run in the south and western sections of the township and to Hagerman's Run in the eastern portion of the township. The barons built summer cottages on both streams, fished for trout in the waters, and built small dams for recreational swimming and ice skating. They also built several trout hatcheries in Mosquito Valley. The Williamsport Municipal Water Authority quickly saw the value of the fresh water that was in abundant supply in both Mosquito and Hagerman's Runs. It acquired water rights to the streams and eventually bought up most of the farmland in the southwestern portion of Armstrong Township in the early 1920s as part of its watershed. Visitors to the \\"water company\\" lands can see the stone remains of the early settlers homesteads spread throughout the watershed. This mass purchase of farmland in Armstrong County has accounted for the steep decline in population since 1890. Mosquito Run and Hagerman's Run still provide drinking water for Williamsport. The water authority built a multimillion-dollar water filtration plant in the 1990s in Mosquito Valley. With the construction of this plant the lands of the water authority were opened as a nature preserve to the general public.

The population was 111 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Brown Township, named for a Major General Jacob Brown of the War of 1812, was formed on May 3, 1815, by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania from parts of Mifflin and Pine Townships. Pine Creek divides the township, nearly in half and it is the center of history in Brown Township. Pine Creek was a major waterway in the settlement of north central Pennsylvania and in the lumber era that swept through Pennsylvania in the mid-to-late 19th century. Early pioneers were attracted to its remoteness and abundance of fish and game. Jacob Lamb, formerly of Milton was the first documented settler to the area. He arrived in late 1794 by paddling with his family and household supplies in ten canoes, up the West Branch Susquehanna River and Pine Creek to the mouth of Slate Run. Here, Lamb built his home. Jacob Lamb also constructed the first saw and gristmills in the area. Pioneer settler Jacob Tomb and his family established a home, sawmill, and gristmill at the mouth of Slate Run in the 1790s, and others settled nearby along the Pine Creek floodplain. By 1855, the village had a post office, general store, hotel, and two churches. Driving the local economy toward the end of the century was the James B. Weed and Company hemlock sawmill, which operated in Slate Run from 1886 to 1910 and produced up to 100,000 board feet of lumber a day. After the end of the lumber era, the mill closed, and the village declined in size. However, in the early 21st century, Slate Run still has a general store and post office, and a hotel with a restaurant and bar. Over the years Brown Township grew slowly, but it never gained a large population. It is largely a remote area, covered with mountains and a thriving second growth forest. It is popular today with outdoor recreation enthusiasts. The population was 885 by the 1890 census and declined to 111 people by the 2000 census.

It is named for the series of waterfalls or cascades that are abundant in the many mountain streams of Cascade Township. Many of the early settlers in Cascade Township were Irish Catholics. Under the leadership of Michael Kelly they established the village of Kellyburg in one of the most remote parts of Lycoming County.

The population was 3,947 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Clinton Township was formed from part of Washington Township by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania during its December 1825 session. It was named for Governor DeWitt Clinton of New York. One of the most prominent physical features in Clinton Township is Penny Hill. This hill which is in the eastern portion of the township was named for a dog named Penny. Penny was apparently fond of wandering up and down the hill during the late 1780s and early 1790s. She was owned by a man named David Tolbert. Tolbert's dog was seen so often on the hill that the residents of the area began to call it Penny Hill. Today Penny Hill is bisected by U.S. Route 15. It overlooks West Branch Susquehanna River and is covered by a number of family residences and several small farms. The first permanent settlers to Clinton Township arrived just before the beginning of the American Revolution. They cleared the land that surrounds Black Hole Creek in the valley between Bald Eagle Mountain and Penny Hill. During the war, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Battle of Wyoming in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the \\"Big Runaway\\" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the \\"Little Runaway\\". Sullivan's Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. Following the war the pioneers returned to Clinton Township and reestablished their homesteads. By this time most of the Native Americans had either been killed off or fled to the west. The settlers encountered some struggles over the years, most notably in the winter of 1787. This winter was especially harsh in Clinton Township. Nearly all the livestock was either frozen to death or they died of starvation. The supplies of food stored after the harvest were quickly depleted and the people began to starve. Hunters struggled through the deep snow. Even those that were able to use snowshoes to walk on top of the snow struggled to find any game, which also struggled to survive the harsh winter. When the winter finally broke the residents were able to harvest tremendous amounts of shad in Black Hole Creek and in the West Branch Susquehanna River with a seine that was delivered to them by the father-in-law of Major Ten Brook, Mr. Emmons. Mr. Emmons arrived from New Jersey with additional supplies including salt, wheat, corn, and garden seeds. He is credited with saving the lives of many of the early residents of Clinton Township. Emmons returned again in 1788 with another wagon load of supplies, while camping he was killed by a tree that fell on the wagon where he was sleeping. Eagle Grange No. 1 in Clinton Township was organized on March 4, 1871 by a group of rural farmers who had become concerned about the rising costs of farming in the post Civil War economy. It was the first grange to be organized in Pennsylvania, two years before the formation of the Pennsylvania State Grange and four years after The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, better known as the National Grange was founded in Fredonia, New York by Oliver Hudson Kelley. The chief objectives of the Eagle Grange No. 1 were the establishment of a co-operative purchasing program for farmers, the lowering of railroad rates, and the establishment of rural free delivery by the United States Postal Service. The Grange was one of the first national organizations to give equal status to female members.

It flows west-southwest through the village of Cogan House, and then under the Cogan House Covered Bridge. The bridge is also known as the \\"Buckhorn Covered Bridge\\" (for a nearby mountain and vanished village) or the \\"Larrys Creek Covered Bridge\\" (for the creek it crosses). A petition from the citizens of Cogan House Township for a bridge to be built was filed on September 4, 1876.

Larrys Creek was vitally important to the economic development of Cogan House Township. During the height of the lumber era that swept through Pennsylvania in the mid-to-late 19th century, Larrys Creek was used to float logs from the hills of the township to the lumber industry in nearby Williamsport on the West Branch Susquehanna River. The township is named for David Cogan, a pioneer who settled on Larrys Creek in 1825. Cogan was one of the few settlers in the area for many years, but wearying of his isolation, he left his homestead in 1842, as did a neighbor named Carter. Cogan's and Carter's houses were used by hunters and travellers. The name Cogan's House was given to the area, hence the name, Cogan House.

The population was 355 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. Cummings Township is home to two of the 120 Pennsylvania state parks, Little Pine State Park and Upper Pine Bottom State Park. History Cummings Township was formed in 1832 from parts of Mifflin and Brown Townships. It was named for John Cummings who was an associate judge in the local court system at the time. Early industry in the county included quarries of flag and building stone and lumber. The Little Pine and Pine Valleys in Cummings Township were used by the Iroquois and Algonkian tribes as a hunting ground. Historians believe that there may have been a Shawnee village and burial ground just to the north of Little Pine State Park on Little Pine Creek. By the mid 19th century the demand for lumber reached Upper Pine Bottom area, where White pine and hemlock covered the surrounding mountainsides. Lumbermen came and harvested the trees and sent them down Pine Creek to the West Branch Susquehanna River to the Susquehanna Boom and sawmills at Williamsport. James and John English were the first to build a sawmill in the area in the Little Pine Area. They built two sawmills in 1809 on Little Pine Creek. In 1816, the village of English Mills sprang up around the two sawmills. The lumber era at Little Pine lasted until 1909, when the last log raft was floated down Little Pine Creek. Remnants of the lumber era can be seen today in and around the park. Waterville is the most significant population center in Cummings Township. Michael and Henry Wolf arrived in the area from Berks County in 1817. They helped to establish Waterville by building a sawmill and clearing some land for farming. A post office was established in Waterville in 1849. Other early business establishments were two stores and a hotel, which stands today. Tiadaghton State Forest lands were acquired by the state by the early 1900s. The site which became the park was \\"Upper Pine Bottom Class B Public Campground\\" by 1924 (Class B Public Campgrounds were on secondary highways and had a lean-to shelter for camping). During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a pavilion at the site in 1936, but it is no longer extant.

She became a part of the Indian nationalist movement and became a follower of Mahatma Gandhi and his idea of swaraj. She was appointed the President of the Indian National Congress in 1925 and later became the Governor of the United Provinces in 1947, becoming the first woman to hold the office of Governor in the Dominion of India. Naidu's poetry includes both children's poems and others written on more serious themes including patriotism, romance, and tragedy. Published in 1912, \\"In the Bazaars of Hyderabad\\" remains one of her most popular poems. She was married to Govindarajulu Naidu, a general physician, and had five children with him. She died of a cardiac arrest on 2 March 1949. Personal life  Sarojini Naidu was born in Hyderabad to Aghorenath Chattopadhyay, a Bengali Brahmin who was the principal of the Nizam's College in Hyderabad. Her parental home was at Brahmangaon in Bikrampur (in present-day Bangladesh). Her father, Aghorenath Chattopadhyay, with a doctorate of Science from Edinburgh University, settled in Hyderabad, where he administered Hyderabad college, which later became Nizam College in Hyderabad. Her mother, Barada Sundari Devi Chattopadhyay, was a poet and used to write poetry in Bengali. Sarojini Naidu in 1912 She was the eldest of the eight siblings. Her brother Virendranath Chattopadhyay was a revolutionary, and another brother Harindranath was a poet, a dramatist, and an actor. Their family was well-regarded in Hyderabad, not only for leading the Nizam College of Hyderabad but also as Hyderabad's most famous artists at that time. Being an artist in the era of British rule in India was considered a risky career, yet with their progressive values, they pursued them anyway. Education Sarojini Naidu, having passed her matriculation examination from the University of Madras, took four-year break from her studies. In 1895, H.E.H. the Nizam's Charitable Trust founded by the 6thNizam, Mahbub Ali Khan gave her a chance to study in England, first at King's College, London and later at Girton College, Cambridge.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/nizams-kin-pulls- out-firmans-showing-last-rulers-generosity/articleshow/67416257.cms Marriage Sarojini met Paidipati Govindarajulu Naidu - a physician, at the age of 19, after finishing her studies, she married him. At that time, Inter-caste marriages were not as common as they are today, but both their families approved their marriage. As Sarojini was from Bengal, while Paidipati Naidu was from Andhra Pradesh, this was an inter-regional marriage of East and South India, with two different cultures. The couple had five children. Their daughter Paidipati Padmaja also joined the independence movement and was part of the Quit India Movement. She was appointed the Governor of the State of Uttar Pradesh soon after Indian independence. Political career=Early work Sarojini Naidu (extreme right) with Mahatma Gandhi during Salt Satyagraha, 1930 Naidu joined the Indian independence movement in the wake of partition of Bengal in 1905. She soon met other such leaders as Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi and was inspired to work towards attaining freedom from the colonial regime and social reform. Between 1915 and 1918, Naidu travelled to different regions in India delivering lectures on social welfare, emancipation of women and nationalism. She also helped to establish the Women's Indian Association (WIA) in 1917. Later in 1917, Naidu also accompanied her colleague Annie Besant, who was the president of Home Rule League and Women's Indian Association, to present the advocate universal suffrage in front of the Joint Select Committee in London, United Kingdom. Naidu again went to London in 1919 as a part of the All India Home Rule League as a part of her continued efforts to advocate for freedom from the British rule. Upon return to India in 1920, she joined Gandhi's Satyagraha Movement. Congress president and increased involvement in the Independence movement Naidu presided over the 1925 Annual Session of the Indian National Congress at Cawnpore (now Kanpur). She was the first Indian woman and second woman overall (after Annie Besant) to do so. Naidu said in her address, \\"In the battle for liberty, fear is one unforgivable treachery and despair, the one unforgivable sin\\". Sarojini Naidu plants a tree in Mehrauli, Delhi. Naidu also presided over East African and Indian Congress' 1929 session in South Africa. Naidu was arrested, along with other Congress leaders including Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Madan Mohan Malaviya for participating in 1930 Salt March. The Indian National Congress decided to stay away from the First Round Table Conference that took place in London owing to the arrests. In 1931, however, Naidu and other leaders of the Congress party participated in the Second Round table Conference headed by Viceroy Lord Irwin in the wake of the Gandhi-Irwin pact. Naidu was one of the major figures to have led the Civil Disobedience Movement and the Quit India Movement led by Gandhi. She faced repeated arrests by the British authorities during the time and even spent over 21 months in jail. Governor of United Provinces Following India's independence from the British rule in 1947, Naidu was appointed as the governor of the United Provinces (present-day Uttar Pradesh), making her India's first woman governor. She remained in office until her death in March 1949. Writing career Naidu began writing at the age of 12. Her play, Maher Muneer, written in Persian, impressed the Nizam of Kingdom of Hyderabad. In 1905, her first collection of poems, named The Golden Threshold was published. The volume bore an introduction by Arthur Symons. Her poems were admired by prominent Indian politicians like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and at least one was set to music by American composer Helen Searles Westbrook. Naidu poem \\"In the Bazaars of Hyderabad\\" was published as a part of The Bird of Time with her other poems in 1912. \\"In the Bazaars of Hyderabad\\" was well received by critics, who variously noted Naidu's visceral use of rich sensory images in her writing. The Feather of The Dawn which contained poems written in 1927 by Naidu was edited and published posthumously in 1961 by her daughter Padmaja Naidu. Moreover her poem The Gift of India is also noteworthy for its patriotism and the actual environment of the 1915 India If You Call Me is a short poem describing the intense feeling of love and the beloveds full hearted devotion to her lover. Death and legacy The ashes of Sarojini Naidu kept at Golden Threshold, Hyderabad before immersion Naidu died of cardiac arrest at 3:30 p.m. (IST) on 2 March 1949 at the Government House in Lucknow. Upon her return from New Delhi on 15 February, she was advised to rest by her doctors, and all official engagements were canceled. Her health deteriorated substantially and bloodletting was performed on the night of 1 March after she complained of severe headache. She died after collapsing following a fit of cough. Naidu was said to have asked the nurse attending to her to sing to her at about 10:40 p.m. (IST) which put her to sleep. The last rites were performed at the Gomati River. Analyzing her political legacy, English writer and philosopher Aldous Huxley wrote, \\"It has been our good fortune, while in Bombay, to meet Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, the newly elected President of the All-India Congress and a woman who combines in the most remarkable way great intellectual power with charm, sweetness with courageous energy, a wide culture with originality, and earnestness with humor. If all Indian politicians are like Mrs. Naidu, then the country is fortunate indeed.\\"Huxley, Aldous (1926). Jesting Pilate: Travels Through India, Burma, Malaya, Japan, China, and America. Paragon House, New York. p. 22.  Golden Threshold  Golden Threshold in 2015 The Golden Threshold is an off-campus annex of University of Hyderabad. The building was the residence of Naidu's father Aghornath Chattopadhyay, the first Principal of Hyderabad College. It was named after Naidu's very first collection of poetry. Golden Threshold now houses Sarojini Naidu School of Arts & Communication of University of Hyderabad. During the Chattopadhyay family's residence, it was the center of many reformist ideas in Hyderabad, in areas ranging from marriage, education, women's. empowerment, literature, and nationalism. Specifically, the reformist ideas included more power for women in a time where politics in India, especially regional politics, was dominated by men. It also included ideas for involvement for women in the arts field. There were also many restrictions on marriage during this time period that persist to this day, such as inter- regional and inter-caste marriages. These ideas were progressive for the era, but brought a change in India in slow ways over time.

It was released on March 27, 1985, through Mercury Records. The album's title was a reference to the supposed melting point of rock, equivalent to 4313¬∞ Celsius; as the Fahrenheit scale is mainly used only in the United States, 7800¬∞ Fahrenheit thus suggested \\"American hot rock.\\" The album introduced the classic 1980s Bon Jovi logo that would later be used on Slippery When Wet and New Jersey. 7800¬∞ Fahrenheit remained charted for 104 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 19, 1987. The singles \\"Only Lonely\\" and \\"In and Out of Love\\" both charted on the Billboard Hot 100. Background Recorded in six weeks between January and March 1985, at the Warehouse Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the album marked the final collaboration between Bon Jovi and producer Lance Quinn. It is the only Bon Jovi album to feature songwriting by four of the band members; \\"Secret Dreams\\" is the only Bon Jovi song to date for which drummer Tico Torres receives a writing credit. Despite being a fan favorite, the band was unsatisfied with the sound of the album and essentially disowned it once they had solidified their status as worldwide superstars with Slippery When Wet and New Jersey.

The population was 1,205 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Duboistown (pronounced 'doo-BOYS town') is named for its founders John and Mathias DuBois who bought of land between 1852 and 1857. The DuBois brothers divided their land into parcels and established the village that bears their name. John DuBois left the West Branch Susquehanna Valley before Duboistown was established as a borough. He sold his business interests and moved west to Clearfield County. He became quite wealthy and the city of DuBois was named in his honor. The town built by the DuBois brothers and established as a borough in 1878 is by no means the beginning of the history of Duboistown. It is situated at the mouth of Mosquito Run on the banks of the West Branch Susquehanna River. A tribe of Susquehannock Indians had what appears to have been a fairly major settlement at the mouth of the creek. The early European settlers found the remains of an Indian village there. Arhaeologic evidence of earthenware, soapstone ware, pestles, hatchets, ornaments and charms were found on the land that is across the river from Lycoming Creek and near where the Sheshequin Path crossed the river. The land on which Duboistown is located was first surveyed in 1769. At the time it was known as \\"Walnut Bottom\\" for the vast stands of black walnut that covered the alluvial plain on which the borough now stands. Samuel Boone, cousin of Daniel Boone, held the first warrant for land at Walnut Bottom. Andrew Culbertson was one of the first settlers to have success in the Duboistown area. He purchased several tracts of land beginning in 1773, including the parcel owned by Samuel Boone, near the mouth of Mosquito Run. Culbertson is thought to have moved into the area by crossing an Indian Trail over White Deer Mountain that is now known as Culbertson's Path. He built a sawmill at the mouth of the creek soon after moving to the area, and he lived in the area for several years before being forced to flee during the American Revolutionary War, when settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and their Indian allies. After the Battle of Wyoming in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the \\"Big Runaway\\" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Settlers abandoned their homes and fields, drove their livestock south, and towed their possessions on rafts on the river to Sunbury. Their abandoned property was burned by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the \\"Little Runaway\\". Culbertson returned to the area and rebuilt his sawmill. He also built a gristmill, distillery, and a press that extracted nut and linseed oils. His gristmill was especially important to the development of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. It was easily accessible from canoe. Farmers could float their grain in their canoes or other watercraft right up to the mill. Other farmers from the surrounding valleys reached his mill via Culbertson's Path. Culbertson saw another business opportunity with the farmers who were coming to his mill. He quickly built a tavern in which the weary farmers could enjoy a drink and get some food while they waited for their grain to be ground into flour. This tavern became a popular destination for the young people of the West Branch Valley. Today Culbertson's Mill and tavern are long gone and the area is a largely overgrown riverbank with an abandoned softball field, that is surrounded by a railroad, bridge, and woods. The 200 block of Summer Street in Duboistown is decorated for Christmas each December and is known as Candy Cane Lane. In 2007, the mayor of the borough proclaimed the month of \\"December as Candy Cane Lane month forever more in DuBoistown\\". Geography Duboistown is located at (41.225278, -77.034953). It is bordered by South Williamsport to the east, Armstrong Township to the south and west, and the West Branch Susquehanna River to the north (with Williamsport north of the river).

The population was 2,178 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The unincorporated village of Warrensville is located in Eldred Township. History=Formation and Early Settlement Eldred Township is one of the smallest townships in Lycoming County. A petition was filed proposing the formation of the new township from Hepburn Township in 1858. The court directed an election to be held at Warrensville, on October 12, 1858. The question of division was hotly contested, resulting in 109 votes for to 91 against the proposition. On the November 16, 1858, Judge Jordan made a decree erecting the township, and it was named Eldred, in honor of C. D. Eldred, who was then an associate on the bench. The first white settlers in Eldred Township were mostly Quakers, attracted by the land speculations of Robert Morris, and others in Muncy Township. Among these settlers were the Winners, Wilsons, and Marshalls. The neighborhood of their settlement is now known by the title of \\"Quaker Hill.\\" In 1892, in the northern part of the township, David Kiess & Brother owned and ran a sawmill; J. W. Milnor, Sr., also had one in the same section and in the southeastern part of the township there was one run by C. D. Heim. All these mills were located on and fed by Mill Creek. There were two gristmills in Warrensville: one, owned by J. K. Crawford, was run by water; the other, owned by C. Aderhold, had steam and water both. Warrensville Warrensville is the only village in the township. The story of the origin of its name is as follows: In 1842, when there was talk of applying for a postoffice, several persons met in the store of John Hoffman, on Mill creek, and the question Warrensville, in honor of General Warren, was proposed, of a name came up. while others suggested Livingston. A vote was taken and Warrensville carried. The postoffice was established July 25, 1842, named Warrensville, and Samuel Torbert was appointed postmaster. The land on which Warrensville stands was cleared in 1802 by Samuel Carpenter. He erected a grist and saw mill and carding machine, which were the first improvements of the kind in the settlement. They proved of great service to the early settlers. These original works have long since passed out of existence. The village of Warrensville was laid out in 1841 by John Weisel, but never has been incorporated. In 1892 it contained two stores and one Temperance Hotel, kept by Isaac M. Else, as well as a tannery, carried on by E. W. Lundy, two wagon makers and two blacksmith shops.

The population was 2,659 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The exact date of the formation of Fairfield Township is not known, but court records point to sometime between August 1825 and December 1826. A petition for the division of Muncy Township was read in court in August 1825. Historical records do not record when the township was formed, but court documents cite Fairfield Township as the residence of a defendant in a lawsuit in a Columbia County court session in 1826. John Andrew Shulze retired to Fairfield Township following his 1823-1829 term as governor of Pennsylvania. Shulze bought in western Fairfield Township, now part of Montoursville for $12,000. His plan was to spend his retirement farming in the West Branch Susquehanna Valley. Shulze quickly made am impact in Fairfield Township. He built a brick house on his farm and donated an acre of land for the construction of Union Church which was shared by the Lutheran and Presbyterian congregations of Montoursville and Fairfield Township. Ultimately Shulze's time in Fairfield Township can be described as a sad failure. His repeated attempts at farming were unsuccessful. He also lost a lawsuit filed by William Cameron of Lewisburg for $3,835.49. Shulze was apparently unable to pay the suit and his property was seized and sold to pay his debt.

Another portion of Franklin Township was cut away in 1828 to form Penn Township. The earliest settlers to Franklin Township were farmers. They arrived in the early 19th century and cleared the hills and valleys. Many of the farms established by these early settlers are still thriving today. Other important business ventures in Franklin Township included a large tannery on Little Muncy Creek just south of Lairdsville and the lumber industry which swept throughout north central Pennsylvania during the mid-to-late 19th century. Thousands of acres of old-growth forests were stripped to the ground. The logs were floated down the streams to one of the many sawmills that were spread along the banks of Little Muncy Creek. Today the forests of Franklin Township have regrown, providing an excellent habitat for white-tailed deer, black bear and turkey. Enos Hawley, born in Chester County, was one of the first citizens to Lycoming County publicly to state an opposition to slavery. He was a member of the Religious Society of Friends. The Quakers were firmly against slavery and were noted for the assistance they provided the abolitionist movement in the years preceding the Civil War. Hawley was raised in Franklin Township in the vicinity of Lairdsville, which is the only village in the township. Hawley went on to serve as postmaster in the nearby borough of Muncy.

History Gamble Township was formed from parts of Lewis and Cascade Townships on January 30, 1875. An election of the citizens of the proposed township was 152-0 in favor of its creation. The drive for the formation of Gamble Township was led Ira Parker, Abraham Swartz, and J.C. Green. They started a petition and gathered the necessary signatures. Their petition was presented to Judge James Gamble who authorized the election. The results of the balloting were certified by Judge Huston Hepburn. The township is named for the judge who ordered the election. The first settler in Gamble Township was John Rose, for who Rose Valley is named. Rose was born in Scotland in 1772. He migrated to the United States in 1794 and settled in what is now Gamble Township. Rose was accompanied to the valley by is first wife and a man named Andrew Tulloh. Rose and Tulloh cleared some land for farming but did not remain in the valley. They both moved to Williamsport in their later years. The departure of John Rose did not bring about the end of agricultural development in Gamble Township. New settlers, a majority of them Germans, continued to clear Rose Valley. Here they established dairy farms and orchards, some of which are thriving today. Salt mining and the lumbering were the primary industries found in Gamble Township during the mid-to-late 19th century. Several salt mines were built within the township. Thousands of acres of old-growth forest were cleared to meet the demands for lumber during the lumber era that swept throughout Pennsylvania.

The population was 2,836 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Hepburn Township was formed from part of Loyalsock Township in 1804. It is named for William Hepburn who was a former state senator and one of the founding fathers of Lycoming County and Williamsport which is the largest city in Lycoming County. Hepburn Township was originally much larger in size than it is today. Lewis, Gamble, Eldred Township, and Cascade Townships all are formed from territory that was at least formerly part of Hepburn Township. An Indian village known as Eeltown played a prominent role in the early history of what is now Hepburn Township. This village located on Lycoming Creek near the present village of Hepburnville was an important village on the Sheshequin Path. The Indian name for Eeltown is unknown, but the whites named it for the plentiful eels that could be found in the waters of Lycoming Creek. Hepburn Township was settled by three distinct groups of European migrants. The western section along Lycoming Creek was largely settled by the Scots-Irish, the middle section known as Blooming Grove was settled by a German religious group, the Dunkard Brethren, and the eastern section of the township was settled by the Quakers. John and Gottlieb Heim were among the first Dunkards to settle in Hepburn Township. The Heims were imprisoned in W√ºrttemberg, Germany as conscientious objectors. A condition of their release from prison was that they would agree to leave Germany forever. Upon their release John and Gottleig moved to the United States. They settled in Lycoming County and founded a religious community and village known as Blooming Grove. Soon other Dunkards from Germany were to join the Heim brothers. They built log cabins and quickly cleared the land for farming. In addition to clearing the land the Dunkards were also free to worship God in a manner that they saw fit. Their faith was banned in Germany. The newly arrived settlers worked hard to clear the land and credited their success on their faith in God. The new farms prospered almost immediately, they \\"bloomed like flowers\\". Hence the name Blooming Grove. Balls Mills is a village in Hepburn Township. It is named for John Ball who migrated from England to the United States in 1893. He settled in Hillsgrove Township in Sullivan County. There he built a sawmill and was beginning to have success when he drowned while bathing. His son, William, then moved west to Hepburn Township and founded Balls Mills in 1818. He built a fulling mill soon after building his home. The Ball family quickly had success and expanded their milling operations to include a clover mill. The machinery at the clover mill was able to clean clover seed. Clover seed was very expensive at the time, a bushel of the seed sold for as much as $24.00. Clover was very important to farmers for providing ground cover and as a food supply for their grazing dairy cows. The Balls family also built a sawmill, a woolen mill, and a grain cradle manufacturing operation. A cradle is attached to a scythe to gather the harvested grains. The cradles were sold not just in Lycoming County but throughout the United States. The first major shipment to the west arrived in St. Louis, Missouri in 1866.

At the time Lycoming Township stretched from the West Branch Susquehanna River to the northern border of Lycoming County. The residents of the northern part of the township became dissatisfied with their representation in township matters. Most of the officers of the townships were from the southernmost portions near the river and they tended to forget about their neighbors to the north. The concerned citizens of the northern portions of Lycoming Township petitioned that a township for their interests be formed from Lycoming Township, and the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania formed Jackson Township in 1824. The township was named for Andrew Jackson who was then known as the hero of the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. He was not to become President until 1829. Peter Sechrist was one of the first settlers to arrive in Jackson Township. He moved there from Liverpool, Pennsylvania in 1811. Sechrist cleared the land for a farm and also constructed a saw and gristmill. His mills were the first of their kind in the area and his child, Daniel, was the first white child born in the area. Other earlier settlers, seeking their fortune, arrived from York County. Two sets of brothers, Jacob and Daniel Beck and George and Daniel Miller first stopped in Williamsport before moving further to the north.

Settlers who had sought refuge at Fort Antes and had returned to the right bank of the West Branch to milk their cows were among the first killed when Fort Antes was attacked just prior to the Big Runaway. These pioneers on the north side of the river were counted among the Fair Play Men, a group of squatters who lived outside the jurisdiction of the colonial and revolutionary governments of Pennsylvania. Many of the settlers did not return to the area until after Sullivan's Expedition had forced the Lenape and other Indians allied with the British further west. Jersey Shore was originally named Waynesburg by the two brothers, Reuben and Jeremiah Manning, who laid out the town circa 1785. Around the time that this was happening, a settlement arose on the eastern side of the West Branch Susquehanna River (Nippenose Township), opposite Waynesburg. A rivalry developed between the two settlements, and those on the eastern shore began referring to the settlement on the western shore as the \\"Jersey Shore,\\" because the Manning family had relocated from New Jersey. The nickname became so fixed that in 1826 the original name of Waynesburg was officially abandoned and changed to Jersey Shore. Jersey Shore's location on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just downstream from the mouth of Pine Creek made it an ideal location for traders and other businessmen who outfitted the pioneers who settled the western most portions of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley and the Pine Creek valley.* Thomas Martin was a farmer who sold his produce to the people of Jersey Shore and to the men and women who were just passing through. Mr. Martin was noted for his strong beliefs regarding the prices that he set. For example, if he believed that his potatoes were worth 35 cents a bushel, he would sell them for 35 cents a bushel, no more no less. If his competitors would sell potatoes for 50 cents a bushel, Martin would not raise his price and if others lowered the price to 25 cents per bushel, he would not lower his price. This firmness and fairness allowed Thomas Martin to rise to a position of prominence in Jersey Shore and Lycoming County. His reputation for fairness and honesty was passed onto his son Lewis Martin who went on to serve as a Lycoming County prothonotary and as a deputy U.S. Marshal. The Old Paint Mill. The Reverend John Hays Grier arrived in Jersey Shore in 1814. He was a Presbyterian missionary who originally set out from his home of Doylestown Pennsylvania with the intention of serving the pioneers of the west. He stopped one Sunday in Jersey Shore and for the most part never left. He built a strong congregation at Jersey Shore and another upstream on the West Branch in Lock Haven. Grier served the churches in Lock Haven and Jersey Shore for 14 years before serving the church in Jersey Shore, alone, for an additional 23 years. Rev. Grier was also elected sheriff of Lycoming County in 1822. Jersey Shore was once a major player in the railroad industry. In 1901, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad announced it would build large rail car shops near Avis, west of Jersey Shore, on the far side of Pine Creek. To induce workers and businesses to favor Jersey Shore over competing towns, entrepreneurs acquired land and built the Jersey Shore Electric Street Railway, a trolley line running from the city to the New York Central shops. In 1905, a second trolley line, the Jersey Shore and Antes Fort Railway, was put into service between the city and the Pennsylvania Railroad station in Antes Fort, to the southeast. These two trolley lines changed Jersey Shore from a city with no railroad connection to a city with two.Shieck, Paul J., and Cox, Harold E. (1978). West Branch Trolleys: Street Railways of Lycoming & Clinton Counties, pp. 55-80. Forty Fort, Pennsylvania: Harold E. Cox. What had formerly been a minor stop on the West Branch Canal and stagecoach lines was transformed into an industrial boomtown. Over 1,000 skilled mechanics were employed at the car shops. They were able to earn wages that far exceeded the normal income of the average worker in Lycoming County at the time. Other early industrial ventures in Jersey Shore included the American Balance Valve and Machine Works (a maker of railroad valves), the Susquehanna Silk Mill and the Jersey Shore Creamery Company. On October 10, 1911, Jersey Shore Hospital was founded by four physicians. At that time, the hospital consisted of 14 beds in the rebuilt home of the L.D. Herrit family. Over the next few years, x-ray services, a maternity ward, and nurses‚Äô residence were added. It was not until 1922 that Jersey Shore Hospital was recognized as a community hospital by the Borough and became a not-for-profit institution, which the hospital still maintains. Jersey Shore Steel Company was founded in 1938, near the end of the Great Depression by John A. Schultz. The company began manufacturing steel rails for the railroad industry. In its first year of business Jersey Shore Steel was able to produce 15,000 tons of rail steel. When John A. Schultz died in 1943, the business was passed onto his sons Charles and John A. Jr. The brothers oversaw expansion and devastation. A massive fire nearly destroyed the steel mill in 1963, and the Agnes Flood of 1972 caused tremendous amounts of damage. The company, which is owned by a third generation of the Schultz family, operates two mills, the original mill in Jersey Shore and a second mill downstream in Montoursville. It is capable of producing 170,000 tons of rail steel annually. The Jersey Shore Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Industry In the past, Jersey Shore held farms, railroad shops, cigar factories, a foundry, and a large silk mill. Woolrich, Inc. had a mill in Jersey Shore, in addition to ones in the neighbouring towns of Woolrich and Avis, which closed in 2008. Geography Jersey Shore is located at (41.202587, -77.266715). It is just east of the confluence of Pine Creek with the Susquehanna, surrounded to the north, west, and south by Porter Township and to the east (across the Susquehanna) by Nippenose Township.

The population was 1,139 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Lewis Township was formed from part of Hepburn Township in 1835. It is named for Ellis Lewis who was the president judge of the local district court at the time. The township was expanded in on December 10, 1846 when part of Cascade Township was added to Lewis Township. This was done at the request of the residents of the area who were geographically cut off from the rest of Cascade Township. Lycoming Creek and the Sheshequin Path played an important role in the early history of Lewis Township. The path was a major Native American trail that ran between two Native American villages: \\"French Margaret's Town\\" on the West Branch Susquehanna River (part of modern-day Williamsport in Lycoming County) and \\"Sheshequin\\" on the North Branch of the Susquehanna River (modern day Ulster Township, in Bradford County). The path ran north and east along Lycoming Creek in Lycoming County and followed much of Towanda Creek in Bradford County. It was a shortcut between the two main branches of the Susquehanna River and was used by early settlers as well as Native Americans. Lycoming Creek, which begins to the north of Lewis Township in McNett Township, also served as a highway of sorts during the colonial era of Pennsylvania's history. The stream was used by early explorers and the Native Americans in the area as a means of travel. They were able to float their canoes down the creek and into the West Branch Susquehanna River. This mode of transportation was considerably faster than walking the path. Conrad Weiser guided Moravian missionaries along the creek and path to reach Onondaga the capital of the Iroquois Confederacy in 1737. Raiding parties of Indian warriors used the creek and path in 1770 when conducting attacks on the West Branch Susquehanna Valley strongholds of Fort Muncy and Fort Freeland. Colonel Thomas Hartley led the 6th Pennsylvania Regiment up the Sheshequin Path during the American Revolution. Hartley's expedition in 1778 preceded the Sullivan Expedition of 1779. Both Hartley and Sullivan were instrumental in claiming the frontier of Pennsylvania and New York for the forces of the Continental Army. As Hartley and his men passed through Lewis Township the Sheshequin path was widened. The widening of the path helped to open this area to settlement in the years following the Revolution. Sheshequin Path Pennsylvania Historical Marker on U.S. Route 15 near Trout Run Lewis Township was largely uninhabited until after the Revolutionary War. A squatter named A.M. Slack is believed to have been the first permanent settler. He built a cabin and cleared some land in the area that is now the village of Bodines. The village of Trout Run has its beginnings during the construction of the Williamson Road. This road which stretched from Williamsport, Pennsylvania to Painted Post, New York helped to open north central Pennsylvania to settlement. Charles Williamson, the builder of the road, established a supply depot at Trout Run. Much of Lewis Township is covered with steep slopes that were carved into the Allegheny Plateau by the streams that drain into the West Branch Susquehanna River. The geography of the township has limited the development of the township. A narrow valley along Lycoming Creek is where most of the settlement of Lewis Township has occurred. James Kyle arrived in the area sometime around 1800. He owned along Lycoming Creek. Kyle took out an advertisement in the Lycoming Gazette. The ad placed on March 14, 1810 read as follows. Kyle's farm was eventually sold to Robert Allen. Robert and his family were among the most successful and prominent early settlers. Allen was born in Northumberland on August 6, 1797. His father, John Allen, was a native of County Down, Ireland and his mother was from Scotland. John Allen moved from Northumberland to a section of land along Lycoming Creek between Cogan Station and Hepburnville in Hepburn Township. He died in 1819 and his farm was divided among his children. Robert Allen sold his share of the farm to his brothers and moved further north along Lycoming Creek and bought the land that was formerly owned by James Kyle. Allen and his wife Mary Ann Hews improved the Kyle Farm. They rose to a position of prominence as the owners of an inn that was frequently busy with visitors who were moving along the Williamson Road. Allen was also employed as a surveyor and civil engineer. He spent several years working for the United States Government in the Northwest Territory especially in what is now Michigan along the Detroit River and Lake Huron. Allen died in 1849 and his wife died in 1883. Her parents Henry and Martha Hews were part of the failed \\"English Settlement\\" in Pine Township. They had migrated to Pennsylvania from Chard, Somerset, England. After struggling the survive in Pine Township, Henry Hews cleared and established several successful farms in Tioga County and northern Lycoming County before finally settling near Trout Run where his daughter met and married Robert Allen. Lewis Township has changed little over the years. The population has risen to 1,139 as of the 2000 census up from 985 in the census of 1890.

It was formed from parts of Nippenose and Wayne Townships. Limestone Township was originally known as Adams Township in honor of United States President John Adams until April 14, 1835 when the name as changed to what was deemed to be a more appropriate title. Upon arriving in present-day Limestone Township in 1789, the first settlers deemed it barren because the base of valley was covered by thickets of thorny bushes and was largely free of trees. At first the land sold for as little as fifty cents an acre. After the initial settlers cleared the shrubbery and planted wheat, the land was found to be quite fertile, and prices rose to $5.00 per acre. Later settlers to Limestone Township established the communities of Collomsville, Oriole and Oval. These small towns were the locations of small taverns, general stores and sawmills. By the 1890s, land sold for as much as $100 per acre. Much of the farmland in the southeastern portion of Limestone Township was purchased by the Williamsport Water Authority in the early 1900s as part of its watershed. Visitors to the \\"water company\\" lands can see the stone remains of the early settlers homesteads spread throughout the watershed. The water authority built a multimillion-dollar water filtration plant in the 1990s in Mosquito Valley.

The population was 145 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History McHenry Township was formed from parts of Cummings and Brown on August 21, 1861. It was named in honor of a Jersey Shore surveyor, Alexander H. McHenry. The first warrant for land in what is now McHenry Township was issued to John Nixon on May 17, 1785. John English and his wife, Fanny Boatman, settled on the largest island in the area as early as 1784. They left hurriedly after a warning from a friendly Indian, Shawnee John, returning about a year later. Claudius Boatman and his son-in-law, Comfort Wanzer, married to Mary \\"Polly\\" Boatman, settled in the area in 1785. Boatman, a Frenchman by birth, formerly lived in the Buffalo Valley area of Union county, Pennsylvania, first near Winfield, then in Mahoning township, before moving further up the West Branch Susquehanna River to Pine Creek. Boatman, at that time married to his second wife, Esther, had a rather large family. A daughter, Rebecca, married and lived a long life despite being partially scalped when she was 15 in 1782; her mother, Boatman's first wife was killed in the same incident. Esther Boatman served as a nurse and rural physician for the pioneers along Pine Creek. The descendants of Claudius Boatman remain in fairly large numbers in western Lycoming County. The first white settlers in the vicinity of what became Jersey Mills arrived in the late 18th and very early 19th centuries. For the next 100 years, lumbering and farming were the main drivers of the local economy. The first lumber mill in the area began operations in 1809. Farm crops included cereal grasses and potatoes. The village of Jersey Mills was officially established in 1855, when its post office opened. Flagstone quarries in the area provided income in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as lumbering income steeply declined. The village had a one-room school through 1946 and a general store and boarding house through 1965. A smaller general store, the last commercial business in Jersey Mills, operated from 1980 though 2007. Lumbering was the primary industry in McHenry Township during the mid-to-late 19th century. Thousands of acres of old-growth forest were cleared to meet the demands for lumber during the lumber era that swept throughout Pennsylvania.

The population was 539 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History McIntyre Township was formed from territory taken from Lewis Township in 1848. It is named for Archibald McIntyre who was one of the founders of the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad. The first pioneers arrived in the McIntyre Township area in 1794 near what is now the village of Ralston. John Smithkontz cleared a parcel of land along Lycoming Creek near the mouth of Pleasant Stream on 1805. The New York Iron and Coal Company created the first business venture in what was to become McIntyre Township in when they constructed a sawmill on Lycoming Creek. The New York Iron and Coal Company also built an iron furnace near the mouth of Frozen Run in 1831. They began to make iron using iron ore that was mined nearby. The company also established a charcoal making operation for the fuel that was needed to keep the furnaces fired. The iron industry had little success in McIntyre. The ore was difficult to clean, it could only be separated from the dirt that was mixed in when it was frozen. And the ore that they did manage to extract produced iron that proved to be very brittle. The reason that several companies attempted to succeed in what proved to be a failing enterprise was the fact that the furnace was within easy distance of the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad which connected the industrial centers of Williamsport, Pennsylvania and Elmira, New York. The McIntyre Coal company was founded by Jervis Langdon in 1870. He set up a coal mining operation in the mountains in the northeastern section of McIntyre Township. Coal mining had taken place on a small scale in the earlier years of the township, but Langdon was the first to open a large scale operation. The coal company constructed a steep (45 degrees) and long (2,300 feet) incline plane to get the coal from the mine to the waiting railroad cars. The village of McIntyre sprang up around the coal mines. At one time it was home to 300 households, had a church, school, store, sawmill, a boot and shoe shop, and a public hall. The McIntyre Coal Company ceased operation in 1886. The mine was abandoned, and the town was abandoned shortly after the mine.

The population was 1,145 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area.  History  Mifflin Township was formed in 1803 by dividing Lycoming Township. It is named in honor of Thomas Mifflin the first governor of Pennsylvania.  Early settlers  When colonial settlers first arrived in what is now Mifflin Township they were outside the western boundary of what was then the Province of Pennsylvania. These settlers were not under the jurisdiction or protection of any type from any of the Thirteen Colonies. They became known as the Fair Play Men. These men established their own form of government, known as the \\"Fair Play System\\", with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776 beneath the \\"Tiadaghton Elm\\" on the banks of Pine Creek. Mifflin Township is located within the Larrys Creek watershed. This area was densely covered with trees and brush until about 1790 when the first settlers attempted to clear some of the land that surrounds Larrys Creek. John Murphy was the first settlers to establish a permanent homestead. He cleared some land along the creek and built a home. His daughter, Sarah, is thought to have been the first white child to have been born in Mifflin Township. Murphy was soon followed by other settlers who also built cabins, cleared some land for farming and built sawmills. Lumber was soon to become the dominant industry in Mifflin Township.  The Lumber Industry  As timber and lumber became a major industry in the mid-19th century, Larrys Creek, in Mifflin Township, was a source of power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and the lumber boom at Williamsport. This and the lack of logging railroads along the creek lead to the development of many small sawmills. Twelve sawmills were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. By 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating. Lumbering removed the tree trunks, but left many flammable limbs, branches, and stumps behind. On May 2, 1872 a large forest fire destroyed the villages of Carter and Gould, 6 miles (10 km) north of Salladasburg on Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township. There are large tracts of second growth forest and small lumber companies still operate in the township today.

The history of the settlement of Montgomery begins in 1783 when John Lawson established a homestead there. Nicholas Shaffer built a gristmill in Montgomery in 1795. A sawmill and a wool carding mill were other early industries found on Black Hole Creek which flows through Montgomery. P. M. Barber was the first person to come to Montgomery and establish an industry that achieved any sustainable success. He opened a distillery in 1859 and later a planing mill in 1869 on the site of the distillery. Barber with his partners, A.B. Henderson, Jesse Rank, and Nathan Fowler had so much success that they laid out a town around their mill in 1870. The town was further expanded by the success of Montgomery Machine Shops which starting in 1873, under the supervision of Levi Houston, built woodworking machinery that was sold to clients throughout the United States and Canada and as far away as Australia. Montgomery was previously known as Black Hole for the creek that flows through it and the post office established in 1836 bearing that name and it was also known as Clinton Mills, again named for the post office.

As of the 2010 census, the borough population was 4,615. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The Williamsport Regional Airport is located in Montoursville. Developed on the east bank of the river near the former native village of Otstonwakin, the borough is named for Andrew Montour, the French/Native American and son of Madame Montour. Madame Montour was a Native American interpreter and negotiator who was important in colonial history for her service to the British in New York and Pennsylvania. She was considered the leader of the native village. Her son Andrew Montour also became influential as an interpreter and negotiator, serving colonial governments in Pennsylvania and Virginia, including during the French and Indian War. History Otstawonkin was a native village located at the mouth of Loyalsock Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River. The Great Shamokin Path ran along the west bank of the river, where late 20th century archeology has shown the village was mostly located.Hirsch, Alison Duncan. \\"'The Celebrated Madame Montour': Interpretess across Early American Frontiers\\", Explorations in Early American Culture 4 (2000): 81‚Äì112 During the 1730s and 1740s, it became an important stopping point for Moravian missionaries who preached in frontier Pennsylvania. For example, Count Zinzendorf, a missionary guided by Conrad Weiser with the permission of Oneida chief Shikellamy, came to Otstonwakin in 1742. Madame Montour is believed to have been of Algonkin-French ancestry, born in Quebec. In one account, she told a colonist in the 1740s that she had been taken captive in an Iroquois raid and adopted into an Iroquois family. (Her given name may have been Catherine, Elisabeth/Isabelle, or Madeleine.)Hirsch, Alison Duncan. \\"'The Celebrated Madame Montour': Interpretess across Early American Frontiers.\\" Explorations in Early American Culture 4 (2000): 81‚Äì112 Speaking French and English, as well as Algonquian and Iroquoian languages, she became highly influential in New York, and acted as Governor Robert Hunter's personal interpreter. She and her Oneida husband Carondawana settled in Pennsylvania by 1727, moving south from New York; he had been appointed by the Shawnee in this part of Pennsylvania as their representative to the provincial council. A war chief, Carondawana was killed in 1729 in a southern raid against the Catawba people. Madame Montour continued to have influence as a friend of the British, representing the Iroquois and other native peoples of the area. She was hospitable to the white men who were beginning to migrate into the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. She had a great amount of influence with the various Indian tribes in the area, who were feeling the pressure of colonial expansion. Believed to have been born in Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec, Madame Montour grew up in the province of New York, where she served as an interpreter to the British. Because of her numerous native ties, she was very influential. The British colonial government was known to be sometimes laggardly in paying her for her services, making her wait one time a year for payment. Millstone from early native settlement, engraved \\"Otstonwakin, 1768, Montour Preserve\\" Madame Montour is believed to have had three children, but different kinship terms has caused confusion among historians as to the status of some. Louis (Lewis), may have been a son or nephew, named for her brother, Louis Couc Montour. He served as an interpreter during the French and Indian War, when he was killed. Her daughter (or niece), Margaret, later to be known as \\"French Margaret,\\" became a leader of \\"French Margaret's Town\\" at the mouth of Lycoming Creek, a few miles up the West Branch Susquehanna River from Montoursville. Her surviving son Andrew, took over leadership of Otstonwakin in the 1740s. Growing up in a polyglot world, he displayed his mother‚Äôs gift for languages, speaking French, English, Lenape, Shawnee and the Iroquoian languages. Comfortable with both Native Americans and Europeans, he made a good living as an interpreter for local tribes and settlers. In 1742 when Count Zinzendorf met Montour, he described him as looking \\"decidedly European, and had his face not been encircled with a broad band of paint we would have thought he was one.\\" Montour also served as an interpreter with Conrad Weiser and Chief Shikellamy. He was granted of land by the Province of Pennsylvania in the Montoursville area. He later was appointed as a captain in George Washington's Army at Fort Necessity during the French and Indian War. Andrew Montour left Montoursville at some point and moved to Juniata County with his mother before finally settling on Mountour's Island in the Allegheny River near Pittsburgh. She died in that area in 1753. Federal period and later Permanent European-American settlement of this site did not take place until after the American Revolutionary War. John Burrows gained credit as the founder of Montoursville because he sold lots to other settlers, as well as achieving some political power and wealth. He was born near Rahway, New Jersey. In his youth Burrows delivered mail, riding on horseback between New York and Philadelphia. He also served as a courier for General George Washington during the American Revolution for fourteen months. Following the war, Burrows migrated to Muncy, Pennsylvania and worked in the distilling business for several years. He built up the needed capital to make an investment in some land near the mouth of Loyalsock Creek, which was developed as Montoursville. Burrows also gained a measure of political clout in Lycoming County, serving first as a justice of the peace before being elected to the county commissioner's post in 1802, and to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1808. He bought in 1812. Burrows divided his land into lots in 1820 and sold them for $50.00 each. The first buyers of lots in Montoursville settled according to ethnicity. The Germans settled in the eastern end in a neighborhood that became known as Coffeetown, while the English settled in the western neighborhood that was known as Teatown. In addition to selling the lots in Montoursville, Burrows operated a highly successful farm. He sent his produce by raft down the Susquehanna River to Baltimore, where he was able to turn a profit. Burrows built the first gristmill in the town. He also continued to sell lots up until his death in 1837. His son Nathaniel Burrows became another successful early businessman. He opened the first general store in the town. He received the contract for construction of the West Branch Canal in this section of Lycoming County. Nathaniel Burrows influenced the routing of the canal so that it ran closer to the town and his businesses. Montoursville was incorporated as a borough on February 19, 1850. John Else came as a child with his family to the Montoursville area in 1807 from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. His father had a farm along Mill Creek in what is now Mill Creek Township. As a young man, John Else worked to build the first permanent bridge over Loyalsock Creek in 1815. He made numerous improvements in the community. Else built many structures in Montoursville, working with his father on its first permanent house. Indian Park Indian Park is located on the north-western side of Montoursville; Interstate 180/U.S. Route 220 run parallel to it. In the 21st century, the large recreational park has several miles of hiking and biking trails, numerous softball fields, picnic areas and pavilions, and fishing ponds. Developed in the late 19th century, Indian Park was an amusement park. Known as a trolley park, it could be reached by public transportation. Visitors from Williamsport would board the trolley in downtown and ride to Indian Park to spend a day of recreation along the banks of Loyalsock Creek. The park had one of the largest and longest roller coasters on the East Coast. The park also featured more than of ponds, a theatre, and a merry-go-round. The amusement park was closed in 1924 due in large part to the seasonal costs of reconstruction of infrastructure following the nearly yearly floods on Loyalsock Creek. In addition, people's increasing use of automobiles meant they traveled to other destinations for pleasure. TWA Flight 800 The TWA Flight 800 Memorial Montoursville was disproportionately affected by the explosion of TWA Flight 800 on July 17, 1996, off East Moriches, New York, as 21 of the 230 passengers were Montoursville-area residents. The sixteen Montoursville High School students and their five chaperones were departing on a class trip to France as part of a student exchange program. Montoursville received condolences from around the world, including Japan, Australia, and Belgium. Governor Tom Ridge attended a vigil at the school with his wife. Ridge also attended a memorial service, which was also attended by New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum. Condolences were also sent by President Bill Clinton, the U.S. softball team at the Atlanta Olympics, and Fran√ßois Bujon de l'Estang, French ambassador to the United States (1995‚Äì2002). A memorial was erected on the grounds of Montoursville High School. It is a statue of an angel (sculpted by James Barnhill of Asheville, North Carolina) on a base engraved with the names of the 21 local victims and a brief history. The memorial is in a circular grove of 21 trees, one for each person lost. The angel was chosen because onlookers thought a cloud seen above the high school on July 21, 1996, resembled an angel, with 21 small clouds at its feet. Randolph Hudson of State College was chosen as the memorial designer and Beth Hershberger served as landscape designer. The five chaperones were Debbie Dickey, a French teacher of the Montoursville Area High School; Doug Dickey, her husband; Carol Fry, former school board member; Judith Rupert, high school secretary; and Eleanor Wolfson (mother of student Wendy Wolfson). The 16 students were Jessica Aikey, Daniel Baszczewski, Michelle Bohlin, Jordan Bower, Monica Cox, Claire Gallagher, Julia Grimm, Rance Hettler, Amanda Karschner, Jody Loudenslager, Cheryl Nibert, Kimberly Rogers, Larissa Uzupis, Jacqueline Watson, Monica Weaver, and Wendy Wolfson.

Moreland Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,036 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Statistical Area. History It was divided into three townships in 1822. One part kept the name Moreland and the other two parts were called Penn and Franklin Townships. The Lairdsville Covered Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The Houseknecht Farm was added in 2007. The name There are several stories about how Moreland Township was named. One story states that an early pioneer to the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley was climbing up and down the hills and upon reaching the top of a hill exclaimed, \\"more land!\\". Another story relates to the \\"sloppiness\\" of the earliest land surveys. An acre was not necessarily measured accurately. These particular acres were larger than they were supposed to be. The early settlers liked to say that they got \\"more land\\" to the acre here than they could have elsewhere. The most likely reason relates to an arcane definition of moreland, meaning \\"a hilly country\\". Early settlers A veteran of the American Revolutionary War was the first settler in Moreland Township. Colonel George Smith migrated to Moreland Township from Montgomery County in 1790. He built a gristmill there in 1796. Smith and his wife were the parents of 6 children, 3 boys and 3 girls. The marriage of his daughter, Annie to a Quaker named William Farr causes some controversy in the early history of Moreland Township. William Farr came from a strict Quaker family and they did not look kindly upon his choice of bride. The local Quaker congregation insisted that Farr confess that he had done wrong in marrying outside his faith. Farr refused to do so and insisted that his Baptist wife, Annie, was a good Christian woman. Farr was forced to choose between his Quaker faith and his Baptist wife. He chose his wife and converted to the Baptist faith. Colonel Smith's son, Jonathan, also had a marriage that proved to be interesting. He married Annie Simpson, the sister of John Simpson of Ohio. John Simpson was the grandfather of Ulysses S. Grant who became President of the United States. This family bond meant that many of the residents of Moreland Township in the mid-19th century were second cousins to the man who served as their President. Geography Moreland Township is bordered by Columbia and Montour Counties to the south, Muncy Creek and Wolf Townships to the west, Penn Township to the north, and Franklin Township to the east. As the crow flies, Lycoming County is about northwest of Philadelphia and east-northeast of Pittsburgh. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 23.9 square miles (62.0 km2), all of it land.  Economy and environment  The Harman Lewis 1H well, a Marcellus Shale shale gas well in Moreland Township, has been leaking methane since 2011. In January 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued an order to the well operator, Range Resources, to address the leakage problems \\"for once and for all.\\" Combustible gas has been found \\"in groundwater, in soil surveys in nearby farm fields and surfacing on Greg‚Äôs Run and Sugar Run.\\" Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 1,036 people, 367 households and 311 families residing in the township. The population density was 43.3 per square mile (16.7/km2). There were 391 housing units at an average density of 16.3/sq mi (6.3/km2).

The name Muncy comes from the Munsee Indians who once lived in the area.Manhattan to Minisink: American Indian Place Names of Greater New York and Vicinity p. 4 The population was 2,477 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. Muncy is located on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just south of the confluence of Muncy Creek with the river. History=Early Settlement Monument to John Brady, Muncy, Pennsylvania About 1787, four brothers Silas, William, Benjamin, and Isaac McCarty, came here from Bucks County. They were of Quaker extraction. William and Benjamin bought known as the \\"John Brady farm.\\" John Brady was one of the earliest settlers in the area. He received a land grant which was awarded to the officers who served in the Bouquet Expedition. He chose land west of present-day Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. He built a private stockade on this land in the Spring of 1776, close to present day Muncy, Pennsylvania, which he called \\"Fort Brady.\\" John Brady's Muncy house was large for its day. He dug a trench around it and emplaced upright logs in that trench side by side all the way around. He filled the trench with dirt and packed the dirt against the logs to hold the log wall solidly in place. This log wall ran about twelve feet high from the ground. He then held this wall in place upright by pinning smaller logs across its top, to keep the wall face steady and solid. The John Brady homestead was perilously close to the leading edge of the frontier of that time, the Susquehanna River. The other side of the Susquehanna was fiercely dominated by the Indians. The Indians resisted settler encroachment on their territory by routinely crossing the Susquehanna to raid the settlers. The settlers just as routinely crossed the Susquehanna to pursue the raiding war parties to retaliate and sometimes to rescue captives taken by the Indians during these raids. In this ongoing skirmishing, both sides committed unspeakable atrocities on the other, which drove a long-lasting cycle of revenge for revenge brutalities between the settlers and Indians. It was in the midst of this extreme danger and violence that Major John Brady chose to settle his family, which set the stage for what happened to him and for what so greatly impacted and influenced his family‚Äîespecially, his sons, Continental Army Captain Samuel Brady of Brady's Leap fame and Hugh Brady, who became a Major General in the United States Army. Map Showing Fort Brady and Fort Muncy, Pennsylvania The McCarty brothers divided up the former Brady land, with William taking the portion between what is now West Water Street and Muncy Creek, and Benjamin that portion between West Water Street and the southern boundary. Main Street now represents what was then the boundary between the Brady farm and Isaac Walton's. In 1797, ten years after coming to Muncy, Benjamin McCarty conceived the idea of starting a town, and began laying out lots on what is now Main Street, and sold them to different parties. His example was followed by his brother William, north of Water street, and by Isaac Walton. The town was named Pennsborough in honor of the William Penn. The town grew slowly and was nothing but a village for many years. More than a quarter of a century passed before an act of incorporation was applied for. Finally, by act approved March 15, 1826, it was incorporated as a borough. Maj. General Hugh Brady On January 19, 1827, with a population of less than 600, the name was changed from Pennsborough to Muncy. This was done because many persons thought it was \\"too flat and long,\\" and the new name would be more in accordance with the historical associations of the place, and serve to perpetuate the name of the tribe that first dwelt there, a tribe of Lenape, named Monseys. Abolition Riot of 1842 One of the common misconceptions about United States history prior to the Civil War is that all the citizens of the northern states were against slavery. In fact many of the \\"Yankees\\", were all for slavery, especially in states closer to the Confederacy like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Delaware. There were more than a few abolitionists in Pennsylvania, and Enos Hawley, a Quaker citizen of Muncy, was one of the most prominent abolitionists in Lycoming County. Hawley, a tanner by trade, was, like most Quakers, a strong supporter of the abolition of slavery. Hawley invited a now unknown speaker to come to Muncy to speak against slavery. This speaker arrived in April 1842. His arrival and resultant speech set off a tremendous riot that led to the near destruction of a local schoolhouse and the controversial pardoning of the rioters by Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter. The anti-slavery speaker gave his speech at a one- room school in Muncy in April 1842. During the course of the speech, eighteen men gathered outside the schoolhouse. They began throwing rocks and other debris at the school, breaking all of the windows. Enos Hawley and the guest speaker were both injured in the assault. Upon fleeing the school, the abolitionists were pelted with eggs. The rioters followed Hawley and his guest to Hawley's home at the corner of High and Main Streets. They continued the assault on Hawley's home until after midnight, when the local law enforcement officers were able to quell the riot and arrest the rioters. The rioters were indicted in September and went to trial in October, when thirteen of the eighteen rioters were found guilty as charged. The jury's deliberation was quite a long process. Abraham Updegraff was a member of the jury who was the driving force that led to the conviction of the rioters. Updegraff, an ardent abolitionist who was a vital member of the Underground Railroad in Lycoming County, was able to convince his peers that the rioters deserved to be punished. The first jury vote was 11 to 1 in favor of acquittal, with Updegraff being the lone dissenter. Updegraff argued that \\"we have been sworn to try this case according to the law and the evidence presented and that if no contradictory evidence [is] offered by the defendants than we could do nothing more than to convict them.\\" He was able to make his argument in German which was the native tongue of three other jurors. The second vote was 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal. A third vote brought about the conviction of 13 of the 18 men charged in the Muncy Abolition Riot of 1842. This conviction was essentially overturned by Governor David R. Porter when he pardoned the rioters several days later. Governor Porter's statement of pardon said, \\"It is represented to me by highly respected citizens of Lycoming County, that this prosecution was instituted more with a view to the accomplishment of political ends than to serve the cause of law and order.\\" Porter's pardon message placed the blame for the riot on the abolitionist speaker. Porter stated that the speech was \\"notoriously offensive to the minds of those to whom they were addressed and were calculated to bring about a breach of the peace.\\" This pardon led to Governor Porter being given the less than flattering nickname of the \\"Previous Pardonin Porter.\\" Historians believe that Porter pardoned the rioters under political pressure that was rampant, in the years prior to the Civil War, regarding the issue of slavery. Today Today, Muncy has nearly 2,700 residents. Muncy's high school football team and the Montgomery high school team, play annually for The Shoe. The trophy was created in 1961 from an old athletic shoe found in the Muncy High School locker room; the shoe has been bronzed and mounted on a wooden box. Muncy currently leads the series with 28 wins to Montgomery's 18. Hughesville's high school team and Muncy are also rivals.

Muncy Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,059 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The unincorporated village of Pennsdale is located here. There is a Religious Society of Friends (Quaker) Meeting House in Pennsdale that was built in 1799, and is one of the oldest buildings and perhaps the oldest house of worship in the county. History Muncy Township, named for the Munsee tribe, was the first township in the county north of the West Branch Susquehanna River to be formed (predating even Lycoming County itself). It was originally formed as a part of Northumberland County on April 9, 1772. Muncy Township, as one of the seven original townships of Northumberland County was once an immense township. It had an indefinite northern border. The southern border of the township was the West Branch Susquehanna River. The eastern boundary may have been Muncy Creek and the western boundary was, like the northern boundary, indefinite. Loyalsock Township was the first township to be formed from Muncy Township in 1786. This division encompassed the land between Loyalsock and Lycoming Creeks. The township was divided several more times. Muncy Creek Township was formed in 1797, Shrewsbury Township in 1804, Penn Township in 1828, Wolf Township in 1834 and lastly in 1878 when Mill Creek Township was formed. Samuel Wallis was one of the first permanent settlers in Muncy Township. Known as the \\"Land King\\" Wallis operated Muncy Farms which was for its time a large and very successful farm. Wallis first came to the West Branch Susquehanna Valley in 1768 as a surveyor. He was born in Harford County, Maryland in 1730 to a wealthy Quaker family. Wallis received a good education and inherited a large fortune. He sought to expand his fortune in various ways. He worked for a while as a shipping merchant in Philadelphia and became a surveyor. While working as a surveyor Wallis was introduced to what would become his home in 1768. He gave up his job as a surveyor and began acquiring land up and down the West Branch Valley. His holdings are said to have extended as far west as Pine Creek from his base of operations in Muncy Township. Wallis held title to the land that has since become, Muncy, Muncy Creek Township, Muncy Township, Montoursville, Loyalsock Township, Williamsport, Woodward Township, Piatt Township, Porter Township and Jersey Shore. Wallis' home was one of, if not the, first houses to be built in what is now Lycoming County. Samuel Wallis was such an important figure in the early history of Muncy Township that Fort Muncy was built on his land. This fort served as an outpost for the colonial army of Pennsylvania providing a safe haven for settlers from various Indian attacks. Wallis' house survives (seen here in 1984) and is the oldest in the county today. Samuel Wallis married Lydia Hollingsworth in Philadelphia on March 1, 1770. They settled at Muncy Farms soon after the marriage and continued to farm while Wallis continued to expand his land holdings. Wallis was forced to flee Muncy Farms during the \\"Big Runaway\\". During the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes- Barre) and smaller local attacks, the Big Runaway occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the \\"Little Runaway\\". Sullivan's Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. Wallis returned as soon as it was safe and continued to farm. He also built a gristmill along Carpenter's Run. The construction of this mill was entrusted to Colonel Henry Antes of Nippenose Township. Antes was the operator of the most successful mill in the area along Antes Creek. Samuel Wallis and James Wilson a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the Supreme Court appointee of George Washington became involved with Theophilus Cazenove and the Holland Land Company. This company bought up much of the land that his now northwestern Pennsylvania and western New York near the Great Lakes. Wallis worked as a surveyor and assessor for the land company and Wilson was heavily invested in the operation. Wilson owed a tremendous debt to Wallis and others. He fled to Edenton, North Carolina to escape his debts. Wallis followed him there in an effort to reach a settlement. They reached a preliminary agreement and agreed to meet again. Both men died before the debts could be settled. Wallis contracted yellow fever on his return from North Carolina and died in Philadelphia on October 14, 1798. Wilson died in Edenton, North Carolina on August 21, 1798. Wallis' heir were unable to collect Wilson's debt. Wallis himself left a large debt behind. The heirs were forced to sell Samuel Wallis' land for a fraction of his value to Henry Drinker. Drinker gave the land to his daughter and son-in-law, Elizabeth and Charles Hall. Muncy Farms became known as Hall's Farms. Pennsdale is a village in Muncy Township. It was founded by a group of Quakers in 1799. They built a meetinghouse there. The first meetings were held in Samuel Wallis's home as early as 1791. The Quakers continue to hold meetings in Pennsdale. The Reading-Halls Station Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Muncy Creek Township is a township in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,487 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The unincorporated village of Clarkstown is located in Muncy Creek Township. History Muncy Creek Township was formed when Muncy Township was divided for the second time in 1797. The township is named for Muncy Creek a tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River that flows thru it. Some of the oldest settlements of Lycoming County are in Muncy Creek Township. The township also played an important role in the development and regular use of the Pennsylvania Canal along the West Branch Susquehanna River. The hamlet of Port Penn rose up along the section of the canal that passed through Muncy Creek Township. This hamlet, greatly reduced in population, was a very busy and sometimes dangerous place. Muncy Dam was built across the river at Muncy Creek Township. This dam provided the water that was needed to fill the canal along a stretch canal that began at Port Penn and ended at Sunbury. The dam, canal and towing path were all constructed for a considerable amount of money. Around these construction projects, the hamlet of Port Penn was built. Upon completion of the canal in 1834 it was already a thriving community featuring a manufacturer of canal boats. Other businesses in Port Penn included hotels and taverns that provided housing and food for the men working on the canal, and a blacksmith and a saddle maker. There was a butcher who also operated a grocery business, a weaver, a wagon builder, a shoemaker, an ice business, as well as several teachers, masons and general merchants. Port Penn quickly gained a reputation as being a dangerous place that attracted \\"unsavory\\" characters. Gambling and prize fighting were two popular past times. Large amounts of alcohol were consumed by the participants furthering the danger. An organized group of counterfeiters had an operation in a cabin in Muncy Creek Township that passed fake coins onto the boatmen and others that passed by Port Penn on the canal. A riot took place during the construction of the canal that resulted in several deaths. A man named Barney McCue is responsible for at least two murders at Port Penn, one in 1870 and another four years later in 1874. Many children drowned in the canal and river. The railroad that largely replaced the canal was not less dangerous as several lives were claimed on the rails. Even the so-called \\"Last Raft\\" to be floated down the West Branch took several lives at Port Penn. The raft hit the railroad bridge and sent 45 passengers into the river, seven of whom died. The canal in Muncy Creek Township brought vast amounts of goods that were stored in warehouses in Port Penn and Muncy. The farmers and industrialists of Lycoming County used these warehouses to store their goods before they were sent south on the canal. The chief exports of the county were hogs, wheat, flour, lumber, dried and salted meats, leather and whiskey. Whiskey was a very big business. At least 13 distilleries in the area produced and out put of 1,200 to 1,500 gallons of whiskey a day. Muncy Creek Township also was home to a thriving commercial fishing industry. The dam was an ideal point to catch fish. The bottleneck in the river caused by the dam and canal locks caused the fish to be forced into one easy to reach location. Baskets were placed along the dam and locks and tremendous amounts of fish and eels were easily caught. The dams and locks at Port Penn were destroyed by numerous floods in the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley during the late 1800s. This caused the canal to be abandoned as it was replaced by the railroads. Port Penn was since faded away. There are several homes in the area, but as a hamlet it no longer exists. Parts of Port Penn have been annexed by the borough of Muncy and others are in Muncy Creek Township. Lycoming College and the Muncy Historical Society have spearheaded an effort to uncover the history of Port Penn.

The population was 729 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Nippenose Township was formed as part of Northumberland County in 1786 by a session of the Northumberland County court that was held in Sunbury. It did not become part of Lycoming County until Lycoming County was also formed from Northumberland County in 1795. Nippenose Township was originally much larger than it is today. It spread over parts of what are now, Clinton, Centre and Lycoming Counties. The population of Nippenose Township was 588, in 1890, compared to the slightly higher population of 729 as of the 2000 census. Etymology The story behind the name of Nippenose Township is unclear. There are two competing stories. One states that it is named for the Indian phrase, \\"Nippeno-wi\\", meaning a warm and genial summerlike place. The other story behind the name is traces back an old Indian named Nippenose. The early settlers told the story of the old man who lingered in the valley after it was settled by whites. Apparently this man's nose had been \\"nipped\\" by exposure to the frost, hence the name \\"Nippenose.\\" An additional source of the name is that there is only one way into and out of the valley without going over a mountain. This gap is bordered on the west by a mountain with nip in the end of it, like a nipped nose. Colonel John Henry Antes The first colonial settlers arrived in the Nippenose area in 1769. Henry Clark was the first to arrive with a \\"warrant\\" to the land from the colonial Pennsylvania government. One of the most prominent early settlers was Colonel John Henry Antes. He is thought to have arrived as early as 1772. His last name is featured prominently in place names in Nippenose Township. Antes Creek the main creek in the valley and Antes Fort a small village both bear his name. Antes built stockade around his home, his neighbors came to call it \\"Antes Fort\\" and the name has lived on to today. Colonel Antes also built a grist mill at the mouth of Antes Creek on the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1777. This mill was burned during the Revolutionary war. During the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the \\"Big Runaway\\" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the \\"Little Runaway\\". Sullivan's Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. When things finally calmed down in 1792, Colonel Antes returned to Nippenose Township and rebuilt his mill. This second mill was a vital link the economy of Nippenose Township until 1873 when a new mill was built in its place. Antes furthered his enterprises by building a carding and fulling mill on the banks of Antes Creek in 1810. Antes died in 1820. Ownership of the mills was passed onto his son- in-law Elias P. Youngman. Youngman and his sons expanded the business yet again in 1835 by adding machinery that was able to clean clover seed. Clover seed was very expensive at the time, a bushel of the seed sold for as much as $24.00. Clover was very important to farmers for providing ground cover and as a food supply for their grazing dairy cows. Antes Fort The village of Antes Fort rose up around the train station that was built in Nippenose Township to service the borough of Jersey Shore which is the north and across the West Branch Susquehanna River from Nippenose Township. Antes Fort went through several name changes. The surveyor who drew up the towns plans called it \\"Granville\\". This name was seldom uses as the locals preferred to call it \\"Jersey Shore Station\\". The name Antes Fort was not bestowed on the village until 1861 when the United States Post Office established a branch there and named it in honor of Colonel Antes' stockade.

Nippenose Valley The region includes anticlinal karst Nippenose Valley part of the northernmost fold sequence of the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province. Nippenose Valley is uniquely bowl-shaped and consists of a doubly plunging anticline. According to a research paper from the University of Akron, The center has been eroded, exposing carbonate rocks in the valley. There is an average total of about 470 meters of Lower to Middle Ordovician limestone and dolomite underlying the valley. The Reedsville Shale is stratigraphically above them, and overlain by the ridge forming Bald Eagle Sandstone. The valley has been intensely karstified, as evidenced by the numerous sinkholes, springs, caves, and disappearing streams. Within a number of caves in this valley a new species of fish, a type of troglomorphic sculpin, was identified in 2003 by Luis Espinasa, an associate professor of biology at Marist College.

The population was 5,508 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Old Lycoming Township is a township in Lycoming County that is actually older than the county. It was formed as part of Northumberland County on August 22, 1785, ten years before the formation of Lycoming County. The original boundaries of the township encompassed much of the territory that was previously governed by the Fair Play Men. The land between Lycoming and Pine Creeks was outside of the legal boundaries of Pennsylvania until 1784 and the second Treaty of Fort Stanwix. The Fair Play Men operated a system of self-government from 1773 to 1785. Their claims to the land had no legal bearing in the state of Pennsylvania when it was finally legally part of the state. These men had some troubles gaining the title to the land that they had cleared and so long defended; ultimately, some obtained title to their lands, while others removed westward. In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna Valley, including what is now Old Lycoming Township, were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. In the early summer of 1778 news came of a group of Native American warriors, perhaps accompanied by Loyalist and British soldiers, heading for the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley to destroy settlements. There were many smaller incidents of violence against settlers, but on June 10, 1778 a party of sixteen settlers were attacked in what is now Williamsport. In what became known as the \\"Plum Tree Massacre\\", twelve of the sixteen were killed and scalped, including two women and six children. The Wyoming Valley Massacre occurred on July 3, 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre). This news caused the local authorities to order the evacuation of the whole West Branch valley. Most of the settlers did not return to their farms until after Sullivan's Expedition had driven off the Indian and Loyalist threat. John McMeens a native of South Carolina was one of the first to return to the area. He had settled along the river in 1776. He fled during the Big Runaway and returned in 1791. McMeens rose to a position of prominence in Lycoming County. He was a county commissioner, state commissioner and served on the initial committee that explored to possibility of building the Pennsylvania Canal that improved navigation on the Susquehanna River. McMeens also represented the area in the Pennsylvania General Assembly from 1814 to 1818. Derick Updegraff arrived in Old Lycoming Township from York County in 1787. He settled on land that had previously been improved during the Fair Play Men era. He was not able to claim legal control of his until 1793 as the result of a lawsuit over the land filed by the man who had previously claimed it. Updegraff and his sons improved the land by clearing many more acres and building what was one of the largest barns in Lycoming County.

The population was 1,259 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Piatt Township was formed from part of Mifflin Township by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania on April 30, 1857. The new township encompassed what was the southernmost part of Mifflin Township. Piatt Township is named for William Piatt who was an associate judge in Lycoming County when the township was created. When colonial settlers first arrived in what is now Piatt Township they were outside the western boundary of what was then the Province of Pennsylvania. These settlers were not under the jurisdiction or protection of any type from any of the Thirteen Colonies. They became known as the Fair Play Men. These men established their own form of government, known as the \\"Fair Play System\\", with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776 beneath the \\"Tiadaghton Elm\\" on the banks of Pine Creek. In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley, including Piatt Township, were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the \\"Big Runaway\\" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the \\"Little Runaway\\". Sullivan's Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. Larrys Creek, which bisects Piatt Township, is named for Larry Burt, the first settler in the area, who lived near the mouth of the creek near what is now the hamlet of Larrys Creek. He traded with the indigenous peoples and according to tradition had a Native American wife. Burt was already there when surveyors came through in 1769 (after the land was purchased in the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix), but disappeared sometime soon after, perhaps moving west with the Native Americans who left the area. Other settlers soon followed Burt to what is now Piatt Township. They settled along the banks of Larrys Creek near where the creek flows into the West Branch Susquehanna River. Peter Duffy was one of the most prominent of the early settlers. He settled with his family at the mouth of Larrys Creek in August 1784. Duffy's journey from County Kildare, Ireland was a long and difficult struggle. He left from Dublin in July 1775 during the early years of the American Revolution. Duffy was an acquaintance of Major John Pitcairn. Pitcairn was with the Royal Marines and was part of the British force that was occupying Boston, Massachusetts at the outset of the Revolution. Pitcairn was killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. This left Duffy without a point of contact in the Thirteen Colonies. Duffy and his family landed in Philadelphia in August 1775. After a short stay in the Philadelphia area, he and his family moved further inland to Lancaster County. The family spent seven years in the Lancaster area before moving to Coxestown, now known as Susquehanna Township, just north of Harrisburg in Dauphin County. The Duffy's owned a home along the banks of the Susquehanna River for about a year before it was flooded and accidentally burned in the winter of 1784. Duffy did not lot this stop him. He gathered is family and migrated further still into the Pennsylvania frontier. The Duffy family was joined by the Stewart family on their trip from Dauphin County to Lycoming County. Both families settled down to the east of what is now Jersey Shore. The Stewarts settled on the southern side of the West Branch Susquehanna River in Nippenose Township and the Duffys settled on the opposite shore in Piatt Township. Duffy built his home near where the Great Shamokin Path crossed Larrys Creek. This path became and important road in the settlement of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. Early pioneers trekked up the road as they continued to move ever westward. Duffy opened an inn that soon became an important stopping point for the pioneers. Duffy was unable to enjoy his prominence for very long. Late one evening, a pack of wolves attacked him along the Great Shamokin Path, and while he fended them off and returned home, he was weakened by the cold and the effort of defending himself. He came down with a severe and fatal cold. Duffy's widow Martha was left to manage the inn with the help of her children, whose numbers were soon reduced by the February 1807 death of their firstborn son James in an accident at a wedding party at Culbertson's Mill in Duboistown. Martha Duffy was left with her four remaining children. Her second daughter, Catharine, had married and moved with her husband to Meadville in Crawford County. The oldest daughter, Mary Ann, took over management of the inn. Bernard operated the family owned sawmill on Pine Creek, Margaret managed the Duffy family home, and Peter, the son, managed the family farm. These four Duffy children never married and spent the rest of their lives living together in the family home in Piatt Township. The area of land along the West Branch and Larrys Creek was previously known as \\"Level Corner\\". Many of the early settlers were attracted to this area of fertile farmland. Isaac Smith migrated to Piatt Township, from Chester County. Smith was a millwright and farmer. Robert Covenhoven was another prominent early settler. He was a veteran of the American Revolution having fought at the battles of Trenton and Princeton. Covenhoven had returned to the West Branch Valley just before the Big Runaway. Upon hearing of the approaching raiding Indians and Loyalist, Covenhoven rode west along the ridge of Bald Eagle Mountain to warn settlers at Fort Antes (opposite what is now Jersey Shore) and the western part of the valley. Covenhoven is listed as a Fair Play Man and one of the signers of the Tiadaghton Declaration of Independence. Following the Great Runaway Covenhoven continued to serve as a scout for the Patriot forces on the Pennsylvania Frontier. At the conclusion of the war he settled with his wife at Level Corner. They raised a family of three sons and five daughters. Covenhoven live a long life before dying at the age of 90. He is buried in Northumberland where he went to live with his daughter Nancy after his wife Mercy's death.

The population was 678 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. Picture Rocks is the birthplace of Warren Sprout, who won a gold medal at the Olympics. History Picture Rocks was incorporated as a borough on September 27, 1875 from Wolf Township, but its history began a century earlier. The earliest settlers, who arrived in 1773, observed Indian pictographs (no longer extant) in the Muncy Creek valley, and the borough occupies the site of a Munsee Indian village. Evidence of this is found in the arrowheads and other relics that have been found in the vicinity of the creek. The borough hall in Picture Rocks The first warrant for property in the Picture Rocks area was issued by the Province of Pennsylvania to Henry Rody on June 3, 1773. The land was used very little and passed through several hands until 1848 when it was sold to A. R. Sprout and Amos Burrows who went on to become the founding fathers of Picture Rocks. Sprout and Burrows worked to clear the land that was thought to be worthless of the rocks, logs and brush that covered it. They also rebuilt an abandoned sawmill and established a factory that manufactured sashes, doors, and window blinds. This factory, the first of its kind in the area, caused a stir among the local carpenters who believed that the ready made building materials would curtail their profitability. The original factory was later used by the Burrows Brothers Furniture Company before becoming the Handle and Excelsior Company. Another factory, located at the present intersection of U.S. Route 220 and Factory Street, manufactured ladders. The town grew up around the factory and soon other manufacturers arrived to harness the water power provided by Muncy Creek. People interested in purchasing lots in Picture Rocks were required to sign an agreement stating that they would not open a saloon or engage in the trafficking of liquor. This law was made by the residents and founders of the town, a majority of them being Baptists. The Baptists of Picture Rocks organized in 1840 and met for a while in a school house. A traveling preacher arrived in Picture Rocks one Saturday evening and found the school to be unfit for Sunday gatherings. After preaching on the following morning, he rallied the members of the congregation around the cause of building a proper house of worship. Under the guidance of their new pastor, the members of the Baptist Church built a log church building that was used until its replacement twenty-five years later by a larger facility. At the time of the borough's creation, Center Street was considered the main street for travelers. The original homes built by the Burrows and Sprout families still exist along Center Street and are easy to identify based upon their square shape with low pitched roof often with a widow's peak or lookout. Borough resident John Wesley Little achieved regional fame for his watercolor landscapes and images of rural farms and animals. His studio/home is located along Water Street. His original paintings are highly sought after at local auctions. The borough boasts two churches, the Baptist Church on Elm Street and the Methodist Church on Laurel Street. Located within the East Lycoming School District, Picture Rocks is home to George A. Ferrell Elementary School. This K-6 elementary school is recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School. The school was originally a fully inclusive school for students in first through twelfth grades with its own sports program. The school joined with others in neighboring Hughesville and nearby Lairdsville to form the East Lycoming School District.

The population was 329 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Pine Township was formed from parts of Brown, Cummings and Cogan House Townships on January 27, 1857. It was originally going to be called Kingston Township, for the Kingston House what was in English Center, but the name was changed to Pine in recognition of the vast stands of pine trees that covered much of the township. The geography and geology of Pine Township have played an important role in its history. Pine Township lies within the southern limits of the most recent ice age. This land was once covered with glaciers. As the glaciers receded they scoured the land creating a moraine, knob like hills, and kettle holes. Some of these kettles are at the top of the hill. This has caused the unusual formation of a swamp at the top of a hill. The effects of glaciation created soil characteristics that limited successful farming and steep hillsides that also cut down on the amount of farmable land. Therefore, trees have thrived in Pine Township. The old-growth forests were harvested in the mid-to-late 19th century during the lumber era that swept throughout the hills and valleys of Pennsylvania. Massive stands of hemlock and pine were chopped down and floated down Little Pine and Pine Creeks to the sawmills of Williamsport. Since the end of the lumbering era and thriving second growth forest has grown throughout Pine Township. John Norris and his wife were among the first to settle in Pine Township. They opened a \\"seminary\\" or school for girls in the wilderness. During the years it was opened it was one of very few schools in such a remote part of the country to focus on educating teen aged girls. A failed colony known as \\"English Settlement\\" plays a role in the history of northern Lycoming County. The Reverend John Hey, who claimed to be part of the \\"Independent Church of England\\" dreamt of acquiring a vast amount of land in the wilderness and establishing a utopia. Hey and some investing partners acquired of land for $21,757 in 1805. Hey next travelled to England to convince his countrymen, mostly from Chard, Somerset, England, to settle his new colony. Fifteen families agreed to move to Pine Township. When they arrived they did not find the paradise that was described to them by John Hey. What they found was a wilderness of massive trees, rocks and rocky soil. The Englishmen were not prepared for this. They had no experience with clearing any land for farming and the land that they managed to clear was too rocky for farming. The English Settlement was abandoned ten years after its founding. Those who managed to survive moved to more fertile land in the nearby area. The villages of Oregon Hill and English Center were founded by survivors of the failed English Settlement. Oregon Hill was the location of two churches, a blacksmith shop, and two stores along with several homes. The settlers of Oregon Hill were surprised to find that the land in the area was fertile unlike much of the surrounding land. English Center on Little Pine Creek was a milling town. The English Center Suspension Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

It includes the villages of Barbours and Proctor. The population was 771 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History=Colonial and Revolutionary era Plunketts Creek Township was formed from parts of Franklin Township, Lycoming County and what is now Davidson Township, Sullivan County by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in 1838. The township was once much larger in size, but several townships in both Lycoming and Sullivan Counties have been carved from its original boundaries. The township is named for Plunketts Creek which is a tributary of Loyalsock Creek. The creek is in turn named for Colonel William Plunkett who was a frontier doctor and militia officer during the pre- Revolution years in the Province of Pennsylvania. He was noted for his skill in dressing the wounds of pioneers who had been scalped by both the French and Indians during the French and Indian War. Plunkett was also a veteran of the Pennamite-Yankee War which pitted settlers from Connecticut to the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania against those who had been established in Pennsylvania prior to the Connecticut settlers arrival. He received title to land at what is now the mouth of Plunketts Creek. Therefore, the land surrounding the creek was generally known as \\"Plunketts Creek\\". The township was to originally be called Plunkett Township. Some residents of the township did not approve of this name. They questioned William Plunkett's loyalty for he had remained largely \\"passive\\" regarding the American Revolution. Some believed that he sympathized with the cause of the Tories during the Revolution. A compromise was reached by naming it Plunketts Creek Township. While others wanted to honor one of the first and most important settlers to the area. Pluketts Creek Township and the Loyalsock Creek valley (from the Doe Pen Vista in Rider Park). The first white man to live in Plunketts Creek Township was a man with the surname of Paulhamus. Tradition states that he was deserter during the Revolutionary War. He fled from the Red coats and cleared a small piece of land in the wilderness along Loyalsock Creek near the mouth of Bear Creek. Paulhamus was a squatter on the land from 1770 until 1776 when it is thought that he was forced to rejoin the British Army. Permanent settlers did not arrive in Plunketts Creek Township until 1818. Three men Donelly, Smith and Payne found the cabin that had been abandoned by Paulhamus. They expanded Paulhamus' improvements and began farming, fishing and hunting in the area. Logging and tanning era Logging was the principal industry in Plunketts Creek Township during the mid-to-late 19th century. Thousands of acres of old- growth forest were harvested and floated down Loyalsock Creek and its tributaries to one of the many sawmills that had sprung up throughout Lycoming County. There were several sawmills in Barbours, a village along Loyalsock Creek, in Plunketts Creek Township. In 1832, John Barbour built a sawmill on Loyalsock Creek near the mouth of Plunketts Creek, and the village of Barbours Mills (today Barbours) later developed at the site. In the 19th century, Barbours had several blacksmiths, a temperance hotel, post office, many sawmills, a school, store and wagon maker. In 1840, a road was built north from Barbours along Plunketts Creek, crossing it several times. This is the earliest possible date for construction of the bridge, but the surviving county road docket on the construction does not mention either bridges or fords for crossing the creek. A 1916 map showing Plunketts Creek and the four bridges over it between the villages of Barbours and Proctor The bridge is at the mouth of Coal Mine Hollow, and the road it was on was used by the lumber and coal industries, which were active in Plunketts Creek Township during the 19th century and early 20th century. Creeks in the township supplied water power to 14 mills in 1861, and in 1876 there were 19 sawmills, a shingle mill, a woolen factory, and a tannery there. Metadata here . For a summary, see page 4 of the PDF. These industries supported the inhabitants of two villages in Plunketts Creek Township by the latter half of the 19th century. In 1868 the village of Proctorville was built as a company town for Thomas E. Proctor's tannery. Proctor, as it is now known, is north of Barbours along Plunketts Creek. The bark from Eastern hemlock trees was used in the tanning process, and the village originally sat in the midst of vast forests of hemlock. The tannery employed \\"several hundred\\" at wages between 50 cents and US$1.75 a day. These employees lived in one hundred twenty company houses, which each rented for $2 a month. The article has a note that it was written in 1959, but the author's name was lost prior to publication in 1966. In 1892, Proctor had a barber shop, two blacksmiths, cigar stand, I.O.O.F hall, leather shop, news stand, a post office (established in 1885), a two-room school, two stores, and a wagon shop. Hemlock bark, used in the tanning process, was hauled to the tannery from up to away in both summer and winter, using wagons and sleds. The hides which were tanned to make leather came from the United States, and as far away as Mexico, Argentina, and China. Finished sole leather was hauled by horse-drawn wagon south about to Little Bear Creek, where it was exchanged for \\"green\\" hides and other supplies brought north from Montoursville. The lumber boom on Plunketts Creek ended when the virgin timber ran out. By 1898, the old growth hemlock was exhausted and the Proctor tannery, then owned by the Elk Tanning Company, was closed and dismantled. 20th century Without timber and the tannery, the populations of Proctor and Barbours declined. The Barbours post office closed in the 1930s and the Proctor post office closed on July 1, 1953. Both villages also lost their schools and almost all of their businesses. Proctor celebrated its centennial in 1968, and a 1970 newspaper article on its thirty-ninth annual \\"Proctor Homecoming\\" reunion called it a \\"near-deserted old tannery town\\". In the 1980s, the last store in Barbours closed, and the former hotel (which had become a hunting club) was torn down to make way for a new bridge across Loyalsock Creek. Plunketts Creek Township has been a place for both lumber and tourism since its villages were founded, and as industry declined, nature recovered. Second growth forests have since covered most of the clear-cut land. Pennsylvania's state legislature authorized the acquisition of abandoned and clear-cut land for Pennsylvania State Game Lands in 1919, and the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) acquired property along Plunketts Creek for State Game Lands Number 134 between 1937 and 1945. The main entrance to State Game Lands 134 is just north of the bridge site, on the east side of the creek. The PGC established the Northcentral State Game Farm in 1945 on part of State Game Lands 134 to raise wild turkey. The farm was converted to ringneck pheasant production in 1981, and, , it was one of four Pennsylvania state game farms producing about 200,000 pheasants each year for release on land open to public hunting.

The population was 1,633 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Porter Township, named for David R. Porter, governor of Pennsylvania (1839‚Äì1845), was formed from part of Mifflin Township on May 6, 1840. When colonial settlers first arrived in what is now Porter Township they were outside the western boundary of what was then the Province of Pennsylvania. These settlers were not under the jurisdiction or protection of any type from any of the Thirteen Colonies. They became known as the Fair Play Men. These men established their own form of government, known as the \\"Fair Play System\\", with three elected commissioners who ruled on land claims and other issues for the group. In a remarkable coincidence, the Fair Play Men made their own Declaration of Independence from Britain on July 4, 1776 beneath the \\"Tiadaghton Elm\\" on the banks of Pine Creek. During the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the \\"Big Runaway\\" occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Homes and fields were abandoned, with livestock driven along and a few possessions floated on rafts on the river east to Muncy, then further south to Sunbury. The abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the \\"Little Runaway\\". Sullivan's Expedition helped stabilize the area and encouraged resettlement, which continued after the war. Dr. James Davidson, a veteran of the American Revolution, served as a doctor for General Anthony Wayne's army, was one of the first and most successful settlers in the Porter Township area. He settled in the Sunbury just after the Revolution. After several years in that vicinity he bought a farm along the West Branch Susquehanna River in what is now western Lycoming County. Here he farmed and also served as the only doctor in the area for many years. Dr. Davidson built one of the first brick houses in the West Branch Susquehanna Valley. He also served as a judge for Lycoming County after it was formed in 1795. The Bridge in Porter Township was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

It was originally much larger in size and included a large part of what is now Sullivan County until 1847. It is named for Shrewsbury Township, New Jersey. Some of the first settlers, The Little and Bennett families, migrated to Lycoming County from New Jersey and wanted their new home to have the same name as their old home.

It is famous for hosting the Little League World Series. The population was 6,379 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History South Williamsport celebrated the centennial of its incorporation as a borough in 1986. On November 29, 1886, the Lycoming County court incorporated the villages of Rocktown, Billman, and vicinities as the borough of South Williamsport. The land had previously been part of Armstrong Township. The first recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna River valley were the Iroquoian speaking Susquehannocks. Their name meant \\"people of the muddy river\\" in Algonquian. Decimated by diseases and warfare, they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes by the early 18th century. The lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were then chiefly occupied by the Munsee clan or phratry of the Lenape, and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations of the Iroquois. The British purchased land from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, opening what is now Lycoming County to settlement. After the American Revolutionary War, Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County, on April 13, 1795. The county's area was originally over and several other counties were subsequently formed from it. Williamsport, across the river from South Williamsport, was also founded in 1795 and chosen as the county seat. The first settler in what is now South Williamsport is believed to have been Aaron Hagerman, a transplanted Hollander, who is thought to have arrived shortly after the end of the American Revolutionary War. Hagermans Run, which flows through the borough, bears his name. One of the predecessor communities was \\"Rocktown\\". And another was Bootstown. One of the first businesses was a tavern established near the mouth of Hagermans Run by Michael McDonough. Another early entrepreneur, Jacob Weiss, gave the village a push toward borough status by purchasing a tract of 40 acres and laying out town lots. Weiss also established a brickyard near McDonough‚Äôs tavern and for many years operated an oil mill and a gristmill. From those early times to the present, South Williamsport‚Äôs fortunes have been linked to those of Williamsport. Sawmills and furniture factories were among the most prosperous industries in both communities. Planing mills and woodworking factories of all types reached a peak of activity during the logging boom of the post-Civil War years of the last century. The industry gradually declined in the 1890s when the surrounding hills were finally stripped of saleable lumber and the logging crews moved west. Today, manufacturing diversity is the rule. The area is reforested with second-growth timber, providing scenic beauty as well as woodland recreational opportunities. In South Williamsport, prime employers include: Little League Baseball, Inc., Keystone Friction Hinge, South Williamsport Area School District and the New Lycoming Bakery. Although Bald Eagle Mountain to the south and the river on the north have restricted development in South Williamsport, growth has been steady. In 1890, there were 2,900 residents. About 600 young scholars attended 10 borough schools. The 2000 census counted 6,412 residents and today, 1,534 students are enrolled in three South Williamsport Area Schools Central Elementary (K-4) is on West Mountain Ave. Rommelt Elementary (5-6) is on West Central Ave. South Williamsport Area Jr./Sr. High School, Home of the Mountaineers, is on Percy Street.

Susquehanna Township was first surveyed in 1769. The surveyors named it \\"Upper Bottom\\" to distinguish from a piece of land further to the east that was named \\"Lower Bottom\\", present day Duboistown and South Williamsport. The first settlers arrived in 1801 and cleared the alluvial plain near the West Branch Susquehanna River and began farming. The village of Nisbet, a collection of about a dozen homes, rose up around the railroad station of the same name. Two grist mills and a small textile mill were built on Mill Run during the early days of Susquehanna Township. Susquehanna Township has grown somewhat since it was founded. The village of Nisbet underwent an expansion during the 1950s and 1960s and now serves as a bedroom community for Williamsport and Jersey Shore.

The citizens of the northern portion were strongly against division, but the township was divided against their wishes on September 12, 1851. Upper Fairfield Township was called Pollock Township during its first two years of existence. It was named for Judge James Pollock, president of the district court that ordered the township to be divided, and a controversial figure at the time.

The population was 1,613 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Washington Township was formed as part of Northumberland County in 1786. It originally extended from White Deer Hole Creek north to the West Branch Susquehanna River with its eastern boundary also formed by the west branch. The western limit was ambiguous, but most historians assumed that the western boundary followed a line that extended to the south opposite the mouth of Pine Creek in what is now eastern Clinton County. Washington Township is older than Lycoming County. Therefore, it was one of the original townships in Lycoming County. Seven additional townships were created from land that was originally part of Washington Township. They are Armstrong, Bastress, Brady, Clinton, Limestone, Nippenose, and Susquehanna Townships. The township is named for the hero of the American Revolution and the 1st President of the United States, George Washington. Historically, two trails of the native indigenous peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek in Washington Township. Settlers arrived by 1760, but fled in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War during The Big Runaway. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County and Washington Township when it was formed in 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting and small-scale lumbering continues. White Deer Hole Creek near the First Gap in South White Deer Ridge in Washington Township. The Great Island Path was a major trail that ran north along the Susquehanna River from the Saponi village of Shamokin at modern Sunbury, fording the river there and following the west bank of the West Branch Susquehanna River north until White Deer Hole valley. The path turned west at Allenwood and followed White Deer Hole Creek until about the present location of Elimsport in Washington Township. There it headed northwest, crossed North White Deer Ridge and passed west through the Nippenose valley, then turned north and crossed Bald Eagle Mountain via McElhattan Creek and ran along the south bank of the river to the Great Island (near the present day city of Lock Haven). In the American Revolutionary War, settlements throughout the Susquehanna valley were attacked by Loyalists and Native Americans allied with the British. After the Wyoming Valley battle and massacre in the summer of 1778 (near what is now Wilkes-Barre) and smaller local attacks, the Big Runaway occurred throughout the West Branch Susquehanna valley. Settlers fled feared and actual attacks by the British and their allies. Settlers abandoned their homes and fields, drove their livestock south, and towed their possessions on rafts on the river to Sunbury. Their abandoned property was burnt by the attackers. Some settlers soon returned, only to flee again in the summer of 1779 in the \\"Little Runaway\\". Beginning with the first settlers, much of the land along White Deer Hole Creek in Washington Township was slowly cleared of timber. Small sawmills were built in the 19th century, and a much larger lumber operation was run by the Vincent Lumber Company from 1901 to 1904. They built a narrow gauge railroad from Elimsport west into timber, and a line east to Allenwood in Union County and the Reading Railroad there. The lumber railroad ran parallel to the creek, with the end of the track near the Fourth Gap. It was incorporated on June 24, 1901 (around the time of construction) as the \\"Allenwood and Western Railroad\\". The lumbering operation ceased in 1904 when the forests were gone. The railroad was torn up, and its one second-hand Shay locomotive was moved to the Vincent Lumber Company operation at Denholm (in Juniata County). From 1900 to 1935, much of what is now Tiadaghton State Forest was purchased by Pennsylvania from lumber companies that had no further use for the clear-cut land. In the 1930s there were seven Civilian Conservation Corps camps to construct roads and trails in the forest. On May 31, 1985 around 10:30 pm a tornado tore through the eastern part of the township and went through the State Gamelands (Old Alvira) and continued into Union County with no warning. Twelve people were injured and one was killed. Small-scale lumbering continues in the Washington Township, but the forest is certified as well-managed \\"in an environmentally sensitive manner\\" and lumber from it qualifies for a \\"green label\\". An Amish-owned and operated sawmill is on Pennsylvania Route 44 in Elimsport. It burned down on May 10, 2006 (causing $500,000 in damages) but was expected to be back in operation in a month. Despite this small-scale lumbering, as of 2006 the forests have grown back and are mixed oak, with blueberry and mountain laurel bushes. White Deer Hole Creek and its tributaries also have stands of hemlock and thickets of rhododendron along them.

History Wolf Township was formed from part of Muncy Township by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the Peace of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in 1834. The township is named for George Wolf who was the governor of Pennsylvania from 1829 to 1835. The boroughs of Hughesville and Picture Rocks are on land that was taken from Wolf Township. Wolf Township today has grown to a population of 2,707 residents as of the 2000 census. This is up from 734 residents at the census of 1890. Quarries The geology of Wolf Township played a role in its history. Limestone was quarried west of Hughesville for use as lime. Lime is used in large quantities as building and engineering materials (including limestone products, concrete and mortar) and as chemical feedstocks, among other uses. Lime industries and the use of many of the resulting products date from prehistoric periods in both the Old World and the New World. Wolf Township was also the home to several Pennsylvania Bluestone quarries. Pennsylvania Bluestone has many uses, from cut dimensional stone used in patios, walkways and stair treads to architectural stone used in buildings. It is also used for wallstone, decorative boulders, natural steps and other landscape features. The name \\"Pennsylvania Bluestone\\" is due to its predominantly blue color and because the majority of stone is quarried in Pennsylvania.

The population of Woodward Township has grown to 2,397 as of the 2000 census. This is up from 817 during the 1890 census. The township, which is bisected by Quenshukeny Run, is semi-rural in nature. The northern parts of the township less heavily populated than the southern parts, which lie on U.S. Route 220 and serve as a suburb for Williamsport and Jersey Shore. When Woodward township was first settled by migrants from Europe it was outside the boundaries of the Province of Pennsylvania. These settlers were not under the rule or protection of the colonial government in Philadelphia. Together they formed their own form of government that was administered by a group of pioneers known as the Fair Play Men. These early settlers banded together to provide law and order to a land that was wild and dangerous. Brattan Caldwell, a native of County Kildare, Ireland, migrated to the Thirteen Colonies in 1770. He arrived in Philadelphia and from there moved to Lancaster County. He joined with other pioneers and they followed the Susquehanna River and West Branch Susquehann River into the frontier. Brattan Caldwell and the other settlers arrived in what is now Woodward Township in 1772. They cleared land along the river its tributaries. Caldwell married Elcy Hughes in the winter of 1775 on the south side of the river in Nippenose Township. This part of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley was under the jurisdiction and protection of the colonial government of Pennsylvania. The Hughes' were married by a Northumberland County Justice of the Peace. It was the first marriage to take place in the settlements west of Lycoming Creek.

Surfactants are molecules that spontaneously bond with each other to form sealed bubbles. NATURE  A New Chemical 'Tree of The Origins of Life' Reveals Our Possible Molecular Evolution  MICHELLE STARR  3 OCTOBER 2020 Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids, between a gas and a liquid, or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, or dispersants. The word \\"surfactant\\" is a blend of surface-active agent, coined . \\\\- \\"A new word, Surfactants, has been coined by Antara Products, General Aniline & Film Corporation, and has been presented to the chemical industry to cover all materials that have surface activity, including wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, detergents and foaming agents.\\" Agents that increase surface tension are \\"surface active\\" in the literal sense but are not called surfactants since their effect is opposite to the common meaning. A common example is salting out: by adding an inorganic salt to an aqueous solution of a weakly polar substance, the substance will precipitate. The substance may itself be a surfactant - this is one of the reasons why many surfactants are ineffective in sea water. Schematic diagram of a micelle ‚Äì the lipophilic tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The polar \\"heads\\" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a hydrophilic outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets (\\"emulsion breaking\\") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically amphiphilic in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it is sometimes known as a reverse micelle. Composition and structure Surfactants are usually organic compounds that are amphiphilic, meaning they contain both hydrophobic groups (their tails) and hydrophilic groups (their heads). Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and adsorb at interfaces between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase. World production of surfactants is estimated at 15 million tons per year, of which about half are soaps. Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (1.7 million tons/y), lignin sulfonates (600,000 tons/y), fatty alcohol ethoxylates (700,000 tons/y), and alkylphenol ethoxylates (500,000 tons/y).Kurt Kosswig \\"Surfactants\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants 4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants Structure of surfactant phases in water In the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as micelles, where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or lipid bilayers. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB). Surfactants reduce the surface tension of water by adsorbing at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the Gibbs isotherm. Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces The dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of absorption depend on the diffusion coefficient of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be ‚Äòkinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions. The surface rheology of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions. Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers Interfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the -pendant or spinning drop method. Dynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the maximum bubble pressure apparatus The structure of surfactant layers can be studied by ellipsometry or X-ray reflectivity. Surface rheology can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer. Surfactants in biology Phosphatidylcholine, found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant. Shown in ‚Äì choline and phosphate group; ‚Äì glycerol; ‚Äì monounsaturated fatty acid; ‚Äì saturated fatty acid. The human body produces diverse surfactants. Pulmonary surfactant is produced in the lungs in order to facilitate breathing by increasing total lung capacity, and lung compliance. In respiratory distress syndrome or RDS, surfactant replacement therapy helps patients have normal respiration by using pharmaceutical forms of the surfactants. One example of pharmaceutical pulmonary surfactants is Survanta (beractant) or its generic form Beraksurf produced by Abbvie and Tekzima respectively. Bile salts, a surfactant produced in the liver, play an important role in digestion.  Safety and environmental risks  Most anionic and non-ionic surfactants are non-toxic, having LD50 comparable to sodium chloride. The toxicity of quaternary ammonium compounds, which are antibacterial and antifungal, varies. Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides (DDAC, DSDMAC) used as fabric softeners have low LD50 (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the disinfectant alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg. Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the lipid membrane that protects skin and other cells. Skin irritancy generally increases in the series non-ionic, amphoteric, anionic, cationic surfactants. Surfactants are routinely deposited in numerous ways on land and into water systems, whether as part of an intended process or as industrial and household waste. Anionic surfactants can be found in soils as the result of sewage sludge application, wastewater irrigation, and remediation processes. Relatively high concentrations of surfactants together with multimetals can represent an environmental risk. At low concentrations, surfactant application is unlikely to have a significant effect on trace metal mobility. In the case of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, unprecedented amounts of Corexit were sprayed directly into the ocean at the leak and on the sea-water's surface. The apparent theory being that the surfactants isolate droplets of oil, making it easier for petroleum-consuming microbes to digest the oil. The active ingredient in Corexit is dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), sorbitan monooleate (Span 80), and polyoxyethylenated sorbitan monooleate (Tween-80). Biodegradation Because of the volume of surfactants released into the environment, their biodegradation is of great interest. Strategies to enhance degradation include ozone treatment and biodegradation. Two major surfactants, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) and the alkyl phenol ethoxylates (APE) break down under aerobic conditions found in sewage treatment plants and in soil to nonylphenol, which is thought to be an endocrine disruptor.Mergel, Maria. \\"Nonylphenol and Nonylphenol Ethoxylates.\\" Toxipedia.org.

Applications The annual global production of surfactants was 13 million tonnes in 2008. In 2014, the world market for surfactants reached a volume of more than US$33 billion. Market researchers expect annual revenues to increase by 2.5% per year to around $40.4 billion until 2022. The commercially most significant type of surfactants is currently the anionic surfactant LAS, which is widely used in cleaners and detergents.Market Study on Surfactants (2nd edition, April 2015), by Ceresana Research Surfactants play an important role as cleaning, wetting, dispersing, emulsifying, foaming and anti-foaming agents in many practical applications and products, including detergents, fabric softeners, motor oils, emulsions, soaps, paints, adhesives, inks, anti-fogs, ski waxes, snowboard wax, deinking of recycled papers, in flotation, washing and enzymatic processes, and laxatives. Also agrochemical formulations such as herbicides (some), insecticides, biocides (sanitizers), and spermicides (nonoxynol-9). Personal care products such as cosmetics, shampoos, shower gel, hair conditioners, and toothpastes. Surfactants are used in firefighting and pipelines (liquid drag reducing agents). Alkali surfactant polymers are used to mobilize oil in oil wells. The displacement of air from the matrix of cotton pads and bandages so that medicinal solutions can be absorbed for application to various body areas; the displacement of dirt and debris by the use of detergents in the washing of wounds; and the application of medicinal lotions and sprays to surface of skin and mucous membranes. Detergents in biochemistry and biotechnology In solution, detergents help solubilize a variety of chemical species by dissociating aggregates and unfolding proteins. Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS) and cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to extract protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipid bilayer (SDS, Triton X-100, X-114, CHAPS, DOC, and NP-40), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as octyl thioglucoside, octyl glucoside or dodecyl maltoside are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as enzymes and receptors without denaturing them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For electrophoresis, for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native tertiary and quaternary structures, allowing the separation of proteins according to their molecular weight. Detergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats. Pulmonary surfactants are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung alveoli in mammals. Quantum dot preparation Surfactants are used with quantum dots in order to manipulate the growth, assembly, and electrical properties of quantum dots, in addition to mediating reactions on their surfaces. Research is ongoing in how surfactants arrange on the surface of the quantum dots.  Surfactants in droplet-based microfluidics  Surfactants play an important role in droplet-based microfluidics in the stabilization of the droplets, and the prevention of the fusion of droplets during incubation. Classification The \\"tails\\" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a hydrocarbon chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. Fluorosurfactants have fluorocarbon chains. Siloxane surfactants have siloxane chains. Many important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly polar anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated (polyethylene oxide-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. Polypropylene oxides conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant. Surfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be double-chained. Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non- ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric. Most commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed zwitterionic. Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include: Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives  Anionic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as sulfate, sulfonate, phosphate, and carboxylates. Prominent alkyl sulfates include ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates sodium laureth sulfate (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and sodium myreth sulfate. Others include: *Docusate (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) *Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) *Perfluorobutanesulfonate * Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates * Alkyl ether phosphates Carboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as sodium stearate. More specialized species include sodium lauroyl sarcosinate and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as perfluorononanoate, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA or PFO). Cationic head groups pH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary amines; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10: octenidine dihydrochloride. Permanently charged quaternary ammonium salts: cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), benzalkonium chloride (BAC), benzethonium chloride (BZT), dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride, and dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide (DODAB). Zwitterionic surfactants Zwitterionic (amphoteric) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule. The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary amines or quaternary ammonium cations. The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the sultaines CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine. Betaines such as cocamidopropyl betaine have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the phospholipids phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelins. Lauryldimethylamine oxide and myristamine oxide are two commonly used zwitterionic surfactants of the tertiary amine oxides structural type.  Non-ionic  Non-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen- containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature. Non-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, biodegradability) or permission for use in food. = Ethoxylates  Fatty alcohol ethoxylates  * Narrow-range ethoxylate * Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether * Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether  Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs)  * Nonoxynols * Triton X-100  Fatty acid ethoxylates  Fatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.

Bradford is the principal city in the Bradford, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 8,770 at the 2010 United States Census. History Settled in 1823, Bradford was chartered as a city in 1879 and emerged as a wild oil boomtown in the Pennsylvania oil rush in the late 19th century. The area's Pennsylvania Grade crude oil has superior qualities and is free of asphaltic constituents, contains only trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen, and has excellent characteristics for refining into lubricants. The Bradford & Foster Brook Railway was built in 1876 as one of, if not the first, monorails in America, when Bradford was a booming oil town. World-famous Kendall racing oils were produced in Bradford. Bradford was the site of an important step in the development of personal aviation. In the 1930s, the Taylor Brothers Aircraft Corporation produced an airplane called the Taylor Cub in Bradford. After a fire at the factory, the company was bought by William T. Piper. After relocating his factory to Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, Piper resumed production of a revised design of the airplane first produced in Bradford, which became the world-famous Piper Cub. The population peaked at 19,306 in 1930, but at the 2010 census had dropped to 8,770. Two adjoining townships, home to approximately 9,000 people, make the population of Greater Bradford about 18,000. Famous Bradfordians include the opera singer Marilyn Horne, the Hall of Fame baseball player Rube Waddell and the five-time All-Star football player Stew Barber. A famous perpetual motion machine hoax was created in Bradford in 1897 by J.M. Aldrich; it was exposed in the July 1, 1899, issue of the Scientific American magazine, leading to a four-month prison sentence in the county jail. The Bradford Armory, Bradford Downtown Historic District, Bradford Old City Hall, and Rufus Barrett Stone House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Economy  Zippo museum & manufacturing facility. Bradford is the home of Zippo (est. 1932), a manufacturer of collectible pocket lighters, and Case (est. in Bradford in 1905), which is owned by Zippo and makes hunting, fishing, folding pocketknives, and collectibles. In February 2009, the two companies employed 1,117 people, but significant layoffs have taken place since. After Zippo and Case, the second largest employer is Bradford Regional Medical Center (BRMC), which employed 759 in February 2009. BRMC underwent a significant campus expansion in 2006. Other major employers in February 2009 included Beacon Light (682 employees), which is responsible for overseeing troubled youth. Bradford Area School District (474) and Wal-Mart (378). FCI McKean nearby employed 301 at that time. The city is home to American Refining Group (formerly Kendall), and their line of specialty products. Along with being Bradford's longest running active business, ARG is the oldest continuously operating refinery in the United States. It celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2006. Since ARG purchased the refinery in the mid-1990s, employment has almost doubled to just under 300 in February 2009. Bradford has a four-year college, the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford (Pitt-Bradford), which in the fall term 2009 had 1,455 full-time students and 202 part-time students for a total enrollment of 1,657, with 217 full-time employees and 106 part-time employees. Almost 900 students live on campus. The city's shopping mall and many of its chain businesses are located just north of the city line in Foster Brook. Arts and entertainment The Bradford Creative and Performing Arts Center season runs from September to March. The Bromeley Family Theater at The University of Pittsburgh at Bradford hosts many events in the University's Spectrum Series that brings authors, artists, musicians, recitalists and performance groups to campus with all events open to the public. Theater productions are staged by the theater departments at Pitt-Bradford and the high school and by the Bradford Little Theater (BLT), which celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2006. BLT also operates Togi's Playhouse for smaller productions. An annual community talent show, Kiwanis Kapers, occurs in the fall. In May 2017, the Marilyn Horne Museum and Exhibit Center opened in downtown Bradford. Part of the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford, the 3,400 square-foot exhibition space celebrates the life and career of American mezzo- soprano, Marilyn Horne. The museum highlights objects from Horne's personal archive, which is housed at the University of Pittsburgh. Annual festivals include Stinkfest (a festival promoting leek cuisine), Summer Daze (formerly known as Summerfest), Autumn Daze, the Italian Festival, the Zippo/Case International Swap Meet (biennial, with Zippo Days held in off years) and the Crook Farm Country Fair. In early August, the annual Big 30 Charity high school all star football game takes place at Parkway Field, where a million- dollar artificial playing surface was installed in 2008. In 2009, for the first time, National Night Out was a significant event in Bradford, coinciding with Taste of Bradford. A First Night celebration is held on New Year's Eve, complete with a ball drop of its own.

Geography Bradford is located on U.S. Route 219 just south of its junction with Interstate 86 north of the New York border. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Bradford is situated in a valley in the Allegheny Mountains and is surrounded by woods and steep hills. Two branches of the Tunungwant Creek enter the city, merge and flow north into the Allegheny River just across the New York border. Bradford Regional Airport is located about south of the city, at Mount Alton. The elevation of the city is 1,443 feet (440 meters) above sea level, but the airport is at an elevation of 2,142 feet (653 meters) above sea level. Because of the higher elevation, the airport often has the coldest reported air temperatures in Pennsylvania. The airport has one of the few National Weather Service stations across the entire northern tier of the state. Temperatures in the city are typically three to seven degrees warmer than at the airport due to the difference in elevation, and actual city temperatures are more representative of other communities in northern Pennsylvania and southwestern New York than are the airport's. Climate Bradford has a humid continental climate with long, snowy winters and warm, humid summers. The record low in Bradford is set in February 1934 and the record high is in July 1936 and again in July 1986. Other notable extremes include a recording on November 29, 1930, and on November 30, 1929, a recording on April 1, 1923, an degree reading on March 30, 1986 and March 29, 1998, and a degree reading on August 29, 1982. Late fall/early winter is especially snowy due to heavy amounts of lake effect snow from Lake Erie and, to a lesser extent, Lake Ontario. Lake effect snow during cold snaps in early spring also helps to raise snowfall totals. Recreation Bradford is located within miles of the Allegany State Park in New York, the third-largest state park in the United States, and the Allegheny National Forest, the only national forest in Pennsylvania. The Tuna Valley Trails Association has constructed several miles of trails in the community, with a master plan of over currently being planned, funded and implemented. Parks in the city include Callahan Park, with swimming pools, tennis courts and an enclosed ice skating rink, and Hanley Park, with a large playground, horseshoe pits and a skate park. The surrounding area has two golf courses, the Pennhills Club in Bradford Township and Pine Acres Golf Course near Marshburg.

Culture Eldred is the home of the Kendall Bridge. This bridge is reportedly one of only a few bridges in the world in which a road turns off the suspended section off the bridge creating a suspended intersection. This bridge also spans the Allegheny River, a small road, as well as a railroad line that runs through the small town. This railroad is owned by Western New York & Pennsylvania Rail Road. Eldred is also home to the World War II Museum. During the war, Eldred was the site of a munitions plant that produced eight million bombs, mortar shells and fuses. Fifteen hundred people worked there, 24 hours a day, from January 1942 to May 1945, supporting the war effort. The museum opened on Memorial Day 1996 and is dedicated to the U.S. fighting forces and the 40 million people on the homefront who provided the materials needed to win the war. Fire Apparatus Museum The Andy Leider Fire Truck Collection is moving from Middletown, NY to Eldred. They bought the old Ethan Allen property to greatly expand the current facility. ‚ÄúWe will now have the largest vintage motorized fire truck museum, restoration plant, and storage facility in the country, located at the former Ethan Allen property in Eldred,‚Äù Leider said. ‚ÄúWe look forward to opening our new facility in McKean County, Pennsylvania.‚Äù References Category:Populated places established in 1815 Category:Boroughs in McKean County, Pennsylvania Category:1880 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Eldred, Pennsylvania"},{"id":"133183","text":"Eldred Township is a township in McKean County, Pennsylvania, United States.

Nicknames  * Kane is known as the Black Cherry Capital of the World because of its thick forest cover and strong logging industry. * Kane has also been known for many years as the \\"Ice Box of Pennsylvania\\" because of extremely cold temperatures reported during winter months.  History  Kane was founded by Major General Thomas L. Kane and his wife Elizabeth Denniston Wood Kane, M.D. Thomas L. Kane was the second son of Judge John Kintzing Kane of Philadelphia, a prominent associate of Presidents Jackson and Polk. In 1846, then Colonel Kane aided the Mormons on their flight west from Nauvoo, Illinois, to the Great Salt Lake; he arranged for them to winter on Indian lands near Council Bluffs, Iowa. In 1858, Colonel Kane prevented the \\"Utah War\\" between 2500 US Army soldiers, under A.S. Johnston, and the Mormons, under Kane's personal friend, Brigham Young. Thomas L. Kane was offered the Utah Territorial Governorship, but insisted that the position go to Brigham Young. Although never a religious convert to the Latter-day Saints, General Kane remained a personal, political, and legal adviser to Brigham Young until Young's death. General Kane's older brother was Elisha Kent Kane, America's most prominent Arctic explorer before the Civil War. The General's wife and three of their four children became physicians in Kane. Their oldest son, Evan O'Neill Kane, M.D., demonstrated the efficacy of local anesthesia on two occasions by performing surgery on himself‚Äîonce repairing an inguinal hernia, and once removing his own appendix. The Kane mansion, Anoatok, Kane Armory, Thomas L. Kane Memorial Chapel, and the New Thomson House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Due to its elevation, Kane had many summer vacationers in the 1950s and 1960s who stayed there for various periods during the late summer and fall months to avoid the effects of hay fever and allergies present at lower elevations in the days before air conditioning was prevalent.  Kane Tornado of 1985  On May 31, 1985 a tornado destroyed many homes in Kane and neighboring East Kane. The F4 tornado passed through the town at approximately 8:15 PM.

The tanker truck was trying to negotiate a left-hand turn at Kane's only stop light from North Fraley Street (Route 6) to Greeves St. (Route 6) at roughly 4:30 a.m. The truck carrying the highly flammable gas rolled onto its side and came to a rest just feet from the New Thomson House. The Kane Area School District, on its second day of school, had to cancel classes and use the Kane Area High School as a shelter for the evacuated citizens. It was reported that if the gas was ignited, the blast radius would cover at least a half mile, essentially incinerating the business district of the town. At 4:45 p.m., PennDOT opened the road and citizens were permitted to return to their homes.http://www.yourerie.com/story/tanker-truck-filled-with-butane-overturns- in-kane/d/story/7dELLYAR9UeclvpcY_ZCjw  Industry  The Holgate Toy Company was for many years based in Kane. One of the more famous toys they manufactured was a wooden replica of the Mister Rogers Trolley car, seen in every single episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.Holgate Wood Toys featuring Mister Rogers' Neighborhood - HolgateToy The company has since relocated to Bradford. Kane Area School District The Kane Area School District has two schools that house the district's 1,220 students (as of the 2013-14 school year). The Kane Area High School, which opened in 1972, is located just outside Kane in Wetmore Township. The high school sits on the former site of General Thomas Kane's homestead, which burned to the ground in 1896. The high school auditorium stage is roughly where Gen. Kane's front porch would have sat, looking out over the valley where the present-day football field and track sit. The high school houses grades nine through twelve. The Kane Area Elementary-Middle School is located on West Hemlock Avenue and opened in 2010. The existing middle school was renovated in a multimillion-dollar project by the district, and a new elementary wing was added on the east side of the former junior high. The elementary-middle school houses students from kindergarten through eighth grade. The construction of the new addition at the middle school was in response to the KASD Board of Directors voting to close the Mount Jewett Elementary School and the Chestnut St. Elementary School. Mount Jewett closed after the 2006-07 school year, while Chestnut St. closed after the 2009-10 school year. The Mount Jewett school has since been sold to a private businessman. The Chestnut St. Complex is currently owned by Kane Innovations and used as office space for Kane Innovations, the KASD, Head Start and the Intermediate Unit 9.

Interesting facts * The Kinzua Bridge State Park is located just a few miles north of Mount Jewett's borough line. It was used to carry trains across the Kinzua valley overlooking the town of Kushequa, Pennsylvania. Originally constructed in 1882, the structure was the highest iron bridge in the world. In 1900 it was turned into a steel structure. Upon becoming a state park an independent company used the bridge to carry sight seers and tourists across the valley in an old steam locomotive. On July 21, 2003 a tornado destroyed a large portion of the bridge.Pennsylvania State Parks - Kinzua Bridge Now all that remains is a portion of the bridge and a small section of railroad track at each end of the valley. In another devastating blow, on early Sunday March 16, 2008 the locomotives used to carry sightseers across the Kinzua Bridge were severely damaged by a fire set by arsonists.Vosler, A. (2008, March 17). Arson fire in Kane causes $1 million in damage, severely burns two locomotives once used for Kinzua Bridge State Park tourist trips. In The Bradford Era.

The residents of Mount Jewett would watch the train daily as it passed through town--directly to the north of the borough building. This further dampened the dream of rebuilding the bridge. :The state decided not to rebuild the Kinzua Bridge, which would have cost an estimated $45 million. Instead, the ruins were to become a visitor attraction used to show the forces of nature at work. Kinzua Bridge State Park had attracted 215,000 visitors annually before the bridge collapsed, and was one of twenty state parks chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its list of \\"Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". The viaduct and its collapse were featured in the History Channel's Life After People as an example of how corrosion and high winds would eventually lead to the collapse of any steel structure. : :The Knox and Kane Railroad was forced to suspend operations in October 2004 after a 75 percent decline in the number of passengers, brought about by the collapse of the Kinzua Bridge. The Kovalchick Corporation bought the Knox and Kane's tracks and all other property owned by the railroad, including the locomotives and rolling stock. The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the East Broad Top Railroad and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before selling it to the state in 1963. : :Pennsylvania released $700,000 to design repairs on the remaining towers and plan development of the new park facilities in June 2005. In late 2005, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) put forward an $8 million proposal for a new observation deck and visitors' center, with plans to allow access to the bridge and a hiking trail giving views of the fallen towers. The Kinzua Sky Walk was opened on September 15, 2011 in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Sky Walk consists of a pedestrian walkway to an observation deck with a glass floor at the end of bridge that allows views of bridge and the valley directly below. The walkway cost $4.3 million to construct, but is estimated to bring in $11.5 million in tourism revenue for the region. * Mount Jewett made world news in February 2001 when an explosion at the Temple Inland particle board plant killed several workers and injured many moreNational News Briefs; 10 Hurt in Blast and Fire At a Pennsylvania Plant - New York Times * The population of Mount Jewett includes a significant number of people with Swedish ancestry.

The population was 2,157 at the 2010 census. The town's tree-lined streets lie in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, 30 miles west of the Allegheny River's headwaters. History Originally known as Canoe Place, the town's name was changed to Port Allegany in 1838. It is unusual among places in Pennsylvania that make reference to the Allegheny River; it used the spelling \\"Allegany,\\" more commonly encountered in place names in neighboring New York. The town developed as a port on the Allegheny River, and provided a place where travelers coming overland from the Susquehanna River could continue by boat. Economy In the 1800s natural gas was discovered in the area, which led to the expansion of industries including glass firms, chemical plants, cheese factories, machine shops, brick plants, sawmills, planing mills and tanneries. The area also produces crude oil and it is not unusual to see small gas or oil wells and storage tanks in fields, forests or back yards in the region. The introduction of hydraulic fracturing produced an increase in local production of gas and oil, and a boost to the local economy, in the 2000s and 2010s. Port Allegany has long been associated with glass manufacturing. Saint-Gobain, a glass container producer, is located there, in a facility that has been owned at different stages by Pierce Glass and Ball-Incon. A concrete tower that is part of the manufacturing plant is the tallest structure in Port Allegany and is visible from most of the small downtown area. From 1937 to 2016, Port Allegany was also home to a factory of the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation. The \\"PC\\", as the factory was known locally, was the only producer of architectural glass building blocks in the United States, and also produced foamglas insulation. In the middle of the 20th century, the town was home to a factory that manufactured Kewpie dolls. Geography Port Allegany is located at (41.814919, -78.279218). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. Port Allegany is located in McKean County, which is generally considered to be part of the Northern Pennsylvania region (and sometimes part of the Northern Tier region). This part of the state is rural and heavily forested. Before the arrival of the first European settlers, the area was densely forested with Eastern Hemlock. Many of these sometimes massive trees were cut for lumber or sometimes only for their bark, which was used in the tanning industry. The rough and ready lifestyles and skills of the men who did this work are commemorated each year at the \\"Barkpeelers' Festival\\" at the Pennsylvania Lumber Museum in nearby Ulysses, Pennsylvania. Many older homes, barns and other buildings in the region were at least partly built with hemlock lumber. The contemporary forests in the region produce high quality black cherry lumber, valued in the furniture and cabinetry industries. While there are currently no working furniture factories in the region, the trade in black cherry continues.

The first magnetic toys in the country were invented in Smethport in 1908. The Wooly Willy toy, a hit in the 1950s and still in production, was created in Smethport by Donald and James Herzog of the Smethport Specialty Company.

The population was 5,111 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Youngstown-Warren- Boardman, OH-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Once dubbed \\"The Magic City,\\" Farrell sprung up practically overnight when a steel mill was constructed in 1901 on a plain bordering the Shenango River, near Sharon, Pennsylvania, in what was then part of Hickory Township (now Hermitage). The community name was at the beginning South Sharon. In 1912, the population reached 10,000. At that time the residents of the new city elected to take the name of Farrell, after industrialist James A. Farrell.(Farrell Golden Jubilee 1901-1951.) The community was incorporated as the Borough of South Sharon in 1916; its population peaked at over 15,000 in 1920 and its status was elevated to a third-class city in 1932. In 1939, artist Virginia Wood Riggs was commissioned to paint the mural Myths of Vulcan and Juno in the towns post office. The mural was painted over in 1966.Park, Marlene and Gerald E. Markowitz, Democratic vistas: Post Offices and Public Art in the New Deal, Temple University Press, Philadelphia 1984 The mill, which eventually became known as the Roemer Works of Sharon Steel Corporation, would serve as the community's lifeblood until 1992, when it was liquidated after filing bankruptcy. Many of the assets were sold at auction to Britain-based Caparo Corporation and later to Swiss steelmaker Duferco, which operates the plant today. Farrell was designated a financially distressed municipality in 1987 by the state of Pennsylvania.

Program for Fredonia Centennial Celebration. William Simmons built the first store in the small village. Based upon the success of his business and the further gains that could be made after the construction of a proposed railroad, Simmons purchased the land that became the borough of Fredonia and had it surveyed and divided into lots. The land came was purchased from two ‚ÄúDonation tracts,‚Äù which were tracts of land given to Revolutionary War soldiers in an attempt to encourage them to continue to serve. The name ‚ÄúFredonia‚Äù came from Simmon‚Äôs ‚Äúfree‚Äù donation of the land for the town square and as a nod to the ‚ÄúDonation‚Äù tracts from which the land was purchased. The first post office was established in 1870 and Fredonia was officially incorporated in August 1876. Fredonia was serviced by passenger train between 1869 and 1955. The Fredonia Volunteer Fire Department was established in 1934 and has continued to host their ‚ÄúOld Home Week‚Äù festival each summer since 1935.  Notable Facts  Fredonia was home to the Fredonia Institute, also known as a ‚Äúnormal academy‚Äù or ‚Äúselect school.‚Äù This higher education institution trained individuals who went on to become physicians, attorneys, teachers, ministers, and enter into other professions. It was incorporated in 1874 and boasted a library established by Andrew Carnegie. During the Depression, the borough applied for and received Works Progress Administration funds. The funds were used to pave streets and construct a water system to provide water service to the town that had previously relied on streams, individual wells, and cisterns. The WPA also provided workers who helped construct Fredonia-Delaware High School. This stone building was built in 1942 on Delaware Road and served first as a high school until 1960 when it began to be used as an elementary school within Reynolds School District. The elementary school was closed by the district in the mid-1990s, and the building was subsequently purchased and converted into a personal care and independent living facility. Since the 1940s, Fredonia has also been home to a diner created from a trolley car. The trolley car came from the Harmony Line of the interurban trolley line that ran from New Castle, PA to Pittsburgh, PA.

History Formerly known as Hickory Township (hence Hickory High School with its Hickory Hornet mascot), the City of Hermitage, in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, was first settled in 1796, and the Township of Hickory was incorporated in 1832 from portions of the Shenango and Pymatuning townships. Following the incorporation of the cities of Sharon and Farrell and the boroughs of Sharpsville and Wheatland, the remainder of the Township was incorporated into a First Class Township.

It cannot be issued to compel an authority to do something against statutory provision. For example, it cannot be used to force a lower court to reject or authorize applications that have been made, but if the court refuses to rule one way or the other then a mandamus can be used to order the court to rule on the applications. Mandamus may be a command to do an administrative action or not to take a particular action, and it is supplemented by legal rights. In the American legal system it must be a judicially enforceable and legally protected right before one suffering a grievance can ask for a mandamus. A person can be said to be aggrieved only when they are denied a legal right by someone who has a legal duty to do something and abstains from doing it. Legal requirements The party requesting a writ of mandamus to be enforced should be able to show that they have a legal right to compel the respondent to do or refrain from doing the specific act. The duty sought to be enforced must have two qualities:RK Choudhary's Law of Writs; Mandamus. It must be a duty of public nature and the duty must be imperative and should not be discretionary. Furthermore, mandamus will typically not be granted if adequate relief can be obtained by some other means, such as appeal. Purpose The purpose of mandamus is to remedy defects of justice. It lies in the cases where there is a specific right but no specific legal remedy for enforcing that right. Generally, it is not available in anticipation of any injury except when the petitioner is likely to be affected by an official act in contravention of a statutory duty or where an illegal or unconstitutional order is made. The grant of mandamus is therefore an equitable remedy; a matter for the discretion of the court, the exercise of which is governed by well-settled principles.Gangadhar Narsingdas Agrawal v. Union of India, AIR 1967 Goa 142 (147); Regional Director v. AS Bhangoo, (1969) 73 Cal. WN 267; Megh Nath v. Director, Technical Education, UT Chandigarh, 1990 (1) RSJ 126. Mandamus being a discretionary remedy, the application for it must be made in good faith and not for indirect purposes. Acquiescence cannot, however, bar the issue of mandamus. The petitioner must, of course, satisfy the Court that they have the legal right to the performance of the legal duty as distinct from mere discretion of authority.Basantilal v. Laxminarayan, 1970 MPLJ (Note) 6. A mandamus is normally issued when an officer or an authority by compulsion of statute is required to perform a duty and that duty, despite demand in writing, has not been performed. In no other case will a writ of mandamus issue unless it be to quash an illegal order. Types There are three kinds of mandamus: #Alternative mandamus: A mandamus issued upon the first application for relief, commanding the defendant either to perform the act demanded or to appear before the court at a specified time to show cause for not performing it. #Peremptory mandamus: An absolute and unqualified command to the defendant to do the act in question. It is issued when the defendant defaults on, or fails to show sufficient cause in answer to, an alternative mandamus.Legal Dictionary.Mongabay.com . #Continuing mandamus: A mandamus issued to a lower authority in general public interest asking the officer or the authority to perform its tasks expeditiously for an unstipulated period of time for preventing miscarriage of justice.Vineet Narain v. Union of India, AIR 1996 SC 3386. In various countries=Parliamentary democraciesAustralia= Under the Australian legal system, mandamus is available through section 75(v) of the Constitution of Australia. Original jurisdiction of High Court.. =England and Wales= In England and Wales, mandamus was originally known as a writ of mandamus. Historically, direct orders from the monarch to subjects commanding the performance of particular acts were common, and to this class of orders mandamus originally belonged. It became customary for the Court of King's Bench, in cases where a legal duty was established but no sufficient means existed for enforcing it, to order performance by this writ. This source reports further details of the mandamus procedure as it stood at the time. Mandamus more recently became known as an order of mandamus. This procedure was renamed by the Civil Procedure (Modification of Supreme Court Act 1981) Order 2004 to become a mandatory order. =India= In India, the sine qua non for mandamus is the existence of a statutory public duty incumbent upon the person or body against whom the mandamus is sought. There must equally co- exist a corresponding right in the petitioner entitling him to claim the enforcement of such public duty. These two preconditions form the foundation for the issue of mandamus. The primary scope and function of mandamus is to \\"command\\" and \\"execute\\" rather than to \\"enquire\\" and \\"adjudicate\\". It cannot be issued to change the decision of a body so as to suit the petitioner. Obligations which are not of statutory nature cannot be enforced by mandamus.R.P. Kapoor v. Delhi Development Authority. The writ petition is not maintainable when a remedy provided for under the Code of Civil Procedure is available. For example, the High Court cannot entertain writ petitions for mandamus to the Government who fails to deposit and pay in the requisite time an enhanced compensation account as ordered by a lower Court. The petitioners in this case would be directed to approach the executing Court for appropriate relief.Government of AP v. Puniparthi Narayana Rajiu, 2002 Andhr. LT. 113 at pp. 113-114. Only the Supreme Court and High Courts are empowered to exercise Writ Jurisdiction, under Art. 32 and 226 of Constitution. No other courts are empowered to issue writ. mandmus:- It means court can ask common people, authorities to do or no to do some task. It does not come against president, governor, parliament, state legislature, private bodies, and individual persons. United States In the administrative law context in the United States, the requirement that mandamus can be used only to compel a ministerial act has largely been abandoned. By statute or by judicial expansion of the writ of mandamus in most of the U.S. states, acts of administrative agencies are now subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion. Judicial review of agencies of the United States federal government, for abuse of discretion, is authorized by the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act. =Federal courts= The authority of the United States district courts (trial courts) to issue mandamus has been expressly abrogated by Rule 81(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,Fed.R.Civ.P. 81 as amended, December 1, 2014. (b) \\"The writs of scire facias and mandamus are abolished. Relief previously available through them may be obtained by appropriate action or motion under these rules.\\" but relief in the nature of mandamus can be had by other remedies provided for in the Rules, where provided by statute, or by use of the District Court's equitable powers. In the context of mandamus from a United States Court of Appeals to a United States District Court, the Supreme Court has ruled that the appellate courts have discretion to issue mandamus to control an abuse of discretion by the lower court in unusual circumstances, where there is a compelling reason not to wait for an appeal from a final judgment.Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for Dist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 390 (2004). This discretion is exercised very sparingly. It is exercised with somewhat greater frequency, although still sparingly, in the context of discovery disputes involving privileged materials, since a district court order erroneously forcing the disclosure of privileged material may never be remediable through a later appeal. In the case In Re Electronic Privacy Information Center (2013), privacy advocates sought a writ of mandamus directly from the Supreme Court to halt the National Security Agency's bulk phone record collection program. The Supreme Court denied the petition. More recently, the Supreme Court sided with the US Government and issued a writ of mandamus related to discovery in a court case involving the rescinding of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. =State courts= In some state court systems, mandamus has evolved into a general procedure for discretionary appeals from non-final trial court decisions. In some U.S. states, such as the courts of California, the writ is now called mandate instead of mandamus, and may be issued by any level of the state court system to any lower court or to any government official. It is still common for Californians to bring \\"taxpayer actions\\" against public officials for wasting public funds through mismanagement of a government agency, where the relief sought is a writ of mandate compelling the official to stop wasting money and fulfill his duty to protect the public fisc.See, e.g., Humane Society of the United States v. State Bd. of Equalization, 152 Cal. App. 4th 349 (2007). The writ of mandate is also used in California for interlocutory appeals. In this context, the party seeking the writ is treated on appeal like a plaintiff, the trial court becomes the defendant, and the opponent is designated as the \\"real party in interest\\". In Virginia, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction under the state constitution for mandamus involving the Virginia courts.Child Custody Resources Elsewhere, including the Courts of New York, have replaced mandamus (as well as the other prerogative writs) with statutory procedures. In New York, this is known as an Article 78 review after the civil procedure law provision that created the relevant procedure.New York Civil Practice Law and Rules article 78 at the New York State Assembly website. Accessed June 28, 2011. In still other states, such as Illinois, the state court of last resort has original jurisdiction in mandamus actions.Illinois Constitution, Article VI. In North Carolina state courts, mandamus is authorized as one of the Extraordinary Writs, under Rule 22 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure. The writ of mandamus may be issued in instances where, for instance, the lower court fails to timely issue a written order after rendition (thus precluding both the possibility of an appeal or enforcement of the rendition and leaving the litigants in limbo). The North Carolina Court of Appeals has spoken on the possible course of action in such situations, and confirmed that petitioning for a writ of mandamus is the only available route. McKyer v. McKyer, 202 N.C.App. 771 at *4 (2010) (unpublished) In McKyer, the lawyer who was unable to persuade the trial court judge to enter an order for about a year, tried to remedy the problem by asking the trial court judge to hold another hearing. Disapproving of the attempted resolution via a new hearing, the Court of Appeals, citing to the Supreme Court case In re T.H.T.,In re T.H.T. 362 N.C. 446, 665 S.E.2d 54 (2008). explained that a party seeking recourse where the trial court has not entered its orders timely should petition for writ of mandamus. Similarly, the writ may issue where the trial court fails or refuses to timely dispose with the litigants' business (for instance, if the judge refuses to hear a case). In North Carolina, as elsewhere, the writ is an action against the official, meaning that the petition must be styled \\"In re Public Figure X\\" or \\"In re Judge Y\\". Thus, a mandamus petition not only brings the strife of optically making the officer or judge the defendant, but also in theory requires the official / judge to respond \\"within ten days\\" \\"with supporting affidavits\\". Curiously, Rule 22(c) provides that \\"any party\\" may respond to the petition for writ. The North Carolina Court of Appeals has interpreted this to mean that where, for instance, one litigant demands that the judge enter a previously rendered order, the other litigant in the same case is free to respond instead of (or in addition to) the judge that presides over both of the litigants.

The Spanish conquest of the Yucat√°n Peninsula was hindered by its politically fragmented state. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. Spanish weaponry included broadswords, rapiers, lances, pikes, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Maya warriors fought with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones, and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish introduced a number of Old World diseases previously unknown in the Americas, initiating devastating plagues that swept through the native populations. The first encounter with the Yucatec Maya may have occurred in 1502, when the fourth voyage of Christopher Columbus came across a large trading canoe off Honduras. In 1511, Spanish survivors of the shipwrecked caravel called Santa Mar√≠a de la Barca sought refuge among native groups along the eastern coast of the peninsula. Hern√°n Cort√©s made contact with two survivors, Ger√≥nimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero, six years later. In 1517, Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba made landfall on the tip of the peninsula. His expedition continued along the coast and suffered heavy losses in a pitched battle at Champot√≥n, forcing a retreat to Cuba. Juan de Grijalva explored the coast in 1518, and heard tales of the wealthy Aztec Empire further west. As a result of these rumours, Hern√°n Cort√©s set sail with another fleet. From Cozumel he continued around the peninsula to Tabasco where he fought a battle at Potonch√°n; from there Cort√©s continued onward to conquer the Aztec Empire. In 1524, Cort√©s led a sizeable expedition to Honduras, cutting across southern Campeche, and through Pet√©n in what is now northern Guatemala. In 1527 Francisco de Montejo set sail from Spain with a small fleet. He left garrisons on the east coast, and subjugated the northeast of the peninsula. Montejo then returned to the east to find his garrisons had almost been eliminated; he used a supply ship to explore southwards before looping back around the entire peninsula to central Mexico. Montejo pacified Tabasco with the aid of his son, also named Francisco de Montejo. In 1531 the Spanish moved their base of operations to Campeche, where they repulsed a significant Maya attack. After this battle, the Spanish founded a town at Chichen Itza in the north. Montejo carved up the province amongst his soldiers. In mid-1533 the local Maya rebelled and laid siege to the small Spanish garrison, which was forced to flee. Towards the end of 1534, or the beginning of 1535, the Spanish retreated from Campeche to Veracruz. In 1535, peaceful attempts by the Franciscan Order to incorporate Yucat√°n into the Spanish Empire failed after a renewed Spanish military presence at Champot√≥n forced the friars out. Champot√≥n was by now the last Spanish outpost in Yucat√°n, isolated among a hostile population. In 1541‚Äì42 the first permanent Spanish town councils in the entire peninsula were founded at Campeche and M√©rida. When the powerful lord of Mani converted to the Roman Catholic religion, his submission to Spain and conversion to Christianity encouraged the lords of the western provinces to accept Spanish rule. In late 1546 an alliance of eastern provinces launched an unsuccessful uprising against the Spanish. The eastern Maya were defeated in a single battle, which marked the final conquest of the northern portion of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The polities of Pet√©n in the south remained independent and received many refugees fleeing from Spanish jurisdiction. In 1618 and in 1619 two unsuccessful Franciscan missions attempted the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza. In 1622 the Itza slaughtered two Spanish parties trying to reach their capital Nojpet√©n. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. Over the course of 1695 and 1696 a number of Spanish expeditions attempted to reach Nojpet√©n from the mutually independent Spanish colonies in Yucat√°n and Guatemala. In early 1695 the Spanish began to build a road from Campeche south towards Pet√©n and activity intensified, sometimes with significant losses on the part of the Spanish. Mart√≠n de Urz√∫a y Arizmendi, governor of Yucat√°n, launched an assault upon Nojpet√©n in March 1697; the city fell after a brief battle. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the Spanish. Geography Satellite view of the Yucat√°n Peninsula The Yucat√°n Peninsula is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the east and by the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west. It can be delimited by a line running from the Laguna de T√©rminos on the Gulf coast through to the Gulf of Honduras on the Caribbean coast. It incorporates the modern Mexican states of Yucat√°n, Quintana Roo and Campeche, the eastern portion of the state of Tabasco, most of the Guatemalan department of Pet√©n, and all of Belize.Quezada 2011, p. 13. Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline. A stretch of high, rocky coast runs south from the city of Campeche on the Gulf Coast. A number of bays are situated along the east coast of the peninsula, from north to south they are Ascensi√≥n Bay, Esp√≠ritu Santo Bay, Chetumal Bay and Amatique Bay. The north coast features a wide, sandy littoral zone. The extreme north of the peninsula, roughly corresponding to Yucat√°n State, has underlying bedrock consisting of flat Cenozoic limestone. To the south of this the limestone rises to form the low chain of Puuc Hills, with a steep initial scarp running east from the Gulf coast near Champot√≥n, terminating some from the Caribbean coast near the border of Quintana Roo.White and Hood 2004, p. 152. Quezada 2011, p. 14. The hills reach a maximum altitude of .Quezada 2011, p. 14. The northwestern and northern portions of the Yucat√°n Peninsula experience lower rainfall than the rest of the peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. This limestone geology results in most rainwater filtering directly through the bedrock to the phreatic zone, from whence it slowly flows to the coasts to form large submarine springs. Various freshwater springs rise along the coast to form watering holes. The filtering of rainwater through the limestone has caused the formation of extensive cave systems. These cave rooves are subject to collapse forming deep sinkholes; if the bottom of the cave is deeper than the groundwater level then a cenote is formed. In contrast, the northeastern portion of the peninsula is characterised by forested swamplands.Thompson 1966, p. 25. The northern portion of the peninsula lacks rivers, except for the Champot√≥n River ‚Äì all other rivers are located in the south. The Sibun River flows from west to east from south central Quintana Roo to Lake Bacalar on the Caribbean Coast; the R√≠o Hondo flows northwards from Belize to empty into the same lake.Quezada 2011, pp. 14‚Äì15. Bacalar Lake empties into Chetumal Bay. The R√≠o Nuevo flows from Lamanai Lake in Belize northwards to Chetumal Bay. The Mopan River and the Macal River flow through Belize and join to form the Belize River, which empties into the Caribbean Sea. In the southwest of the peninsula, the San Pedro River, the Candelar√≠a River and the Mamantel River, which all form a part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage.Quezada 2011, p. 15. The Pet√©n region consists of densely forested low-lying limestone plain featuring karstic topography.Lovell 2005, p. 17. The area is crossed by low east‚Äìwest oriented ridges of Cenozoic limestone and is characterised by a variety of forest and soil types; water sources include generally small rivers and low-lying seasonal swamps known as bajos.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 46. A chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of Pet√©n; during the rainy season some of these lakes become interconnected. This drainage area measures approximately east‚Äìwest by north‚Äìsouth.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 46‚Äì47. The largest lake is Lake Pet√©n Itza, near the centre of the drainage basin; it measures . A broad savannah extends south of the central lakes. To the north of the lakes region bajos become more frequent, interspersed with forest. In the far north of Pet√©n the Mirador Basin forms another interior drainage region.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 47. To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands.Rice and Rice 2009, p. 5. The canopy height of the forest gradually decreases from Pet√©n northwards, averaging from .Quezada 2011, p. 16. This dense forest covers northern Pet√©n and Belize, most of Quinatana Roo, southern Campeche and a portion of the south of Yucat√°n State. Further north, the vegetation turns to lower forest consisting of dense scrub.Quezada 2011, p. 17. Climate The climate becomes progressively drier towards the north of the peninsula. In the north, the annual mean temperature is in M√©rida. Average temperature in the peninsula varies from in January to in July. The lowest temperature on record is . For the peninsula as a whole, the mean annual precipitation is . The rainy season lasts from June to September, while the dry season runs from October to May. During the dry season, rainfall averages ; in the wet season this increases to an average . The prevailing winds are easterly and have created an east-west precipitation gradient with average rainfall in the east exceeding and the north and northwestern portions of the peninsula receiving a maximum of . The southeastern portion of the peninsula has a tropical rainy climate with a short dry season in winter.White and Hood 2004, p. 152. Pet√©n has a hot climate and receives the highest rainfall in all Mesoamerica. The climate is divided into wet and dry seasons, with the rainy season lasting from June to December, although these seasons are not clearly defined in the south; with rain occurring through most of the year. The climate of Pet√©n varies from tropical in the south to semitropical in the north; temperature varies between , although it does not usually drop beneath .Schwartz 1990, p. 17. Mean temperature varies from in the southeast to in the northeast. Highest temperatures are reached from April to June, while January is the coldest month; all Pet√©n experiences a hot dry period in late August. Annual precipitation is high, varying from a mean of in the northeast to in central Pet√©n.Schwartz 1990, p. 18. Yucat√°n before the conquest The first large Maya cities developed in the Pet√©n Basin in the far south of the Yucat√°n Peninsula as far back as the Middle Preclassic (c. 600‚Äì350 BC),Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 52. and Pet√©n formed the heartland of the ancient Maya civilization during the Classic period (c. AD 250‚Äì900).Coe 1999, p. 31. Webster 2002, p. 45. The 16th century Maya provinces of northern Yucat√°n are likely to have evolved out of polities of the Maya Classic period. From the mid-13th century AD through to the mid-15th century, the League of Mayap√°n united several of the northern provinces; for a time they shared a joint form of government. The great cities that dominated Pet√©n had fallen into ruin by the beginning of the 10th century AD with the onset of the Classic Maya collapse.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 499‚Äì500. A significant Maya presence remained in Pet√©n into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 613, 616. In the early 16th century, when the Spanish discovered the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the region was still dominated by the Maya civilization. It was divided into a number of independent provinces referred to as kuchkabal (plural kuchkabaloob) in the Yucatec Maya language. The various provinces shared a common culture but the internal sociopolitical organisation varied from one province to the next, as did access to important resources. These differences in political and economic makeup often led to hostilities between the provinces. The politically fragmented state of the Yucat√°n Peninsula at the time of conquest hindered the Spanish invasion, since there was no central political authority to be overthrown. However, the Spanish were also able to exploit this fragmentation by taking advantage of pre-existing rivalries between polities. Estimates of the number of kuchkabal in the northern Yucat√°n vary from sixteen to twenty- four.Andrews 1984, p. 589. The boundaries between polities were not stable, being subject to the effects of alliances and wars; those kuchkabaloob with more centralised forms of government were likely to have had more stable boundaries than those of loose confederations of provinces.Andrews 1984, p. 590. When the Spanish discovered Yucat√°n, the provinces of Mani and Sotuta were two of the most important polities in the region. They were mutually hostile; the Xiu Maya of Mani allied themselves with the Spanish, while the Cocom Maya of Sotuta became the implacable enemies of the European colonisers.Caso Barrera 2002, p. 17. At the time of conquest, polities in the north included Mani, Cehpech and Chakan. Chakan was largely landlocked with a small stretch of coast on the north of the peninsula. Cehpech was a coastal province to its east; further east along the north coast were Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, and Chikinchel. The modern city of Valladolid is situated upon the site of the former capital of Cupul.Andrews 1984, p. 593. Cupul and Chinkinchel are known to have been mutually hostile, and to have engaged in wars to control the salt beds of the north coast.Andrews 1984, p. 592. Tases was a small landlocked province south of Chikinchel. Ecab was a large province in the east. Uaymil was in the southeast, and Chetumal was to the south of it; all three bordered on the Caribbean Sea. Cochuah was also in the eastern half of the peninsula; it was southwest of Ecab and northwest of Uaymil. Its borders are poorly understood and it may have been landlocked, or have extended to occupy a portion of the Caribbean coast between the latter two kuchkabaloob. The capital of Cochuah was Tihosuco. Hocaba and Sotuta were landlocked provinces north of Mani and southwest of Ah Kin Chel and Cupul. Ah Canul was the northernmost province on the Gulf coast of the peninsula. Canpech (modern Campeche) was to the south of it, followed by Chanputun (modern Champot√≥n). South of Chanputun, and extending west along the Gulf coast was Acalan.Andrews 1984, p. 591. This Chontal Maya-speaking province extended east of the Usumacinta River in Tabasco, as far as what is now the southern portion of Campeche state, where their capital was located. In the southern portion of the peninsula, a number of polities occupied the Pet√©n Basin. The Kejache occupied a territory to the north of the Itza and east of Acalan, between the Pet√©n lakes and what is now Campeche, and to the west of Chetumal. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Pet√©n in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish.Houwald 1984, p. 257. Although there is insufficient data to accurately estimate population sizes at the time of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports suggest that sizeable Maya populations existed in Pet√©n, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers.Jones 2000, p. 351. Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Pet√©n and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. Their capital was Nojpet√©n, an island city upon Lake Pet√©n Itz√°; it has developed into the modern town of Flores, which is the capital of the Pet√©n department of Guatemala.Jones 2000, p. 353. The Itza spoke a variety of Yucatecan Maya.Jones 2000, p. 352. The Kowoj were the second in importance; they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza, around the eastern Pet√©n lakes: Lake Salpet√©n, Lake Macanch√©, Lake Yaxh√° and Lake Sacnab.Rice and Rice 2009, p. 10. Rice 2009, p. 17. The Yalain appear to have been one of the three dominant polities in Postclassic central Pet√©n, alongside the Itza and the Kowoj. The Yalain territory had its maximum extension from the east shore of Lake Pet√©n Itz√° eastwards to Tipuj in Belize.Cecil et al. 1999, p. 788. In the 17th century the Yalain capital was located at the site of that name on the north shore of Lake Macanch√©.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 617. At the time of Spanish contact the Yalain were allied with the Itza, an alliance cemented by intermarriage between the elites of both groups. In the late 17th century, Spanish colonial records document hostilities between Maya groups in the lakes region, with the incursion of the Kowoj into former Yalain sites including Zacpeten on Lake Macanch√© and Ixlu on Lake Salpet√©n.Rice and Rice 2005, p. 149. Other groups in Pet√©n are less well known, and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Icaiche, the Kejache, the Lakandon Ch ºol, the Manche Ch ºol, and the Mopan.Rice 2009, p. 17. Feldman 2000, p. xxi. Impact of Old World diseases European-introduced smallpox devastated the indigenous populations of the Americas A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and thus initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas.Smith 2003, p. 279. The European diseases that ravaged the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas also severely affected the various Maya groups of the entire Yucat√°n Peninsula. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. The terrible plagues that swept the peninsula were recorded in Yucatec Maya written histories, which combined with those of neighbouring Maya peoples in the Guatemalan Highlands, suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area the same year that it arrived in central Mexico with the forces under the command of P√°nfilo Narv√°ez. Old World diseases are often mentioned only briefly in indigenous accounts, making it difficult to identify the exact culprit. Among the most deadly were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis; the latter disease was attributed to the arrival of the Spanish by the Maya inhabitants of Yucat√°n. These diseases swept through Yucat√°n in the 1520s and 1530s, with periodic recurrences throughout the 16th century. By the late 16th century, the reports of high fevers suggest the arrival of malaria in the region, and yellow fever was first reported in the mid-17th century, with a terse mention in the Chilam Balam of Chumayel for 1648. That particular outbreak was traced back to the island of Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, from whence it was introduced to the port city of Campeche, and from there was transmitted to M√©rida. Mortality was high, with approximately 50% of the population of some Yucatec Maya settlements being wiped out. Sixteen Franciscan friars are reported to have died in M√©rida, probably the majority of the based there at the time, and who had probably numbered not much more than twenty before the outbreak.Thompson 1966, p. 24. Those areas of the peninsula that experience damper conditions, particularly those possessing swamplands, became rapidly depopulated after the conquest with the introduction of malaria and other waterborne parasites. An example was the one-time well-populated province of Ecab occupying the northeastern portion of the peninsula. In 1528, when Francisco de Montejo occupied the town of Conil for two months, the Spanish recorded approximately 5,000 houses in the town; the adult male population at the time has been conservatively estimated as 3,000. By 1549, Spanish records show that only 80 tributaries were registered to be taxed, indicating a population drop in Conil of more than 90% in 21 years. The native population of the northeastern portion of the peninsula was almost completely eliminated within fifty years of the conquest. In the south, conditions conducive to the spread of malaria existed throughout Pet√©n and Belize.Thompson 1966, p. 26. At the time of the fall of Nojpet√©n in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Pet√©n Itz√°, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.Jones 2000, p. 364. Likewise, in Tabasco the population of approximately 30,000 was reduced by an estimated 90%, with measles, smallpox, catarrhs, dysentery and fevers being the main culprits. Weaponry, strategies and tactics The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or reducciones (also known as congregaciones).Rice 2009, p. 83. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish.Pugh 2009, p. 191. Houwald 1984, p. 256. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases.Houwald 1984, p. 256. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hern√°n Cort√©s passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducci√≥n. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducci√≥n town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. Spanish weaponry and armour The 16th-century Spanish conquistadors were armed with broadswords, rapiers, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Mounted conquistadors were armed with a lance, that also served as a pike for infantrymen. A variety of halberds and bills were also employed. As well as the one-handed broadsword, a long two-handed version was also used. Crossbows had arms stiffened with hardwoods, horn, bone and cane, and supplied with a stirrup to facilitate drawing the string with a crank and pulley. Crossbows were easier to maintain than matchlocks, especially in the humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region that included much of the Yucat√°n Peninsula.Pohl and Hook 2008, pp. 26‚Äì27. Native weaponry and armour Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. Members of the Maya aristocracy wore quilted cotton armour, and some warriors of lesser rank wore twisted rolls of cotton wrapped around their bodies. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.Wise and McBride 2008, pp. 33‚Äì34.  First encounters: 1502 and 1511  Bartholomew Columbus came across a Yucatec Maya canoe in the Gulf of Honduras On 30 July 1502, during his fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras. He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island. As Bartholomew explored the island with two boats, a large canoe approached from the west, apparently en route to the island. The canoe was carved from one large tree trunk and was powered by twenty-five naked rowers.Clendinnen 2003, p. 3. Curious as to the visitors, Bartholomew Columbus seized and boarded it. He found it was a Maya trading canoe from Yucat√°n, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo that included ceramics, cotton textiles, yellow stone axes, flint-studded war clubs, copper axes and bells, and cacao.Perramon 1986, p. 242. Clendinnen 2003, p. 3. Also among the cargo were a small number of women and children, probably destined to be sold as slaves, as were a number of the rowers. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly Maya captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 3‚Äì4. This was the first recorded contact between Europeans and the Maya.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 758. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes ‚Äì the first prophecies of bearded invaders sent by Kukulkan, the northern Maya feathered serpent god, were probably recorded around this time, and in due course passed into the books of Chilam Balam.Clendinnen 2003, p. 4. In 1511 the Spanish caravel Santa Mar√≠a de la Barca set sail along the Central American coast under the command of Pedro de Valdivia.de D√≠os Gonz√°lez 2008, p. 25. G√≥mez Mart√≠n June 2013, p. 56. The ship was sailing to Santo Domingo from Dari√©n to inform the colonial authorities there of ongoing conflict between conquistadors Diego de Nicuesa and Vasco Nu√±ez de Balboa in Dari√©n.G√≥mez Mart√≠n June 2013, p. 56. The ship foundered upon a reef known as Las V√≠boras (\\"The Vipers\\") or, alternatively, Los Alacranes (\\"The Scorpions\\"), somewhere off Jamaica. There were just twenty survivors from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, Ger√≥nimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero.de D√≠os Gonz√°lez 2008, pp. 25‚Äì26. They set themselves adrift in one of the ship's boats, with bad oars and no sail; after thirteen days during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucat√°n. There they were seized by Halach Uinik, a Maya lord. Captain Vildivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast. Aguilar and Guerrero were held prisoner and fattened for killing, together with five or six of their shipmates. Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape their captors and fled to a neighbouring lord who was an enemy of Halach Uinik; he took them prisoner and kept them as slaves. After a time, Gonzalo Guerrero was passed as a slave to the lord Nachan Can of Chetumal. Guerrero became completely Mayanised and served his new lord with such loyalty that he was married to one of Nachan Chan's daughters, Zazil Ha, by whom he had three children. By 1514, Guerrero had achieved the rank of nacom, a war leader who served against Nachan Chan's enemies.de D√≠os Gonz√°lez 2008, p. 26. Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, 1517 Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba In 1517, Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba set sail from Cuba with a small fleet, consisting of two caravels and a brigantine, with the dual intention of exploration and of rounding up slaves.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 4‚Äì5. The experienced Ant√≥n de Alaminos served as pilot; he had previously served as pilot under Christopher Columbus on his final voyage. Also among the approximately 100-strong expedition members was Bernal D√≠az del Castillo.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 5. The expedition sailed west from Cuba for three weeks, and weathered a two-day storm a week before sighting the coast of the northeastern tip of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The ships could not put in close to the shore due to the shallowness of the coastal waters. However, they could see a Maya city some two leagues inland, upon a low hill. The Spanish called it Gran Cairo (literally \\"Great Cairo\\") due to its size and its pyramids.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 6. Although the location is not now known with certainty, it is believed that this first sighting of Yucat√°n was at Isla Mujeres. The following morning, the Spanish sent the two ships with a shallower draught to find a safe approach through the shallows. The caravels anchored about one league from the shore. Ten large canoes powered by both sails and oars rowed out to meet the Spanish ships. Over thirty Maya boarded the vessels and mixed freely with the Spaniards. The Maya visitors accepted gifts of beads, and the leader indicated with signs that they would return to take the Spanish ashore the following day. The Maya leader returned the following day with twelve canoes, as promised. The Spanish could see from afar that the shore was packed with natives. The conquistadors put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats; a few of the more daring Spaniards boarded the native canoes. The Spanish named the headland Cape Catoche, after some words spoken by the Maya leader, which sounded to the Spanish like cones catoche. Once ashore, the Spaniards clustered loosely together and advanced towards the city along a path among low, scrub-covered hillocks. At this point the Maya leader gave a shout and the Spanish party was ambushed by Maya warriors armed with spears, bows and arrows, and stones. Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault, but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed the Maya attack. They advanced to a small plaza bordered by temples upon the outskirts of the city.Clendinnen 2003, p. 7. When the Spaniards ransacked the temples they found a number of low-grade gold items, which filled them with enthusiasm. The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships. Over the following days the Spanish discovered that although the Maya arrows had struck with little force, the flint arrowheads tended to shatter on impact, causing infected wounds and a slow death; two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow-wounds inflicted in the ambush.Clendinnen 2003, p. 8. Early 16th century European caravel Over the next fifteen days the fleet slowly followed the coastline west, and then south. The casks brought from Cuba were leaking and the expedition was now running dangerously low on fresh water; the hunt for more became an overriding priority as the expedition advanced, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 8‚Äì9. On 23 February 1517, the day of Saint Lazarus, another city was spotted and named San L√°zaro by the Spanish ‚Äì it is now known by its original Maya name, Campeche. A large contingent put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats to fill their water casks in a freshwater pool. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city.Clendinnen 2003, p. 9. They were led amongst large buildings until they stood before a blood-caked altar, where many of the city's inhabitants crowded around. The Indians piled reeds before the visitors; this act was followed by a procession of armed Maya warriors in full war paint, followed by ten Maya priests. The Maya set fire to the reeds and indicated that the Spanish would be killed if they were not gone by the time the reeds had been consumed. The Spanish party withdrew in defensive formation to the shore and rapidly boarded their boats to retreat to the safety of the ships.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 9‚Äì10. The small fleet continued for six more days in fine weather, followed by four stormy days.Clendinnen 2003, p. 10. By this time water was once again dangerously short.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 10‚Äì11. The ships spotted an inlet close to another city, Champot√≥n,Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 759. and a landing party discovered fresh water. Armed Maya warriors approached from the city while the water casks were being filled. Communication was once again attempted with signs. Night fell by the time the water casks had been filled and the attempts at communication concluded. In the darkness the Spaniards could hear the movements of large numbers of Maya warriors. They decided that a night-time retreat would be too risky; instead, they posted guards and waited for dawn. At sunrise, the Spanish saw that they had been surrounded by a sizeable army. The massed Maya warriors launched an assault with missiles, including arrows, darts and stones; they then charged into hand-to-hand combat with spears and clubs. Eighty of the defenders were wounded in the initial barrage of missiles, and two Spaniards were captured in the frantic m√™l√©e that followed. All of the Spanish party received wounds, including Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. The Spanish regrouped in a defensive formation and forced passage to the shore, where their discipline collapsed and a frantic scramble for the boats ensued, leaving the Spanish vulnerable to the pursuing Maya warriors who waded into the sea behind them. Most of the precious water casks were abandoned on the beach.Clendinnen 2003, p. 12. When the surviving Spanish reached the safety of the ships, they realised that they had lost over fifty men, more than half their number.Clendinnen 2003, p. 11. Five men died from their wounds in the following days.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 11‚Äì12. The battle had lasted only an hour, and the Spanish named the locale as the Coast of the Disastrous Battle. They were now far from help and low on supplies; too many men had been lost and injured to sail all three ships back to Cuba. They decided to abandon their smallest ship, the brigantine, although it was purchased on credit from Governor Vel√°squez of Cuba. Governor Diego Vel√°zquez de Cuellar claimed the discovery of wealthy cities and gold in Yucat√°n The few men who had not been wounded because they were manning the ships during the battle were reinforced with three men who had suffered relatively minor wounds; they put ashore at a remote beach to dig for water. They found some and brought it back to the ships, although it sickened those who drank it.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 12‚Äì13. The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, where they found good drinking water, although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so much water that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hern√°ndez de Cord√≥ba wrote a report to Governor Vel√°zquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hern√°ndez died soon after from his wounds.Clendinnen 2003, p. 13. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucat√°n.Clendinnen 2003, p. 14. Based upon Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba's report and the testimony of the interrogated Indian prisoners, Governor Vel√°zquez wrote to the Council of the Indies notifying it of \\"his\\" discovery. Juan de Grijalva, 1518 Diego Vel√°zquez, the governor of Cuba, was enthused by Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba's report of gold in Yucat√°n. He organised a new expedition consisting of four ships and 260 men.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 759. Clendinnen 2003, p. 14. He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command. Francisco de Montejo, who would eventually conquer much of the peninsula, was captain of one of the ships;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 759. Recinos 1986, p. 18. Pedro de Alvarado and Alonso d'Avila captained the other ships.Recinos 1986, p. 18. Bernal D√≠az del Castillo served on the crew; he was able to secure a place on the expedition as a favour from the governor, who was his kinsman.Clendinnen 2003, p. 15. Ant√≥n de Alaminos once again served as pilot.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 760. Governor Vel√°zquez provided all four ships, in an attempt to protect his claim over the peninsula. The small fleet was stocked with crossbows, muskets, barter goods, salted pork and cassava bread.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 14‚Äì15. Grijalva also took one of the captured Indians from the Hern√°ndez expedition. The fleet left Cuba in April 1518, and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel, off the east coast of Yucat√°n. The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish and would not respond to Grijalva's friendly overtures. The fleet sailed south from Cozumel, along the east coast of the peninsula.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 760. Clendinnen 2003, p. 15. The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast, one of which was probably Tulum. On Ascension Thursday the fleet discovered a large bay, which the Spanish named Bah√≠a de la Ascensi√≥n. Grijalva did not land at any of these cities and turned back north from Ascensi√≥n Bay. He looped around the north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula to sail down the west coast. At Campeche the Spanish tried to barter for water but the Maya refused, so Grijalva opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. Messages were sent with a few Maya who had been too slow to escape but the Maya remained hidden in the forest. The Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast. At Champot√≥n, where the inhabitants had routed Hern√°ndez and his men, the fleet was approached by a small number of large war canoes, but the ships' cannon soon put them to flight. At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach.Clendinnen 2003, pp. 15‚Äì16. By means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies. From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold-rich empire,Clendinnen 2003, p. 16. sailing as far north as P√°nuco River. As the fleet returned to Cuba, the Spanish attacked Champot√≥n to avenge the previous year's defeat of the Spanish expedition led by Hern√°ndez. One Spaniard was killed and fifty were wounded in the ensuing battle, including Grijalva. Grijalva put into the port of Havana five months after he had left. Hern√°n Cort√©s, 1519 alt=Old painting of a bearded young man facing slightly to the right. He is wearing a dark jacket with a high collar topped by a white ruff, with ornate buttons down the front. The painting is dark and set in an oval with the letters \\"HERNAN CORTES\\" in a rectangle underneath Grijalva's return aroused great interest in Cuba, and Yucat√°n was believed to be a land of riches waiting to be plundered. A new expedition was organised, with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses. Hern√°n Cort√©s was placed in command, and his crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors, including Pedro de Alvarado, Crist√≥bal de Olid, Gonzalo de Sandoval and Diego de Ordaz. Also aboard were Francisco de Montejo and Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, veterans of the Grijalva expedition. The fleet made its first landfall at Cozumel, and Cort√©s remained there for several days. Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up on one of them. At Cozumel, Cort√©s heard rumours of bearded men on the Yucat√°n mainland, who he presumed were Europeans.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 760‚Äì761. Cort√©s sent out messengers to them and was able to rescue the shipwrecked Ger√≥nimo de Aguilar, who had been enslaved by a Maya lord. Aguilar had learnt the Yucatec Maya language and became Cort√©s' interpreter.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 758‚Äì759, 760‚Äì761. From Cozumel, the fleet looped around the north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula and followed the coast to the Tabasco River, which Cort√©s renamed as the Grijalva River in honour of the Spanish captain who had discovered it. In Tabasco, Cort√©s anchored his ships at Potonch√°n,Townsend 1995, p. 16. a Chontal Maya town.Hern√°ndez et al. 2010, p. 26. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. The defeated Chontal Maya lords offered gold, food, clothing and a group of young women in tribute to the victors. Among these women was a young Maya noblewoman called Malintzin, who was given the Spanish name Marina. She spoke Maya and Nahuatl and became the means by which Cort√©s was able to communicate with the Aztecs.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 761. Marina became Cort√©s' consort and eventually bore him a son. From Tabasco, Cort√©s continued to Cempoala in Veracruz, a subject city of the Aztec Empire, and from there on to conquer the Aztecs.Townsend 1995, pp. 16ff. In 1519, Cort√©s sent the veteran Francisco de Montejo back to Spain with treasure for the king. While he was in Spain, Montejo pleaded Cort√©s' cause against the supporters of Diego de Vel√°squez. Montejo remained in Spain for seven years, and eventually succeeded in acquiring the hereditary military title of adelantado.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 766. Hern√°n Cort√©s in the Maya lowlands, 1524‚Äì25 In 1524, after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hern√°n Cort√©s led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across Acalan in southern Campeche and the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Pet√©n Department of Guatemala.Jones 2000, p. 358. His aim was to subdue the rebellious Crist√≥bal de Olid, whom he had sent to conquer Honduras; Olid had, however, set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory. Cort√©s left Tenochtitlan on 12 October 1524 with 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. He also had with him the captured Aztec emperor Cuauhtemoc, and Cohuanacox and Tetlepanquetzal, the captive Aztec lords of Texcoco and Tlacopan. Cort√©s marched into Maya territory in Tabasco; the army crossed the Usumacinta River near Tenosique and crossed into the Chontal Maya province of Acalan, where he recruited 600 Chontal Maya carriers. In Acalan, Cort√©s believed that the captive Aztec lords were plotting against him and he ordered Cuauhtemoc and Tetlepanquetzal to be hanged. Cort√©s and his army left Acalan on 5 March 1525. The expedition passed onwards through Kejache territory and reported that the Kejache towns were situated in easily defensible locations and were often fortified.Rice and Rice 2009, p. 12. One of these was built on a rocky outcrop near a lake and a river that fed into it. The town was fortified with a wooden palisade and was surrounded by a moat. Cort√©s reported that the town of Tiac was even larger and was fortified with walls, watchtowers and earthworks; the town itself was divided into three individually fortified districts. Tiac was said to have been at war with the unnamed smaller town.Rice et al. 2009, p. 127. The Kejache claimed that their towns were fortified against the attacks of their aggressive Itza neighbours.Rice and Rice 2005, p. 152. They arrived at the north shore of Lake Pet√©n Itz√° on 13 March 1525.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 761‚Äì762. The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass in the presence of Aj Kan Ek º, the king of the Itza, who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762. Cort√©s accepted an invitation from Kan Ek º to visit Nojpet√©n (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762. Jones 2000, p. 358. On his departure from Nojpet√©n, Cort√©s left behind a cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, attempting to feed it poultry, meat and flowers, but the animal soon died.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 773. Jones 2000, p. 358. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of Franciscan priests in 1618, when Cort√©s' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpet√©n. From the lake, Cort√©s continued south along the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover , during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cort√©s turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses. On 15 April 1525 the expedition arrived at the Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of Lake Izabal, where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety. Cort√©s found a village on the shore of Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay,Feldman 1998, p. 6. with about a dozen companions, and waited there for the rest of his army to regroup over the next week. By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cort√©s succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Crist√≥bal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cort√©s then returned to Mexico by sea.Webster 2002, p. 83.  Francisco de Montejo, 1527‚Äì28  Monument in M√©rida to Montejo the Elder and his son The richer lands of Mexico engaged the main attention of the conquistadors for some years, then in 1526 Francisco de Montejo (a veteran of the Grijalva and Cort√©s expeditions) successfully petitioned the King of Spain for the right to conquer Yucat√°n. On 8 December of that year he was issued with the hereditary military title of adelantado and permission to colonise the Yucat√°n Peninsula.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 766‚Äì767. In 1527, he left Spain with 400 men in four ships, with horses, small arms, cannon and provisions.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 767. Clendinnen 2003, p. 20. He set sail for Santo Domingo, where more supplies and horses were collected, allowing Montejo to increase his cavalry to fifty.Clendinnen 2003, p. 20. One of the ships was left at Santo Domingo as a supply ship to provide later support; the other ships set sail and reached Cozumel in the second half of September 1527. Montejo was received in peace by the lord of Cozumel, Aj Naum Pat, but the ships only stopped briefly before making for the Yucat√°n coast. The expedition made landfall somewhere near Xelha in the Maya province of Ekab,Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 767. in what is now Mexico's Quintana Roo state.ITMB 2000. Montejo garrisoned Xelha with 40 soldiers under his second-in-command, Alonso d'Avila, and posted 20 more at nearby Pole. Xelha was renamed Salamanca de Xelha and became the first Spanish settlement on the peninsula. The provisions were soon exhausted and additional food was seized from the local Maya villagers; this too was soon consumed. Many local Maya fled into the forest and Spanish raiding parties scoured the surrounding area for food, finding little.Clendinnen 2003, p. 21. With discontent growing among his men, Montejo took the drastic step of burning his ships; this strengthened the resolve of his troops, who gradually acclimatised to the harsh conditions of Yucat√°n.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 767. Clendinnen 1989, 2003, p. 21. Montejo was able to get more food from the still-friendly Aj Nuam Pat, when the latter made a visit to the mainland. Montejo took 125 men and set out on an expedition to explore the north-eastern portion of the Yucat√°n peninsula. His expedition passed through the towns of Xamanha, Mochis and Belma, none of which survives today. At Belma, Montejo gathered the leaders of the nearby Maya towns and ordered them to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown. After this, Montejo led his men to Conil, a town in Ekab that was described as having 5,000 houses, where the Spanish party halted for two months. In the spring of 1528, Montejo left Conil for the city of Chauaca, which was abandoned by its Maya inhabitants under cover of darkness. The following morning, the inhabitants attacked the Spanish party but were defeated. The Spanish then continued to Ake, some north of Tizim√≠n, where they engaged in a major battle against the Maya, killing more than 1,200 of them. After this Spanish victory, the neighbouring Maya leaders all surrendered. Montejo's party then continued to Sisia and Loche before heading back to Xelha. Montejo arrived at Xelha with only 60 of his party, and found that only 12 of his 40-man garrison survived, while the garrison at Pole had been entirely wiped out.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 767‚Äì768. The support ship eventually arrived from Santo Domingo, and Montejo used it to sail south along the coast, while he sent D'Avila over land. Montejo discovered the thriving port city of Chaktumal (modern Chetumal).Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 768. Clendinnen 2003, p. 21. At Chaktumal, Montejo learnt that shipwrecked Spanish sailor Gonzalo de Guerrero was in the region, and Montejo sent messages to him, inviting him to return to join his compatriots, but the Mayanised Guerrero declined.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 768. The Maya at Chaktumal fed false information to the Spanish, and Montejo was unable to find d'Avila and link up with him. D'Avila returned overland to Xelha, and transferred the fledgling Spanish colony to nearby Xamanha, modern Playa del Carmen, which Montejo considered to be a better port. After waiting for d'Avila without result, Montejo sailed south as far as the Ul√∫a River in Honduras before turning around and heading back up the coast to finally meet up with his lieutenant at Xamanha. Late in 1528, Montejo left d'Avila to oversee Xamanha and sailed north to loop around the Yucat√°n Peninsula and head for the Spanish colony of New Spain in central Mexico.  Francisco de Montejo and Alonso d'Avila, 1531‚Äì35  Montejo was appointed alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor) of Tabasco in 1529, and pacified that province with the aid of his son, also named Francisco de Montejo. D'Avila was sent from eastern Yucat√°n to conquer Acalan, which extended southeast of the Laguna de Terminos. Montejo the Younger founded Salamanca de Xicalango as a base of operations. In 1530 D'Avila established Salamanca de Acal√°n as a base from which to launch new attempts to conquer Yucat√°n.Quezada 2011, p. 37. Salamanca de Acal√°n proved a disappointment, with no gold for the taking and with lower levels of population than had been hoped. D'Avila soon abandoned the new settlement and set off across the lands of the Kejache to Champot√≥n, arriving there towards the end of 1530.Quezada 2011, pp. 37‚Äì38. During a colonial power struggle in Tabasco, the elder Montejo was imprisoned for a time. Upon his release, he met up with his son in Xicalango, Tabasco, and they then both rejoined d'Avila at Champot√≥n. In 1531 Montejo moved his base of operations to Campeche.Clendinnen 2003, p. 23. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 768. Alonso d'Avila was sent overland to Chauaca in the east of the peninsula, passing through Man√≠ where he was well received by the Xiu Maya. D'Avila continued southeast to Chetumal where he founded the Spanish town of Villa Real (\\"Royal Town\\"). The local Maya fiercely resisted the placement of the new Spanish colony and d'Avila and his men were forced to abandon Villa Real and make for Honduras in canoes. At Campeche, the Maya amassed a strong force and attacked the city; the Spanish were able to fight them off, a battle in which the elder Montejo was almost killed.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 768‚Äì769. Aj Canul, the lord of the attacking Maya, surrendered to the Spanish. After this battle, the younger Francisco de Montejo was despatched to the northern Cupul province, where the lord Naabon Cupul reluctantly allowed him to found the Spanish town of Ciudad Real at Chichen Itza. Montejo carved up the province amongst his soldiers and gave each of his men two to three thousand Maya in encomienda. After six months of Spanish rule, Cupul dissatisfaction could no longer be contained and Naabon Cupul was killed during a failed attempt to kill Montejo the Younger. The death of their lord only served to inflame Cupul anger and, in mid 1533, they laid siege to the small Spanish garrison at Chichen Itza. Montejo the Younger abandoned Ciudad Real by night after arranging a distraction for their attackers, and he and his men fled west, where the Chel, Pech and Xiu provinces remained obedient to Spanish rule. Montejo the Younger was received in friendship by Namux Chel, the lord of the Chel province, at Dzilam. In the spring of 1534 he rejoined his father in the Chakan province at Dzikabal, near T ºho (the modern city of M√©rida).Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 769. While his son had been attempting to consolidate the Spanish control of Cupul, Francisco de Montejo the Elder had met the Xiu ruler at Man√≠. The Xiu Maya maintained their friendship with the Spanish throughout the conquest and Spanish authority was eventually established over Yucat√°n in large part due to Xiu support. The Montejos, after reuniting at Dzikabal, founded a new Spanish town at Dzilam, although the Spanish suffered hardships there. Montejo the Elder returned to Campeche, where he was received with friendship by the local Maya. He was accompanied by the friendly Chel lord Namux Chel, who travelled on horseback, and two of the lord's cousins, who were taken in chains.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 769‚Äì770. Montejo the Younger remained behind in Dzilam to continue his attempts at conquest of the region but, finding the situation too difficult, he soon retreated to Campeche to rejoin his father and Alonso d'Avila, who had returned to Campeche shortly before Montejo the Younger. Around this time, the news began to arrive of Francisco Pizarro's conquests in Peru and the rich plunder that his soldiers were taking there, undermining the morale of Montejo's already disenchanted band of followers. Montejo's soldiers began to abandon him to seek their fortune elsewhere; in seven years of attempted conquest in the northern provinces of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, very little gold had been found. Towards the end of 1534 or the beginning of the next year, Montejo the Elder and his son retreated from Campeche to Veracruz, taking their remaining soldiers with them.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 770. Montejo the Elder became embroiled in colonial infighting over the right to rule Honduras, a claim that put him in conflict with Pedro de Alvarado, captain general of Guatemala, who also claimed Honduras as part of his jurisdiction. Alvarado's claim ultimately turned out successful. In Montejo the Elder's absence, first in central Mexico, and then in Honduras, Montejo the Younger acted as lieutenant governor and captain general in Tabasco.  Conflict at Champoton  The Franciscan friar Jacobo de Testera arrived in Champoton in 1535 to attempt the peaceful incorporation of Yucat√°n into the Spanish Empire. Testera had been assured by the Spanish authorities that no military activity would be undertaken in Yucat√°n, while he was attempting its conversion to the Roman Catholic faith, and that no soldiers would be permitted to enter the peninsula. His initial efforts were proving successful when Captain Lorenzo de Godoy arrived in Champoton at the command of soldiers despatched there by Montejo the Younger. Godoy and Testera were soon in conflict and the friar was forced to abandon Champoton and return to central Mexico. Godoy's attempt to subdue the Maya around Champoton was unsuccessful and the local Kowoj Maya resisted his attempts to assert Spanish dominance of the region.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 770‚Äì771. This resistance was sufficiently tenacious that Montejo the Younger sent his cousin from Tabasco to Champoton to take command. His diplomatic overtures to the Champoton Kowoj were successful and they submitted to Spanish rule. Champoton was the last Spanish outpost in the Yucat√°n Peninsula; it was increasingly isolated and the situation there became difficult.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 771.  Conquest and settlement in northern Yucat√°n, 1540‚Äì46  Ruins of a mission church built by the Spanish in Dzibilchalt√∫n ca. 1590‚Äì1600 from the stone taken from the nearby Maya temples Colonial coat of arms of Yucat√°n In 1540, Montejo the Elder, who was now in his late 60s, turned his royal rights to colonise Yucat√°n over to his son, Francisco de Montejo the Younger. In early 1541, Montejo the Younger joined his cousin in Champoton; he did not remain there long, and quickly moved his forces to Campeche. Once there, Montejo the Younger, commanding between three and four hundred Spanish soldiers, established the first permanent Spanish town council in the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Shortly after establishing the Spanish presence in Campeche, Montejo the Younger summoned the local Maya lords and commanded them to submit to the Spanish Crown. A number of lords submitted peacefully, including the ruler of the Xiu Maya. The lord of the Canul Maya refused to submit and Montejo the Younger sent his cousin against them; Montejo himself remained in Campeche awaiting reinforcements. Montejo the Younger's cousin met the Canul Maya at Chakan, not far from T ºho. On 6 January 1542, he founded the second permanent town council, calling the new colonial town M√©rida. On 23 January, Tutul Xiu, the lord of Mani, approached the Spanish encampment at M√©rida in peace, bearing sorely needed food supplies. He expressed interest in the Spanish religion and witnessed a Roman Catholic mass celebrated for his benefit. Tutul Xiu was greatly impressed and converted to the new religion; he was baptised as Melchor and stayed with the Spanish at M√©rida for two months, receiving instruction in the Catholic faith. Tutul Xiu was the ruler of the most powerful province of northern Yucat√°n and his submission to Spain and conversion to Christianity had repercussions throughout the peninsula, and encouraged the lords of the western provinces of the peninsula to accept Spanish rule. The eastern provinces continued to resist Spanish overtures.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 772. Montejo the Younger next sent his cousin to Chauaca where most of the eastern lords greeted him in peace. The Cochua Maya resisted fiercely but were soon defeated by the Spanish. The Cupul Maya also rose up against the newly imposed Spanish domination, and also their opposition was quickly put down. Montejo continued to the eastern Ekab province, reaching the east coast at Pole. Stormy weather prevented the Spanish from crossing to Cozumel, and nine Spaniards drowned in the attempted crossing. Another Spanish conquistador was killed by hostile Maya. Rumours of this setback grew in the telling and both the Cupul and Cochua provinces once again rose up against their would-be European overlords. The Spanish hold on the eastern portion of the peninsula remained tenuous and a number of Maya polities remained independent, including Chetumal, Cochua, Cupul, Sotuta and the Tazes. On 8 November 1546, an alliance of eastern provinces launched a coordinated uprising against the Spanish. The provinces of Cupul, Cochua, Sotuta, Tazes, Uaymil, Chetumal and Chikinchel united in a concerted effort to drive the invaders from the peninsula; the uprising lasted four months.Caso Barrera 2002, pp. 17, 19. Eighteen Spaniards were surprised in the eastern towns, and were sacrificed. A contemporary account described the slaughter of over 400 allied Maya, as well as livestock. M√©rida and Campeche were forewarned of the impending attack; Montejo the Younger and his cousin were in Campeche. Montejo the Elder arrived in M√©rida from Chiapas in December 1546, with reinforcements gathered from Champoton and Campeche. The rebellious eastern Maya were finally defeated in a single battle, in which twenty Spaniards and several hundred allied Maya were killed. This battle marked the final conquest of the northern portion of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. As a result of the uprising and the Spanish response, many of the Maya inhabitants of the eastern and southern territories fled to the still unconquered Pet√©n Basin, in the extreme south of the peninsula. The Spanish only achieved dominance in the north and the polities of Pet√©n remained independent and continued to receive many refugees from the north.Caso Barrera 2002, p. 19. Pet√©n Basin, 1618‚Äì97 The Pet√©n Basin covers an area that is now part of Guatemala; in colonial times it originally fell under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Yucat√°n, before being transferred to the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala in 1703.Fialko Coxemans 2003, pp. 72‚Äì73. The Itza kingdom centred upon Lake Pet√©n Itz√° had been visited by Hern√°n Cort√©s on his march to Honduras in 1525. Early 17th century 17th century entry routes to Pet√©n Following Cort√©s' visit, no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpet√©n for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from M√©rida on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still-pagan Itza in central Pet√©n. Bartolom√© de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received at Nojpet√©n by the current Kan Ek º. They stayed for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan Ek º refused to renounce his Maya religion, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpet√©n on friendly terms with Kan Ek º.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 773. The friars returned in October 1619, and again Kan Ek º welcomed them in a friendly manner, but this time the Maya priesthood were hostile and the missionaries were expelled without food or water, but survived the journey back to M√©rida.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. In March 1622, the governor of Yucat√°n, Diego de Cardenas, ordered Captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano to launch an assault upon the Itza; he set out from Yucat√°n with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucat√°n.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Jones 1998, p. 46. Chuchiak IV 2005, p. 131. His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. In May the expedition advanced to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, where there was a lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements.Jones 1998, pp. 42, 47. En route to Nojpet√©n, Delgado believed that the soldiers' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel, and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpet√©n with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipuj in Belize. In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts.Chuchiak IV 2005, p. 132. When Mirones learnt of Delgado's departure, he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj, but he was determined to reach Nojpet√©n.Means 1917, p. 79. From Tipuj, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ek º, asking permission to travel to Nojpet√©n; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital,Means 1917, p. 80. but as soon as the Spanish soldiers let their guard down, the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals.Means 1917, p. 81. The soldiers were sacrificed to the Maya gods.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Means 1917, p. 81. After their sacrifice, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others.Means 1917, p. 81. Jones 1998, pp. 47‚Äì48. The fortune of the leader of Delgado's Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with a Maya scout to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Pet√©n Itz√°, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. Bernardino Ek, the scout, escaped and returned to Mirones with the news. Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjK ºin P ºol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum,Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Jones 1998, p. 48. and killed them all. Spanish reinforcements arrived too late. A number of local Maya men and women were killed by Spanish attackers, who also burned the town.Jones 1998, p. 48. Following these killings, Spanish garrisons were stationed in several towns in southern Yucat√°n, and rewards were offered for the whereabouts of AjK ºin P ºol. The Maya governor of Oxkutzcab, Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya archers to track the warleader down; they succeeded in capturing the Itza captain and his followers, together with silverware from the looted Sakalum church and items belonging to Mirones. The prisoners were taken back to the Spanish Captain Antonio M√©ndez de Canzo, interrogated under torture, tried, and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered. They were decapitated, and the heads were displayed in the plazas of towns throughout the colonial Partido de la Sierra in what is now Mexico's Yucat√°n state.Jones 1998, pp. 48‚Äì49. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands; the Spanish Crown lacked the time, money or interest in such colonial adventures for the next four decades.Feldman 2000, p. 151. Late 17th century In 1692 Basque nobleman Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a y Arizmendi proposed to the Spanish king the construction of a road from M√©rida southwards to link with the Guatemalan colony, in the process \\"reducing\\" any independent native populations into colonial congregaciones; this was part of a greater plan to subjugate the Lakandon and Manche Ch ºol of southern Pet√©n and the upper reaches of the Usumacinta River. The original plan was for the province of Yucat√°n to build the northern section and for Guatemala to build the southern portion, with both meeting somewhere in Ch ºol territory; the plan was later modified to pass further east, through the kingdom of the Itza.Jones 1998, pp. 111, 132‚Äì133, 145. The governor of Yucat√°n, Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a y Arizmendi, began to build the road from Campeche south towards Pet√©n. At the beginning of March 1695, Captain Alonso Garc√≠a de Paredes led a group of 50 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by native guides, muleteers and labourers.Jones 1998, pp. 129‚Äì130. ITMB 2000. The expedition advanced south into Kejache territory, which began at Chunpich, about north of the modern border between Mexico and Guatemala.Jones 1998, pp. 130‚Äì131. ITMB 2000. He rounded up some natives to be moved into colonial settlements, but met with armed Kejache resistance. Garc√≠a decided to retreat around the middle of April.Jones 1998, p. 131. In March 1695, Captain Juan D√≠az de Velasco set out from Cahab√≥n in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, with 70 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by a large number of Maya archers from Verapaz, native muleteers, and four Dominican friars.Jones 1998, pp. 132, 134. Means 1917, p. 97. The Spanish pressed ahead to Lake Pet√©n Itz√° and engaged in a series of fierce skirmishes with Itza hunting parties.Jones 1998, pp. 135‚Äì136, 139‚Äì140. At the lakeshore, within sight of Nojpet√©n, the Spanish encountered such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to their main camp.Jones 1998, p. 141. Interrogation of an Itza prisoner revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish;Jones 1998, p. 140. the expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahab√≥n.Jones 1998, p. 142. In mid-May 1695 Garc√≠a again marched southwards from Campeche, with 115 Spanish soldiers and 150 Maya musketeers, plus Maya labourers and muleteers; the final tally was more than 400 people, which was regarded as a considerable army in the impoverished Yucat√°n province.Jones 1998, p. 143. Urs√∫a also ordered two companies of Maya musketeers from Tek ºax and Oxk ºutzkab º to join the expedition at B ºolonch ºen Kawich, some southeast of the city of Campeche.Jones 1998, pp. 130, 144. At the end of May three friars were assigned to join the Spanish force, accompanied by a lay brother. A second group of Franciscans would continue onwards independently to Nojpet√©n to make contact with the Itzas; it was led by friar Andr√©s de Avenda√±o, who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother.Jones 1998, pp. 148‚Äì149. Garc√≠a ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65 miles or 105 km) north of Lake Pet√©n Itz√°, which would serve as the main military base for the Camino Real (\\"Royal Road\\") project.Jones 1998, p. 147. The Sajkab ºchen company of native musketeers pushed ahead with the road builders from Tzuktzok º to the first Kejache town at Chunpich, which the Kejache had fled. The company's officers sent for reinforcements from Garc√≠a at Tzuktok º but before any could arrive some 25 Kejache returned to Chunpich with baskets to collect their abandoned food. The nervous Sajkab ºchen sentries feared that the residents were returning en masse and discharged their muskets at them, with both groups then retreating. The musketeer company then arrived to reinforce their sentries and charged into battle against approaching Kejache archers. Several musketeers were injured in the ensuing skirmish and, the Kejache retreated along a forest path without injury. The Sajkab ºchen company followed the path and found two more deserted settlements with large amounts of abandoned food. They seized the food and retreated back along the path.Jones 1998, p. 154. Means 1917, pp. 117‚Äì118. Around 3 August Garc√≠a moved his entire army forward to Chunpich,Jones 1998, p. 154. and by October Spanish soldiers had established themselves near the source of the San Pedro River.Jones 1998, p. 163. By November Tzuktok º was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki. In December 1695 the main force was reinforced with 250 soldiers, of which 150 were Spanish and pardo and 100 were Maya, together with labourers and muleteers.Jones 1998, p. 162. =Avenda√±o's expedition, June 1695= In May 1695 Antonio de Silva had appointed two groups of Franciscans to head for Pet√©n; the first group was to join up with Garc√≠a's military expedition. The second group was to head for Lake Pet√©n Itza independently. This second group was headed by friar Andr√©s de Avenda√±o. Avenda√±o was accompanied by another friar, a lay brother, and six Christian Maya.Jones 1998, pp. 148, 150. This latter group left M√©rida on 2 June 1695.Jones 1998, pp. 130, 151‚Äì152. Avenda√±o continued south along the course of the new road, finding increasing evidence of Spanish military activity. The Franciscans overtook Garc√≠a at B ºuk ºte, about before Tzuktok º.Jones 1998, p. 152. On 3 August Garc√≠a advanced to Chunpich but tried to persuade Avenda√±o to stay behind to minister to the prisoners from B ºuk ºte. Avenda√±o instead split his group and left in secret with just four Christian Maya companions,Jones 1998, pp. 150, 154. seeking the Chunpich Kejache that had attacked one of Garc√≠a's advance companies and had now retreated into the forest.Jones 1998, pp. 154‚Äì155. He was unable to find the Kejache but did manage to get information regarding a path that led southwards to the Itza kingdom. Avenda√±o returned to Tzuktok º and reconsidered his plans; the Franciscans were short of supplies, and the forcefully congregated Maya that they were charged with converting were disappearing back into the forest daily.Jones 1998, p. 155. Antonio de Silva ordered Avenda√±o to return to M√©rida, and he arrived there on 17 September 1695.Jones 1998, p. 156. Meanwhile, the other group of Franciscans, led by Juan de San Buenaventura Ch√°vez, continued following the roadbuilders into Kejache territory, through IxB ºam, B ºatkab º and Chuntuki (modern Chuntunqui near Carmelita, Pet√©n).Jones 1998, pp. 148, 157. Quezada 2011, p. 23. ITMB 1998. =San Buenaventura among the Kejache, September ‚Äì November 1695= Juan de San Buenaventura's small group of Franciscans arrived in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695, and found that the army had opened the road southwards for another seventeen leagues (approximately 44.2 miles or 71.1 km), almost to Lake Pet√©n Itz√°, but returned to Chuntuki due to the seasonal rains.Jones 1998, p. 157. San Buenaventura was accompanied by two friars and a lay brother.Jones 1998, p. 148. With Avenda√±o's return to M√©rida, provincial superior Antonio de Silva despatched two additional friars to join San Buenaventura's group. One of these was to convert the Kejache in Tzuktok º, and the other was to do the same at Chuntuki.Jones 1998, p. 158. On 24 October San Buenaventura wrote to the provincial superior reporting that the warlike Kejache were now pacified and that they had told him that the Itza were ready to receive the Spanish in friendship.Jones 1998, pp. 158‚Äì159. On that day 62 Kejache men had voluntarily come to Chuntuki from Pak ºek ºem, where another 300 Kejache resided.Jones 1998, pp. 159‚Äì160. In early November 1695, friar Tom√°s de Alcoser and brother Lucas de San Francisco were sent to establish a mission at Pak ºek ºem, where they were well received by the cacique (native chief) and his pagan priest. Pak ºek ºem was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference, and the friars oversaw the building of a church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory. A second church was built at B ºatkab º to attend to over 100 K ºejache refugees who had been gathered there under the stewardship of a Spanish friar;Jones 1998, p. 160. a further church was established at Tzuktok º, overseen by another friar.Jones 1998, pp. 160‚Äì161. =Avenda√±o's expedition, December 1695 ‚Äì January 1696= Franciscan Andr√©s de Avenda√±o left M√©rida on 13 December 1695, and arrived in Nojpet√©n around 14 January 1696, accompanied by four companions.Jones 1998, pp. 187, 189. From Chuntuki they followed an Indian trail that led them past the source of the San Pedro River and across steep karst hills to a watering hole by some ruins.Jones 1998, pp. 189‚Äì190. Means 1917, p. 128. From there they followed the small Act√© River to a Chak ºan Itza town called Saklemakal.Jones 1998, p. 190. They arrived at the western end of Lake Pet√©n Itz√° to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek º travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the Chak ºan Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake Pet√©n Itza.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 775. Jones 1998, p. 192. The Franciscans returned to Nojpet√©n with Kan Ek º and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avenda√±o tried to convince Kan Ek º to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish Crown, without success. The king of the Itza, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 775. On 19 January AjKowoj, the king of the Kowoj, arrived at Nojpet√©n and spoke with Avenda√±o,Jones 1998, p. 205. arguing against the acceptance of Christianity and Spanish rule.Jones 1998, p. 207. The discussions between Avenda√±o, Kan Ek º and AjKowoj exposed deep divisions among the Itza.Jones 1998, pp. 209‚Äì210. Kan Ek º learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to M√©rida via Tipuj.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 775. Jones 1998, pp. 214‚Äì215. The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships, including the death of one of Avenda√±o's companions,Vayhinger- Scheer 2011, p. 383. but after a month wandering in the forest found their way back to Chuntuki, and from there returned to M√©rida.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 775‚Äì776. Jones 1998, pp. 218‚Äì219. =Battle at Ch ºich º, 2 February 1696= By mid- January Captain Garc√≠a de Paredes had arrived at the advance portion of the Camino Real at Chuntuki.Jones 1998, pp. 189, 226. By now he only had 90 soldiers plus labourers and porters.Jones 1998, p. 226. Captain Pedro de Zubiaur, Garc√≠a's senior officer, arrived at Lake Pet√©n Itza with 60 musketeers, two Franciscans, and allied Yucatec Maya warriors.Jones 1998, p. 227. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 776. They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters.Jones 1998, p. 227. They were approached by about 300 canoes carrying approximately 2,000 Itza warriors.Jones 1998, p. 228. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 776. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and a scuffle then broke out; a dozen of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and three of them were killed. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners, who included the two Franciscans.Jones 1998, p. 228. The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by thousands of Itza warriors. Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate.Jones 1998, p. 229. Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a was now convinced that Kan Ek º would not surrender peacefully, and he began to organise an all-out assault on Nojpet√©n.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 776. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch ºich º the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance. =Expedition from Verapaz, February ‚Äì March 1696= Oidor Bartolom√© de Am√©squeta led the next Guatemalan expedition against the Itza. He marched his men from Cahab√≥n to Mop√°n, arriving on 25 February 1696.Jones 1998, pp. 232‚Äì233. On 7 March, Captain D√≠az de Velasco led a party ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by two Dominican friars and by AjK ºixaw, an Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on D√≠az's previous expedition.Jones 1998, p. 233. When they drew close to the shore of Lake Pet√©n Itz√°, AjK ºixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpet√©n.Jones 1998, pp. 233‚Äì234. D√≠az's party was lured into an Itza trap and the expedition members were killed to a man. The two friars were captured and sacrificed. The Itza killed a total of 87 expedition members, including 50 soldiers, two Dominicans and about 35 Maya helpers.Jones 1998, p. 479n59. Am√©squeta left Mop√°n three days after D√≠az and followed D√≠az's trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpet√©n they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance.Jones 1998, p. 234-235. Am√©squeta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpet√©n; as nightfall approached Am√©squeta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby.Jones 1998, pp. 237‚Äì238. In the early hours of the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight.Jones 1998, pp. 238‚Äì239. At San Pedro Mart√≠r he received news of an Itza embassy to M√©rida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority.Jones 1998, p. 240. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro M√°rtir, Am√©squeta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.Jones 1998, pp. 241‚Äì242. =Assault on Nojpet√©n= The Itzas' continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpet√©n once and for all.Jones 2000, p. 362. Mart√≠n de Urz√∫a y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of Lake Pet√©n Itz√° with his soldiers on 26 February 1697, and once there built the heavily armed galeota attack boat.Jones 2009, p. 59. Jones 1998, pp. 253, 265‚Äì266. The galeota carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces.Jones 1998, pp. 268‚Äì269. The piragua longboat used to cross the San Pedro River was also transported to the lake to be used in the attack on the Itza capital.Jones 1998, pp. 252, 268. On 10 March a number of Itza and Yalain emissaries arrived at Ch ºich º to negotiate with Urs√∫a.Jones 1998, pp. 269‚Äì270. Kan Ek º then sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries, who offered peaceful surrender. Urs√∫a received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ek º to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ek º failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 777. A waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital on the morning of 13 March.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 777. Jones 1998, p. 295. Urs√∫a boarded the galeota with 108 soldiers, two secular priests, five personal servants, the baptised Itza emissary AjChan and his brother-in-law and an Itza prisoner from Nojpet√©n. The attack boat was rowed east towards the Itza capital; across the lake it encountered a large fleet of canoes spread in an arc across the approach to Nojpet√©n ‚Äì Urs√∫a simply gave the order to row through them. A large number of defenders had gathered along the shore of Nojpet√©n and on the roofs of the city.Jones 1998, p. 297. Itza archers began to shoot at the invaders from the canoes. Urs√∫a ordered his men not to return fire but arrows wounded a number of his soldiers; one of the wounded soldiers discharged his musket and at that point the officers lost control of their men. The defending Itza soon fled from the withering Spanish gunfire.Jones 1998, pp. 298‚Äì299. The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss of life on the island; the surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 777‚Äì778. After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town. Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpet√©n as Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (\\"Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza\\").Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 778. Jones 2009, p. 59. The Itza nobility fled, dispersing to Maya settlements throughout Pet√©n; in response the Spanish scoured the region with search parties.Jones 1998, p. 295. Kan Ek º was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu;Jones 1998, p. 306. The Kowoj king (Aj Kowoj) was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families.Jones 2009, p. 59. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers.Jones 1998, p. xix.

The Sinclair Scientific Programmable, released a year later, was advertised as the first budget programmable calculator. Significant modifications to the algorithms used meant that a chipset intended for a four-function calculator was able to process scientific functions, but at the cost of reduced speed and accuracy. Compared to contemporary scientific calculators, some functions were slow to execute, and others had limited accuracy or gave the wrong answer, but the cost of the Sinclair was a fraction of the cost of competing calculators. History In 1972, Hewlett-Packard launched the HP-35, the world's first handheld scientific calculator. Despite market research suggesting that it was too expensive for there to be any real demand, production went ahead. It cost (about ), but despite the price, over 300,000 were sold in the three and a half years for which it was produced. From 1971 Texas Instruments had been making available the building block for a simple calculator on a single chip and the TMS0803 chipset appeared in a number of Sinclair calculators. Clive Sinclair wanted to design a calculator to compete with the HP-35 using this series of chips. Despite scepticism about the feasibility of the project from Texas Instruments engineers, Nigel Searle was able to design algorithms that sacrificed some speed and accuracy in order to implement scientific functions on the TMS0805 variation. The Sinclair Scientific first appeared in a case derived from that of the Sinclair Cambridge, but it was not part of the same range. The initial retail price was in the UK (), and in the US for as a kit or fully assembled. By July 1976, however, it was possible to purchase one for (). The Sinclair Scientific Programmable was introduced in August 1975, and was larger than the Sinclair Scientific, at . It was advertised as \\"the first ... calculator to offer a ... programming facility ... at a price within the reach of the general public,\\" but was limited by having only 24 program steps. Both the Sinclair Scientific and the Sinclair Scientific Programmable were manufactured in England, like all other Sinclair calculators except the Sinclair President. Design=Sinclair Scientific The HP-35 used five chips, and had a been developed by twenty engineers at a cost of a million dollars, leading the Texas Instruments engineers to think that Sinclair's aim to build a scientific calculator around the TMS0805 chip, which could barely handle four-function arithmetic, was impossible. However, by sacrificing some speed and accuracy, Sinclair used clever algorithms to run scientific operations on a chip with room for just 320 instructions. Constants, rather than being stored in the calculator, were printed on the case below the screen. It displays only in scientific notation, with a five digit mantissa and a two digit exponent, although a sixth digit of the mantissa was stored internally. Because of the way the processor was designed, it uses Reverse Polish notation (RPN) for inputting calculations. RPN meant that the difficult implementation of brackets, and the associated recursive logic, was not necessary to implement in the hardware, but the effort was instead offloaded to the user. Instead of an \\"Equals\\" button, there is an \\"Enter\\" button that tells the calculator when a value has been entered, and then the operators are entered in after the operands. For example, on some devices to evaluate \\"(1+2) x 3\\", the sequence entered would be \\"3 enter 2 enter 1 + x.\\" The Sinclair Scientific entry procedure is slightly different as it lacks an enter key and has a limited number of internal registers. To fit the program into the 320 words available on the chip, some significant modification was used. By not using regular floating point numbers, which require many instructions to keep the decimal point in the right place, some space was freed up. Trigonometric functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log taking about 20 more. The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs. The design of the algorithms meant that some calculations, such as arccos0.2, could take up to 15 seconds, whereas the HP-35 was designed to complete calculations in under a second. Accuracy in scientific functions was also limited to around three digits at most, and there were a number of bugs and limitations. Ken Shirriff, an employee of Google, reverse engineered a Sinclair Scientific and built a simulator using the original algorithms. =Assembly kit= The assembly kit consisted of eight groups of components, plus a carry case. The build time was advertised as being around three hours, and required a soldering iron and a pair of cutters. In January 1975, the kit was available for , half the price at the time of introduction a year earlier, and in December 1975 it was available for , less than a quarter of the introductory price. =Giant Scientific= A version of the Scientific, with all the same functionality, was made to be , and was known as the Giant Scientific. It was powered by 240 V AC, and used discrete LEDs for its display. Sinclair Scientific Programmable The Sinclair Scientific Programmable was introduced in 1975, with the same case as the Sinclair Oxford. It was larger than the Scientific, at , and used a larger PP3 battery, but could also be powered by mains electricity. It had 24-step programming abilities, which meant it was highly limited for many purposes. It also lacked functions for the natural logarithm and exponential function. Constants used in programs were required to be integers, and the programming was wasteful, with start and end quotes needed to use a constant in a program. However, included with the calculator was a library of over 120 programs that performed common operations in mathematics, geometry, statistics, finance, physics, electronics, engineering, as well as fluid mechanics and materials science. The full library of standard programs contained over 400 programs in the Sinclair Program Library. Calculations using the Sinclair Scientific The Sinclair used a slightly different Reverse Polish Notation method; lacking an enter key, the operation keys enter a number into the appropriate register and the calculation is performed. For example, \\"(1+2) * 3\\" could be calculated as: C 1 + 2 + 3 √ó to give the result of 9.0000 00 (, or 9). The \\"C\\" key performs a clear; pressing it sets the calculator to a state with zero in the internal registers. Pressing \\"C\\" followed by number keys then \\"+\\" effectively adds the number entered to the zero and stores it internally to be worked on in subsequent calculations. If the \\"-\\" key is pressed instead, the number is subtracted from zero, effectively entering a negative number. All numbers are entered in scientific notation. After entering the mantissa part of the number the \\"E\\" exponent key is pressed prior to entering the integer exponent of the number. Respect for the order of operations is placed on the user, and there are no bracket keys. The display shows only five digits, but six digits can be entered. As an example 12.3*(-123.4+123.456) could be entered as C 1 2 3 4 E 2 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 E 2 + 1 2 3 E 1 √ó for a displayed result of 6.8880 -01 (representing , or 0.68880). Four constants are printed on the calculator case for easy reference. For converting to and from base 10 logarithms and natural logarithms the natural logarithm of 10 (2.30259) and e (2.71828) are printed on the case. Pi (3.14159) and 57.2958 (180 / Pi) are also on the case for trigonometry calculations. There was not enough internal memory to store these constants internally. Angles are computed using radians; degree values must be converted to radians by dividing by 57.2958. As an example, to calculate 25 sin (600*0.05¬∞) one would enter C 6 E 2 + 0 0 5 √ó 5 7 2 9 5 8 E 1 √∑ ‚ñ≤ + 2 5 E 1 √ó to get a result of 1.2500 01 (representing 12.5 which is equal to 25 sin(30¬∞) ). Sine is selected with the combination of the \\"‚ñ≤\\" key followed by the \\"+\\" key. The \\"‚ñº\\" (down) and \\"‚ñ≤\\" (up) arrow keys are function select keys. The four operation keys (\\"-, +, √∑ and √ó\\") all have two other function activated by using one of the arrow keys. The function available are Sine, Arcsine, Cosine, Arccosine, Tangent, Arctangent, Logarithm and Antilogarithm.

Along with her family, Albright immigrated to the United States in 1948 from Czechoslovakia. Her father, diplomat Josef Korbel, settled the family in Denver, Colorado, and she became a U.S. citizen in 1957. Albright graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 and earned a PhD from Columbia University in 1975, writing her thesis on the Prague Spring. She worked as an aide to Senator Edmund Muskie before taking a position under Zbigniew Brzezinski on the National Security Council. She served in that position until 1981, when President Jimmy Carter left office. After leaving the National Security Council, Albright joined the academic faculty of Georgetown University and advised Democratic candidates regarding foreign policy. After Clinton's victory in the 1992 presidential election, Albright helped assemble his National Security Council. In 1993, Clinton appointed her to the position of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. She held that position until 1997, when she succeeded Warren Christopher as Secretary of State. Albright served in that capacity until Clinton left office in 2001. Albright has served as chair of the Albright Stonebridge Group since 2009. She is the Michael and Virginia Mortara Endowed Distinguished Professor in the Practice of Diplomacy at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. In May 2012, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President Barack Obama. Secretary Albright also serves on the board of the Council on Foreign Relations. Early life and career Albright was born Marie Jana Korbelov√° in 1937 in the Sm√≠chov district of Prague, Czechoslovakia. She is the daughter of Josef Korbel, a Czech diplomat, and Anna Korbel (n√©e Spieglov√°). At the time of her birth, Czechoslovakia had been independent for less than 20 years, having gained independence from the Austria-Hungary empire after World War I. Her father was a supporter of the early Czech democrats, Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk and Edvard Bene≈°. Marie Jana had a younger sister Katherine and a younger brother John (these versions of their names are Anglicized). When Marie Jana was born, her father was serving as a press-attach√© at the Czechoslovak Embassy in Belgrade. The signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938, and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler's troops forced the family into exile because of their links with Bene≈°.Albright, 2003: pp. 8‚Äì9 In 1941, Josef and Anna converted from Judaism to Catholicism. Marie Jana and her siblings were raised in the Roman Catholic faith. In 1997, Albright said her parents never told her or her two siblings about their Jewish ancestry and heritage. The family moved to Britain in May 1939. Here her father worked for Bene≈°'s Czechoslovak government-in-exile. Her family first lived on Kensington Park Road in Notting Hill, London ‚Äì where they endured the worst of the Blitz ‚Äì but later moved to Beaconsfield, then Walton-on-Thames, on the outskirts of London.Albright, 2003, pp. 9‚Äì11. They kept a large metal table in the house, which was intended to shelter the family from the recurring threat of German air raids. While in England, Marie Jana was one of the children shown in a documentary film designed to promote sympathy for war refugees in London.Albright, 2003, p. 9. After the defeat of the Nazis in the European Theatre of World War II and the collapse of Nazi Germany and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, the Korbel family returned to Prague. They were given a luxurious apartment in the Hradƒçany district. (This benefit generated controversy for the family, as the flat had belonged to an ethnic German Bohemian industrialist family who were forced out by the Bene≈° decrees to expel such families from the country. This was part of a multi-nation expulsion of ethnic Germans from eastern Europe after the war. See \\"Controversies\\"). Korbel was appointed as Czechoslovakian Ambassador to Yugoslavia, and the family moved to Belgrade. Yugoslavia was governed by the Communist Party, and Korbel was concerned his daughter would be exposed to Marxism in a Yugoslav school. She was taught privately by a governess and later sent to the Prealpina Institut pour Jeunes Filles finishing school in Chexbres, on Lake Geneva in Switzerland.Albright, 2003, p. 15. She learned to speak French while in Switzerland and changed her name from \\"Marie Jana\\" to \\"Madeleine\\".Albright, 2003, p. 4. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took over the government in 1948, with support from the Soviet Union. As an opponent of communism, Korbel was forced to resign from his position.Albright, 2003, p. 17. He later obtained a position on a United Nations delegation to Kashmir. He sent his family to the United States, by way of London, to wait for him when he arrived to deliver his report to the U.N. Headquarters, then located in Lake Success, New York. Youth and young adulthood in the United States Korbel's family emigrated from the United Kingdom on the SS America, departing Southampton on November 5, 1948, and arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor on November 11, 1948. The family initially settled in Great Neck on the North Shore of Long Island.Albright, 2003, p. 18. Korbel applied for political asylum, arguing that as an opponent of Communism, he was under threat in Prague.Albright, 2003, p. 19‚Äì20. With the help of Philip Moseley, a professor of Russian at Columbia University in New York City, Korbel obtained a position on the staff of the political science department at the University of Denver in Colorado.Albright, 2003, p. 20. He became dean of the university's school of international relations, and later taught future U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. In 2008 the school was named as the Josef Korbel School of International Studies in his honor. Madeline Korbel spent her teen years in Denver, and in 1955 graduated from the Kent Denver School in Cherry Hills Village, a suburb of Denver. She founded the school's international relations club and was its first president.Albright, 2003, p. 24. She attended Wellesley College, in Wellesley, Massachusetts, on a full scholarship, majoring in political science, and graduated in 1959.Albright, 2003, p. 47. The topic of her senior thesis was Zdenƒõk Fierlinger, a former Czechoslovakian Prime Minister.Albright, 2003, p. 43. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1957, and joined the College Democrats of America.Albright, 2003, pp. 34‚Äì35. While home in Denver from Wellesley, Korbel worked as an intern for The Denver Post. There she met Joseph Medill Patterson Albright. He was the nephew of Alicia Patterson, owner of Newsday and wife of philanthropist Harry Frank Guggenheim.Albright, 2003, p. 36. Korbel converted to the Episcopal Church at the time of her marriage. The couple were married in Wellesley in 1959, shortly after her graduation. They lived first in Rolla, Missouri, while her husband completed his military service at nearby Fort Leonard Wood. During this time, Albright worked at The Rolla Daily News.Albright, 2003, p. 48. In January 1960, the couple moved to her husband's hometown of Chicago, Illinois. Joseph worked at the Chicago Sun-Times as a journalist, and Albright worked as a picture editor for Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.Albright, 2003, pp. 49‚Äì50. The following year, Joseph Albright began work at Newsday in New York City, and the couple moved to Garden City on Long Island.Albright, 2003, p. 52. That year, she gave birth to twin daughters, Alice Patterson Albright and Anne Korbel Albright. The twins were born six weeks premature and required a long hospital stay. As a distraction, Albright began Russian classes at Hofstra University in the Village of Hempstead nearby. In 1962, the family moved to Washington, DC, where they lived in Georgetown. Albright studied international relations and continued in Russian at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, a division of Johns Hopkins University in the capital.Albright, 2003, p. 54. In 1963 Joseph's aunt Alicia Patterson died, and the Albrights returned to Long Island with the notion of Joseph taking over the family newspaper business.Albright, 2003, p. 55. In 1967 Albright gave birth to another daughter, Katherine Medill Albright. She continued her studies at Columbia University's Department of Public Law and Government.Albright, 2003, p. 56. (It was later renamed as the political science department, and is located within the School of International and Public Affairs.) She earned a certificate in Russian, an M.A. and a Ph.D., writing her master's thesis on the Soviet diplomatic corps and her doctoral dissertation on the role of journalists in the Prague Spring of 1968.Albright, 2003, pp. 56, 59, 71. She also took a graduate course given by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who later became her boss at the U.S. National Security Council.Albright, 2003, p. 57. Career=Early career Albright returned to Washington, D.C., in 1968, and commuted to Columbia for her PhD degree, which she received in 1975.Albright, 2003, p. 71. She began fund-raising for her daughters' school, involvement which led to several positions on education boards.Albright, 2003, pp. 63‚Äì66. She was eventually invited to organize a fund-raising dinner for the 1972 presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Ed Muskie of Maine.Albright, 2003, p. 65. This association with Muskie led to a position as his chief legislative assistant in 1976. However, after the 1976 U.S. presidential election of Jimmy Carter, Albright's former professor Brzezinski was named National Security Advisor, and recruited Albright from Muskie in 1978 to work in the West Wing as the National Security Council's congressional liaison. Following Carter's loss in 1980 to Ronald Reagan, Albright moved on to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where she was given a grant for a research project.Albright, 2003, p. 91. She chose to write on the dissident journalists involved in Poland's Solidarity movement, then in its infancy but gaining international attention. She traveled to Poland for her research, interviewing dissidents in Gda≈Ñsk, Warsaw and Krak√≥w.Albright, 2003, p. 92. Upon her return to Washington, her husband announced his intention to divorce her for another woman.Albright, 2003, p. 94. Albright joined the academic staff at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1982, specializing in Eastern European studies.Albright, 2003, p. 99. She also directed the university's program on women in global politics.Albright, 2003, p. 100. She served as a major Democratic Party foreign policy advisor, briefing Vice-Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 (both campaigns ended in defeat).Albright, 2003, pp. 102‚Äì104. In 1992, Bill Clinton returned the White House to the Democratic Party, and Albright was employed to handle the transition to a new administration at the National Security Council.Albright, 2003, p. 127. In January 1993, Clinton nominated her to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, her first diplomatic posting.Albright, 2003, p. 131. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Albright was appointed Ambassador to the United Nations shortly after Clinton was inaugurated, presenting her credentials on February 9, 1993. During her tenure at the U.N., she had a rocky relationship with the U.N. Secretary- General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom she criticized as \\"disengaged\\" and \\"neglect[ful]\\" of genocide in Rwanda.Albright, 2003, p. 207. Albright wrote: \\"My deepest regret from my years in public service is the failure of the United States and the international community to act sooner to halt these crimes.\\"Albright, 2003, p. 147. In Shake Hands with the Devil, Rom√©o Dallaire claims that in 1994, in Albright's role as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N., she avoided describing the killings in Rwanda as \\"genocide\\" until overwhelmed by the evidence for it; this is now how she describes these massacres in her memoirs. She was instructed to support a reduction or withdrawal (something which never happened) of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Rwanda but was later given more flexibility.Albright, 2003, pp. 150‚Äì151. Albright later remarked in PBS documentary Ghosts of Rwanda that \\"it was a very, very difficult time, and the situation was unclear. You know, in retrospect, it all looks very clear. But when you were [there] at the time, it was unclear about what was happening in Rwanda.\\"\\" Also in 1996, after Cuban military pilots shot down two small civilian aircraft flown by the Cuban- American exile group Brothers to the Rescue over international waters, she announced, \\"This is not cojones. This is cowardice.\\"Albright, 2003, p. 205. The line endeared her to President Clinton, who said it was \\"probably the most effective one-liner in the whole administration's foreign policy.\\" In 1996, Albright entered into a secret pact with Richard Clarke, Michael Sheehan, and James Rubin to overthrow U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who was running unopposed for a second term in the 1996 selection. After 15 U.S. peacekeepers died in a failed raid in Somalia in 1993, Boutros-Ghali became a political scapegoat in the United States. They dubbed the pact \\"Operation Orient Express\\" to reflect their hope that other nations would join the United States. Although every other member of the United Nations Security Council voted for Boutros-Ghali, the United States refused to yield to international pressure to drop its lone veto. After four deadlocked meetings of the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali suspended his candidacy and became the only U.N. Secretary-General ever to be denied a second term. The United States then fought a four-round veto duel with France, forcing it to back down and accept Kofi Annan as the next Secretary-General. In his memoirs, Clarke said that \\"the entire operation had strengthened Albright's hand in the competition to be Secretary of State in the second Clinton administration.\\" Secretary of State The top level of the Clinton administration was divided into two camps on selecting the new foreign policy. Outgoing Chief of Staff Leon Panetta favored Albright, but a separate faction argued, \\"anybody but Albright\\", with Sam Nunn as its first choice. Albright orchestrated a campaign on her own behalf that proved successful.Thomas Blood, Madam Secretary (1997) pp 12-34. When Albright took office as the 64th U.S. Secretary of State on January 23, 1997, she became the first female U.S. Secretary of State and the highest-ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government at the time of her appointment. Not being a natural-born citizen of the U.S., she was not eligible as a U.S. Presidential successor and was excluded from nuclear contingency plans. During her tenure, Albright considerably influenced American foreign policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Middle East. According to Albright's memoirs, she once argued with Colin Powell for the use of military force by asking, \\"What's the point of you saving this superb military for, Colin, if we can't use it?\\"Albright, 2003, p. 182. As Secretary of State, she represented the U.S. at the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. She along with the British contingents boycotted the swearing-in ceremony of the Chinese-appointed Hong Kong Legislative Council, which replaced the elected one. Albright with Benjamin Netanyahu (left) and Yasser Arafat at the Wye River Memorandum, 1998 According to several accounts, Prudence Bushnell, U.S. Ambassador to Kenya, repeatedly asked Washington for additional security at the embassy in Nairobi, including a letter directly addressed to Albright in April 1998. Bushnell was ignored. She later stated that when she spoke to Albright about the letter, Albright told her that it had not been shown to her.PBS Documentary In Against All Enemies, Richard Clarke writes about an exchange with Albright several months after the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed in August 1998. \\"What do you think will happen if you lose another embassy?\\" Clarke asked. \\"The Republicans in Congress will go after you.\\" \\"First of all, I didn't lose these two embassies\\", Albright shot back. \\"I inherited them in the shape they were.\\" In 1998, at the NATO summit, Albright articulated what became known as the \\"three Ds\\" of NATO, \\"which is no diminution of NATO, no discrimination and no duplication ‚Äì because I think that we don't need any of those three \\"Ds\\" to happen.\\" With NATO officers during NATO Ceremony of Accession of New Members, 1999 In February 1998, Albright partook in a town-hall style meeting at St. John Arena in Columbus where she, William Cohen, and Sandy Berger attempted to make the case for military action in Iraq. The crowd was disruptive, repeatedly drowning out the discussion with boos and anti-war chants. James Rubin downplayed the disruptions, claiming the crowd was supportive of a war policy.\\"U.S. policy on Iraq draws fire in Ohio\\", CNN. February 18, 1998. Retrieved January 9, 2017 Later that year, both Bill Clinton and Albright insisted that an attack on Saddam Hussein could be stopped only if Hussein reversed his decision to halt arms inspections. In 2000, Albright became one of the highest level Western diplomats ever to meet Kim Jong-il, the then- leader of communist North Korea, during an official state visit to that country. On January 8, 2001, in one of her last acts as Secretary of State, Albright made a farewell call to Kofi Annan and said that the U.S. would continue to press Iraq to destroy all its weapons of mass destruction as a condition of lifting economic sanctions, even after the end of the Clinton administration on January 20, 2001. In 2001, Albright received the U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by the Jefferson Awards Foundation. Post-Clinton administration Madeleine Albright at the World Economic Forum Following Albright's term as Secretary of State, many speculated that she might pursue a career in Czech politics. Czech President, V√°clav Havel, spoke openly about the possibility of Albright succeeding him. Albright was reportedly flattered, but denied ever seriously considering the possibility of running for office in her country of origin. In 2001, Albright was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Also in 2001, Albright founded the Albright Group, an international strategy consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. that later become the Albright Stonebridge Group. Affiliated with the firm is Albright Capital Management, which was founded in 2005 to engage in private fund management related to emerging markets. In 2003, Albright accepted a position on the Board of Directors of the New York Stock Exchange. In 2005, she declined to run for re- election to the board in the aftermath of the Richard Grasso compensation scandal, in which Grasso, the chairman of the NYSE Board of Directors, had been granted $187.5 million in compensation, with little governance by the board on which Albright sat. During the tenure of the interim chairman, John S. Reed, Albright served as chairwoman of the NYSE board's nominating and governance committee. Shortly after the appointment of the NYSE board's permanent chairman in 2005, Albright submitted her resignation. Albright serves on the Council on Foreign Relations Board of directors and on the International Advisory Committee of the Brookings Doha Center. As of 2016, she is the Mortara Distinguished Professor of Diplomacy at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Washington, D.C. Albright serves as chairperson of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and as president of the Truman Scholarship Foundation. She is also the co-chair of the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor and was the chairwoman of the Council of Women World Leaders Women's Ministerial Initiative up until November 16, 2007, when she was succeeded by Margot Wallstr√∂m. On October 25, 2005, Albright guest starred on the television drama Gilmore Girls as herself. She also made a guest appearance on Parks and Recreation, in the eighth episode of the seventh season. At the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on November 13, 2007, Albright declared that she and William Cohen would co- chair a new \\"Genocide Prevention Task Force\\" created by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the American Academy of Diplomacy, and the United States Institute for Peace. Their appointment was criticized by Harut SassounianMadeleine Albright to Co-Chair Genocide Prevention Task Force, Huffington Post, November 20, 2007. and the Armenian National Committee of America, as both Albright and Cohen had spoken against a Congressional resolution on the Armenian genocide. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry greets Albright, February 6, 2013 Albright endorsed and supported Hillary Clinton in her 2008 presidential campaign. Albright has been a close friend of Clinton and has served as an informal advisor on foreign policy matters. On December 1, 2008, then-President-elect Barack Obama nominated then-Senator Clinton for Albright's former post of Secretary of State. Bob Schieffer and Madeleine Albright at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2017 In September 2009, Albright opened an exhibition of her personal jewelry collection at the Museum of Art and Design in New York City, which ran until January 2010. In 2009 Albright also published the book Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat's Jewel Box about her pins. In August 2012, when speaking at an Obama campaign event in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, Albright was asked the question \\"How long will you blame that previous administration for all of your problems?\\", to which she replied \\"Forever\\". In October 2012, Albright appeared in a video on the official Twitter feed for the Democratic Party, responding to then-GOP candidate Mitt Romney's assertion that Russia was the \\"number-one geopolitical foe\\" of the United States. According to Albright, Romney's statement was proof that he had \\"little understanding of what was actually going on in the 21st Century [and] he is not up to date and that is a very dangerous aspect [of his candidacy]\\".Romney, who calls Russia our \\"No. 1 geopolitical foe,\\" doesn't seem to realize it's the 21st century. #RomneyNotReady Albright has described Donald Trump as \\"the most anti-democratic leader\\" in US history. She has also criticised the Trump Administration for its delay in filling some diplomatic posts as a sign of \\"disdain for diplomacy\\". As of 2016, Albright serves as chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, a consulting firm, and chair of the advisory council for The Hague Institute for Global Justice, which was founded in 2011 in The Hague., YouTube. uploaded May 31, 2011 by THIGJTHIGJ. She also serves as an Honorary Chair for the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity. Investments Madeleine Albright is a co-investor with Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, and George Soros in a $350 million investment vehicle called Helios Towers Africa, which intends to buy or build thousands of mobile phone towers in Africa.  Controversies Deaths by sanctions against Iraq= On May 12, 1996, Albright defended UN sanctions against Iraq on a 60 Minutes segment in which Lesley Stahl asked her, \\"We have heard that half a million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?\\" and Albright replied, \\"We think the price is worth it.\\" Albright later criticized Stahl's segment as \\"amount[ing] to Iraqi propaganda\\", saying that her question was a loaded question. She wrote, \\"I had fallen into a trap and said something I did not mean\\", and she regretted coming \\"across as cold-blooded and cruel.\\" Sanctions critics took Albright's failure to reframe the question as confirmation of the statistic. The segment won an Emmy Award. In the context of the 1998 Iraq campaign, Albright expressed another justification, saying, \\"But if we have to use force, it is because we are America; we are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future, and we see the danger here to all of us.\\"Interview on NBC-TV, (Transcript, February 19, 1998, USIS Washington File, ). =2003 Iraq War= According to Politifact, Albright opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although after the U.S. was committed to the war, she said she would support the President.In foreign policy spat, Bernie Sanders suggests Madeleine Albright supported Iraq invasion, By Linda Qiu on Sunday, February 7, 2016. \\"Mostly false.\\" =Art ownership lawsuit= Following the Washington Post's profile of Albright by Michael Dobbs, an Austrian man named Philipp Harmer launched legal action against Albright, claiming her father had illegally taken possession of artwork that belonged to his great-grandfather, Karl Nebrich. Nebrich, a German-speaking Prague industrialist, was forced to abandon some of his possessions when ethnic Germans were expelled from the country after World War II under the Bene≈° decrees. His apartment, at 11 Hradƒçansk√° Street in Prague, was subsequently given to Korbel and his family, which they occupied before also being forced to flee to America. Harmer felt Korbel stole his great- grandfather's artwork, which was left in the apartment. The matter was handled by Albright's brother, John Korbel. =Allegations of hate speech against Serbs= The place where the Prague incident took place. In late October 2012, during a book signing in the Prague bookstore Pal√°c Knih Luxor, Albright was visited by a group of activists from the Czech organization \\"P≈ô√°tel√© Srb≈Ø na Kosovu\\". She was filmed saying, \\"Disgusting Serbs, get out!\\" to the Czech group, which had brought war photos to the signing, some of which showed Serbian victims of the Kosovo War in 1999. The protesters were expelled from the event when police arrived. Two videos of the incident were later posted by the group on their YouTube channel. Filmmaker Emir Kusturica expressed thanks to Czech director V√°clav Dvo≈ô√°k for organizing and participating in the demonstration. Together with other protesters, Dvo≈ô√°k also reported Albright to the police, stating that she was spreading ethnic hatred and disrespect to the victims of the war. Albright's involvement in the NATO bombing of Serbia was the main cause of the demonstration ‚Äì a sensitive topic which became even more controversial when it was revealed that her investment firm, Albright Capital Management, was preparing to bid in the proposed privatization of Kosovo's state-owned telecom and postal company, Post and Telecom of Kosovo. In an article published by the New York-based magazine Bloomberg Businessweek, it was estimated that the deal could be as large as ‚Ç¨600 million. Serbia opposed the sale, and intended to file a lawsuit to block it, alleging that the rights of former Serbian employees were not respected. = Clinton campaign comment = Albright supported Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. While introducing Clinton at a campaign event in New Hampshire ahead of that state's primary, Albright said, \\"There's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other\\" (a phrase Albright had used on several previous occasions in other contexts). The remark was seen as a rebuke of younger women who supported Clinton's primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, which many women found \\"startling and offensive.\\"Alan Rappeport, Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Rebuke Young Women Backing Bernie Sanders, New York Times (February 8, 2016). In a New York Times op-ed published several days after the remark, Albright said: \\"I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line. I did not mean to argue that women should support a particular candidate based solely on gender.\\" Honorary degrees and awards Medlin Olbrajt Square in Prishtin√´, Kosovo named in honor of Madeleine Albright Albright holds honorary degrees from Brandeis University (1996), the University of Washington (2002), Smith College (2003), Washington University in St. Louis (2003), University of Winnipeg (2005), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2007), Knox College (2008), Dickinson College (2014), and Tufts University (2015).

The couple had three daughters before divorcing in 1982. Korbel was raised Roman Catholic, but converted to the Episcopal Church at the time of her marriage in 1959. Her parents had converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1941, during her early childhood, while still in Czechoslovakia, in an effort to avoid anti-Jewish persecution before they immigrated to the US. They never discussed their Jewish ancestry with her later. When The Washington Post reported on Albright's Jewish heritage shortly after she had become Secretary of State in 1997, Albright said that the report was a \\"major surprise\\". Albright has said that she did not learn until age 59 that both her parents were born and raised in Jewish families. As many as a dozen of her relatives in Czechoslovakia‚Äîincluding three of her grandparents‚Äîhad been murdered in the Holocaust. Albright has mentioned her physical fitness and exercise regimen in several interviews. In 2006, she said she was capable of leg pressing .

He was elected five times as a Republican to the United States Senate from North Carolina, serving from 1973 until 2003. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1995 to 2001 he had a major voice in foreign policy. Helms helped organize and fund the conservative resurgence in the 1970s, focusing on Ronald Reagan's quest for the White House as well as helping many local and regional candidates. Helms was the longest-serving popularly elected Senator in North Carolina's history. He was widely credited with shifting the one-party state into a competitive two-party state. He advocated the movement of conservatives from the Democratic Party ‚Äì which they deemed too liberal ‚Äì to the Republican Party. The Helms-controlled National Congressional Club's state-of-the-art direct mail operation raised millions of dollars for Helms and other conservative candidates, allowing Helms to outspend his opponents in most of his campaigns.William A. Link, Righteous Warrior: Jesse Helms and the Rise of Modern Conservatism (2008) p. 557 Helms was the most stridently conservative politician of the post-1960s era,Bruce Frohnen, American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia (2006) p. 379 especially in opposition to federal intervention into what he considered state affairs (including legislating integration via the Civil Rights Act and enforcing suffrage through the Voting Rights Act). As long-time chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he demanded a staunchly anti-communist foreign policy that would reward America's friends abroad, and punish its enemies. His relations with the State Department were often acrimonious, and he blocked numerous presidential appointees. In domestic affairs, Helms promoted industrial development in the South, seeking low taxes and few labor unions so as to attract Northern and international corporations to relocate to North Carolina. On social issues, Helms was conservative. He was a master obstructionist who relished his nickname, \\"Senator No\\".Congressional Quarterly, Politics in America 1992: The 102 Congress (1991) p 927 He combined cultural, social and economic conservatism, which often helped his legislation win wide public support. He fought what he considered to be liberalism by opposing civil rights, disability rights, feminism, gay rights, affirmative action, access to abortions, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), and the National Endowment for the Arts.Link (2008) Helms brought an \\"aggressiveness\\" to his conservatism, as in his rhetoric against homosexuality.Link (2008) pp 39, 50, 196, 284, 373 The Almanac of American Politics once wrote that \\"no American politician is more controversial, beloved in some quarters and hated in others, than Jesse Helms\\". Childhood and education (1921‚Äì1940) Advice from Jesse A. Helms, Sr., to his son; Jesse Helms Center in Wingate, North Carolina Helms was born in 1921 in Monroe, North Carolina, where his father, nicknamed \\"Big Jesse\\", served as both fire chief and chief of police; his mother, Ethel Mae Helms, was a homemaker. Helms was of English ancestry on both sides.Link (2008) ch 1 Helms described Monroe as a community surrounded by farmland and with a population of about three thousand where \\"you knew just about everybody and just about everybody knew you.\\" The Helms family was poor during the Great Depression, resulting in each of the children working from an early age. Helms acquired his first job sweeping floors at The Monroe Enquirer at age 9. The family attended services each Sunday at First Baptist, Helms later saying he would never forget being served chickens raised in the family's backyard by his mother, following their weekly services. He recalled initially being bothered by their chickens becoming their food, but abandoned this view to allow himself to concentrate on his mother's cooking. Helms recalled that his family rarely spoke about politics, reasoning that the political climate did not call for discussions as most of the people the family were acquainted with were members of the Democratic Party. Link described Helms's father as having a domineering influence on the child's development, describing the pair as being similar in having the traits of being extrovert, effusive, and enjoying the company of others while both favored constancy, loyalty, and respect for order.Link, p. 23. The elder Helms asserted to Jesse that ambition was good and accomplishments and achievements would come his way through following a strict work ethic.Link, p. 20. Years later, Helms retained fond memories of his father's involvement with his youth: \\"I shall forever have wonderful memories of a caring, loving father who took the time to listen and to explain things to his wide-eyed son.\\" Helms briefly attended Wingate Junior College, now Wingate University, near Monroe, before leaving for Wake Forest College. He left Wingate after a year to begin a career as a journalist, working for the next eleven years as a newspaper and radio reporter, first as a sportswriter and news reporter for Raleigh's The News & Observer, and also as assistant city editor for The Raleigh Times. Helms retained a positive view of Wingate into his later years, saying the school was filled with individuals that treated him with kindness and that he had made it an objective to repay the institution for what it had done for him. While attending Wake Forest, Helms left work early and ran a few blocks to catch a train every morning to ensure he was on time to his classes. Helms stated that his goal in attending was never to get a diploma but instead form the skills needed for forms of employment he was seeking at a time when he aspired to become a journalist. Marriage and family Helms met Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Coble, editor of the society page at The News & Observer, and they married in 1942. Helms's first interest in politics came from conversations with his conservative father-in-law. In 1945, his and Dot's first child Jane was born. Early career (1940‚Äì1972) Helms's first full-time job after college was as a sports reporter with The Raleigh Times. During World War II, Helms served stateside as a recruiter in the United States Navy. After the war, he pursued his twin interests of journalism and Democratic Party politics. Helms became the city news editor of The Raleigh Times. He later became a radio and television newscaster and commentator for WRAL-TV, where he hired Armistead Maupin as a reporter. Entry into politics U.S. Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia told Helms in 1952 that he hoped Helms would one day become a senator; Helms achieved this 20 years later, but Russell did not live to see it. In 1950, Helms played a critical role as campaign publicity director for Willis Smith in the U.S. Senate campaign against a prominent liberal, Frank Porter Graham. Smith (a conservative Democratic lawyer and former president of the American Bar Association) portrayed Graham, who supported school desegregation, as a \\"dupe of communists\\" and a proponent of the \\"mingling of the races\\". Smith's fliers said, \\"Wake Up, White People\\", in the campaign for the virtually all- white primaries. Blacks were still mostly disfranchised in the state, because its 1900 constitutional amendment had been passed by white Democrats with restrictive voter registration and electoral provisions that effectively and severely reduced their role in electoral politics. Smith won and hired Helms as his administrative assistant in Washington. In 1952, Helms worked on the presidential campaign of Georgia Senator Richard Russell, Jr. After Russell dropped out of the presidential race, Helms returned to working for Smith. When Smith died in 1953, Helms returned to Raleigh. From 1953 to 1960, Helms was executive director of the North Carolina Bankers Association. He and his wife set up their home on Caswell Street in the Hayes Barton Historic District, where he lived the rest of his life. In 1957, Helms as a Democrat won his first election for a Raleigh City Council seat. He served two terms and earned a reputation as a conservative gadfly who \\"fought against everything from putting a median strip on Downtown Boulevard to an urban renewal project\\". Helms disliked his tenure on the council, feeling all the other members acted as a private club and that Mayor William G. Enloe was a \\"steamroller\\". In 1960, Helms worked on the unsuccessful primary gubernatorial campaign of I. Beverly Lake, Sr., who ran on a platform of racial segregation. Lake lost to Terry Sanford, who ran as a racial moderate willing to implement the federal policy of school integration. Helms felt forced busing and forced racial integration caused animosity on both sides and \\"proved to be unwise\\". Capitol Broadcasting Company In 1960, Helms joined the Raleigh-based Capitol Broadcasting Company (CBC) as the executive vice-president, vice chairman of the board, and assistant chief executive officer. His daily CBC editorials on WRAL-TV, given at the end of each night's local news broadcast in Raleigh, made Helms famous as a conservative commentator throughout eastern North Carolina. Helms's editorials featured folksy anecdotes interwoven with conservative views against \\"the civil rights movement, the liberal news media, and anti-war churches,\\" among many targets. He referred to The News and Observer, his former employer, as the \\"Nuisance and Disturber\\" for its promotion of liberal views and support for African-American civil rights activities. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which had a reputation for liberalism, was also a frequent target of Helms's criticism. He is said to have referred to the university as \\"The University of Negroes and Communists\\" despite a lack of evidence, and suggested a wall be erected around the campus to prevent the university's liberal views from \\"infecting\\" the rest of the state. Helms said the civil rights movement was infested by Communists and \\"moral degenerates.\\" He described the federal program of Medicaid as a \\"step over into the swampy field of socialized medicine\\". Commenting on the 1963 protests and March on Washington during the Civil Rights Movement, Helms stated, \\"The negro cannot count forever on the kind of restraint that's thus far left him free to clog the streets, disrupt traffic, and interfere with other men's rights.\\" He later wrote, \\"Crime rates and irresponsibility among Negroes are facts of life which must be faced.\\" He was at Capitol Broadcasting Company until he filed for the Senate race in 1972. Senate campaign of 1972 Helms announced his candidacy for a seat in the United States Senate in 1972. His Republican primary campaign was managed by Thomas F. Ellis, who would later be instrumental in Ronald Reagan's 1976 campaign and also become the chair of the National Congressional Club. Helms took the Republican primary, winning 92,496 votes, or 60.1%, in a three-candidate field. Meanwhile, Democrats retired the ailing Senator B. Everett Jordan, who lost his primary to Congressman Nick Galifianakis. The latter represented the \\"new politics\\" of voters who included the young, African Americans voting since federal legislation removed discriminatory restrictions, and anti- establishment activists, who were based in and around the urban Research Triangle and Piedmont Triad. Although Galifianakis was a \\"liberal\\" by North Carolina standards, he opposed busing to achieve integration in schools. Polls put Galifianakis well ahead until late in the campaign, but Helms, facing all but certain defeat, hired a professional campaign manager, F. Clifton White, giving him dictatorial control over campaign strategy. While Galifianakis avoided mention of his party's presidential candidate, the liberal George McGovern, Helms employed the slogans \\"McGovernGalifianakis ‚Äì one and the same\\", \\"Vote for Jesse. Nixon Needs Him\\" and \\"Jesse: He's One of Us\\", an implicit play suggesting his opponent's Greek heritage made him somehow less \\"American.\\" Helms won the support of numerous Democrats, especially in the conservative eastern part of the state. Galifianakis tried to woo Republicans by noting that Helms had earlier criticized Nixon as being too left-wing. In a taste of things to come, money poured into the race. Helms spent a record $654,000, much of it going toward carefully crafted television commercials portraying him as a soft-spoken mainstream conservative. In the final six weeks of the campaign, Helms outspent Galifianakis three-to-one. Though the year was marked by Democratic gains in the Senate, Helms won 54 percent of the vote to Galifianakis's 46 percent. He was elected as the first Republican senator from the state since 1903, before senators were directly elected, and when the Republican Party stood for a different tradition. Helms was helped by Richard Nixon's gigantic landslide victory in that year's presidential election; Nixon carried North Carolina by 40 points. First Senate term (1973‚Äì79)=Entering the Senate Helms quickly became a \\"star\\" of the conservative movement, and was particularly vociferous on the issue of abortion. In 1974, in the wake of the US Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, Helms introduced a constitutional amendment that would have prohibited abortion in all circumstances, by conferring due process rights upon every fetus. However, the Senate hearing into the proposed amendments heard that neither Helms', nor James L. Buckley's similar amendment, would achieve their stated goal, and shelved them for the session. Both Helms and Buckley proposed amendments again in 1975, with Helms's amendment allowing states leeway in their implementation of an enshrined constitutional \\"right to life\\" from the \\"moment of fertilization\\". Helms was also prominent advocate of free enterprise and favored cutting the budget. He was a strong advocate of a global return to the gold standard, which he would push at numerous points throughout his Senate career; in October 1977, Helms proposed a successful amendment that allowed United States citizens to sign contracts linked to gold, overturning a 44-year ban on gold-indexed contracts, reflecting fears of inflation. Helms supported the tobacco industry, which contributed more than 6% of the state's GSP until the 1990s (the highest in the country); he argued that federal price support programs should be maintained, as they did not constitute a subsidy but insurance. Helms offered an amendment that would have denied food stamps to strikers when the Senate approved increasing federal contributions to food stamp and school lunch programs in May 1974. In 1973, the United States Congress passed the Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. It states that, \\"no foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.\\" In January 1973, along with Democrats James Abourezk and Floyd Haskell, Helms was one of three senators to vote against the confirmation of Peter J. Brennan as United States Secretary of Labor. In May 1974, when the Senate approved the establishment of no‚Äêfault automobile insurance plans in every state, it rejected an amendment by Helms exempting states that were opposed to no‚Äêfault insurance. Foreign policy From the start, Helms identified as a prominent anti-communist. He proposed an act in 1974 that authorized the President to grant honorary citizenship to Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. He remained close to Solzhenitsyn's cause, and linked his fight to that of freedom throughout the world. In 1975, as North Vietnamese forces approached Saigon, Helms was foremost among those urging the US to evacuate all Vietnamese demanding this, which he believed could be \\"two million or more within seven days\\". When the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to suppress a report critical of the US's strategic position in the arms race, Helms read the entire report out, requiring it to be published in full in the Congressional Record. Helms was not at first a strong supporter of Israel; for instance, in 1973 he proposed a resolution demanding Israel return the West Bank to Jordan, and, in 1975, demanding that the Palestinian Arabs receive a \\"just settlement of their grievances\\".Link (2007), p. 318 In 1977, Helms was the sole senator to vote against prohibiting American companies from joining the Arab League boycott of Israel, but that was primarily because the bill also relaxed discrimination against Communist countries. In 1982, Helms called for the US to break diplomatic relations with Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War. He favored prohibiting foreign aid to countries that had recently detonated nuclear weapons: this was aimed squarely at India, but it also affected Israel should it conduct a nuclear test. He worked to support the supply of arms to the United States' Arab allies under presidents Carter and Reagan, until his views on Israel shifted significantly in 1984. Helms and Bob Dole offered an amendment in 1973 that would have delayed cutting off funding for bombing in Cambodia if the President informed Congress that North Vietnam was not making an accounting \\"to the best of its ability\\" of US servicemen missing in Southeast Asia. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 56 to 25.  Nixon resignation  Helms delivered a Senate speech blaming liberal media for distorting Watergate and questioned if President Nixon had a constitutional right to be considered innocent until proven guilty following the April 1973 revelation of details relating to the scandal and Nixon administration aides resigning. He advocated against illegal activities being condoned with concurrent \\"half-truth and allegations\\" being reported by the media. Helms had four separate meetings with President Nixon in April and May 1973 where he attempted to cheer up the president and called for the White House to challenge its critics even as fellow Republicans from North Carolina criticized Nixon. Helms opposed the creation of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices in the summer of 1973, even as it was chaired by fellow North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin, arguing that it was a ploy by Democrats to discredit and oust Nixon.Link (2008), pp. 137‚Äì138 In August 1974, Newsweek published a list by the White House including Helms as one of thirty- six senators that the administration believed would support President Nixon in the event of his impeachment and being brought to trial by the Senate. The article stated that some supporters were not fully convinced and this would further peril the administration as 34 needed to prevent conviction. Nixon resigned days later and kept contact with Helms during his post-presidency, calling Helms to either chat or offer advice. 1976 presidential election Helms supported Ronald Reagan for the presidential nomination in 1976, even before Reagan had announced his candidacy.Shirley (2005), p. 23 His contribution was crucial in the North Carolina primary victory that paved the way for Reagan's presidential election in 1980. The support of Helms, alongside Raleigh-based campaign operative Thomas F. Ellis, was instrumental in Reagan's winning the North Carolina primary and later presenting a major challenge to incumbent President Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention. According to author Craig Shirley, the two men deserve credit \\"for breathing life into the dying Reagan campaign\\".Shirley (2005), p. 160 Going into the primary, Reagan had lost all the primaries, including in New Hampshire, where he had been favored, and was two million dollars in debt, with a growing number of Republican leaders calling for his exit.Shirley (2005), p. 176 The Ford campaign was predicting a victory in North Carolina, but assessed Reagan's strength in the state simply: Helms's support.Shirley (2005), p. 61 While Ford had the backing of Governor James Holshouser, the grassroots movement formed in North Carolina by Ellis and backed by Helms delivered an upset victory by 53% to 47%.Shirley (2005), p. 175 The momentum generated in North Carolina carried Ronald Reagan to landslide primary wins in Texas, California, and other critical states, evening the contest between Reagan and Ford, and forcing undeclared delegates to choose at the 1976 convention. Later, Helms was not pleased by the announcement that Reagan, if nominated, would ask the 1976 Republican National Convention to make moderate Pennsylvania Senator Richard Schweiker his running mate for the general election, but kept his objections to himself at the time.Shirley (2005), p. 275 According to Helms, after Reagan told him of the decision, Helms noted the hour because, \\"I wanted to record for posterity the exact time I received the shock of my life.\\" Helms and Strom Thurmond tried to make Reagan drop Schweiker for a conservative, perhaps either James Buckley or his brother William F. Buckley, Jr., and rumors surfaced that Helms might run for Vice President himself,Shirley (2005), p. 311 but Schweiker was kept. In the end, Reagan lost narrowly to Ford at the Convention, while Helms received only token support for the Vice Presidential nomination, albeit enough to place him second, far behind Ford's choice of Bob Dole. The Convention adopted a broadly conservative platform, and the conservative faction came out acting like the winners; except Jesse Helms. Helms vowed to campaign actively for Ford across the South, regarding the conservative platform adopted at the Convention to be a \\"mandate\\" on which Ford was pledging to run. However, he targeted Henry Kissinger after the latter issued a statement calling Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn a \\"threat to world peace,\\" and Helms demanded that Kissinger embrace the platform or resign immediately. Helms continued to back Reagan, and the two remained close friends and political allies throughout Reagan's political career, although sometimes critical of each other. Despite Reagan's defeat at the convention, the intervention of Helms and Ellis arguably led to the most important conservative primary victory in the history of the Republican Party. This victory enabled Reagan to contest the 1976 Republican Presidential nomination, and to win the next nomination at the 1980 Republican National Convention and ultimately the presidency of the United States. According to Craig Shirley, > Had Reagan lost North Carolina, despite his public pronouncements, his > revolutionary challenge to Ford, along with his political career, would have > ended unceremoniously. He would have made a gracious exit speech, cut a deal > with the Ford forces to eliminate his campaign debt, made a minor speech at > the Kansas City Convention later that year, and returned to his ranch in > Santa Barbara. He would probably have only reemerged to make speeches and > cut radio commercials to supplement his income. And Reagan would have faded > into political oblivion. Torrijos‚ÄìCarter treaties Helms was a long-time opponent of transferring possession of the Panama Canal to Panama, calling its construction an \\"historic American achievement.\\"Link (2008), p. 188 He warned that it would fall into the hands of Omar Torrijos's \\"communist friends\\". The issue of transfer of the canal was debated in the 1976 presidential race, wherein then- President Ford suspended negotiations over the transfer of sovereignty to assuage conservative opposition. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter reopened negotiations, appointing Sol Linowitz as co-negotiator without Senate confirmation, and Helms and Strom Thurmond led the opposition to the transfer. Helms claimed that Linowitz's involvement with Marine Midland constituted a conflict of interests, arguing that it constituted a bailout of American banking interests. He filed two federal suits, demanding prior congressional approval of any treaty and then consent by both houses of Congress. Helms also rallied Reagan, telling him that negotiation over Panama would be a \\"second Schweiker\\" as far as his conservative base was concerned. When Carter announced, on August 10, 1977, the conclusion of the treaties, Helms declared it a constitutional crisis, cited the need for the support of United States' allies in Latin America, accused the U.S. of submitting to Panamanian blackmail, and complained that the decision threatened national security in the event of war in Europe. Helms threatened to obstruct Senate business, proposing 200 amendments to the revision of the United States criminal code, knowing that most Americans opposed the treaties and would punish congressmen who voted for them if the ratification vote came in the run-up to the election. Helms announced the results of an opinion poll showing 78% public opposition. However, Helms's and Thurmond's leadership of the opposition made it politically easier for Carter, causing them to be replaced by the soft- spoken Paul Laxalt. 1978 re-election campaign Helms began campaigning for re-election in February 1977, giving himself 15 months by the time of the primaries. While he faced no primary opponent, the Democrats nominated Commissioner of Insurance John Ingram, who came from behind in the first round of the primary to win in the run-off. Ingram was known as an eccentric populist and used low-budget campaigning, just as he had in winning the primary. He campaigned almost exclusively on the issue of insurance rates and against \\"fat cats and special interests\\", in which he included Helms. Helms was one of three senators given a 100% rating by the conservative Americans for Constitutional Action for 1977, and was ranked fourth-most conservative by others. The Democratic National Committee targeted Helms, as did President Carter, who visited North Carolina twice on Ingram's behalf. In June 1978, along with Strom Thurmond, Helms was one of two senators named by an environmental group as part of a congressional \\"Dirty Dozen\\" that the group believed should be defeated in their re-election efforts due to their stances on environmental issues; membership on the list was based \\"primarily on 14 Senate and 19 House votes, including amendments to air and water pollution control laws, strip‚Äêmining controls, auto emissions and water projects.\\" Over the long campaign, Helms raised $7.5 million, more than twice as much as the second most-expensive nationwide (John Tower's in Texas), thanks to Richard Viguerie's and Alex Castellanos's pioneering direct mail strategies.Link (2007), p. 193‚Äì4 It was estimated that at least $3 million of Helms's contributions were spent on fund-raising. Helms easily outspent Ingram several times over, as the latter spent $150,000.Link (2007), p. 196 Due to a punctured lumbar disc, Helms was forced to suspend campaigning for six weeks in September and October.Link (2007), p. 199 In a low-turnout election, Helms received 619,151 votes (54.5 percent) to Ingram's 516,663 (45.5 percent). Celebrating his victory, Helms told his supporters that it was a \\"victory for the conservative and the free enterprise cause throughout America\\", adding, \\"I'm Senator No and I'm glad to be here!\\" Second Senate term (1979‚Äì1985)=New Senate term On January 3, 1979, the first day of the new Congress, Helms introduced a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion, on which he led the conservative Senators. Senator Helms was one of several Republican senators who in 1981 called into the White House to express his discontent over the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the US Supreme Court; their opposition hinged over the issue of O'Connor's presumed unwillingness to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling.Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court. 2007. Penguin Books. Page 222. Helms was also the Senate conservatives' leader on school prayer. An amendment proposed by Helms allowing voluntary prayer was passed by the Senate, but died in the House committee. To that act, Helms also proposed an amendment banning sex education without written parental consent. In 1979, Helms and Democrat Patrick Leahy supported a federal Taxpayer Bill of Rights. He joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, being one of four men critical of Carter who were new to the committee. Leader of the pro-Taiwan congressional lobby, Helms demanded that the People's Republic of China reject the use of force against the Republic of China, but, much to his shock, the Carter administration did not ask them to rule it out. Helms also criticized the government over Zimbabwe Rhodesia, leading support for the Internal Settlement government under Abel Muzorewa, and campaigned along with Samuel Hayakawa for the immediate lifting of sanctions on Muzorewa's government. Helms complained that it was inconsistent to lift sanctions on Uganda immediately after Idi Amin's departure, but not Zimbabwe Rhodesia after Ian Smith's. Helms hosted Muzorewa when he visited Washington and met with Carter in July 1979. He sent two aides to the Lancaster House Conference because he did not \\"trust the State Department on this issue\\", thereby provoking British diplomatic complaints. His aide John Carbaugh was accused of encouraging Smith to \\"hang on\\" and take a harder line, implying that there was enough support in the US Senate to lift sanctions without a settlement. Helms introduced legislation that demanded immediate lifting of the sanctions; as negotiations progressed, Helms complied more with the administration's line, although Senator Ted Kennedy accused Carter of conceding the construction of a new aircraft carrier in return for Helms's acquiescence on Zimbabwe Rhodesia, which both parties denied. Helms's support for lifting sanctions on Zimbabwe Rhodesia may have been grounded in North Carolina's tobacco traders, who would have been the main group benefiting from unilaterally lifting sanctions on tobacco-exporting Zimbabwe Rhodesia. 1980 presidential election In 1979, Helms was touted as a potential contender for the Republican nomination for the 1980 presidential election, but had poor voter recognition, and he lagged far behind the front-runners. He was the only candidate to file for the New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary. Going into 1980, he was suggested as a potential running mate for Reagan, and said he'd accept if he could \\"be his own man.\\" He was one of three conservative candidates running for the nomination. However, his ideological agreement with Reagan risked losing moderates' votes, particularly due to the independent candidacy of Rep. John B. Anderson, and the Reagan camp was split: eventually designating George H. W. Bush as his preferred candidate. At the convention, Helms toyed with the idea of running for Vice-President despite Reagan's choice, but let it go in exchange for Bush's endorsing the party platform and allowing Helms to address the convention. As expected, Helms was drafted by conservatives anyway, and won 54 votes, coming second. Helms was the \\"spiritual leader of the conservative convention\\", and led the movement that successfully reversed the Republican Party's 36-year platform support for an Equal Rights Amendment. In the fall of 1980, Helms proposed another bill denying the Supreme Court jurisdiction over school prayer, but this found little support in committee. It was strongly opposed by mainline Protestant churches, and its counterpart was defeated in the House. Senators Helms and James A. McClure blocked Ted Kennedy's comprehensive criminal code that did not relax federal firearms restrictions, inserted capital punishment procedures, and reinstated current statutory law on pornography, prostitution, and drug possession. Following from his success at reintroducing gold-indexed contracts in 1977, in October 1980, Helms proposed a return to the gold standard, and successfully passed an amendment setting up a commission to look into gold-backed currency. After the presidential election, Helms and Strom Thurmond sponsored a Senate amendment to a Department of Justice appropriations bill denying the department the power to participate in busing, due to objections over federal involvement, but, although passed by Congress, was vetoed by a lame duck Carter. Helms pledged to introduce an even stronger anti-busing bill as soon as Reagan took office. Republicans take the Senate In the 1980 Senate election, the Republicans unexpectedly won a majority, their first in twenty-six years, including John Porter East, a social conservative and a Helms prot√©g√© soon dubbed \\"Helms on Wheels\\", winning the other North Carolina seat. Howard Baker was set to become Majority Leader, but conservatives, angered by Baker's support for the Panama treaty, SALT II, and the Equal Rights Amendment, had sought to replace him with Helms until Reagan gave Baker his backing. Although, it was thought they'd put Helms in charge of the Foreign Relations Committee instead of the liberal Charles H. Percy, he instead became chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee in the new Congress. The first six months of 1981 were consumed by numerous Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearings, which were held up by Helms, who believed many of the appointees too liberal or too tainted by association with Kissinger, and not dedicated enough to his definition of the \\"Reagan program\\": support for South Africa, Taiwan, and Latin American right-wing regimes (as opposed to Black Africa and \\"Red\\" China), and active defense of human rights. These nominations included Alexander Haig, Chester Crocker, John J. Louis, Jr., and Lawrence Eagleburger, all of whom were confirmed regardless, whilst all of Helms's candidates were rejected. Helms also, unsuccessfully, opposed the nominations of Caspar Weinberger, Donald Regan, and Frank Carlucci. However, he did score a notable coup two years later when he led a small group of conservatives to block the nomination of Robert T. Grey for nine months, and thus causing the firing of Eugene V. Rostow. Food stamp program An opponent of the Food Stamp Program, Helms had already voted to reduce its scope, and was determined to follow this through as Agriculture Committee chairman. At one point, he proposed a 40% cut in their funding. Instead, Helms supported the replacement of food stamps with workfare. He then proposed that food stamp benefits be dropped by $11.50 per month per child for each youngster enrolled in the school lunch program. He maintained that \\"free lunches\\" duplicate food stamps. The outcry against his proposal was so strong that he was compelled to back down. Helms also challenged fraud in the food stamp program. He said that the public had \\"grown legitimately resentful about the abuses which they themselves have observed\\".Ernest B. Furgurson, Hard Right: The Rise of Jesse Helms (New York: W.W. Norton, 1986), pp. 152‚Äì153 As a freshman lawmaker in 1973, Helms tried to reverse the 1968 congressional vote which had permitted workers on strike to qualify for food stamps. Though he failed to gain reversal, his position drew the support of future Minority and Majority Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee and twelve Senate Democrats. Helms's position was upheld in 1988, when the United States Supreme Court decreed 5‚Äì3 that a law denying food stamps to strikers was constitutional unless the worker otherwise qualified for food stamps before going on strike. Justice Byron White said that the government must maintain neutrality in labor dispute and not subsidize strikers.The New York Times, March 24, 1988, p.1; Washington Post, March 24, 1988, p. A16 As the Agriculture Committee chairman, Helms proposed repeal of the 1977 amendment which had deleted the purchase requirement for food stamps. With that position he ran afoul of fellow Republican Bob Dole, who claimed that the purchase requirement had contributed to fraud and administrative difficulties in the program. Helms cited a Congressional Budget Office report which showed that 75 percent of the increase in stamp usage had occurred since the purchase requirement was dropped. When Helms's ally, Steve Symms of Idaho, proposed to reinstitute the purchase requirement, the motion was defeated, 33‚Äì66.Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report, August 25, 1981, p. 726; June 13, 1981, p. 1033 The Helms bloc also failed to secure other limits to the program, including a motion to delete alcohol and drug residential treatment patients from benefits. House and Senate conferees dropped a Helms-backed provision requiring families disqualified from the program to repay double the amount of any benefits received improperly. House Democratic Whip Tom Foley of Washington insisted that such a penalty would violate the Fifth Amendment rights to due process. Instead families repay the actual amount of improperly obtained benefits.Billy Hathorn, \\"The Iron Triangle in Action: The Federal Food Stamp Program\\", National Social Science Journal, Vol 12, No. 2 (1999), p. 54 Economic policies Helms supported the gold standard through his role as the Agriculture Committee chairman, which exercises wide powers over commodity markets. During the budget crisis of 1981, Helms restored $200 million for school lunches by instead cutting foreign aid, and against increases in grain and milk price support, despite the importance of the dairy industry to North Carolina. He warned repeatedly against costly farm subsidies as chairman. However, in 1983, he used his position to lobby to use the country's strategic dairy and wheat stocks to subsidize food exports as part of a trade war with the European Union. Helms heavily opposed cutting food aid to Poland after martial law was declared, and called for the end of grain exports to (and arms limitation talks with) the Soviet Union instead. In 1982, Helms authored a bill to introduce a federal flat tax of 10% with a personal allowance of $2,000. He voted against the 1983 budget: the only conservative Senator to have done so, and was a leading voice for a balanced budget amendment. With Charlie Rose, he proposed a bill that would limit tobacco price supports, but would allow the transfer of subsidy credits from non-farmers to farmers. He co-sponsored the bi-partisan move in 1982 to extend drug patent duration. Helms continued to pose obstacles to Reagan's budget plans. At the end of the 97th Congress, Helms led a filibuster against Reagan's increase of federal gasoline tax by 5-cents per gallon: mirroring his opposition to Governor Jim Hunt's 3-cent increase in the North Carolina gasoline tax, but alienating the White House from Helms. Social issues Although Helms recognized budget concerns and nominations as predominant, he rejected calls by Baker to move debate on social issues to 1982, with conservatives seeking to discuss abortion, school prayer, the minimum wage, and the \\"fair housing\\" policy. With the new Congress, Helms and Robert K. Dornan again proposed an amendment banning abortion in all circumstances, and also proposed a bill defining fetuses as human beings, thereby taking it out of the hands of the federal courts, along with Illinois Republican Henry Hyde and Kentucky Democrat Romano Mazzoli. More successfully, Helms passed an amendment banning federal funds from being used for abortion unless the woman's life is in danger. His support was key to the nomination of C. Everett Koop as Surgeon General, by proposing lifting the age limit that would otherwise have ruled out Koop. He proposed an amendment taking school prayer out of the remit of the Supreme Court, which was criticized for being unconstitutional; despite Reagan's endorsement, the bill was eventually rejected, after twenty months of dispute and numerous filibusters, in September 1982, by 51‚Äì48. Helms and Strom Thurmond sponsored another amendment to prevent the Department of Justice filing suits in defence of federal busing, which he contended wasted taxpayer money without improving education; this was filibustered by Lowell Weicker for eight months, but passed in March 1982. However, Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill blocked the measure from being considered by the House of Representatives. In 1981, Helms started secret negotiations to end an 11-year impasse and pave the way for desegregation of historically white and historically black colleges in North Carolina. In response to a rival anti-discrimination bill in 1982, he proposed a bill outlawing granting tax-free status to schools that discriminated racially, but allowing schools that discriminate on the grounds of religion to avoid taxes. When the Voting Rights Act came up for amendment in 1982, Helms and Thurmond criticized it for bias against the South, arguing that it made Carolinians \\"second-class citizens\\" by treating their states differently,Link (2007), p. 260 and proposed an amendment that extended its terms to the whole country, which they knew would bury it. However, it was extended anyway, despite Helms's filibuster, which he promised to lead \\"until the cows come home\\". In 1983, Helms hired Claude Allen, an African American, as his press secretary. Despite his publicly aired belief that he was one of the best-liked senators amongst black staff in Congress, it was pointed out that he did not have any African-American staff of his own, prompting the hiring of the twenty-two-year-old,Link (2007), p. 259 who had switched parties when he was press secretary to Bill Cobey in the previous year's campaign. In 1983, Helms led the 16-day filibuster in the Senate opposing the proposed establishment of Martin Luther King Day as a federal holiday. Helms and others claimed, \\"another federal holiday would be costly for the economy.\\" Although the Congressional Budget Office cited a cost of $18 million, Helms claimed it would cost $12 billion a year. Helms \\"distributed a 300-page packet claiming that the civil rights leader was a political radical who adopted \\"action- oriented Marxism\\" and detailing Dr. King's supposed treachery\\" in which he accused King of \\"appear[ing] to have welcomed collaboration with Communists,\\" Stanley Levison and Jack O'Dell. Helms ended the filibuster in exchange for a new tobacco bill. President Reagan signed the bill on October 19, 1983. Helms then demanded that FBI surveillance tapes allegedly detailing philandering on King's part be released, although Reagan and the courts refused. The conservatives attempted to rename the day \\"National Equality Day\\" or \\"National Civil Rights Day\\", but failed, and the bill was passed. Writing in The Washington Post several years later, David Broder attributed Helms opposition to the MLK holiday to racism on Helms's part.Race Matters ‚Äì Jesse Helms, WhiteRacist, by David Broder Latin America Upon the Republican takeover of the Senate, Helms became chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, promising to \\"review all our policies on Latin America\\", of which he had been severely critical under Carter. He immediately focused on escalating aid to the Salvadoran government in its civil war, and particularly preventing Nicaraguan and Cuban support for guerrillas in El Salvador. Within hours, the subcommittee approved military aid to El Salvador, and later led the push to cut aid to Nicaragua. Helms was assisted in pursuing the foreign policy realignment by John Carbaugh, whose influence the New York Times reported \\"[rivalled] many of [the Senate's] more visible elected members\\". In El Salvador, Helms had close ties with the right-wing Salvadoran Nationalist Republican Alliance and its leader and death squad founder Roberto D'Aubuisson. Helms opposed the appointment of Thomas R. Pickering as Ambassador to El Salvador.Link (2007), p. 248 Helms alleged that the CIA had interfered in the Salvadoran election March and May 1984, in favor of the incumbent centre-left Jos√© Napole√≥n Duarte instead of D'Aubuisson, claiming that Pickering had \\"used the cloak of diplomacy to strangle freedom in the night\\". A CIA operative testifying to the Senate Intelligence Committee was alleged by Helms to have admitted rigging the election, but senators that attended have stated that, whilst the CIA operative admitted involvement, they did not make such an admission. Helms disclosed details of CIA financial support for Duarte, earning a rebuke from Barry Goldwater, but Helms replied that his information came from sources in El Salvador, not the Senate committee.Link (2007), p. 249 In 1982, Helms was the only senator who opposed a Senate resolution endorsing a pro-British policy during the Falklands War, citing the Monroe Doctrine, although he did manage to weaken the resolution's language. Nonetheless, Helms was a supporter of the Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who supported the United Kingdom in the Falklands conflict. Helms was steadfastly opposed to the Castro regime in Cuba, and spent much of his time campaigning against the lifting of sanctions. In 1980, he opposed a treaty with Cuba on sea boundary delimitation unless it included withdrawal of the Soviet brigade stationed on the island. The following year, he proposed legislation establishing Radio Free Cuba, which would later become known as Radio Mart√≠. 1984 re-election campaign Halfway through Reagan's term, Helms was talked about as a prospective presidential candidate in 1984 in case Reagan chose to stand down after his first term. There was also speculation that Helms would run for the Governorship, being vacated by Jim Hunt. However, the President stood for re-election, and Helms ran once more for his Senate seat‚Äîfacing Governor Hunt‚Äîand becoming the top target amongst the incumbent Senate Republicans. Unlike in 1978, Helms faced an opponent in the primary, George Wimbish, but won with 90.6% of the vote, while Hunt received 77% in his. During the general election campaign, Hunt accused Helms of having the most \\"anti-Israel record of any member of the U.S. Senate\\". Helms pledged during the campaign that he would retain his chairmanship of the Agriculture committee. In the most expensive Senate campaign up to that time, Helms narrowly defeated Hunt, taking 1,156,768 (51.7%) to Hunt's 1,070,488 (47.8%). Third Senate term (1985‚Äì1991) In 1989, Helms hired James Meredith, most famous as the first African American ever admitted to the University of Mississippi, as a domestic policy adviser to his Senate office staff. Meredith noted that Helms was the only member of the Senate to respond to his offer. In 1989, Helms successfully lobbied for an amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act, legislation protecting disability rights that exempted pedophilia, schizophrenia, and kleptomania from the conditions against which discrimination was barred. Even though the Helms amendment was kept in the final ADA bill that passed Congress in 1990, Helms twice voted against the bill. Foreign policy Although Helms was returned to office, and became the senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, Richard Lugar of Indiana became its chair, after Helms and Lugar cut a deal to keep liberals out of top committee posts. Despite pressure to claim the Foreign Relations chair, Helms kept the Agriculture chair, as he had pledged in his campaign. A \\"purge\\" of the State Department by George P. Shultz in early 1985, replacing conservatives with moderates, was heavily opposed by the Helms-led conservatives. They unsuccessfully attempted to block the appointment of Rozanne L. Ridgway, Richard Burt, and Edwin G. Corr as ambassadors, arguing that Shultz was appointing diplomats that were not loyal to President Reagan's philosophy, particularly in Latin America. In August, Helms threatened to lead a filibuster against a bill imposing sanctions on South Africa, delaying it until after summer recess. In early 1986, Panamanian dissident Winston Spadafora visited Helms and requested that the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs hold hearings on Panama. Ignoring Elliott Abrams' request for a softer line towards Panama, Helms‚Äîa long-time critic of Noriega‚Äîagreed, and the hearings uncovered the large degree of leeway that the U.S. government, and particularly the Central Intelligence Agency, had been giving to Noriega.Kinzer (2006), p. 246‚Äì7 After the Drug Enforcement Administration encountered opposition from Oliver North in investigating Noriega's role in drug trafficking, Helms teamed up with John Kerry to introduce an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act demanding that the CIA investigate the Panama Defense Forces' potential involvement.Kinzer (2006), p. 247 In 1988, after Noriega was indicted on charges including drug trafficking, a former Panamanian consul general and chief of political intelligence testified to the subcommittee, detailing Panama's compiling of evidence on its political opponents in the United States, including Senators Helms and Ted Kennedy, with the assistance of the CIA and National Security Council. Helms proposed that the government suspend the Carter-Torrijos treaties unless Noriega were extradited within thirty days. In July 1986, after Rodrigo Rojas DeNegri was burned alive during a street demonstration against the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Helms stated that DeNegri and his companion Carmen Quintana Arancibia were \\"Communist terrorists\\" that had earlier been sighted setting fire to a barricade. Helms also criticized United States Ambassador to Chile Harry G. Barnes Jr. for attending DeNegri's funeral, saying Barnes \\"planted the American flag in the midst of a Communist activity\\" and President Reagan would have sent him home were he there. The following month, the Justice Department disclosed information to Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that linked Helms and a sensitive intelligence matter of the Chile government. Helms responded to the disclosure by telling reporters that the Justice Department \\"want to intimidate me and harass me, and it's not going to work\\" and said that both the Justice Department and himself were aware he had \\"violated no rules of classification.\\" In a letter to Attorney General Edwin Meese, Helms made a request of the Justice Department to investigate if he or members of his staff had been spied on during the Chile visit and called the charges against him \\"frivolous and false indictment.\\" Helms became interested in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, and in October 1990 his committee staff chief and longest-serving aide, James P. Lucier, prepared a report stating that it was probable there were live American prisoners still being held in Vietnam and that the George H. W. Bush administration was complicit in hiding the facts.Link (2008) pp. 397‚Äì398 The report also alleged that the Soviet Union had held American prisoners after the end of World War II and more may have been transferred there during the Korean War and during the Vietnam War. (Lucier also believed that survivors of the 1983 shoot-down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 were being held prisoner by the Soviets.) Helms stated that the \\"deeper story\\" was a possible \\"deliberate effort by certain people in the government to disregard all information or reports about living MIA-POWs\\". This was followed up in May 1991 by a minority report of the Foreign Relations Committee, released by Helms and titled An Examination of US Policy Toward POW/MIAs, which made similar claims and concluded that \\"any evidence that suggested an MIA might be alive was uniformly and arbitrarily rejected ...\\" The issuing of the report caused other Republicans on the committee to become angry, and charges were made that the report contained errors, innuendo, and unsubstantiated rumors. This and other personnel matters led to Helms firing Lucier and eight other staff members in January 1992.Link (2008) pp. 400‚Äì401 Helms subsequently distanced himself from the POW/MIA issue. (The aides claimed vindication later in 1992 when Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union had kept some U.S. prisoners in the early 1950s.) HIV legislation In 1987, Helms added an amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations Act, which directed the president to use executive authority to add HIV infection to the list of excludable diseases that prevent both travel and immigration to the United States. The action was opposed by the U.S. Public Health Service. Congress restored the executive authority to remove HIV from the list of excludable conditions in the 1990 Immigration Reform Act, and in January 1991, Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan announced he would delete HIV from the list of excludable conditions. A letter-writing campaign headed by Helms ultimately convinced President Bush not to lift the ban, and left the United States the only industrialized nation in the world to prohibit travel based on HIV status. The travel ban was also responsible for the cancellation of the 1992 International AIDS Conference in Boston. On January 5, 2010, the 22-year-old ban was lifted after having been signed by President Barack Obama on October 30, 2009. The New York Times stated that Helms was \\"bitterly opposed\\" to federal financing for research and treatment of AIDS, which he believed was God's punishment for homosexuals. Opposing the Kennedy-Hatch AIDS bill in 1988, Helms stated, \\"There is not one single case of AIDS in this country that cannot be traced in origin to sodomy\\".States News Service, 5/17/88 When Ryan White died in 1990, his mother went to Congress to speak to politicians on behalf of people with AIDS. She spoke to 23 representatives; Helms refused to speak to Jeanne White, even when she was alone with him in an elevator. Despite opposition by Helms, the Ryan White Care Act passed in 1990. In 1988, Helms convinced congress to implement a ban on federal funding for needle exchange programs, arguing that spending federal money on such programs was tantamount to \\"federal endorsement of drug abuse.\\" 1990 re-election campaignPrimary= Helms ran for re- election in a nationally publicized and rancorous campaign against the former mayor of Charlotte, Harvey Gantt, in his \\"bid to become the nation's only black Senator\\" and \\"the first black elected to the Senate from the South since Reconstruction\\". In the Republican primary, Helms had two opponents, George Wimbish (as in 1984) and another; Helms won with 84.3% of the vote. =Campaign= During the campaign the North Carolina GOP and others mailed over 125,000 notices (almost exclusively to black voters) telling them that they were not eligible to vote and warned that if they went to the polls they could be prosecuted for voter fraud.  February 27, 1992  Helms' Campaign Denies It Tried to Intimidate Black Voters  AP  At the behest of several civil rights groups and the Democratic National Party, the US Department of Justice sued the Helm's Campaign, the NC GOP, four lobbying firms and two individual lobbyists.  The Department of Justice makes case against 1990 Helms campaign and North Carolina GOP  washingtonpost.com ¬© 1996‚Äì2019 The Washington Post NOV. 2, 1990  THE 1990 CAMPAIGN; Democrats Accuse G.O.P. of Voter Intimidation in Two States  AP  Thomas Farr, Campaign Manager for Jesse Helms disavowed any knowledge of the dirty tricks, which was shown to be false when his hand written notes were discovered. The affected parties acknowledged and agreed to the Justice Departments' ruling and were forced to desist from any other such activities. In a close race, Helms also aired a late-running television commercial titled \\"Hands\\"Helms's 'Hands' anti- affirmative action campaign ad on YouTube, item KIyewCdXMzk that showed a white man's hands crumpling up a rejection notice from a company that gave the job to a \\"less qualified minority\\"; some critics claimed the ad utilized sub- textual racist themes. The advertisement was produced by Alex Castellanos, whom Helms would employ until his company was dropped in April 1996 after running an unusually hard-hitting ad. Another Helms television commercial accused Mr. Gantt of running a \\"secret campaign\\" in homosexual communities and of being committed to \\"mandatory gay rights laws\\" including \\"requiring local schools to hire gay teachers.\\" =Outcome= Helms won the election with 1,087,331 votes (52.5 percent) to Gantt's 981,573 (47.4 percent). In his victory statement, Helms noted the unhappiness of some media outlets over his victory, paraphrasing a line from Casey at the Bat: \\"There's no joy in Mudville tonight. The mighty ultra-liberal establishment, and the liberal politicians and editors and commentators and columnists have struck out.\\" Fourth Senate term (1991‚Äì1997) Senator Helms holding a watermelon and standing between Miss North Carolina and Miss Watermelon in 1991 In the early 1990s, Helms was a vocal opponent of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).Reno, Robert (September 14, 1993) A Nation of Ninnies, Baltimore Sun In August 1991, Helms became one of six Republicans on the Select Senate Committee on POW-MIA Affairs that would investigate the number of Americans still missing in the aftermath of the Vietnam War following renewed interest.  Keating Five investigation  On August 5, 1991, Helms made public a special counsel report calling for California Senator Alan Cranston to be censured by the Senate on charges of reprehensible conduct. The document was delivered to members of the Senate Ethics Committee the previous month, Helms stating that his move came from the belief that the release would cause the panel to act faster, additionally citing the panel members with being at odds on how much of the report should be released as a reason for not closing an inquiry into Charles H. Keating Jr.. The Senate Ethics Committee subsequently voted to investigate Helms for releasing the confidential document, Helms issuing a statement saying in part that it was \\"a fascinating suggestion that I may have somehow violated some unspecified 'rule' when I released, over the weekend, my own signed report regarding to Keating Five investigation.\\" Helms welcomed the investigation into himself, along with one into the handling of the Keating Five case by the Senate Ethics Committee, calling the panel's investigation \\"long, arduous and expensive\\" and noting a potential public investigation \\"may disclose that the committee labored and brought forth a mouse.\\"  National Endowment for the Arts  In 1989, the National Endowment for the Arts awarded grants for a retrospective of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs, some of which containing homosexual themes, in addition to a museum in Winston-Salem, North Carolina supporting an exhibition that featured an image by Andres Serrano of a crucifix suspended in urine. These images caused an uproar and marked the National Endowment for the Arts becoming \\"a favorite target for Mr. Helms and other conservative senators who have objected to the work of some of the artists who have received Government grants.\\" In September 1989, Helms met with John E. Frohnmayer, President Bush's appointee for Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. While both declined releasing details on the contents of the meeting, Helms was reported to have made it clear that he considered his opposition to the N.E.A. grants on certain imagery essential to his political capital and that the battle over what was considered appropriate for federal government funding had just begun. In September 1991, Helms charged the National Endowment for the Arts with financing art that would turn \\"the stomach of any normal person\\" while proposing an amendment to an appropriations bill forbidding the usage of the grants for the N.E.A. in promoting material that would be deemed as depicting \\"sexual or excretory activities or organs\\" in an \\"offensive way.\\" On September 20, the Senate voted 68 to 28 in favor of the amendment. The same night, Helms withdrew another amendment that changed the financing formula of the N.E.A. to funneling over half of its grant money through states as opposed to the Washington headquarters and would see a reduction in the New York fiscal year appropriation from its 26 million to just over 7 million. Remarks re Moseley Braun and Clinton In a widely publicized incident on July 22, 1993, Carol Moseley Braun, the first black woman in the Senate and the only black Senator at the time, reported that Helms deliberately sought to offend her by singing \\"Dixie\\" in her presence. After Moseley Braun persuaded the Senate to vote against Helms's amendment to extend the patent of the United Daughters of the Confederacy insignia, which included the Confederate flag, Mosely Braun claims that Helms ran into her in an elevator. Helms turned to Senator Orrin Hatch and said, \\"Watch me make her cry. I'm going to make her cry. I'm going to sing 'Dixie' until she cries.\\"Chicago Sun-Times, August 5, 1993 He then proceeded to sing the song about \\"the good life\\" during slavery to Moseley Braun. In 1999, Helms unsuccessfully attempted to block Moseley Braun's nomination to be United States Ambassador to New Zealand. In 1994, Helms created a sensation when he told broadcasters Rowland Evans and Robert Novak that Clinton was \\"not up\\" to the tasks of being commander-in-chief, and suggested two days later, on the anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination, \\"Mr. Clinton better watch out if he comes down here. He'd better have a bodyguard.\\" Helms said Clinton was unpopular and that he had not meant it as a threat. Clinton addressed the comments when asked about them by a reporter at a press conference the following day: \\"I think the remarks were unwise and inappropriate. The President oversees the foreign policy of the United States. And the Republicans will decide in whom they will repose their trust and confidence; that's a decision for them to make, not for me.\\" During this term, he was one of three Senators to vote against the confirmation of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court.https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=103&session;=1&vote;=00232 Republican majority Republicans regained control of Congress after the 1994 elections and Helms finally became the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was the first North Carolinian to chair the committee since Nathaniel Macon, a descendant of Martha Washington, in the first quarter of the 19th century. In that role, Helms pushed for reform of the UN and blocked payment of the United States' dues. Helms secured sufficient reforms that a colleague, future Vice President Joe Biden of Delaware said that \\"As only Nixon could go to China, only Helms could fix the U.N.\\"Poster at Jesse Helms Center, Wingate, North Carolina Helms passed few laws of his own in part because of this bridge-burning style. Hedrick Smith's The Power Game depicts several senators specifically blocking Helms's goals as a result of his intransigence, but nonetheless portrays Helms as a \\"devastatingly effective power broker\\". Helms vehemently opposed granting most favored nation status to China, citing human rights concerns. Helms tried to block the refunding of the Ryan White Care Act in 1995, saying that those with AIDS were responsible for the disease, because they had contracted it because of their \\"deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct\\", and that the reason AIDS existed in the first place was because it was \\"God's punishment for homosexuals\\". Helms also claimed that more federal dollars were spent on AIDS than heart disease or cancer, despite this not being borne out by the Public Health Service statistics. Helms‚ÄìBurton Act Soon after becoming the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in February 1995, Helms announced that he wished to strengthen the spirit of the 1992 Torricelli Act with new legislation.Roy (2000), p. 29 Its companion sponsored through the House by Dan Burton of Indiana, it would strengthen the embargo against Cuba: further codifying the embargo, instructing United States diplomats to vote in favor of sanctions on Cuba, stripping the President of the option of ending the embargo by executive order until Fidel and Ra√∫l Castro leave power and a prescribed course of transition is followed. The bill also, controversially explicitly overruling the Act of State Doctrine, allowed foreign companies to be sued in American courts if, in dealings with the regime of Fidel Castro, they acquired assets formerly owned by Americans. Passing the House comfortably, the Senate was far more cautious, under pressure from the Clinton administration. The debate was filibustered, with a motion of cloture falling four votes short. Helms reintroduced the bill without Titles III and IV, which detailed the penalties on investors, and it passed by 74 to 24 on October 19, 1995.Roy (2000), p. 30 A conference committee was scheduled to convene, but did not until February 28, 1996, by which time external events had taken over. On 24 February, Cuba shot down two small Brothers to the Rescue planes piloted by anti-Castro Cuban-Americans. When the conference committee met, the tougher House version, with all four titles, won out on most substantive points. It was passed by the Senate 74‚Äì22 and the House 336‚Äì86, and President Clinton signed the Helms- Burton Act into law on March 12, 1996.Roy (2000), p. 31 For years after its passing, Helms criticized the corporate interests that sought to lift the sanctions on Cuba, writing an article in 1999 for Foreign Affairs, at whose publisher, the Council on Foreign Relations, also drew Helms's ire for its softer approach to Cuba.Roy (2000), p. 192 1996 re-election campaign In 1996, Helms drew 1,345,833 (52.6 percent) to Gantt's 1,173,875 (45.9 percent). Helms supported his former Senate colleague Bob Dole for president, while Gantt endorsed Bill Clinton. Although Helms is generally credited with being the most successful Republican politician in North Carolina history, his largest proportion of the vote in any of his five elections was 54.5 percent. In North Carolina, Helms was a polarizing figure, and he freely admitted that many people in the state strongly disliked him: \\"[The Democrats] could nominate Mortimer Snerd and he'd automatically get 45 percent of the vote.\\" Helms was particularly popular among older, conservative constituents, and was considered one of the last \\"Old South\\" politicians to have served in the Senate. However, he also considered himself a voice of conservative youth, whom he hailed in the dedication of his autobiography. Fifth Senate term (1997‚Äì2003) Helms with Joe Biden in 1999 Weld ambassadorial nomination The summer of 1997 saw Helms engage in a protracted, high-profile battle to block the nomination of William Weld, Republican Governor of Massachusetts, as Ambassador to Mexico: refusing to hold a committee meeting to schedule a confirmation hearing. Although he did not make a formal statement of his reason, Helms did criticize Weld's support for medical marijuana, which Senate conservatives saw as incompatible with Mexico's key role in the War on Drugs. Weld attacked Helms's politics, saying, \\"I am not Senator Helms's kind of Republican. I do not pass his litmus test on social policy. Nor do I want to.\\"Link (2008), p. 447 This opened Helms to counter on Weld's positions on abortion, gay rights, and other issues on which he had a liberal position. Other factors, such as Weld's noncommittal position on Helms's chairmanship during his 1996 Senate campaign and Weld's wife's donation to the Gantt campaign, made the nomination personal and less cooperative.Link (2008), p. 446‚Äì7 Held up in the committee by Helms, despite Weld resigning his governorship to concentrate on the nomination and a petition signed by most senators, his nomination died.  Cuba  In January 1998, Helms endorsed a legislative proposal by the Cuban-American National Foundation to provide 100 million worth of food and medicine so long as Havana could promise the assistance would not be allocated to government stores or officials of the Communist Party. In the same statement, Helms said Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba had \\"created a historic opportunity for bold action\\" in the country. On May 15, Helms announced a proposal of 100 million aid package for Cuba that would provide food and medical assistance to the Cuban people by the Roman Catholic Church and politically independent relief organizations. Helms stated the proposal would hurt Castro's regime if he either accepted or rejected it and the proposal was endorsed by more than twenty senators from both parties. In his memoir, Helms stated the only reason Castro was able to maintain leadership in Cuba was the direct result of the Clinton administration not making his removal an objective of its foreign policy. He asserted the administration should have worked to develop strategies to undermine Castro and instead spent years \\"wasting precious time and energy on a senseless debate over whether to lift the Cuban embargo unilaterally.\\" Helms saw the Bush administration as \\"understanding of the nature\\" of Castro and his crimes and stated his hope that an American president would eventually be able to visit Cuba at a time when the latter country and the United States could welcome each other as friends and trading partners. In May 2001, Helms cosponsored legislation with Connecticut Democrat Joe Lieberman granting 100 million in aid to both government critics and independent workers in Cuba during the period of the following four years and said the aim of the bill was to provide financial assistance to domestic opponents of the Cuban government so that they could continue their work. The legislation was \\"the first major legislative proposal by hard-line critics\\" since the Helms-Burton Act and Helms promoted its enactment in a statement by saying it would see the United States government \\"move beyond merely isolating the Castro regime\\" which could be undermined \\"by finding bold, proactive and creative programs to help those working for change on the island.\\" In July, President Bush announced his intent to waive a portion of the Helms-Burton Act authorizing lawsuits against businesses operating in Cuba for six months in the national interest of the US and to aid administration efforts to \\"expedite the transition to democracy in Cuba.\\" Helms released a statement defending Bush, saying \\"it would be wise to consider the other salutary initiatives that the president is putting into force\\" before criticizing the decision and credited Bush with \\"taking a very tough line which is certain to make Fidel Castro squirm.\\" Final Senate years Helms watches President George W. Bush sign H.J. Resolution 114 authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 2002 In January 1997, during the confirmation hearings for Secretary of State nominee Madeleine Albright, Helms stated President Clinton's first term had left adversaries of the United States in doubt of their resolve and that \\"a lot of Americans\\" were praying she would issue in a change during her tenure. Two months later, after being confirmed, Albright traveled with Helms to his boyhood home and the Jesse Helms Center for discussions on the treaty to ban chemical arms, Helms afterward saying the pair would not have any issues if they continued being able to cooperate but stressed that the treaty would not assist with protecting Americans. In a March 1998 letter to Albright, Helms stated his opposition \\"to the creation of a permanent U.N. criminal court\\" and the United Nations becoming \\"a sovereign entity\\", Helms spokesman Marc Thiessen confirming concerns of the senator \\"that a permanent tribunal will turn into a petty claims court that will spend its time taking up complaints about the United States\\" and thereby serve the function of the General Assembly. In September 1997, amid the Senate voting to repeal a 50 billion tax break for the tobacco industry, Helms joined Mitch McConnell and Lauch Faircloth in being one of three senators to vote against the amendment. In January 1998, President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky became public. Helms found the revelation \\"damning\\", having little patience for sexual transgressions and said anyone that would advocate President Clinton's \\"should be excused, already announced their total lack of character.\\" In remarks the following month, Helms stated the scandal had left him saddened for the United States and President Clinton's daughter Chelsea. Helms exercised caution on the impeachment issue, refraining from announcing his vote until right before Clinton's Senate trial in January of the following year. The Washington Post noted Helms as the only one of the nine senators who had by then served a quarter century to vote in favor of Lewinsky making an appearance before the chamber. In his memoir, Helms stated that his vote against Clinton was not personal and that he understood \\"the fallibility of every human, and the power of Grace\\", but that he was unwilling to deny the Constitution not allowing \\"gradients of wrongdoing\\" since Clinton was proven to have lied under oath. In March 1998, after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to add Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Helms predicted the resolution would pass overwhelmingly in the full chamber and said the vote was a testament to \\"confidence in the democracies of Eastern Europe.\\" In May 1998, while delivering remarks to Therma, Inc. employees, President Clinton listed Helms as one of the senators who had aided the intent of Partnership for Peace. While the United States cast one of four votes against the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, adopted by a 120 to 4 vote in July 1998, President Clinton signed the Statute for the United States. However, Helms was strident in his opposition and let it be known that any attempt to have the Senate ratify the Statute would be \\"dead on arrival\\" at the Foreign Relations Committee. He also introduced the American Service- Members' Protection Act, adopted by Congress in 2002 \\"to protect United States military personnel and other elected and appointed officials of the United States government against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party\\". In June 1999, after President Clinton nominated Richard Holbrooke for United States Ambassador to the United Nations, the Clinton administration expressed concerns with Helms's silence on whether he would allow a vote on Holbrooke's nomination. In a June 5 statement, Helms announced the date of the four hearings and that Holbrooke would be questioned regarding his career, specifically his mediating role in negotiations of the Bosnia accords with President of Yugoslavia Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. Helms added that he could not \\"recall another Cabinet-level nomination sent to this committee with so much ethical baggage attached to it.\\" During the confirmation hearings, Helms stated that Holbrooke had violated the law repeatedly. In response, Holbrooke apologized and admitted to his \\"misconceptions\\" regarding ethics, Helms afterward expressing optimism toward the nomination as a result of Holbrooke's remorse. Three months later, after President Clinton nominating former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun for United States Ambassador to New Zealand, Helms released a statement saying the \\"nomination comes to the Senate with an ethical cloud hanging over Ms. Moseley-Braun\\" and questioned if her record had even been examined by the Clinton administration. An article published around the same time as the statement by Roll Call indicated Helms would prevent the nomination unless Moseley-Braun \\"amends for past slights\\" such as her opposition to the renewal of the emblem for the Daughters of the Confederacy. Helms subsequently demanded documents relating to Moseley-Braun's ethical charges and delayed confirmation hearings until receiving them. On November 9, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to endorse Moseley-Braun 17 to 1, Helms being the lone vote against the nomination. When the Senate voted to confirm Moseley- Braun, Helms was joined by Peter Fitzgerald, who defeated Moseley-Braun in her re-election bid, in being the only two senators to vote against her. In 2000, Bono sought out Jesse Helms to discuss increasing American aid to Africa. In Africa, AIDS is a disease that is primarily transmitted heterosexually, and Helms sympathized with Bono's description of \\"the pain it is bringing to infants and children and their families\\". Helms insisted that Bono involve the international community and private sector, so that relief efforts would not be paid for by \\"just Americans\\". Helms coauthored a bill authorizing $600 million for international AIDS relief efforts. In 2002, Helms announced that he was ashamed to have done so little during his Senate career to fight the worldwide spread of AIDS, and pledged to do more during his last few months in the Senate. Helms spoke with special appreciation of the efforts of Janet Museveni, first lady of Uganda, for her efforts to stop the spread of AIDS through a campaign based on \\"biblical values and sexual purity\\". Helms also was a proponent in trying to dissolve the United States Agency for International Development.Brainard, et al, 20023, The Other War: Global Poverty and the Millennium Challenge Account, Washington DC: Brooklings Institution and Center for Global Development, p.187 In January 2001, Helms stated he would support an increase in international assistance on the condition that all future aid from the United States be provided to the needy by private charities and religious groups as opposed to a government agency, and endorsed abolishing the United States Agency for International Development and concurrently transferring its 7 billion in annual aid to another foundation which would give grants to private relief groups. In March 2002, Helms and Democrat Joe Biden, in their positions as the ranking members of their parties on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, submitted a letter to the Bush administration demanding the Senate receive any nuclear arms reductions with Russia as a formal treaty. Retirement Because of recurring health problems, including bone disorders, prostate cancer and heart disease, Helms did not seek re-election in 2002. His Senate seat was won by Elizabeth Dole, a former Johnson, Nixon and Ford presidential advisor who served as Ronald Reagan's Transportation Secretary (which at that time included the Coast Guard), George H.W. Bush's Labor Secretary, and a former Presidential candidate, who also happened to be the wife of long-time colleague and former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. Dole held the seat for a single term, losing her 2008 re-election bid to Democrat Kay Hagan. Hagan likewise held the seat for a single term, losing her 2014 re-election bid to Republican Thom Tillis, the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives. Post-Senate life (2003‚Äì2008) Helms with Patrick McHenry in 2005 In 2004, he spoke out for the election of Republican U.S. Representative Richard Burr, who, like Elizabeth Dole two years earlier, defeated Democrat Erskine Bowles to win the other North Carolina Senate seat. In September 2005, Random House published his memoir Here's Where I Stand. In his memoirs, he likened abortion to the Holocaust and the September 11 terrorist attacks stating, \\"I will never be silent about the death of those who cannot speak for themselves.\\" Helms had also been recruited by pop star Bono for charity work. In 1994, after turning down requests for his papers to be left to an Ivy League university, he designated Wingate University as the repository of the official papers and historical items from his Senate career, where the Jesse Helms Center is based to promote his legacy. In 2005, Liberty University opened the Jesse Helms School of Government with Helms present at the dedication. Death Helms's health remained poor after he retired from the Senate in 2003. In April 2006, news reports disclosed that Helms had multi-infarct dementia, which leads to failing memory and diminished cognitive function, as well as a number of physical difficulties. He was later moved into a convalescent center near his home. Helms died of vascular dementia during the early morning hours of July 4, 2008, at the age of 86. He is buried in Historic Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina.Jesse Alexander Helms, Jr. at Find a Grave Social and political views=Views on race Jesse Helms was accused of racism throughout his career. Upon Helms's retirement from the Senate in 2001, David Broder of The Washington Post wrote a column headlined \\"Jesse Helms, White Racist,\\" analyzing Helms's public record on race, a record he felt many other reporters were side-stepping. He highlighted Helms's willingness to inflame racial resentment against African-Americans for political gain, dubbing Helms \\"the last prominent unabashed white racist politician in this country\\". Early in his career, as news director for WRAL radio, Helms supported Willis Smith in the 1950 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, against Frank Porter Graham, in a campaign that used racial issues in a divisive way, in order to draw conservative white voters to the polls. Portraying Graham as favoring interracial marriages, the campaign circulated placards with the heading, \\"White people, wake up before it is too late\\"; and a handbill that showed Graham's wife dancing with a black man.Campbell, Karl E. (2017). \\"Tar Heel Politics in the Twentieth Century: The Rise and Fall of the Progressive Plutocracy \\", in Larry E. Tise and Jeffrey J. Crowe (Eds.), New Voyages to Carolina: Reinterpreting North Carolina History. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press. . pp. 241‚Äì268; here: p. 254. When Smith won, Helms went to Washington as his administrative assistant. Helms opposed busing, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Helms called the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \\"the single most dangerous piece of legislation ever introduced in the Congress\\", and sponsored legislation to either extend it to the entire country or scrap it altogether. In 1982, he voted against the extension of the Voting Rights Act. Helms reminded voters that he tried, with a 16-day filibuster, to stop the Senate from approving a federal holiday to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., although he had fewer reservations about establishing a North Carolina state holiday for King. He has been accused of being a segregationist by some political observers and scholars, such as USA Today's DeWayne Wickham who wrote that Helms \\"subtly carried the torch of white supremacy\\" from Ben Tillman. Helms never stated that segregation was morally wrong and expressed the belief that integration would have been achieved voluntarily but that it was forced by \\"outside agitators who had their own agendas.\\" In 1996, the Department of Justice admonished Helms's 1990 campaign for mailing 125,000 postcards to households in predominantly African-American precincts warning them (incorrectly) that they could go to jail if they had not updated their addresses on the electoral register since moving.Link (2007), p. 379‚Äì80 Besides opposing civil rights and affirmative action legislation, Helms, for ideological reasons, blocked many black judges from being considered for the federal bench, and black appointees to positions of prominence in the Federal Government. In one instance, he blocked attempts by President Bill Clinton over a period of years to appoint a black judge on the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Only when Helms's own judicial choices were threatened with blocking did attorney Roger Gregory of Richmond, Virginia get confirmed. Views on homosexuality Helms had a negative view of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and LGBT rights in the United States. Helms called homosexuals \\"weak, morally sick wretches\\" and tried to cut funding for the National Endowment for the Arts for supporting the \\"gay-oriented artwork of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe\\".Jesse Helms, \\"Tax-Paid Obscenity.\\" Nova Law Review 14 (1989): 317. online In 1993, when then-president Bill Clinton wanted to appoint 'out' lesbian Roberta Achtenberg to assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Helms held up the confirmation \\"because she's a damn lesbian\\", adding \\"she's not your garden-variety lesbian. She's a militant- activist-mean lesbian\\". Helms also stated \\"I'm not going to put a lesbian in a position like that. If you want to call me a bigot, fine.\\" When Clinton urged that gays be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces, Helms said the president \\"better have a bodyguard\\" if he visited North Carolina. His views on gay and lesbian citizens were depicted in the 1998 documentary film Dear Jesse. Helms initially fought against increasing federal financing for HIV/AIDS research and treatment, saying the disease resulted from \\"unnatural\\" and \\"disgusting\\" homosexual behavior. In his final Senate year, he strongly supported AIDS measures in Africa, where heterosexual transmission of the disease is most common, and continued to hold the belief that the \\"homosexual lifestyle\\" is the cause of the spread of the epidemic in America. During his 1990 campaign against Harvey Gantt, Helms ran television commercials accusing Mr. Gantt of running a \\"secret campaign\\" in homosexual communities and of being committed to \\"mandatory gay rights laws\\" including \\"requiring local schools to hire gay teachers.\\" In 1993, when he voted against confirming Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court, he cited her support for the \\"homosexual agenda\\" as one of his reasons for doing so. In his 2017 memoir, Logical Family, gay author Armistead Maupin recalls that Helms described homosexuality as an \\"abomination\\" when he was working for him as a young man. Maupin adds that he later gave an interview about his first novel on the same TV station, and said, \\"I worked here when Jesse Helms was here. Now he's in Washington, ranting about militant homosexuals, and I'm out running around being one.\\" Personal life=Family Jesse and Dot had two daughters, Jane and Nancy, and adopted a nine-year-old orphan with cerebral palsy named Charles after reading in a newspaper that Charles wanted a mother and father for Christmas. The couple had seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild. One of his grandchildren, Jennifer Knox, later became a judge in Wake County, North Carolina. Religious views Helms was well known for his strong Christian religious views. He played a leading role in the development of the Christian right, and was a founding member of the Moral Majority in 1979. Although a Southern Baptist from his upbringing in a strictly literalist, but hawkishly secularist, environment, when in Raleigh, Helms worshipped at the moderate Hayes-Barton Baptist Church, where he had served as a deacon and Sunday school teacher before his election to the Senate. Helms was close to fellow North Carolinian Billy Graham (whom he considered a personal hero), as well as Charles Stanley, Pat Robertson, and Jerry Falwell, whose Liberty University dedicated its Jesse Helms School of Government to Helms. Helms helped found Camp Willow Run, an interdenominational Christian summer camp, sitting on its board of directors until his death, and was a Grand Orator of the Masonic Grand Lodge of North Carolina. Equating leftism and atheism, Helms argued that the downfall of the U.S. was due to loss of Christian faith, and often stated, \\"I think God is giving this country one more chance to save itself\\". He believed that the morality of capitalism was assured in the Bible, through the Parable of the Talents. He believed, writing in When Free Men Shall Stand, that \\"such utopian slogans as Peace with Honor, Minimum Wage, Racial Equality, Women's Liberation, National Health Insurance, Civil Liberty\\" are ploys by which to divide humanity \\"as sons of God\\". Awards The Jesse Helms Center is located next to the Wingate Town Hall. Helms held honorary degrees from several religious universities including Bob Jones University, Campbell University, Grove City College, and his alma mater, Wingate University. * : Order of Propitious Clouds with Grand Cordon (2002) Works * \\"Saving the UN: a challenge to the next Secretary-General.\\" Foreign Affairs 75 (1996): 2+ online * \\"What Sanctions Epidemic?

It was built on the site of a 16th-century manor house. It is particularly known for having been, between 1807 and 1897, the summer residence of the Archbishops of Canterbury. Between 1953 and 1996 it was occupied by the Royal School of Church Music. It is now a conference and wedding venue and country club, while the grounds are occupied by a golf course. History The original manor house called Addington Place was built about the 16th century. An ancient recipe for Malepigernout (or Dillegrout), a spiced chicken porridge, was historically made by the current Lord of the Manor of Addington to be served upon the Coronation of the Monarch of England. The Leigh family gained this serjeanty upon becoming Lords of the Manor of Addington prior to the coronation of Charles II in 1661. The Addington estate was owned by the Leigh family until the early 18th century. Sir John Leigh died without heirs in 1737 and his estates went to distant relatives, who eventually sold to Barlow Trecothick. Trecothick had been brought up in Boston, Massachusetts, and became a merchant there. He then moved to London, still trading as a merchant, and later sat as MP for the City of London in 1768‚Äì74, and served as Lord Mayor in 1770. He bought the estate for ¬£38,500 (). He built a new house, designed by Robert Mylne in the Palladian style; a country mansion with single-storey wings. He died before it was completed in 1774 and it was inherited by his heir, James Ivers, who had to take the surname Trecothick in order to inherit the estate. James continued the work on the house, having the substantial grounds and gardens landscaped by Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown. Owing to financial difficulties, James Trecothick had to sell the estate in 1802. The estate was sold in lots in 1803. The next owners (William Coles and Westgarth Snaith) also got into financial trouble and sold it by Act of Parliament in 1807. This enabled the mansion to be purchased for the Archbishops of Canterbury, since nearby Croydon Palace had become dilapidated and inconvenient. The name became Addington Farm under the first few Archbishops, but gradually changed to Addington Palace. The archbishops made further changes and enlarged the building; work on the building was overseen by Richard Norman Shaw. It became the official summer residence of six archbishops: *Charles Manners-Sutton (Archbishop 1805‚Äì1828) *William Howley (Archbishop 1828‚Äì1848) *John Bird Sumner (Archbishop 1848‚Äì1862) *Charles Thomas Longley (Archbishop 1862‚Äì1868) *Archibald Campbell Tait (Archbishop 1868‚Äì1882) *Edward White Benson (Archbishop 1883‚Äì1896) All except Benson are buried in St Mary's Church or churchyard, Addington: Benson is buried in Canterbury Cathedral. The house was sold in 1897 to Frederick Alexander English, a diamond merchant from South Africa. After his death, the mansion was taken over during the First World War by the Red Cross and became a fever hospital. Eventually, in 1930, it came into the hands of the County Borough of Croydon. Current usage The house was Grade II* listed in 1951. In 1953, it was leased to the Royal School of Church Music, initially to house choirboys assembled from all over Britain to sing at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The building housed the Royal School of Church Music's music publishing operation, residential college and choir school until 1996, when a private company took it over for development as a conference and banqueting venue, health farm and country club. It is used extensively for weddings. It is surrounded by a park and golf courses, and its gardens are still largely in their original design. Much of the grounds have been leased by golf clubs and the exclusive Bishops Walk housing development was built on Bishops Walk (a private road).

It lies south west of the nearest large town, Alice Springs. Uluru is sacred to the Pitjantjatjara, the Aboriginal people of the area, known as Anangu. The area around the formation is home to an abundance of springs, waterholes, rock caves and ancient paintings. Uluru is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Uluru and Kata Tjuta, also known as the Olgas, are the two major features of the Ulu·πüu-Kata Tju·πØa National Park. Name The local Anangu, the Pitjantjatjara people, call the landmark Ulu·πüu (). This word is a proper noun, with no further particular meaning in the Pitjantjatjara dialect, although it is used as a local family name by the senior Traditional Owners of Uluru. On 19 July 1873, the surveyor William Gosse sighted the landmark and named it Ayers Rock in honour of the then Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers. Since then, both names have been used. In 1993, a dual naming policy was adopted that allowed official names that consist of both the traditional Aboriginal name (in the Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjatjara and other local languages) and the English name. On 15 December 1993, it was renamed \\"Ayers Rock / Uluru\\" and became the first official dual-named feature in the Northern Territory. The order of the dual names was officially reversed to \\"Uluru / Ayers Rock\\" on 6 November 2002 following a request from the Regional Tourism Association in Alice Springs. Description Uluru is one of Australia's most recognisable natural landmarks. The sandstone formation stands high, rising above sea level with most of its bulk lying underground, and has a total perimeter of . Both Uluru and the nearby Kata Tjuta formation have great cultural significance for the A·πâangu people, the traditional inhabitants of the area, who lead walking tours to inform visitors about the local flora and fauna, bush food and the Aboriginal dreamtime stories of the area. Uluru is notable for appearing to change colour at different times of the day and year, most notably when it glows red at dawn and sunset. Kata Tjuta, also called Mount Olga or the Olgas, lies west of Uluru. Special viewing areas with road access and parking have been constructed to give tourists the best views of both sites at dawn and dusk. Panorama of Uluru around sunset, showing its distinctive red colouration at dusk. Geology Uluru rock formations Panorama from the top of Uluru, showing a typical gully Close-up view of Uluru's surface, composed of arkose Uluru is an inselberg, literally \\"island mountain\\".Young, David N.; Duncan, N.; Camacho, A.; Ferenczi, P.A.; Madigan, T.L.A. (2002). Ayers Rock, Northern Territory, Map Sheet GS52-8 (2nd edition) (Map). 1:250 000\\\\. Northern Territory Geological Survey. Geological Map Series Explanatory Notes. An inselberg is a prominent isolated residual knob or hill that rises abruptly from and is surrounded by extensive and relatively flat erosion lowlands in a hot, dry region. Uluru is also often referred to as a monolith, although this is a somewhat ambiguous term that is generally avoided by geologists. The remarkable feature of Uluru is its homogeneity and lack of jointing and parting at bedding surfaces, leading to the lack of development of scree slopes and soil. These characteristics led to its survival, while the surrounding rocks were eroded. For the purpose of mapping and describing the geological history of the area, geologists refer to the rock strata making up Uluru as the Mutitjulu Arkose, and it is one of many sedimentary formations filling the Amadeus Basin. Composition Uluru is dominantly composed of coarse-grained arkose (a type of sandstone characterised by an abundance of feldspar) and some conglomerate. Average composition is 50% feldspar, 25‚Äì35% quartz and up to 25% rock fragments; most feldspar is K-feldspar with only minor plagioclase as subrounded grains and highly altered inclusions within K-feldspar. The grains are typically in diameter, and are angular to subangular; the finer sandstone is well sorted, with sorting decreasing with increasing grain size. The rock fragments include subrounded basalt, invariably replaced to various degrees by chlorite and epidote. The minerals present suggest derivation from a predominantly granite source, similar to the Musgrave Block exposed to the south. When relatively fresh, the rock has a grey colour, but weathering of iron-bearing minerals by the process of oxidation gives the outer surface layer of rock a red-brown rusty colour. Features related to deposition of the sediment include cross-bedding and ripples, analysis of which indicated deposition from broad shallow high energy fluvial channels and sheet flooding, typical of alluvial fans. Age and origin Rain water flows off Uluru along channels marked by dark algae, forming small ponds at the base The Mutitjulu Arkose is believed to be of about the same age as the conglomerate at Kata Tjuta, and to have a similar origin despite the rock type being different, but it is younger than the rocks exposed to the east at Mount Conner, and unrelated to them. The strata at Uluru are nearly vertical, dipping to the south west at 85¬∞, and have an exposed thickness of at least . The strata dip below the surrounding plain and no doubt extend well beyond Uluru in the subsurface, but the extent is not known. The rock was originally sand, deposited as part of an extensive alluvial fan that extended out from the ancestors of the Musgrave, Mann and Petermann Ranges to the south and west, but separate from a nearby fan that deposited the sand, pebbles and cobbles that now make up Kata Tjuta. The similar mineral composition of the Mutitjulu Arkose and the granite ranges to the south is now explained. The ancestors of the ranges to the south were once much larger than the eroded remnants we see today. They were thrust up during a mountain building episode referred to as the Petermann Orogeny that took place in late Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian times (550‚Äì530 Ma), and thus the Mutitjulu Arkose is believed to have been deposited at about the same time. The arkose sandstone which makes up the formation is composed of grains that show little sorting based on grain size, exhibit very little rounding and the feldspars in the rock are relatively fresh in appearance. This lack of sorting and grain rounding is typical of arkosic sandstones and is indicative of relatively rapid erosion from the granites of the growing mountains to the south. The layers of sand were nearly horizontal when deposited, but were tilted to their near vertical position during a later episode of mountain building, possibly the Alice Springs Orogeny of Palaeozoic age (400‚Äì300 Ma). Fauna and flora Black-flanked rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis) Historically, 46 species of native mammals are known to have been living near Uluru; according to recent surveys there are currently 21. A·πâangu acknowledge that a decrease in the number has implications for the condition and health of the landscape. Moves are supported for the reintroduction of locally extinct animals such as malleefowl, common brushtail possum, rufous hare-wallaby or mala, bilby, burrowing bettong, and the black-flanked rock-wallaby. Trees at the base of Uluru The mulgara is mostly restricted to the transitional sand plain area, a narrow band of country that stretches from the vicinity of Uluru to the northern boundary of the park and into Ayers Rock Resort. This area also contains the marsupial mole, woma python, and great desert skink. The bat population of the park comprises at least seven species that depend on day roosting sites within caves and crevices of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Most of the bats forage for aerial prey within or so from the rock face. The park has a very rich reptile fauna of high conservation significance, with 73 species having been reliably recorded. Four species of frogs are abundant at the base of Uluru and Kata Tjuta following summer rains. The great desert skink is listed as vulnerable. A·πâangu continue to hunt and gather animal species in remote areas of the park and on A·πâangu land elsewhere. Hunting is largely confined to the red kangaroo, bush turkey, emu, and lizards such as the sand goanna and perentie. Of the 27 mammal species found in the park, six are introduced: the house mouse, camel, fox, cat, dog, and rabbit. These species are distributed throughout the park, but their densities are greatest near the rich water run-off areas of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park flora represents a large portion of plants found in Central Australia. A number of these species are considered rare and restricted in the park or the immediate region. Many rare and endemic plants are found in the park. The growth and reproduction of plant communities rely on irregular rainfall. Some plants are able to survive fire and some are dependent on it to reproduce. Plants are an important part of Tjukurpa, and ceremonies are held for each of the major plant foods. Many plants are associated with ancestral beings. Flora in Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park can be broken into these categories: * ‚Äì trees * ‚Äì shrubs * ‚Äì flowers * ‚Äì grasses Trees such as the mulga and centralian bloodwood are used to make tools such as spearheads, boomerangs, and bowls. The red sap of the bloodwood is used as a disinfectant and an inhalant for coughs and colds. Several rare and endangered species are found in the park. Most of them, like adder's tongue ferns, are restricted to the moist areas at the base of the formation, which are areas of high visitor use and subject to erosion. Since the first Europeans arrived, 34 exotic plant species have been recorded in the park, representing about 6.4% of the total park flora. Some, such as perennial buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), were introduced to rehabilitate areas damaged by erosion. It is the most threatening weed in the park and has spread to invade water- and nutrient-rich drainage lines. A few others, such as burrgrass, were brought in accidentally, carried on cars and people. Climate and five seasons The park has a hot desert climate and receives an average rainfall of per year. The average high temperature in summer (December‚ÄìJanuary) is , and the average low temperature in winter (June‚ÄìJuly) is . Temperature extremes in the park have been recorded at during the summer and during winter. UV levels are extreme between October and March, averaging between 11 and 15 on the UV index.Yulara Ultraviolet (UV) Index Forecast Graph. Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Retrieved 20 April 2014.

One such account, taken from Robert Layton's (1989) Uluru: An Aboriginal history of Ayers Rock, reads as follows: Two other accounts are given in Norbert Brockman's (1997) Encyclopedia of Sacred Places. The first tells of serpent beings who waged many wars around Uluru, scarring the rock. The second tells of two tribes of ancestral spirits who were invited to a feast, but were distracted by the beautiful Sleepy Lizard Women and did not show up. In response, the angry hosts sang evil into a mud sculpture that came to life as the dingo. There followed a great battle, which ended in the deaths of the leaders of both tribes. The earth itself rose up in grief at the bloodshed, becoming Uluru. The Commonwealth Department of Environment's webpage advises: It is sometimes reported that those who take rocks from the formation will be cursed and suffer misfortune. There have been many instances where people who removed such rocks attempted to mail them back to various agencies in an attempt to remove the perceived curse. History Petroglyphs on Uluru Aerial view of Uluru Ancient human settlement Archaeological findings to the east and west indicate that humans settled in the area more than 10,000 years ago. European arrival (1870s) Europeans arrived in the Australian Western Desert in the 1870s. Uluru and Kata Tjuta were first mapped by Europeans in 1872 during the expeditionary period made possible by the construction of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. In separate expeditions, Ernest Giles and William Gosse were the first European explorers to this area. While exploring the area in 1872, Giles sighted Kata Tjuta from a location near Kings Canyon and called it Mount Olga, while the following year Gosse observed Uluru and named it Ayers' Rock, in honour of the Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers. European colonisation Further explorations followed with the aim of establishing the possibilities of the area for pastoralism. In the late 19th century, pastoralists attempted to establish themselves in areas adjoining the Southwestern/Petermann Reserve and interaction between A·πâangu and white people became more frequent and more violent. Due to the effects of grazing and drought, bush food stores became depleted. Competition for these resources created conflict between the two groups, resulting in more frequent police patrols. Later, during the depression in the 1930s, A·πâangu became involved in dingo scalping with 'doggers' who introduced A·πâangu to European foods and ways. Aboriginal reserve (1920) Between 1918 and 1921, large adjoining areas of South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory were declared as Aboriginal reserves, sanctuaries for nomadic people who had virtually no contact with European settlers. In 1920, part of Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park was declared an Aboriginal Reserve (commonly known as the South-Western or Petermann Reserve) by the Australian government under the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918. Tourism (1936‚Äì1960s) The first tourists arrived in the Uluru area in 1936. Beginning in the 1940s, permanent European settlement of the area for reasons of the Aboriginal welfare policy and to help promote tourism of Uluru. This increased tourism prompted the formation of the first vehicular tracks in 1948 and tour bus services began early in the 1950s. In 1958, the area that would become the Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park was excised from the Petermann Reserve; it was placed under the management of the Northern Territory Reserves Board and named the Ayers Rock‚ÄìMount Olga National Park. The first ranger was Bill Harney, a well-recognised central Australian figure. By 1959, the first motel leases had been granted and Eddie Connellan had constructed an airstrip close to the northern side of Uluru. Following a 1963 suggestion from the Northern Territory Reserves Board, a chain was laid to assist tourists in climbing the landmark.Tourism pioneer Peter Severin laid the chain up Uluru. He predicts it will return ABC News, 26 October 2019. Retrieved 26 October 2019. Aboriginal ownership since 1985 On 26 October 1985, the Australian government returned ownership of Uluru to the local Pitjantjatjara people, with one of the conditions being that the A·πâangu would lease it back to the National Parks and Wildlife agency for 99 years and that it would be jointly managed. An agreement originally made between the community and Prime Minister Bob Hawke that the climb to the top by tourists would be stopped was later broken. The Aboriginal community of Mutitjulu, with a population of approximately 300, is located near the eastern end of Uluru. From Uluru it is by road to the tourist town of Yulara, population 3,000, which is situated just outside the national park. On 8 October 2009, the Talinguru Nyakuntjaku viewing area opened to public visitation. The project about on the east side of Uluru involved design and construction supervision by the A·πâangu traditional owners, with of roads and of walking trails being built for the area. Tourism Driving on Lasseter Highway from Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park, April 2007 The development of tourism infrastructure adjacent to the base of Uluru that began in the 1950s soon produced adverse environmental impacts. It was decided in the early 1970s to remove all accommodation-related tourist facilities and re-establish them outside the park. In 1975, a reservation of of land beyond the park's northern boundary, from Uluru, was approved for the development of a tourist facility and an associated airport, to be known as Yulara. The camp ground within the park was closed in 1983 and the motels closed in late 1984, coinciding with the opening of the Yulara resort. In 1992, the majority interest in the Yulara resort held by the Northern Territory Government was sold and the resort was renamed Ayers Rock Resort. Since the park was listed as a World Heritage Site, annual visitor numbers rose to over 400,000 visitors by the year 2000. Increased tourism provides regional and national economic benefits. It also presents an ongoing challenge to balance conservation of cultural values and visitor needs. Climbing Climbers and a warning sign On 11 December 1983, the Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, promised to hand back the land title to the A·πâangu traditional custodians and caretakers and agreed to the community's 10-point plan which included forbidding the climbing of Uluru. The government, however, set access to climb Uluru and a 99-year lease, instead of the previously agreed upon 50-year lease, as conditions before the title was officially given back to the A·πâangu on 26 October 1985. The local A·πâangu do not climb Uluru because of its great spiritual significance. They request that visitors do not climb the rock, partly due to the path crossing a sacred traditional Dreamtime track, and also due to a sense of responsibility for the safety of visitors. Until October 2019, the visitors guide said \\"the climb is not prohibited, but we prefer that, as a guest on A·πâangu land, you will choose to respect our law and culture by not climbing.\\" According to a 2010 publication, just over one-third of all visitors to the park climbed Uluru; a high percentage of these were children. A chain handhold added in 1964 and extended in 1976 made the hour-long climb easier, but it remained a steep, hike to the top, where it can be quite windy. It was recommended that individuals drink plenty of water while climbing, and that those who were unfit, sufferers from vertigo or medical conditions restricting exercise, did not attempt it. Climbing Uluru was generally closed to the public when high winds were present at the top. There were at least 37 deaths relating to recreational climbing since such incidents began being recorded. About one- sixth of visitors made the climb between 2011 and 2015. The traditional owners of Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park (Nguraritja) and the Federal Government's Director of National Parks share decision-making on the management of Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park. Under their joint Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park Management Plan 2010‚Äì20, issued by the Director of National Parks under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, clause 6.3.3 provides that the Director and the Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa Board of Management should work towards closure of the climb and, additionally, that it was to be closed upon any of three conditions being met: there were \\"adequate new visitor experiences\\", less than 20 per cent of visitors made the climb, or the \\"critical factors\\" in decisions to visit were \\"cultural and natural experiences\\". Despite cogent evidence that the second condition was met by July 2013, the climb remained open. Several controversial incidents on top of Uluru in 2010, including a striptease, golfing, and nudity, led to renewed calls for banning the climb. On 1 November 2017, the Ulu·πüu‚ÄìKata Tju·πØa National Park board voted unanimously to prohibit climbing Uluru. As a result, there was a surge in climbers and visitors after the ban was announced. The ban took effect on 26 October 2019, and the chain was then removed.Uluru chains removed, but site may take 'thousands of years' to return to natural state ABC News, 13 November 2019.

These areas are the sites of gender-linked rituals or ceremonies and are forbidden ground for A·πâangu of the opposite sex to those participating in the rituals in question. The photographic restriction is intended to prevent A·πâangu from inadvertently violating this taboo by encountering photographs of the forbidden sites in the outside world. In September 2020, Parks Australia alerted Google Australia to the user- generated images from the Uluru summit that have been posted on the Google Maps platform and requested that the content be removed in accordance with the wishes of Anangu, Uluru's traditional owners, and the national park's Film and Photography Guidelines.

Different approaches developed, each specific to the time and place of a particular society. Jamaican historian Verene Shepherd states that the most widely used term is gratuitous manumission, \\"the conferment of freedom on the enslaved by enslavers before the end of the slave system\\". The motivations for manumission were complex and varied. Firstly, it may present itself as a sentimental and benevolent gesture. One typical scenario was the freeing in the master's will of a devoted servant after long years of service. A trusted bailiff might be manumitted as a gesture of gratitude. For those working as agricultural laborers or in workshops, there was little likelihood of being so noticed. Such feelings of benevolence may have been of value to slave owners themselves as it allowed them to focus on a \\"humane component\\" in the human traffic of slavery. In general, it was more common for older slaves to be given freedom once they had reached the age at which they were beginning to be less useful. Legislation under the early Roman Empire put limits on the number of slaves that could be freed in wills (Lex Fufia Caninia, 2 BCE), which suggests that it had been widely used. Freeing slaves could serve the pragmatic interests of the owner. The prospect of manumission worked as an incentive for slaves to be industrious and compliant. Roman slaves were paid a wage (peculium), which they could save up to buy themselves freedom. Manumission contracts found, in some abundance at Delphi (Greece), specify in detail the prerequisites for liberation. Manumission was not always charitable or altruistic. In one of the stories in the Arabian Nights, in the Richard Francis Burton translation, a slave owner threatens to free his slave for lying to him. The slave says, \\"thou shall not manumit me, for I have no handicraft whereby to gain my living\\". Burton notes: \\"Here the slave refuses to be set free and starve. For a master to do so without ample reason is held disgraceful\\".Richard Burton, Tales from the Arabian Nights, P.H. Newby, editor, New York: Pocket Library Edition, 1954, p. 84. Ancient Greece A History of Ancient Greece explains that in the context of Ancient Greece, affranchisement came in many forms. A master choosing to free his slave would most likely do so only \\"at his death, specifying his desire in his will\\". In rare cases, slaves who were able to earn enough money in their labour were able to buy their own freedom and were known as choris oikointes. Two 4th- century bankers, Pasion and Phormio, had been slaves before they bought their freedom. A slave could also be sold fictitiously to a sanctuary from where a god could enfranchise him. In very rare circumstances, the city could affranchise a slave. A notable example is that Athens liberated everyone who was present at the Battle of Arginusae (406 BCE). Even once a slave was freed, he was not generally permitted to become a citizen, but would become a metic. The master then became a prostat√®s. The former slave could be bound to some continuing duty to the master and was commonly required to live near the former master (paramone).Manumission of Female Slaves at Delphi at attalus.org. Breaches of these conditions could lead to beatings, prosecution at law and re-enslavement. Sometimes, extra payments were specified by which a freed slave could liberate himself from such residual duties. However, ex- slaves were able to own property outright, and their children were free of all constraint. Ancient Rome Under Roman law, a slave had no personhood and was protected under law mainly as his or her master's property. In Ancient Rome, a slave who had been manumitted was a libertus (feminine liberta) and a citizen. pileus (1st century BCE, Mus√©e de Mariemont). The soft felt pileus hat was a symbol of the freed slave and manumission; slaves were not allowed to wear them: :Among the Romans the cap of felt was the emblem of liberty. When a slave obtained his freedom he had his head shaved, and wore instead of his hair an undyed pileus (œÄŒØŒªŒµŒøŒΩ ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫œåŒΩ, Diodorus Siculus Exc. Leg. 22 p625, ed. Wess.; Plaut. Amphit. I.1.306; Persius, V.82). Hence the phrase servos ad pileum vocare is a summons to liberty, by which slaves were frequently called upon to take up arms with a promise of liberty (Liv. XXIV.32). \\"The figure of Liberty on some of the coins of Antoninus Pius, struck A.D. 145, holds this cap in the right hand\\".Yates, James. Entry \\"Pileus\\" in William Smith's A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (John Murray, London, 1875). The cap was an attribute carried by Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who was also recognized by the rod (vindicta or festuca), used ceremonially in the act of manumissio vindicta, Latin for \\"freedom by the rod\\" (emphasis added): :The master brought his slave before the magistratus, and stated the grounds (causa) of the intended manumission. \\"The lictor of the magistratus laid a rod (festuca) on the head of the slave, accompanied with certain formal words, in which he declared that he was a free man ex Jure Quiritium\\", that is, \\"vindicavit in libertatem\\". The master in the meantime held the slave, and after he had pronounced the words \\"hunc hominem liberum volo,\\" he turned him round (momento turbinis exit Marcus Dama, Persius, Sat. V.78) and let him go (emisit e manu, or misit manu, Plaut. Capt. II.3.48), whence the general name of the act of manumission. The magistratus then declared him to be free [...]Long, George. Entry \\"Manumission\\" in William Smith's A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (John Murray, London, 1875). A freed slave customarily took the former owner's family name, which was the nomen (see Roman naming conventions) of the master's gens. The former owner became the patron (patronus) and the freed slave became a client (cliens) and retained certain obligations to the former master, who owed certain obligations in return. A freed slave could also acquire multiple patrons. A freed slave became a citizen. Not all citizens, however, held the same rights and privileges (for instance, women were citizens, but their Roman citizenship did not let them vote or hold public office). The freed slaves' rights were limited or defined by particular statutes. A freed slave could become a civil servant but not hold higher magistracies (see, for instance, apparitor and scriba), serve as priests of the emperor or hold any of the other highly respected public positions. If they were sharp at business, however, there were no social limits to the wealth that freedmen could amass. Their children held full legal rights, but Roman society was stratified. One of the most famous Romans to have been the son of a freedman was the poet Horace, who enjoyed the patronage of Augustus. A notable character of Latin literature is Trimalchio, the ostentatiously nouveau riche freedman in the Satyricon, by Petronius. Peru In colonial Peru, the laws around manumission were influenced by the Siete Partidas a Castilian law code. According to the Siete Partidas, a master who manumitted their slaves should be honored and obeyed by their former slaves for giving such a generous gift.McKinley, Michelle A. (2016) Fractional Freedoms: Slavery, Intimacy, and Legal Mobilization in Colonial Lima, 1600‚Äì1700. New York: Cambridge University Press, p. 165. Due perhaps to the closer intimacy between masters and household slaves, women and children were more likely to be manumitted than men.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 11. As in other parts of Latin America under the system of coartaci√≥n, slaves could purchase their freedom by negotiating with their master for a purchase price and this was the most common way for slaves to be freed.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 177. Manumission also occurred during baptism, or as part of an owner's last will and testament. In baptismal manumission, enslaved children were freed at baptism. Many of these freedoms came with stipulations which could include servitude often until the end of an owner's life.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 152 Children freed at baptism were also frequently the children of still enslaved parents. A child who was freed at baptism but continued to live with enslaved family was far more likely to be reenslaved.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 145 Baptismal manumission could be used as evidence of a person's freed status in a legal case but they did not always have enough information to serve as a carta de libertad.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 153. Female slave owners were more likely than males to manumit their slaves at baptism.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 155. The language used by women slave owners who freed their slaves also differed substantially from that of men, with many women using the phrasing ‚Äúfor the love I have for her‚Äù as well as other expressions of intimacy as part of the reasoning for freeing their slaves as written on the baptismal record or carta de libertad.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 152. Male slave owners were far less likely to speak in intimate terms about their reasoning for freeing their slaves.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 161. Some children manumitted at baptism were the illegitimate children of their male owners though this can be difficult to determine from the baptismal record and must be assessed through other evidence.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 162. Although slave owners often characterized these baptismal manumissions as a result of their generous beneficence, there are records of payments by parents or godparents to ensure the child's freedom.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 165. Mothers were almost never manumitted alongside their children. Manumitting a slave's children at baptism could be one way for owners to ensure the loyalty of the children's still enslaved parents.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 167. Enslaved people could also be freed as part of a slave owner's last will and testament. Testamentary manumission frequently involved expressions of affection on the part of the slave owner to the enslaved person as part of the rationale behind manumission. Slave owners also frequently cited a desire to die with a clear conscience as part of their reasoning for freeing their slaves. Testamentary manumission could often be disputed by heirs claiming fraud, or that an enslaved person had preyed upon a relative's weak mental or physical condition.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 180. Legally testamentary manumissions were usually respected by the courts, who understood enslaved people as part of their owner's property to distribute as they wished.McKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 181. Relatives who claimed fraud had to provide evidence of their claims or they would be dismissed. As in baptismal manumission, conditions of ongoing servitude were sometimes placed upon the enslaved person, by obligating them to care for another relative. In Iberoamerican law, a person had discretion over one-fifth of their estateMcKinley, Fractional Freedoms, p. 182. with the rest going to children, spouses, and other relatives. An enslaved person could be sold in order to cover debts of the estate, but not if they had already paid part of their purchase price towards manumission as this was considered a legally binding agreement. As long as a person had not disinherited his children or spouse, a slave owner could manumit their slaves as they wished. Caribbean Manumission laws varied between the various colonies in the Caribbean. The island of Barbados had some of the strictest laws, requiring owners to pay ¬£200 for male slaves and ¬£300 for female slaves, and show cause to the authorities. This was done to limit the number of free blacks on the island. In some other colonies no fees applied. It was not uncommon for ex-slaves to purchase family members or friends in order to free them. For example, ex- slave Susannah Ostrehan became a successful businesswoman in Barbados and purchased many of her acquaintances. United States African slaves were freed in the North American colonies as early as the 17th century. Some, such as Anthony Johnson, went on to become landowners and slaveholders themselves in the colonies. Slaves could sometimes arrange manumission by agreeing to \\"purchase themselves\\" by paying the master an agreed amount. Some masters demanded market rates; others set a lower amount in consideration of service. Regulation of manumission began in 1692, when Virginia established that to manumit a slave, a person must pay the cost for them to be transported out of the colony. A 1723 law stated that slaves may not \\"be set free upon any pretence whatsoever, except for some meritorious services to be adjudged and allowed by the governor and council.\\"Wilson, Black Codes (1965), p. 15. In some cases, a master who was drafted into the army would send a slave instead, with a promise of freedom if he survived the war.Taylor loc 491 The new government of Virginia repealed the laws in 1782 and declared freedom for slaves who had fought for the colonies during the American Revolutionary War. The 1782 laws also permitted masters to free their slaves on their own accord; previously, a manumission had required obtaining consent from the state legislature, which was arduous and rarely granted.Taylor loc 604 However, as population of free Negroes increased, the state passed laws forbidding them from moving into the state (1778)Taylor loc 598 and requiring newly-freed slaves to leave within one year unless they had special permission (1806).Wilson, Black Codes (1965), p. 16. In the Upper South in the late 18th century, planters had less need for slaves, as they switched from labor- intensive tobacco cultivation to mixed-crop farming. Slave states such as Virginia made it easier for slaveholders to free their slaves. In the two decades after the American Revolutionary War, so many slaveholders accomplished manumissions by deed or in wills that the proportion of free blacks to the total number of blacks rose from less than 1% to 10% in the Upper South. In Virginia, the proportion of free blacks increased from 1% in 1782 to 7% in 1800.Taylor loc 611 Together with several Northern states abolishing slavery during that period, the proportion of free blacks nationally increased to ~14% of the total black population. New York and New Jersey adopted gradual abolition laws that kept the free children of slaves as indentured servants into their twenties. After the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, which enabled the development of extensive new areas for cotton cultivation, the number of manumissions decreased because of the increased demand for slave labor. In the 19th century, slave revolts such as the Haitian Revolution, and especially, the 1831 rebellion, led by Nat Turner, increased slaveholders' fears, and most Southern states passed laws making manumission nearly impossible until the passage of the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery \\"except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,\\" after the American Civil War. In South Carolina, to free a slave required permission of the state legislature; in Florida manumission was prohibited altogether. Of the Founding Fathers of the United States, as defined by the historian Richard B. Morris, the Southerners were the major slaveholders, but Northerners also held them, generally in smaller number, as domestic servants. John Adams owned none. George Washington freed his own slaves in his will (his wife independently held numerous dower slaves). Thomas Jefferson freed five slaves in his will, and the remaining 130 were sold to settle his estate debts. James Madison did not free his slaves, and some were sold to pay off estate debts, but his widow and her son retained most to work Montpelier plantation. Alexander Hamilton's slave ownership is unclear, but it is most likely that he was of the abolitionist ideal, as he was an officer of the New York Manumission Society. John Jay founded the society and freed his domestic slaves in 1798; the same year, as governor, he signed the Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery. John Dickinson freed his slaves between 1776 and 1786, the only Founding Father to do so during that time. See also * Emancipation * Islamic views on slavery ReferencesSources * Bradley, K.R. (1984).

He was a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress, and for six months served as the presiding officer of that body. He also attended the Constitutional Convention, served on its Committee of Detail, and was one of the signers of the United States Constitution on September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Biography=Early life and family Gorham was born in Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts, and was the son of Captain Nathaniel Gorham and his father's wife Mary Soley.Morton, p. 117. His 3rd great grandfather was John Howland (c. 1599‚Äì1673), who was one of the Pilgrims who traveled from England to North America on the Mayflower, signed the Mayflower Compact, and helped found the Plymouth Colony.Haxtun, p. 34.The Pilgrim John Howland Society: Famous Descendants His sister, Elizabeth Gorham, who married John Leighton, was the ancestor of Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt, the second wife of Theodore Roosevelt, who served as First Lady of the United States during his presidency from 1901 to 1909.MMOA, p. 184. Marriage He married Rebecca Call, who was descended from Anglican vicar and the first minister of Dorchester, Massachusetts, John Maverick, and his royally descended wife, Mary Gye Maverick. Rev. John Maverick was born in Awliscombe, Devon, baptized there on December 28, 1578, and enrolled at Oxford October 24, 1595, age 18. He was the son of Rev. Peter Maverick (spelled Mavericke in old English records), the vicar of Awliscombe. on September 6, 1763, in Charlestown, Massachusetts. She was born on May 14, 1744, in Charlestown, and died there on November 18, 1812. She was the daughter of Caleb Call and Rebecca Stimson.Waters, p. 366. They were the parents of nine children. Career Starting at 15, he served an apprenticeship with a merchant in New London, Connecticut, after which he opened a merchant house in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1759. He took part in public affairs at the beginning of the American Revolution: he was a member of the Massachusetts General Court (legislature) from 1771 until 1775, a delegate to the Provincial congress from 1774 until 1775, and a member of the Board of War from 1778 until its dissolution in 1781. In 1779 he served in the state constitutional convention. He was a delegate to the Congress of the Confederation from 1782 until 1783, and also from 1785 until 1787, serving as its president for five months from June 6 to November 5, 1786, after the resignation of John Hancock. Gorham also served a term as judge of the Middlesex County Court of Common Pleas.Morton, p. 118. In 1786 it might have been Gorham who suggested to Alexander Hamilton that Prince Henry of Prussia would become President or King of the United States. However, the offer was revoked before the prince could make a reply. For several months in 1787, Gorham served as one of the Massachusetts delegates to the United States Constitutional Convention.Morton, p. 118. Gorham frequently served as Chairman of the Convention's Committee of the Whole, meaning that he (rather than the President of the Convention, George Washington) presided over convention sessions during the delegates' first deliberations on the structure of the new government in late May and June 1787. After the convention, he worked hard to see that the Constitution was approved in his home state. In connection with Oliver Phelps, he purchased from the state of Massachusetts in 1788 pre-emption rights to an immense tract of land in western New York State which straddled the Genesee River, all for the sum of $1,000,000 (about $ today) (the Phelps and Gorham Purchase).Morton, p. 120. The land in question had been previously ceded to Massachusetts from the state of New York under the 1786 Treaty of Hartford. The pre-emption right gave them the first or preemptive right to obtain clear title to this land from the Indians. They soon extinguished the Indian title to the portion of the land east of the Genesee River, as well as a tract west of the Genesee, the Mill Yard Tract, surveyed all of it, laid out townships, and sold large parts to speculators and settlers. Nathaniel Gorham Jr. (died October 22, 1836, Canandaigua, New York) was a pioneer settler of this tract, having been placed in charge of his father's interests there. In 1790, after Gorham and Phelps defaulted in payment, they sold nearly all of their unsold lands east of the Genesee to Robert Morris, who eventually resold those lands to The Pulteney Association. Phelps and Gorham were unable to fulfill their contract in full to Massachusetts, so in 1790, they surrendered back to Massachusetts that portion of the lands which remained under the Indian title, namely, the land west of the Genesee. It also was eventually acquired by Robert Morris, who resold most of it to The Holland Land Company. Morris did keep of land that became known as The Morris Reserve. Death and legacy Gorham died in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1796. A eulogy was delivered in his memory by Dr. Thomas Welch of Charlestown.Dr. Welch was a 1772 graduate of Harvard College. He served as a surgeon in the American Revolutionary War. He is buried in the Phipps Street Cemetery in Charlestown.US Army Center of Military History Gorham Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in his honor.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/002071.asp The Town of Gorham, New York, is also named in his honor.

The population was 589 at the 2010 census. Otter Creek Township received its name due to the creek's substantive otter population. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 11.8 square miles (30.6 km2), all of it land. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 611 people, 229 households, and 172 families residing in the township. The population density was 51.8 people per square mile (20.0/km2). There were 246 housing units at an average density of 20.8/sq mi (8.0/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 97.87% White, 1.15% African American, 0.16% Asian, and 0.82% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.33% of the population. There were 229 households, out of which 33.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.1% were married couples living together, 6.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.5% were non-families. 18.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

In 1830, Edeburn built a sawmill, and McConnell built a flour mill. James Gilkey, cultivator of the \\"Neshannock potatoes,\\" surveyed the site and platted the town in 1836 on McConnell's land. A store and a tavern were opened about the time the town was platted, and in 1840 the post office was established, with Robert Young as the first postmaster. In 1864 West Middlesex was incorporated as a borough. The first burgess was D. Edeburn, and the first members of the council were C.W. Watson, Hiram Veach and G.R. Tuttle.

These games simulate realistic combat, thus making tactics and caution more important than quick reflexes in other action games. Tactical shooters involving military combat are sometimes known as \\"soldier sims\\".IGN Staff Operation Flashpoint Goes to War IGN (December 14, 2001) Retrieved on February 7, 2008Adams, David America's Army Linked Up IGN, (February 9, 2006) Retrieved on February 7, 2008 Game design According to IGN, tactical shooters \\"are about caution, care, cooperation, coordination, planning, and pacing. In these games, making decisive pushes, quick moves for cover, strategic retreats, and last ditch grabs at the gold are not only important to success, but balanced in such a way that they become enjoyable activities in play.\\" David Treharne of GameSpew identifies four criteria for what qualifies as a tactical shooter: ‚Äú[M]ainly you‚Äôre looking for the use of: realistic constraints of player movement; realistically simulated ballistics and accuracy; squad based or multiple approach/style accessibility; and a low tolerance or low health realistic damage model. Basically, you usually move slower than most shooters, your accuracy is much lower and bullets drop over a distance, you usually have a squad to command, and all of you only being able to take two or three shots before dying.‚Äù Tactical shooters are designed for realism. It is not unusual for players to be killed with a single bullet, and thus players must be more cautious than in other shooter games. The emphasis is on realistic modeling of weapons, and power-ups are often more limited than in other action games. This restrains the individual heroism seen in other shooter games, and thus tactics become more important.Fudge, James, Rainbow Six 3 to GameCube (GCN) GameSpy (April 8, 2004), Retrieved on February 7, 2008Tamte, Peter Close Combat: First to Fight ‚Äì Vol #3 (PC) GameSpy (November 4, 2004) Retrieved on February 7, 2008Special Forces Pack Released IGN (February 20, 2003) Retrieved on February 7, 2008 Overall, the style of play is typically slower than other action games, due to the significantly more punishing gameplay. Jumping techniques are sometimes de-emphasized in order to promote realism, with some games going so far as to omit a jump button. In contrast to games that emphasize running and shooting, tactical shooters require more caution and patience (making use of cover and avoiding being caught in the open), plus tactical shooters are usually designed so that shooting becomes inaccurate while running which increasing accuracy for crouching or prone stances. Players often have the choice of shooting from the hip (\\"hippie\\") which is less accurate but gives a wider view of the area, or using the scope/iron sights for better zoom-in accuracy but at the penalty of restricted view. Some tactical shooters such as the InfiltrationMod for Unreal Tournament even lack the crosshair seen in other first-person shooters, in order to achieve a high degree of realism. Many tactical shooters make use of group-based combat, where the player character is supported by other teammates. While early tactical shooters had simple computer-controlled teammates who offered support fire, the artificial intelligence in later games has evolved with more complex teammate responses such as cover-fire mechanics. In games with a sufficiently robust artificial intelligence, the player character is able to issue commands to other computer-controlled characters. Some games in the genre allow players to plan their team's movements before a mission, which the artificial intelligence then follows. Many games also offer a multiplayer online play, allowing human players to strategize and coordinate via a headset. Team-based tactics are emphasized more than other shooter games, and thus accurate aiming and quick reflexes are not always sufficient for victory. The level design usually reflects the game's setting. For example, the player may play the role of SWAT police fighting terrorists or other criminals, or may engage in military combat in real world conflicts as either battlefield soldiers or special forces commandos. Some games take place in entirely fictional universes, and incorporate elements of science fiction. Each level will have different objectives. Although some levels may simply require that the player defeat their enemy, other levels may challenge the player with objectives such as escorting a VIP safely to a specific location or planting a demolition charge on a target. Levels are often designed with check points or alternate routes. As \\"run and gun\\" assaults are often met with heavy resistance, it becomes important to exploit a superior position and/or take the enemy by surprise and even evading them entirely. Weapons Tactical shooters often feature a wide variety of weapons modeled upon actual firearms, being more realistic than run-and-gun shooters. For instance, the Brothers in Arms series is unique in that, since the game takes place in World War II, the development team Gearbox Software made sure to actually portray the weapon accurately by adding realistic recoil, motion blur and the feeling of being suppressed. They did this by actually testing the weapons themselves and hiring military consultants in the development. April 7, 2005 However, simulating actual combat is often sacrificed in favor of balance as well as playability. There are often considerable modifications to in-game weapons and ballistics from their real-life counterparts in order to ensure balance in multiplayer. For instance Counter-Strike and other games allow the player to survive multiple bullet hits to the torso (ignoring the bullet resistance of different types of ballistic vests) and even more to the legs (rarely armored in real-life), while registering an automatic kill for melee hits to the back (whether punches or knife stabs) and \\"headshots\\" (including a pistol shot to the back of the head even if the target is wearing a combat helmet). In contrast to run and gun shooters such as Quake which allow players to carry full arsenals, tactical shooters place considerable restrictions on what players may be equipped with, so players have to carefully select weapons according to the situation and/or role in their team. Half-Life: Counter-Strike's system of allowing a primary weapon (assault rifle, shotgun, submachine gun, sniper rifle, or light machine gun) and a secondary weapon (pistol, shotgun) has been followed by other shooters like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Wielding or carrying heavier weapons such as sniper rifles and machine guns often incurs a movement penalty over lighter weapons like submachine guns and pistols. Players often find loopholes in this system, such as in Half-Life: Counter- Strike where they would switch their firearm to a knife in order to run faster. Akimbo (Dual wielding) of pistols and submachine guns , despite being ineffective and inaccurate in real life, is frequently featured in tactical shooters likely as a homage to films. The Desert Eagle, despite its heavy weight, recoil, and limited magazine capability making it unsuitable for actual military and special forces applications, is frequently found in many tactical shooters as a high-powered handgun option. Numerous fictional depictions of the Soviet/Russian armed forces such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare show them armed with 7.62x39mm AK variants (AK-47 or AKM) as their standard-issue assault rifles, a long-standing anachronism thanks to the AK-47's iconic status, despite the Soviets having actually replaced them with the 5.45x39mm AK-74 in the 1970s.Seabrook, Andrea (26 November 2006) \\"AK-47: The Weapon Changed the Face of War\\". NPR Weekend Edition Sunday. Examples of these elements are in Counter-Strike and the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series.http://world.guns.ru/handguns/hg/isr/desert-eagle-e.html =Explosives= Due to the problem of grenade spamming, the effect of explosions are often toned down and/or only 1‚Äì2 grenades are allowed to be carried. Cooking a grenade by releasing the lever to partially burn the fuse before throwing it, to make it harder for an opponent to catch it or run away, is discouraged in real-life since fuses are imprecise; nonetheless, this is an extremely common \\"Hollywood tactic\\" in video games or movies. In first-person shooter video games of the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, such as Quake and Unreal Tournament, the \\"rocket launcher\\" which fires dumbfire/unguided missiles was one of the most prominent multiplayer weapons which largely overshadowed the other weapons available to the player. This was because the rocket launcher had a quick reload, the rocket traveled fast, the warhead had a devastating splash damage which could severely injure or kill when the missile detonated upon a wall/floor/ceiling near the target player, and the blast force could propel and disorient the target. Experienced gamers could take advantage of the blast (and risk some injury) by rocket jumping. The Rocket Arena mod was created, which focused upon the use of the rocket launcher as the primary weapon. The rocket launcher remained in the sequels but the attributes were toned down somewhat. Lastly, players could carry dozens of rockets which encourages their profligate use. By contrast, shooters such as Call of Duty do not use the term \\"rocket launcher\\". While they have similar concept weapons, these are modeled after real-life equivalents such as the rocket-propelled grenade, Bazooka, and FIM-92 Stinger, several with specific applications against vehicles rather than personnel. These rocket weapons also have very scarce ammo and long reload times, reflecting the limited situations that they are utilized as well as discouraging reckless player usage. History Features now common to the tactical shooters genre appeared as early as 1987, with Airborne Ranger by Microprose. Computer Gaming World compared it to the earlier arcade game Commando (a more typical action shooter of the period), but commented that it was \\"deeper and more versatile\\". The game featured a limited inventory which had to be carefully managed, a variety of mission types which often promoted guile over violence, and the impetus to plan ahead and outmaneuver the enemy‚Äîall of which are features common in the tactical shooter genre as a whole. Airborne Ranger was followed by Special Forces in 1991, also by Microprose, which first introduced squad mechanics to the genre. The next technical breakthrough came in 1993 with the release of SEAL Team by Electronic Arts. This game already offered many of the basic features associated with the genre, including utilizing support elements and vehicular units, and running a real-time simulated environment (with 3D Vector graphics) that reacts to the player's actions. Experiments in tactical shooter design were sparse over the next five years, and included Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri, released in 1996‚Äîone of first 3D-rendered games with squad-oriented gameplay. The first major successes of the genre came in 1998, with games such as Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon, which are credited for defining and refining the genre. Another key title was Delta Force, which emphasized real-world weaponry and quick kills. Other influences on the genre included games such as the SOCOM series, as well as the SWAT series - a spin- off from the Police Quest series of adventure games. Rainbow Six has been credited as a revolutionary game, which defined the conventions of the genre. The game was inspired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation Hostage Rescue Team, and was designed to replicate a team of specialists performing a skilled operation. The game was designed to emphasize strategy in a way that would be fun for players without the best reflexes. The series has since become a benchmark for the genre in terms of detail and accuracy. Some of the most notable tactical shooters have been total conversion mods of first person shooter titles which have been released for free. Infiltration, a total conversion of Unreal Tournament (1999), has been described as \\"turning Unreal Tournament's wild cartoon action into a harrowing game of cat and mouse\\". Infiltration has been noted for detailed aiming system including hip (\\"hippie\\") and scope/iron fire while lacking a crosshair, different movement stances (running, walking, crouching, and prone, leaning around corners), and a customizable loadout system that allows configuration of weapons (including attachments) with a weight penalty. Half-Life: Counter-Strike (2000), a mod of Half-Life (1998), was the most popular multiplayer game of its era despite the release of first-person shooters with more advanced graphics engines such as Unreal Tournament 2003. One of the developers of the Half-Life expansions was Gearbox Software, who in 2005 released the game Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 that further defined the genre. March 18, 2005 March 15, 2005 Critics praised the game for not only adding realism to its first-person shooter gameplay, but also in its unique tactical gameplay that allows players to command soldiers and teams during combat. Decline Since the late 2000s, contemporary shooters such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare have proven more popular than futuristic first-person shooters such as Quake and Unreal, although the field of true tactical shooters has been largely neglected by developers since the mid-to-late 2000s. Even traditionally tactical shooter series like Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon have seen their sequels drift away from tactical realism towards cinematic action centered themes, as can be witnessed by, e.g., contemporary Rainbow Six sequels which completely do away with the series' iconic pre-action planning stage (last encountered in Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield), or the overly futuristic settings of Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, which provides players with invisibility cloaks and shoulder-mounted anti-tank rockets while failing to adhere to simple tactical realism paradigms like one-shot-one-kill. VBS2 (and its successor VBS3) is a military tactical shooter simulation used for dismounted infantry training by the USMC, the US Army, and a number of the NATO armed forces. Its new Pointman user interface combines head tracking, a motion-sensitive gamepad and sliding foot pedals to increase the precision and level of control over one's avatar, enabling users to more realistically aim their weapon and practice muzzle discipline, to take measured steps when moving around obstacles or cover, and to continuously control their postural height to make better use of cover and concealment. Resurgence With the release of Arma 3 and later games like OWI's Squad, Tripwire's Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, and NWI's Insurgency: Sandstorm by the early to late 2010s, the genre continues to enjoy a fairly large following as more and more games are released with tactical elements, such as magazine dropping and one-shot-one-kill paradigms. Casual games like Rainbow Six: Siege and Battlefield V have also demonstrated 'back to roots' philosophies, such as the removal of regenerative health and '3d spotting' in the latter.

The population was 542 at the 2010 census. History Construction of the town started in 1920 and was completed by 1924 by the British Crown Rayon Company, a rayon manufacturer later known as American Viscose Corporation, for the workers of its Lewistown plant. The plant was opened in 1921 and was located across the Juniata River from Lewistown, on the same side as Juniata Terrace. It employed up to 5,000 workers and was closed in 1972 following flooding and damage from Tropical Storm Agnes. The town was constructed on a ridge overlooking the Juniata River to the east and the Lewistown Railroad Station to the north, about one and a half miles from downtown Lewistown. Two hundred fifty nearly identical brick townhouses were built along three streets, each about 500 yards long, which were crossed by four shorter streets. Early renters were all company employees and paid $1 a month in rent out of the standard factory worker's 15-cents-an- hour pay. With solid brick construction, electricity, and running water, the apartments were luxurious for the time. Each home had three bedrooms and a bathroom on the top floor. A front porch, living room and a kitchen/dining room formed the ground floor. There was also a basement and a backyard. There are few other buildings in the borough. Juniata Terrace School operated from the 1920s to 1976 when it was sold to the borough for $1. The Lewistown Christian and Missionary Alliance Church was constructed in the 1950s. One building housed the company grocery store and drugstore until it was converted into Wilson‚Äôs Meats and Grocery in 1965. During the 1950s, American Viscose sold the homes to the tenants for $2,800. The borough was incorporated in 1967. Twenty-two houses were destroyed by a fire in 2014.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (7.14%) is water. History Kistler, Pennsylvania is one of the United States' lesser known Company Towns. A Company Town is a settlement built and operated by a single business enterprise.Garner, John. The Company Town; Architecture and Society in the Early Industrial Age. Oxford University Press. 1992 Most company towns were established between 1880 and 1930 during the early industrial age. See list of company towns. Kistler was initially established to meet the needs of a large manufacturing plant by providing comfortable homes for its workmen within close proximity of the factory.Nolen, John. New Towns for Old (1927) Reprinted by University of Massachusetts Press, Amherst 2005 pp. 66-74. The town was built and owned by the Mount Union Refractories Company (MURC), a large brick making plant originally located at the foot of Mount Union, Pennsylvania. The MURC sought to design and implement an industrial village which provided the best home and surrounding environment for its employees, in the hope that this would achieve the highest possible working efficiency. In order to successfully accomplish this goal, the company appointed distinguished town planner John Nolen to design a model company town. John Nolen was a prominent planner of his time, producing nearly four hundred planning projects, with more than 25 of those company towns.Crawford, Margaret. The \\"New\\" Company Town. Perspecta, Vol. 30, Settlement Patterns (1999), pp. 48-57 Published by: The MIT Press on behalf of Perspecta. Nolen published New Towns for Old in 1927, which carefully outlines in detail the planning precautions taken in the towns‚Äô design and also includes illustrations of Kistler‚Äôs planned layout.  Development  Juniata River as seen from Kistler 1918 saw the construction of the industrial village. At this stage, MURC employed some seven hundred employees. The town of Kistler was located on the East side of the Juniata River, one and half miles east from the Refractories site. MURC acquired a sufficient land size of about sixty acres on the opposite side of the river from the works, in order to reduce the potential spread of dust, dirt and noise. The site of the planned town was of triangular in shape, bordered by the Juniata River, the Pennsylvania Railroad Topography and pre existing agricultural land.  Town Layout  Although there was no definite axis in John Nolen‚Äôs design, the centre point of the plan was said to be the major recreational facility, ‚ÄòKistler Green‚Äô. These well planned open spaces provided recreational areas for all residents. Park Road and Nolen Street were the two arterials leading into the development from the south, while running parallel to the railway is State Street. Nolen‚Äôs original plan included provisions for a proposed train station.  Street Design  There were two major street widths in the design of Kistler. The forty foot design allowed for eighteen foot of road and twenty-two feet of sidewalk and planting space. In contrast the seventy foot street allowed for two lanes with a central twenty-two foot parking strip. The street widths played a pivotal role in allocating as much area to the lot owner as possible whilst avoiding street paving costs. In the early stages of the development while the streets would not have been prone to large volumes of traffic throughput they served a secondary purpose; play spaces for children.  Park Features  The large amount of open areas in Nolen‚Äôs design retained the natural woods which included willow, locust, sycamore, persimmon and black and white oak. The river embankment was to be reserved for parkland with the northern end comprising a playground and picnic facilities and the south a boat landing, athletic field, baseball diamond and a field house.  Housing design  The houses constructed for employees were built with varying character in detached or semi detached quadrangles. This was thought to bring some individuality among the residents and their houses and to generally provide the best surroundings for the employees and their families. Dwellings were built on block sizes of forty feet in width by one hundred feet in depth. Almost two hundred dwellings were built in total, with houses ranging from four to eight rooms in total and all houses including their own baths and porches.  Community wellbeing  The former volunteer fire company firehouse It was evident that Nolen and MURC gave considerable attention to the welfare of the citizens of Kistler. The design aspired to provide not only comfortable housing and surrounds but equally importantly it attempted to promote a sense of belonging and citizenship among the residents. John Nolen discusses the success of Kistler and its design in his book New Towns for Old (1927) when he states that ‚Äòthere are few places in this country where the problem of low cost housing, primarily for the unskilled worker has been better solved for the employer and employee alike.

The population was 405 at the 2000 census. The \\"Father of Pennsylvania Forestry\\", Dr. Joseph Rothrock was born in McVeytown on April 9, 1839. He was largely responsible for the acquisition of the lands that became Pennsylvania state parks and forests, including Rothrock State Forest. History The settlement of what is now McVeytown was begun by Samuel Holliday in 1755. But it wasn‚Äôt until 1762 that he settled in permanently and not until 1795 that the town of Waynesburg (present day McVeytown) was laid out. John McVey owned the land and was the founder of McVeytown. Samuel, Adam, John and William Holliday, and his two sisters, Elizabeth and Nancy, the latter of which would become the wife of Andrew Bratton, emigrated to the U.S. about 1745 and located on the ‚Äúmanor‚Äù of Lancaster County. They moved later to Conococheague in what is now Franklin County, and John removed to Path Valley, where he lived and died. Adam and William took up land at Hollidaysburg, and it was from him that the borough took its name. In early 1775, Samuel Holliday and Andrew Bratton, just after the New Purchase of the Indians, went out into that region in search for land to settle. After they made a decision on the land, they went to the land- office, at the time located in Philadelphia, and in 1775 received their warrants. Bratton was in what is now Bratton Township, and Holliday at what is now McVeytown and vicinity. Geography McVeytown is located at (40.497584, -77.740796).

There are plans for the New Jersey Transit to run through and reopen this station.New Jersey Transit. Njtransit.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-09. Most of this project however, is currently not funded. Only the MOS (Minimum Operable Segment) of the project is being built so far, from where the Eastern end of the Lackawanna Cut-Off separates from the former Lackawanna RR main line at Port Morris Jct. to Andover, New Jersey. The track Eastward from East Stroudsburg to Slateford Junction is still in service and used by the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad three times a week both to service a paper plant at Minisink Hills and interchange freight with Norfolk Southern at Slateford Jct. Heading west from East Stroudsburg, the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western (Lackawanna) double-track main line still has a usable single track through to Scranton. The Delaware Lackawanna Railroad provides local freight service over this segment, and passenger excursions from Steamtown, USA (located in Scranton) are run several times a year to East Stroudsburg and to the Delaware Water Gap. Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority Project Rail transportation plays an important part in the history of the borough and continues to have an impact today. The Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority is a bi-county creation of both Lackawanna County and Monroe County to oversee the use of common rail freight lines in northeastern Pennsylvania, including one formerly owned by Conrail running from Scranton, through East Stroudsburg towards New Jersey, and the New York City market.

In 1921, a boathouse and beach were constructed on the site of today's Lake Naomi Clubhouse. In 1938, a famous Pennsylvania Supreme Court case took place over who owned the water rights to Lake Naomi, as the surrounding lands were soon owned by many different parties. See Miller v. Lutheran Conference & Camp Ass'n, 331 Pa. 241 (Pa. 1938). In 1963, the Logan Steele family purchased surrounding the lake which eventually was turned into a resort community called the Lake Naomi Club. Logan Steel died in the 1980s and the club is now owned by its members and run by a board of governors. Lake Naomi Club today includes 1400 families who own property surrounding Lake Naomi. Lake Naomi itself is a lake with private beaches and marinas. The Club has a very active sailing organization, 3 pools including a 50-meter outdoor Olympic-sized pool with a scenic view of the lake, 18 tennis courts, and full service clubhouse. There is another community center that lies directly across from Timber Trails (a branch off Lake Naomi) that was completed and opened Memorial Day weekend of 2007 for all community members to enjoy. Across the street is Pinecrest Lake, another resort community. At some point Naomi Pines was renamed Pocono Pines. The main thoroughfare through the current Village of Pocono Pines is Route 940 on is the intersection of 'Old' 940, Route 940, and Route 423, where one can find one traffic light with one gas station and a few surrounding businesses.

The Pocono Manor Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The Building of Sullivan Trail On May 15-6, 1779, Van Cortland's 2nd New York Regiment, Spencer's 5th New Jersey Regiment, and Cilly's 1st New Hampshire Regiment arrived at Learns Tavern in Tannersville and began construction on the trail on May 17. Originally a mountain path, the road was under construction as a military road to assist with moving troops through the area for Sullivan's Expedition. The builders reached the Hungry Hill area on May 23, Tobyhanna Creek on the 24th, Locust Hill (now Locust Ridge) on May 30, and established Camp Fatigue on June 7. The road to the Wyoming Valley (Scran/Wilkes-Barre area) was completed on June 15. The Battle of Locust Ridge, 1784 In 1754, settlers from Connecticut (Yankees) claimed land in the Wyoming Valley, now the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area. The Charter of 1662 of King Charles II of England reads, \\"We, of Our abundant Grace, . . . have given, granted, and confirmed. . . unto the said Governor and Company. . . all that Part of Our Dominions in New-England . . . bounded on the East by . . . Narraganset-Bay, . . . on the North by the Line of the Massachusetts-Plantation; and on the South by the Sea; and in Longitude . . . From the said Narraganset-Bay on the East, to the South Sea on the West Part . . .\\". The South Sea is now called the Pacific Ocean. Thus, settlers in Connecticut felt they had claim to the land. Pennsylvania settlers (Pennamites) laid claim to the same land by right of a royal charter. Thirdly, the Iroquois claimed the land as theirs, as they had been living there before either group of settlers arrived. Unrest was largely minimal until 1769, when Connecticut established its first permanent settlement. The resulting conflicts were eventually dubbed the Pennamite‚ÄìYankee War. The Third Yankee- Pennamite War lasted from 1784-1794. In July 1784, Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council raised a militia to combat the Yankee occupations. Locust Hill, now known as Locust Ridge, was the site of an engagement on August 2, 1784 between Pennamite troops under the command of Colonel John Armstrong and Yankee troops under the command of Captain John Swift. Swift's men surrendered on August 8. Only one person died during the Battle of Locust Ridge, a man by the name of Jacob Everett. Industry in the 19th and 20th Centuries From 1896 through the 1940s, one large industry in the township was ice harvesting. Ice was harvest from Lake Naomi, Pocono Lake, Stillwater Lake, Anglewood Lake, and Brady's Lake. The ice was stored in icehouses and transported by the Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad to major cities. Another large industry was logging and lumbering. Charles Hauser built a sawmill in 1848, and Isaac Stauffer followed in 1863. Stauffer eventually purchased Hauser's operation, and through the accumulation of 4,500 acres of land, became known as the \\"King of the Poconos.\\" Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 8,554 people, 3,433 households, and 2,450 families residing in the township.

Eschenbach Cemetery The Eschenbach Cemetery was established between 1810-1830 as a private family cemetery. Andrew Eschenbach, Jr., born on December 25, 1745 to Andreas Eschenbach and Johanna Catharina Muntz, was one of the first permanent settlers in Tobyhanna Township. He and his wife, Susan Fink, moved to Tobyhanna Township in 1809. They had 10 children between 1780 and 1810, and had a large enough family that a cemetery became a necessity, as the infrastructure of the township was not sufficiently developed. It is possible that the location of the Eschenbach Cemetery was determined by an existing grave site. The Battle of Locust Ridge took place on August 2, 1784 as part of the Yankee-Pennamite Wars between Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Jacob Everett (of Pennsylvania) was the only person to lose his life in the battle. Although lacking firm documentation, lore handed down through generations suggests he is buried in what later became the Eschenbach Cemetery. The Eschenbach Cemetery headstones are local field stone and slate, which means the etchings have since worn away from natural weathering. While the location of who is buried at what grave site may forever be a mystery, it is known that the cemetery was the final resting place for Andrew and Susan. Hungry Hill Memorial The Hungry Hill memorial is a Revolutionary War memorial and grave site of an unknown soldier. Van Cortlandt's 2nd New York and Spencer's 5th New Jersey regiments camped nearby while they changed a wilderness trail into a military road. This path, known now as Sullivan Trail, paved the way for the Sullivan Expedition in 1779. General John Sullivan and Brigadier General James Clinton, who led the expedition, pushed through the area known as the Great Swamp, as they pursued a scorched earth campaign against the Iroquois. Today, the path of the original Sullivan Road within Tobyhanna Township is virtually intact. Keiper Park Keiper Park is located in the center of Tobyhanna Township. The park contains a softball field, concession stand, and a playground. The area is largely grassy fields.

History The villages that have comprised Lower Providence Township since the early eighteenth century include Evansburg, Shannonville (now called Audubon), Eagleville, and Providence Square. Lower Providence Township is currently bounded on the west by Upper Providence Township, on the northeast by Perkiomen and Worcester townships, on the southeast by West Norriton Township, and on the south by the Schuylkill River. The area of the township is . Red shale predominates in the soils of this part of Montgomery County. Many years ago, lead mines were worked near Perkiomen Creek at Oaks, Pennsylvania, but did not generate profits. The mines were opened in 1800 and were being operated in 1818 by a Mr. Wetherell. The discovery of copper followed that of lead, and in January, 1848, the Perkiomen Mining Association was formed. Its land cost about $10,000; much costly machinery was placed in position and a shaft was dug. Many thousands of tons of copper were unearthed over the years until deposits were exhausted. Shannonville was named after a large, influential family in 1823, when a post office was established there. Jack's tavern‚Äîthe present-day Audubon Inn‚Äîwas opened here as well. Mr. Shannon was a prosperous pig farmer and hence the town gained the nickname \\"Hogtown\\". Present-day Audubon was christened in 1899 in honor of early-19th century resident John James Audubon, who resided at Mill Grove, located at the intersection of Audubon and Pawlings Roads. Local landmarks Mill Grove Fatland Hall Audubon lies on the north side of the Schuylkill River across from Valley Forge National Historical Park, and is situated about away from King of Prussia, one of the largest malls in the United States. Local landmarks include: Mill Grove Built in 1762 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Mill Grove was the first American home of the renowned artist, author and naturalist John James Audubon. Between 1803 and 1806 Mill Grove and its surrounding fields and woodlands first inspired young Audubon's passion for painting and drawing birds. Today, the estate remains largely as Audubon found it. It serves as an educational center of the National Audubon Society, dedicated to connecting people with nature. A haven for birds and wildlife, the property boasts more than of trails and stunning views of Perkiomen Creek. The historic three-story stone farmhouse contains a museum displaying original Audubon prints, oil painting, and Audubon memorabilia. Several years later, discouraged by disputes with partners and the failure of the lead mine on the property, Audubon sold Mill Grove. He married the daughter of a neighboring landowner, and moved to Kentucky to seek his fortune as a frontier merchant. Mill Grove later became the property of Samuel Wetherill 3rd of Philadelphia, who purchased the property in 1813. It remained in that family for 138 years, when Herbert J. Wetherill sold it in 1951 to Montgomery County. In April 2003 the National Audubon Society and Montgomery County signed an agreement creating the Mill Grove Audubon Center. The center is managed by Audubon Pennsylvania, the state office of the National Audubon Society.https://web.archive.org/web/20080527150453/http://pa.audubon.org/centers_mill_grove.html Walnut Hill (Pawlings Farm) The land known as the Perkiomen Peninsula, and particularly the Pawling Farm, played an essential role in the Valley Forge winter encampment of 1777‚Äì1778. It provided strategic protection for the camp; it was the site of the newly organized Commissary function that saved the Continental Army from starvation; and it was the ultimate site of the encampment itself before the army marched on to victory at Monmouth. Today the peninsula is a mix of habitats‚Äîopen meadow, riparian and upland forest, wetlands and extensive vernal ponds. This is why the Pawling Farm lands provide the best wildlife habitat in the entire park. The park's unpaved River Trail runs from the Pawling Bridge to Betzwood, and is a favorite of local residents. The paved Schuylkill River Trail runs along the northern edge of the Pawling Farm. Located on the south side of Apple Valley Lane is a reconstructed stone wall (commissioned by David Lapps and Eileen Moran) from one of the original structures that some of the troops stayed in during the winter of 1777-1778. Schuylkill River Trail multiuse trail that runs from Philadelphia to Oaks. It was built on the Pennsylvania Railroad right-of- way and parallels the scenic Schuylkill River as it passes through various townships and boroughs. The trail is a popular destination for biking, rollerblading, jogging, and walking. It is recognized as a National Recreation Trail by the U.S. Department of Interior's National Trails System. Trailheads include Betzwood Park (parking/restrooms), Pawlings Road (parking), Mill Grove, and the Upper Providence Park (parking/restrooms) off Rt. 422 and Egypt Road in Oaks. Perkiomen Trail The scenic Perkiomen Trail runs through the Perkiomen Creek Valley from its junction with the Schuylkill River Trail at Oaks, Upper Providence Township, to Green Lane Park, the largest county park. Most of the trail is a -wide cinder or stone aggregate (unpaved) surface with grass shoulders. Selected sections are paved where deemed appropriate. The trail is popular with walkers, joggers, bicyclists, cross-country skiers, and equestrians. The trail, developed on a former railroad bed, follows Perkiomen Creek and connects three county parks (Lower Perkiomen Valley Park, Central Perkiomen Valley Park, and Green Lane Park) and two county historic sites (Mill Grove at Audubon Wildlife Sanctuary and Pennypacker Mills). It passes directly through ten municipalities, making connections to numerous municipal parks and open spaces along the scenic waterway. It provides access to Valley Forge National Historical Park via its connection to the Schuylkill River Trail extension. Audubon Elementary School Located roughly in the center of Audubon, Audubon Elementary school was decommissioned from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. During that interim period, it housed the town library and a YMCA. In the mid-1990s, it underwent extensive renovation and was reopened to coincide with a large housing boom in the area. On the corner of its property, there is a tree that is at least two centuries old. In 2017, the Methacton School District Board of Education voted to close Audubon Elementary effective July 1, 2017.http://www.methacton.org/audubones/site/default.asphttp://www.pottsmerc.com/article/MP/20170222/NEWS/170229901 The Club at Shannondell (formerly General Washington Golf and Swim Club) Leased from Lower Providence Township by Shannondell Retirement Services around the year 2000, this 18-hole championship golf course features of golf from the tips for a par of 70. The course rating is 69.9, and it has a slope rating of 121 on ryegrass. General Washington golf course opened in 1965. The facility is currently paid for by the taxpayers of Lower Providence who pay a $417K per year mortgage while the township receives $100K per year and receives no profit share or tax revenue from the lease. I The facility also includes a family-oriented swim club and upscale family-dining restaurant. A poll membership in 2019 cost $900 for a family. Audubon Inn This large colonial-era structure is located at the corner of Park Avenue and Egypt Roads, and its proposed demolition was a subject of dispute in a 2005 township rezoning hearing. Currently it houses a law firm, though in the past it has served as a restaurant and inn. The Audubon Inn was bought by a local law firm, and the property behind it bought by CVS. Bud's Bar Originally the Shannonville Hotel, and having served for some time as the post office for the community, it is located on the opposite corner as the Audubon Inn and likely built around the same time.

Gannett Fleming, Inc. is an American-based engineering firm specializing in international planning, design, and construction management. The company was founded in 1915 as \\"Farley Gannett, Consulting Engineer\\". MOS-Commodore Semiconductor MOS Technology operated a semiconductor design and fabrication business, operating from 1969 to 1976. Purchased by Commodore Business Machines (CBM) in 1976, the facility continued to manufacture chips under the MOS name. Eventually, the business division was renamed the Commodore Semiconductor Group (CSG). Commodore shut down operations at the site in 1992 and went bankrupt in 1994. GMT Microelectronics purchased the facility in 1995 and manufactured CMOS and other circuitry until the EPA shut the site down in 2001. It was put on EPA's National Priorities List in 1989. Leaks from an underground storage tank caused the local groundwater to become contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE) and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.  History  Oreland, as part of Springfield Township, was settled as one of William Penn's manors. In 1686, Thomas Fitzwater discovered vast lime deposits on his land in Oreland. He erected a kiln to process it, which by 1693 had attracted the attention of William Penn. Penn ordered a highway built from the port of the Delaware River to the kiln. Named Limekiln Pike, and still in existence today, it was one of the first roads in the area. These lime deposits and the ore deposits also found in the area gave Oreland its name. Mining and farming would dominate Oreland's economy until the 20th century, when Oreland transformed into a residential suburb of Philadelphia, as it remains today. The village of Oreland was not laid out until 1889 near the North Penn Railroad running along the east side of town (currently SEPTA's Lansdale/Doylestown Line). The Plymouth Railroad ran from Conshohocken to Oreland through Plymouth and Flourtown. The tracks were mostly removed in the 1980s. The path where the trains used to run begins northeast of the Oreland Station Apartments, next to Ehrenpfort Road, and runs southwest towards Flourtown. The actual tracks, which still connect to SEPTA's Lansdale/Doylestown Line, end near the corner of Montgomery Avenue and Lyster Road. The path continues all the way to Flourtown, although in the 1990s the path was cut at Oreland Mill Road by housing built on both sides. The remainder of the path today is used primarily by children, runners and bikers. A bronze tablet, installed in 1928, marks where Emlen House is located.

He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as \\"The Waltz King\\", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century. Some of Johann Strauss's most famous works include \\"The Blue Danube\\", \\"Kaiser-Walzer\\" (Emperor Waltz), \\"Tales from the Vienna Woods\\", and the \\"Tritsch-Tratsch- Polka\\". Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the best known. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well known as their brother. Spelling of name Although the name Strauss can be found in reference books frequently with \\"√ü\\" (Strau√ü), Strauss himself wrote his name with a long \\"s\\" and a round \\"s\\" (Strau≈øs), which was a replacement form for the Fraktur-√ü used in antique manuscripts. His family called him \\"Schani\\", derived from the Italian \\"Gianni\\", a diminutive of \\"Giovanni\\", the Italian equivalent of \\"Johann\\" (John). Early life His father, Johann Strauss I, in an etching from 1835 Strauss was born into a Catholic family in St Ulrich near Vienna (now a part of Neubau), Austria, on 25 October 1825, to the composer Johann Strauss I. His paternal great-grandfather was a Hungarian Jew ‚Äì a fact which the Nazis, who lionised Strauss's music as \\"so German\\", later tried to conceal. His father did not want him to become a musician but rather a banker. Nevertheless, Strauss Junior studied the violin secretly as a child with the first violinist of his father's orchestra, Franz Amon. When his father discovered his son secretly practising on a violin one day, he gave him a severe whipping, saying that he was going to beat the music out of the boy. It seems that rather than trying to avoid a Strauss rivalry, the elder Strauss only wanted his son to escape the rigours of a musician's life. It was only when the father abandoned his family for a mistress, , that the son was able to concentrate fully on a career as a composer with the support of his mother. Strauss studied counterpoint and harmony with theorist Professor Joachim Hoffmann, who owned a private music school. His talents were also recognized by composer Joseph Drechsler, who taught him exercises in harmony. It was during that time that he composed his only sacred work, the graduale ' (1844). His other violin teacher, Anton Kollmann, who was the ballet r√©p√©titeur of the Vienna Court Opera, also wrote excellent testimonials for him. Armed with these, he approached the Viennese authorities to apply for a license to perform. He initially formed his small orchestra where he recruited his members at the Zur Stadt Belgrad tavern, where musicians seeking work could be hired easily.  Debut as a composer  Johann Strauss in his younger years Johann Strauss I's influence over the local entertainment establishments meant that many of them were wary of offering the younger Strauss a contract for fear of angering the father. Strauss Jr. was able to persuade Dommayer's Casino in Hietzing, a suburb of Vienna, to allow him to perform. The elder Strauss, in anger at his son's disobedience, and at that of the proprietor, refused to ever play again at Dommayer's Casino, which had been the site of many of his earlier triumphs. Strauss made his debut at Dommayer's in October 1844, where he performed some of his first works, such as the waltzes \\"Sinngedichte\\", Op. 1 and \\"Gunstwerber\\", Op. 4 and the polka \\"Herzenslust\\", Op. 3. Critics and the press were unanimous in their praise for Strauss's music. A critic for Der Wanderer commented that \\"Strauss‚Äôs name will be worthily continued in his son; children and children‚Äôs children can look forward to the future, and three-quarter time will find a strong footing in him.\\" Strauss at the beginning of his career Despite the initial fanfare, Strauss found his early years as a composer difficult, but he soon won over audiences after accepting commissions to perform away from home. The first major appointment for the young composer was his award of the honorary position of \\"Kapellmeister of the 2nd Vienna Citizen's Regiment\\", which had been left vacant following Joseph Lanner's death two years before. Vienna was wracked by the revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire and the intense rivalry between father and son became much more apparent. Johann Jr. decided to side with the revolutionaries. It was a decision that was professionally disadvantageous, as the Austrian royalty twice denied him the much coveted 'KK Hofballmusikdirektor' position, which was first designated especially for Johann I in recognition of his musical contributions. Further, the younger Strauss was also arrested by the Viennese authorities for publicly playing \\"La Marseillaise\\", but was later acquitted. The elder Strauss remained loyal to the monarchy, and composed his \\"Radetzky March\\", Op. 228 (dedicated to the Habsburg field marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz), which would become one of his best-known compositions. When the elder Strauss died from scarlet fever in Vienna in 1849, the younger Strauss merged both their orchestras and engaged in further tours. Later, he also composed a number of patriotic marches dedicated to the Habsburg Emperor Franz Josef I, such as the \\"Kaiser Franz- Josef Marsch\\" Op. 67 and the \\"Kaiser Franz Josef Rettungs Jubel-Marsch\\" Op. 126, probably to ingratiate himself in the eyes of the new monarch, who ascended to the Austrian throne after the 1848 revolution.  Career advancements  Strauss Jr. eventually attained greater fame than his father and became one of the most popular waltz composers of the era, extensively touring Austria, Poland and Germany with his orchestra. He applied for the KK Hofballmusikdirektor (Music Director of the Royal Court Balls) position, which he finally attained in 1863, after being denied several times before for his frequent brushes with the local authorities. In 1853, due to constant mental and physical demands, Strauss suffered a nervous breakdown. He took a seven- week vacation in the countryside in the summer of that year on the advice of doctors. Johann's younger brother Josef was persuaded by his family to abandon his career as an engineer and take command of Johann's orchestra in the interim. In 1855, Strauss accepted commissions from the management of the Tsarskoye-Selo Railway Company of Saint Petersburg to play in Russia for the Vauxhall Pavilion at Pavlovsk in 1856. He would return to perform in Russia every year until 1865. In 1862, the 27-year-old Eduard Strauss officially joined the Strauss orchestra as another conductor, and he and his brother Josef would lead it until 1870. Later, in the 1870s, Strauss and his orchestra toured the United States, where he took part in the Boston Festival at the invitation of bandmaster Patrick Gilmore and was the lead conductor in a \\"Monster Concert\\" of over 1000 performers (see World's Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival), performing his \\"Blue Danube\\" waltz, amongst other pieces, to great acclaim. As was customary at the time, requests for personal mementos from celebrities were often in the form of a lock of hair. In the case of Strauss during his visit to America, his valet obliged by clipping Strauss' black Newfoundland dog and providing \\"authentic Strauss hair\\" to adoring female fans. However, on account of the high volume of demand, there grew a fear that the dog may be trimmed bald.Google Books.com \\"The Wicked Waltz and Other Scandalous Dances\\".

Marriages  Strauss married the singer Henrietta Treffz in 1862, and they remained together until her death in 1878. Six weeks after her death, Strauss married the actress Angelika Dittrich. Dittrich was not a fervent supporter of his music, and their differences in status and opinion, and especially her indiscretion, led him to seek a divorce. Strauss was not granted a decree of nullity by the Roman Catholic Church, and therefore changed religion and nationality, and became a citizen of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in January 1887. Strauss sought solace in his third wife Adele Deutsch, whom he married in August 1887. She encouraged his creative talent to flow once more in his later years, resulting in many famous compositions, such as the operettas Der Zigeunerbaron and Waldmeister, and the waltzes \\"Kaiser-Walzer\\" Op. 437, \\"Kaiser Jubil√§um\\" Op. 434, and \\"Klug Gretelein\\" Op. 462\\\\.  Musical rivals and admirers  Strauss and Johannes Brahms photographed in Vienna Although Strauss was the most sought-after composer of dance music in the latter half of the 19th century, stiff competition was present in the form of Karl Michael Ziehrer and √âmile Waldteufel; the latter held a commanding position in Paris. Phillip Fahrbach also denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the KK Hofballmusikdirektor when the latter first applied for the post. The German operetta composer Jacques Offenbach, who made his name in Paris, also posed a challenge to Strauss in the operetta field. Strauss was admired by other prominent composers: Richard Wagner once admitted that he liked the waltz \\"Wein, Weib und Gesang\\" Op. 333\\\\. Richard Strauss (unrelated to the Strauss family), when writing his Rosenkavalier waltzes, said in reference to Johann Strauss, \\"How could I forget the laughing genius of Vienna?\\" Johannes Brahms was a personal friend of Strauss; the latter dedicated his waltz \\"Seid umschlungen, Millionen!\\" (\\"Be Embraced, You Millions!\\"), Op. 443, to him. A story is told in biographies of both men that Strauss's wife Adele approached Brahms with a customary request that he autograph her fan. It was usual for the composer to inscribe a few measures of his best-known music, and then sign his name. Brahms, however, inscribed a few measures from the \\"Blue Danube\\", and then wrote beneath it: \\"Unfortunately, NOT by Johannes Brahms.\\"  Stage works  The most famous of Strauss' operettas are Die Fledermaus, Eine Nacht in Venedig, and Der Zigeunerbaron. There are many dance pieces drawn from themes of his operettas, such as \\"Cagliostro-Walzer\\" Op. 370 (from Cagliostro in Wien), \\"O Sch√∂ner Mai\\" Walzer Op. 375 (from Prinz Methusalem), \\"Rosen aus dem S√ºden\\" Walzer Op. 388 (from Das Spitzentuch der K√∂nigin), and \\"Kuss- Walzer\\" op. 400 (from Der lustige Krieg), that have survived obscurity and become well-known. Strauss also wrote an opera, Ritter P√°zm√°n, and was in the middle of composing a ballet, Aschenbr√∂del, when he died in 1899.  Death and legacy  Statue of the Waltz King in Stadtpark, Vienna Strauss was diagnosed with pleuropneumonia, and on 3 June 1899 he died in Vienna, at the age of 73. He was buried in the Zentralfriedhof. At the time of his death, he was still composing his ballet Aschenbr√∂del. As a result of the efforts by Clemens Krauss who performed a special all-Strauss programme in 1929 with the Vienna Philharmonic, Strauss's music is now regularly performed at the annual Vienna New Year's Concert. Distinguished Strauss interpreters include Willi Boskovsky,\\"Willi Boskovsky, 81, Waltz Violinist, Dies\\", The New York Times, 24 April 1991. who carried on the ' tradition of conducting with violin in hand, as was the Strauss family custom, as well as Herbert von Karajan, Carlos Kleiber, Lorin Maazel, Zubin Mehta and Riccardo Muti. In addition, the Wiener Johann Strauss Orchester, which was formed in 1966, pays tribute to the touring orchestras which once made the Strauss family so famous.Vienna Johann Strau√ü Orchestra In 1987 Dutch violinist and conductor Andr√© Rieu also created a Johann Strauss Orchestra. Eduard Strauss had surprisingly wound up the Strauss Orchestra on 13 February 1901 after concerts in 840 cities around the globe, and had pawned the instruments. The orchestra's last violins were destroyed in the firestorm of the Second World War. Most of the Strauss works that are performed today may once have existed in a slightly different form, as Eduard Strauss destroyed much of the original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna's Mariahilf district in 1907. Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact between himself and brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to destroy their works. The measure was intended to prevent the Strauss family's works from being claimed by another composer. This may also have been fueled by Strauss's rivalry with another of Vienna's popular waltz and march composers, Karl Michael Ziehrer. Two museums in Vienna are dedicated to Johann Strauss II. His residence in the Praterstrasse where he lived in the 1860s is now part of the Vienna Museum. The Strauss Museum is about the whole family with a focus on Johann Strauss II.  Portrayals in the media  Silhouette by Otto B√∂hler The lives of the Strauss dynasty members and their world-renowned craft of composing Viennese waltzes are also briefly documented in several television adaptations, such as The Strauss Family (1972), The Strauss Dynasty (1991) and Strauss, the King of 3/4 Time (1995). Many other films used his works and melodies, and several films have been based upon the life of the musician, the most famous of which is The Great Waltz (1938), remade in 1972. Alfred Hitchcock made a low-budget biographical film of Strauss in 1934 called Waltzes from Vienna. After a trip to Vienna, Walt Disney was inspired to create four feature films. One of those was The Waltz King, a loosely adapted biopic of Strauss, which aired as part of the Wonderful World of Disney in the U.S. in 1963. In Mikhail Bulgakov's 1940 (published 1967) novel, The Master and Margarita, Strauss conducts the orchestra during Satan's Great Ball at the invitation of Behemoth. On screen Strauss has been portrayed by Horst Buchholz, Fernand Gravet, Esmond Knight, Kerwin Mathews, Stephen McGann, and Stuart Wilson. A Corny Concerto (1943), a Warner Bros cartoon, features music that was composed by Strauss, and is a parody of Walt Disney's 1940 Fantasia. The 1950 animated short titled \\"Tom and Jerry in the Hollywood Bowl\\" from the series Tom and Jerry makes use of Strauss's overture of Die Fledermaus. Another 1953 animated short \\"Johann Mouse\\" from the series Tom and Jerry features a mouse mesmerised by the playing of several Strauss waltzes by Johann Strauss himself, and later, by Tom. The 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey features The Blue Danube.  Works  Notes  References   * * Further reading * G√§nzl, Kurt (2001). The Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre (3 Volumes).

Congregation Beth Hamedrosh, an Orthodox synagogue that had been situated in Overbrook Park since 1958, bought a property in Penn Wynne in 2000. Following the process of getting zoning permits and fundraising, groundbreaking for the new synagogue building was started in May 2006. A ceremonial ground breaking was held on June 11, 2006. Rabbis spoke, as did former Lower Merion Township Commissioner Lance Rogers, US Representative Jim Gerlach, and Pennsylvania Assemblyman Daylin Leach. The synagogue moved from its temporary location in Overbrook Park into the new site at 200 Haverford Road upon the completion of the building on May 31, 2007. The first weekday services were held on the evening of May 31. The sanctuary of the new building, now attached to the house originally on the property, was used for the inaugural Shabbat services of June 1‚Äì2. A gala celebration event took place on Sunday, June 3, which featured the marching of Torah scrolls from the local Jewish Community Center along Haverford Road to the new site following speeches by rabbis, Commissioner Rogers, Assemblyman Leach, and the President of the synagogue, followed by food and dancing with live music in the sanctuary. Chabad of Penn Wynne, originally located in Rabbi Zalman Gerber's house, moved to a store front on Manoa Road across the street from the new synagogue building of Congregation Beth Hamedrosh soon after the latter moved in, but Chabad moved out three years later following the termination of the storefront lease at the end of May 2010. In the same Manoa Road storefront block, for a short time in 2007, there was also Just Chill, a kosher water ice and ice cream store. On June 5, 2010, Chabad of Penn Wynne began to hold Shabbat services at the Family Hall of the local Jewish Community Center. Chabad attracted many new Chabad families from out of town and many of them moved to Overbrook Park. Chabad had to relocate due to the coronavirus pandemic and starting with Rosh Hashana in September, 2020, Chabad is now across City Line Avenue in Overbrook Park in the same shopping center that is home to New York Bagels and R&R; Produce and Fish. After 13 years with no synagogue, Overbrook Park again has a synagogue. The Jewish community on both sides of City Avenue, the border between Philadelphia and Montgomery County, are considered to be one unit and are connected by an eruv, a wire attached to the telephone and electric poles which allows religious Jews to carry things on Shabbat. In addition to the Orthodox Jewish amenities, Penn Wynne is home to the Kaiserman branch of the Jewish Community Center. Penn Wynne Civic Association The Penn Wynne Civic Association (\\"PWCA\\") is dedicated to serving Penn Wynne residents. The organization defines the boundaries of Penn Wynne as the Delaware County line to the west, Remington Road to the north, Lancaster Avenue to the east and City Avenue to the south.Penn Wynne Civic Association Website About Us. The PWCA is a community organization, not a political organization. The PWCA's goal is to remain neutral on political matters. However, the PWCA has on occasion taken up community causes that have broad support. For example, in the past, the PWCA has opposed Lankenau Hospital's proposed access route through Manoa Road and has been active in promoting public safety in the Penn Wynne community. The PWCA holds an annual Fourth of July parade in the neighborhood. The parade route goes through the Penn Wynne area before ending at the Penn Wynne Elementary School. When the parade ends, the PWCA hosts a Fourth of July celebration, where games are provided for children in the neighborhood, food is sold, and awards are given to community leaders. In addition to the annual Fourth of July parade, the PWCA holds an annual meeting in October, where the PWCA usually provides a forum for officials running for elective office. The PWCA holds its monthly board meetings every first Thursday of the month at 7:30 pm at the Penn Wynne Library on Overbrook Parkway. Penn Wynne Green Penn Wynne Green was created by residents of the Penn Wynne neighborhood. It is an organization that promotes conservation and living a \\"green\\" lifestyle.

As of the 2010 census, the township population was 9,139, which represents a 28.8% increase from the 2000 total of 7,093 residents. Governmentally, it is a township of the second class, governed by a board of supervisors. It is part of the Perkiomen Valley School District. Perkiomen Township includes an abundance of history that goes as far back as to the first tribes who inhabited the area. This township started with the inhabitants of the Lenni-Lenape Tribe and progressed in many ways into what it is today.  History = First inhabitants  The Perkiomen Valley was first inhabited by the Lenni-Lenape Tribe and was declared part of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on March 4, 1681 by King Charles II of England. In 1720, the first copper mine in Pennsylvania was located near Schwenksville. The Perkiomen Valley provided the colonists and the Native Americans a rich place to grow crops and livestock, which would later feed the troops during the Revolutionary War. George Washington‚Äôs troops rested in the Perkiomen Valley in a place called Valley Forge on their way to defeat the British and gain their autonomy over the thirteen colonies. One of the famous men that lived in the Perkiomen Valley was John James Audubon, a French-American ornithologist noted for his paintings and drawings of birds. In 1784, Montgomery County was formed with land that was previously owned by the city of Philadelphia. Nearly a century later in 1879 Limerick Township was created and in 1886 the Skippack and Perkiomen Townships split into Skippack Township and Perkiomen Township. The Perkiomen Township later split into two different townships called Lower Perkiomen Township and Upper Perkiomen Township. Collegeville and Trappe are two towns in Montgomery County that were purchased by Ursinus College in 1869 and was later included in Upper Providence Township in 1896. In 1903, the Schwenksville Borough was incorporated into the Perkiomen Township. In the latest census that was taken in 1990, nearly 59,000 people lived in the Perkiomen Valley. Limerick Township contains the Nuclear Power Plant that produces electricity for the Perkiomen Valley and is owned by a company called PECO. Many businesses that are looking at expanding to the suburbs of Philadelphia look towards the Perkiomen Valley as it is one of the major areas that are rapidly developing into a powerhouse of the suburbs of Philadelphia. They are also moving to the Perkiomen Valley because the businesses are able to escape all of the problems that having a business in Philadelphia creates and they are able to attract more skilled workers to their companies allowing them to grow.  Early living styles  The Perkiomen Valley was once referred to as the ‚ÄúGoschenhoppen‚Äù, named after the Northern American people who referred to themselves as Lenape. The vast majority of settlers were German. They were of Lutheran and German reformed faith. Their language was used exclusively and eventually evolved today into what is now known as Pennsylvania Dutch. Many old roads ran through Perkiomen valley and were maintained as well as roads are today. The people that lived on the roads did all of the upkeep. Farming was one of the settler‚Äôs main ways of living until they discovered they could use their streams for operating mills. These mills were used for many different things such as gunpowder, mixing animal food, as well as cutting wood and graining flour. These mills provided the settlers with an easy way of production as well as a good source of income. The railroad was also a major transportation use. It went through many main places but ran along the Schuylkill River. Because of this major railroad, the cigar industry rose to success. This industry brought in an influx of workers, which resulted in a greater population. With more people came a more diverse civilization, as well as the construction of homes, stores, places of worship, and many more. This industry was appealing to both the artisan as well as the tradesmen, who took on the cigar business over farming.  Perkiomen Watershed Conservacy (PWC)  The Perkiomen Watershed Conservancy at 362-square miles is a part of the Schuylkill River watershed. A watershed is a drainage basin that collects surface water from other running bodies of water. The Perkiomen Watershed plays a part in the Perkiomen Valley by creating a water system for this area. Originally called the Perkiomen Valley Watershed Association, it was started in 1964 to help address these poor water conditions in the Perkiomen Creek. When PWC first started it was divided between public education activities, continuing data collection, efforts to advance the idea of state water quality standards and a required degree of treatment for wastes discharged to streams. A half of century later in the first meetings, the PWC has helped clean trash from creeks, this has helped in the preserve the Spring Mountain area, this has helped educate children and adults. This program taught people about our connection to nature, how to preserve and repair riparian areas along local creeks to help reduce erosion and improve water quality.

The settlement was founded in 1686. The population of Plymouth Meeting was 6,177 in the 2010 census. Plymouth Meeting is home to the Colonial School District, the recently renovated Plymouth Meeting Mall and several large office parks and shopping centers.

This interchange contributes to regional commerce and was a major driver for business and retail development. History The area was originally settled by members of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, who built the Plymouth Friends Meetinghouse in 1708. They sailed from Devonshire, England, on the ship Desire, arriving in Philadelphia on June 23, 1686. The settlement takes its name from the founders' hometown of Plymouth in Devon. During the Revolutionary War, in May 1778, the Plymouth Friends Meetinghouse served as a temporary military hospital. General George Washington, then at Valley Forge, learned that a British force intended to seize the area and cut off movement of the Continental Army. He sent Marquis de Lafayette and 2,100 troops to counter. They camped around the meetinghouse on the night before the May 19 Battle of Barren Hill. The next morning the British arrived with a massive force of 16,000, and tried to cut off any escape route. Lafayette instead took advantage of the Americans' knowledge of local roads, and escaped with minimal casualties. > Plymouth Meeting House is the name of a village situated at the intersection > of the Plymouth and Perkiomen turnpikes, on the township line.

Slave holding was condemned by the Society of Friends in 1754. Few slaves were held in Plymouth Township, and only one remained by 1830. The Maulsby and Corson families were early abolitionists, sheltering runaway slaves beginning in the 1810s and turning their properties into stations on the Underground Railroad.Hiram Corson, M.D. \\"The Plymouth Group,\\" The Abolitionists of Montgomery County, (Norristown, PA: Historical Society of Montgomery County, 1900), pp. 41-43. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 increased the penalties for giving assistance to an escaped slave to six months in prison and a $1,000 fine. It allowed slavecatchers to pursue a fugitive across state lines into every U.S. state and territory. Local resident George Corson was involved in hiding Jane Johnson, whose 1855 escape exposed a loophole in the federal law.Phil Lapsansky, \\"The Liberation of Jane Johnson,\\" The Library Company of Philadelphia, 2003. When the doors to local churches and schools were closed to Abolitionist speakers, Corson built Abolition Hall (1856) on his farm at Germantown and Butler Pikes. The hall could accommodate up to 200 people, and hosted speakers such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Lucretia Mott, Mrs. Stephen Foster and William Lloyd Garrison. In later years (1881-1895) Abolition Hall became the art studio of painter Thomas Hovenden. Married to George Corson's daughter, Helen (Corson) Hovenden, Hovenden was best known for painting realistic scenes taken out of American life as he experienced it in the farmlands of Plymouth Meeting. His depictions of everyday life during the Civil War seem like photographs rather than oil paintings. One of his most famous paintings,‚ÄúBreaking Home Ties,‚Äù (shown below) as well as several others, can be seen in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Hovenden succeeded Thomas Eakins as the principal painting instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1886 after the latter was forced to resign for inappropriate use of nude models. Growth continued for Plymouth Meeting during the 1900s which led to the advent of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the Plymouth Meeting Mall, high-rise and garden apartment complexes, industries and office buildings. What is now Germantown Pike was ordered laid out by the Provincial Government in 1687 as a \\"cart road\\" from Philadelphia to Plymouth Meeting. The actual road was finished in 1804, at a cost of $11,287. A road from Plymouth Meeting to Gwynedd appears to have been built in 1751. What is now Chemical Road, following Plymouth Creek, was opened in 1759 to provide access to a new gristmill. In the early 19th century the Hickorytown Hotel, on Germantown Pike opposite Hickory Road, was a prominent road house. Robert Kennedy, an officer in the Revolution, operated the inn in 1801. In 1806 it was kept by Frederick Dull and in 1825, Jacob Hart. In the beginning of the 19th century it was a training place for the 36th Regiment of the Pennsylvania Militia and the Second Battalion of Montgomery County. The Friendship Company for the Protection against Horse Stealing was organized there in 1807. Township elections were held there, and a post office was established there in May 1857. The Plymouth Meeting Post Office appears to have been established sometime prior to 1827. In 1754, Benjamin Davis received a license to keep an inn on Ridge Pike at Plymouth Creek. This inn, the Seven Stars, was shown on maps as early as 1759. The inn was demolished in 1975 to make way for the Midcounty Expressway. Early records indicate that one person was elected as \\"road supervisor\\" and tax collector. The roads were mostly dirt, and repair and maintenance was often auctioned off to the lowest bidder, usually a farmer who had large properties and kept many men and horses, and the smaller farmers worked on the roads for them. Tax records show that many taxpayers worked out their taxes on the roads. From 1846 to 1854 the road supervisor was paid one dollar per day for his work as supervisor and collector of taxes. Men working on the roads received $.80 per day and boys received $.40 per day. For the use of a double team of horses with a wagon or cart, one was paid $1.75 per day. Among early industries in Plymouth Township was the Hickorytown Forge operated by the Wood family, and a forerunner of the present Alan Wood Steel Company. The name Plymouth Furnace appears in the records about 1847 and was engaged in the manufacture of nails. In 1863, a company named Plymouth Iron Company was organized with a capital of $30,000.00. The company purchased the property of Colwell Furnace, which is located just west of the present Colwell Lane adjoining the development known as Farmview Village. The Plymouth Railroad was built in 1836 to serve some 20 lime kilns operating along the route between Conshohocken and Cold Point. In 1870, the line was acquired by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and was rebuilt and extended to Oreland at a junction with the North Penn Railroad. The line was abandoned by the 1970s. Prior to the building of the Plymouth Railroad, the Philadelphia, Germantown, and Norristown Railroad was built along the Schuylkill River through Plymouth Township and commenced operation in 1835. For most of its history, this railroad was part of the Reading Railroad system. Today these tracks are SEPTA's Manayunk Norristown passenger train line. The Schuylkill Valley Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad was built parallel to the Reading Railroad tracks along the Schuylkill River, opening for service in 1884. Rail service ended in the 1970s and the track-bed is now occupied by the multi-use (pedestrian and bicycle) Schuylkill River Trail. The Trenton Cutoff branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad was built in 1891. The Trenton Cutoff is now owned by Norfolk Southern and is known as the Morrisville Line. Later in the 1890s electric trolley lines were built through Plymouth Meeting. The trolleys that ran on the shoulder of Germantown Pike connected Chestnut Hill and Norristown. The trolley on the shoulder of Butler Pike was a short shuttle known as the Harmanville Dinkey, running between Germantown Pike and Ridge Pike (0.7 miles). Dinkey passengers transferred to Conshohocken-bound trolleys at the corner of Ridge Pike and Butler Pike. For most of their existence the trolley lines were operated by the Reading Transit & Light Company (no relation to the Reading Railroad). In addition to passengers, during the 1910s freight was handled by the RT&L; trolleys; an abandoned wooden track-side freight platform near the northwest corner of Germantown Pike and Butler Pike survived into the 1950s. The Harmanville Dinkey was replaced with buses in 1927. The Germantown Pike trolleys ceased operation in December 1931. The trolley that ran from Norristown to Conshohocken through Black Horse, Seven Stars and Harmanville was replaced with buses in September 1933.Harry Foesig, Trolleys of Montgomery County Pennsylvania, 1968, ASIN: B0029HAHZU (no ISBN) The roadside trolley tracks were quickly torn up and the adjacent two-lane Ridge Pike, and Butler Pike south of Ridge Pike, were widened to accommodate ever-increasing motor vehicle traffic. The first school in the township was established by the Plymouth Meeting Society of Friends in 1780, although some records indicate an earlier school. A school was established at Cold Point in 1821. Public schools, established under the system authorized by the legislature in 1834, included Cold Point School, Plymouth Valley School, the Eight Square school, the Sandy Hill school and the North Star school. Plymouth became a township of the first class in January 1922. Isaac J. Sheppard became township secretary from that time until his retirement in 1952. Under the new form of government the board changed from \\"road supervisors\\" to \\"Township Commissioners\\". In 1925, the Board of Health was organized. Plumbing inspection began in 1934. In 1939, Plymouth adopted a \\"modern\\" zoning ordinance. A building code ordinance was adopted. In 1947, the first subdivision ordinance was adopted. In 1952, the Township Planning Commission was created, and a Recreation Committee was established to study recreation needs. Plymouth Township adopted a Home Rule Charter in 1972. This allows a municipality to take any governmental or administrative actions it requires, unless such actions are prohibited by general laws of the Commonwealth. From as early as 1688, lime kilns have been a large, productive and profitable business there. The Plymouth Meeting Historic District, Alan West Corson Homestead, Plymouth Friends Meetinghouse, and Hovenden House, Barn and Abolition Hall were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

Skippack is a census- designated place (CDP) in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 3,758 at the 2010 census. History In 1683, thirteen families from the lower Rhine River arrived at Philadelphia aboard the Concord, on October 6, 1683. These families were primarily linen weavers, but also knew how to farm too. These first German immigrants gave up the homeland of Germany because of religious persecution they experienced as Mennonite and Quakers from the Catholic and Reformed Churches. Upon arriving at Philadelphia, the families were greeted by the representative of the Frankfort Land Company, a highly educated German lawyer, Franz Daniel Pastorius, charged with the authority to make land transactions with the thirteen families. After inspecting different areas of the vicinity of Philadelphia, the families settled on the land that was to become the villages of Germantown, Summerhousen, Crefeld, and Germantownship. Within approximately twenty years German farmers in the Electorate of the Palatinate began to immigrate to Philadelphia in such numbers that Benjamin Franklin wrote an editorial fearing that Philadelphia would become a German-speaking colony. As the Germantown area became settled, there was a departure of some of the original families of Germantown to an area twenty miles west of Philadelphia further up the Schuylkill, purchasing land from the father in-law of Herman op Den graefe, (an original settler of Germantown) that earlier purchased approximately seven thousand acres. These German Mennonites brought the linen making business to the community, along with their farming skills to the vicinity of Perkiomen Creek and Skippack Creek to a point where travel by boat became impossible because of shallow water. This point is where Skippack Creek crosses Skippack Pike in Skippack Township. The origin of the name \\"Skippack\\" came from early German settlers, they originally spelled it Schippach, named after a town of the same name in the Bayern region of Germany South East of Frankfurt. Skippack Township was originally named \\"Van Bebber's Township\\" after Matthias Van Bebber, to whom the original land patent was issued in 1702 by William Penn. The name later changed to \\"Skippack and Perkiomen Township\\" until the township was split into two townships. Skippack Township is home to one of the oldest homes still standing in the area, the Indenhofen (De Haven) Farmstead, built in circa 1720. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, as the Warren Z. Cole House. Originally, the Indenhofen Farm consisted of . In 1795, Jacob Reiff bought a property at Store Road and Skippack Pike and opened a general merchandise store. In 1800, the store was sold to Jacob Sorver, who ran it until 1854. A post office was established in 1827 with weekly mail delivery by the Kutztown stagecoach. The Souderton, Skippack & Fairview Electric Railway Co. was formed in 1901 to provide trolley service from Norristown, through Trooper and Worcester to Souderton. Trolley service to Skippack began in 1908. Harleysville was reached in 1912; the line to Souderton was never completed. The railway was renamed the Montgomery County Rapid Transit Company and later the Montgomery Transit Company. In 1923, its name was changed once again to the Skippack & Perkiomen Transit Company. The \\"Wogglebug\\" trolleys ran on the south shoulder of Skippack Pike through the village (a sidewalk was on the north side). Buses replaced the trolleys in 1925. In 1940 the bus service ended.

He was famous for his waltzes, and he popularized them alongside Joseph Lanner, thereby setting the foundations for his sons to carry on his musical dynasty. He is best known for his composition of the Radetzky March (named after Joseph Radetzky von Radetz). Life and work Strauss was born in Leopoldstadt (now in Vienna). Strauss's parents, Franz Borgias Strauss (October 10, 1764 ‚Äì April 5, 1816) and Barbara Dollmann (December 3, 1770 ‚Äì August 28, 1811), were innkeepers (). He was born a Roman Catholic. His mother died of 'creeping fever' when he was seven and five years later his father drowned, possibly as a result of suicide, in the Danube river. Strauss' guardian, the tailor Anton M√ºller, placed him as an apprentice to the bookbinder, Johann Lichtscheidl; Strauss took lessons in the violin and viola in addition to fulfilling his apprenticeship.Martin Bjelik: \\"Biographien von Johann Strau√ü Vater und Sohn\\", Wiener Institut f√ºr Strauss-Forschung Norbert Rubey: Johann Strauss (Vater) ‚Äî \\"ein Musiker von Gottes Gnaden\\"? , University of Vienna Contrary to a story later told by his son Johann II, Strauss successfully completed his bookbinder apprenticeship in 1822. He also studied music with Johann Polischansky during his apprenticeship and eventually managed to secure a place in a local orchestra, headed by Michael Pamer. Strauss left the orchestra to join a popular string quartet known as the Lanner Quartet, formed by his would-be rivals Joseph Lanner and the Drahanek brothers, Karl and Johann. This string quartet playing Viennese Waltzes and rustic German dances expanded into a small string orchestra in 1824. Strauss became deputy conductor of the orchestra to assist Lanner in commissions after it became so popular during the Fasching of 1824 and Strauss was soon placed in command of a second smaller orchestra which was formed as a result of the success of the parent orchestra. In 1825, he decided to form his own band and began to write music (chiefly, dance music) for it to play after he realized that he could also possibly emulate the success of Lanner in addition to putting an end to his financial struggles. By so doing, he would have made Lanner a serious rival although the rivalry did not entail hostile consequences as the musical competition was very productive for the development of the waltz as well as other dance music in Vienna. He soon became one of the best-known and well loved dance composers in Vienna. During the carnival of 1826, Strauss inaugurated his long line of triumphs by introducing his band to the public of Vienna at the in the suburb of Ro√üau where his T√§uberln-Walzer (Op. 1) at once established his reputation. He toured with his band to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain. The conducting reins and management of this Strauss Orchestra would eventually be passed on to the hands of his sons until its disbandment by Eduard Strauss in 1901. On a trip to France in 1837 he heard the quadrille and began to compose them himself, becoming largely responsible for introducing that dance to Austria in the 1840 Fasching, where it became very popular. It was this very trip (in 1837) which has proved Strauss' popularity with audiences from different social backgrounds and this paved the way to forming an ambitious plan to perform his music in England for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. Strauss also adapted various popular melodies of his day into his works so as to ensure a wider audience, as evidenced in the incorporation of the Oberon overture into his early waltz, \\"Wiener Carneval\\", Op. 3, and also the French national anthem \\"La Marseillaise\\" into his \\"Paris-Walzer\\", Op. 101. Johann Strauss I, 1837 Strauss married Maria Anna Streim in 1825 in the Roman Catholic Lichtental Parish Church in Vienna. The marriage was relatively unhappy due to his prolonged absences caused by frequent tours abroad which led to a gradual alienation. They had seven children; Johann, Josef and Eduard Strauss, the last of whom had a son called Johann Strauss III. Strauss Sr. also had two daughters, Anna, who was born in 1829, and Therese, who was born in 1831. His third son, Ferdinand, born in 1834, lived only ten months. The family home was called 'Hirschenhaus' but was better known in Vienna as the 'Goldener Hirsch' (The Golden Stag). Strauss was a strict disciplinarian and demanded that none of his sons pursue careers in music, despite their display of musical talent. Johann Junior was to study banking, likewise his brother Josef Strauss was destined for a military career, whereas the youngest Eduard Strauss was expected to join the Austrian consulate. By 1834 Strauss had taken a mistress, Emilie Trampusch, with whom he had eightMichael Lorenz: \\"Familie Trampusch ‚Äì geliebt und totgeschwiegen\\", Jahrbuch des Vereins f√ºr Geschichte der Stadt Wien, Vol. 62/63, 2006/2007, (Vienna: Verein f√ºr Geschichte der Stadt Wien, 2011), 135‚Äì49. children. When her husband openly acknowledged his paternity of a daughter born to Emilie in 1844, Maria Anna sued for divorce. With the ending of the marriage Anna Strauss determined to further Johann Strauss II's musical career, allowing him to develop his skills as a composer. Despite family problems, Strauss senior continued to tour frequently and was always prepared to write novelty pieces for numerous charitable organizations. His waltzes were gradually developed from a rustic peasant dance into one which posterity would recognize as the Viennese Waltz. They were written in three- quarter time with a short introduction; often with little or no reference to the later chain of five two-part waltz structure; usually appended with a short coda and concluded in a stirring finish, although his son Johann Strauss II expanded the waltz structure and utilized more instruments than his father. While he did not possess a musical talent as rich as his eldest son's, nor a business mind as astute, he was among the handful of early waltz composers along with Joseph Lanner to actively write pieces with individual titles ‚Äî with the view to boost sales of their sheet music ‚Äî which enabled music enthusiasts to easily recognize those pieces. In fact, during his performances at the Sperl-Ballroom in Vienna, where he established his name, he actively pursued the concept of collecting a fixed entrance fee from the patrons of the ballroom instead of the old practice of passing around a collection plate where income was reliant on the goodwill of the patrons. Grave of Johann Strauss I, Zentralfriedhof, Vienna, Austria Johann Strauss II often played his father's works and openly declared his admiration of them, although it was no secret to the Viennese that their rivalry was intense, with the press at that time fueling it. Johann Strauss I himself refused to play ever again at the Dommayer's Casino, which offered his son his conducting debut, and was to tower over his son during his lifetime in terms of career advancement, although Strauss II was to eclipse him in terms of popularity in the classical repertoire. In 1846, Johann Strauss I was awarded the honorary title of K.K. Hofballmusikdirektor (Director of Music for the Imperial and Royal Court Balls) by Emperor Ferdinand I. Strauss died in Vienna on September 25, 1849 at the age of 45 from scarlet fever contracted from one of his illegitimate children. He was buried at the D√∂blinger cemetery beside his friend Joseph Lanner. In 1904, both of their remains were transferred to the graves of honour at the Zentralfriedhof. The former D√∂bling Cemetery is now a Strauss- Lanner Park. Hector Berlioz himself paid tribute to the 'Father of the Viennese Waltz' by commenting that \\"Vienna without Strauss is like Austria without the Danube\\". Nita Strauss, guitarist with Alice Cooper and others, is a descendant of Johann Strauss.

History Aerial view of the Willow Grove Park amusement park in 1926 Willow Grove's history spans nearly three centuries. Following a land grant established by William Penn, known as the Manor of Moreland, the first home was built in 1719. The colonial farmstead slowly grew into a small rural community. By the mid-19th century, Willow Grove served as a summer vacation retreat for Philadelphia residents. Dr. Nicholas More, an English friend and business associate of William Penn, was granted 9,815 acres of land at an annual rent of a silver shilling for every 100 acres. Originally known as \\"The Manor of Moreland\\", it became the Township of Moreland in 1718. The name officially became Willow Grove about 1792 when it appeared on a map of Pennsylvania townships. The planting of willow trees to absorb the surrounding swampland strengthened the decision to give Willow Grove its name. The Willow Grove area enjoys its place in Revolutionary War history, as well. Washington's troops marched through Willow Grove in 1777 on their way to the Battle of Brandywine, and the famous Battle of Crooked Billet took place in the vicinity of Hatboro. The Willow Grove area was also a major player in the efforts of the Underground Railroad during the Civil War. Old York Road was a primary route through Pennsylvania, leading slaves to freedom in Canada. As with many early communities, Willow Grove experienced rapid growth and development, thanks to railroad and trolley expansion toward the end of the 19th, and early 20th centuries. Less than a day's trip away from Philadelphia and attracted by the country, more and more inns and restaurants sprang up. The economy enjoyed a growth spurt and the Willow Grove area blossomed. \\"Life is a lark in Willow Grove Park\\" With travel and accommodations readily available and to stimulate travel on the increasingly popular trolleys, the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company decided to build an amusement park in Willow Grove, at the end of the line. Willow Grove Park opened in 1896 and was the prototype for numerous parks that followed across the country. The Park also enjoyed its reputation as the \\"Music Capital of America\\" with orchestras and bands, especially John Philip Sousa, who was a regular in the band shell starting in 1901. In 1926, more than 100,000 people attended Sousa's last annual concert in the park, after twenty-five years of making music in the area. In 1976, Willow Grove Park gave way to innovation and progress once again, when it was razed to make way for a new retail concept ‚Äì the mall. The Willow Grove Park Mall opened in 1982.

Stotesbury mansion), (built 1916‚Äì21, demolished 1980) William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, reserved Springfield Township as one of his family's original manors in the 1680s. The origin of the name \\"Wyndmoor\\" is somewhat obscure. The community was earlier called \\"Bungtown,\\" \\"Spring (or Springfield) Village,\\" and \\"Tedyuscung,\\" after the Native American leader, Teedyuscung, whose statue stands overlooking the Wissahickon Creek in Valley Green. \\"Wyndmoor\\" is variously said to be an appellation offered by the Heebner family who donated land for the Reading Railroad station, or originally the name of the estate of Randal Morgan, who made a fortune in oil and purchased property adjacent to the Reading Railroad station about 1900. The name eventually replaced the name \\"Springfield Village\\" for the small collection of shops and houses just east of Stenton Avenue, and finally encompassed the entire residential area east of Stenton Avenue.Contosta, David R. \\"Suburb in the City: Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, 1850‚Äì1990\\". Ohio State University Press, 1992, p. 203 Wyndmoor was the site of Whitemarsh Hall, the estate of banking executive Edward T. Stotesbury. The estate became a housing development in the late 1940s, and the 147-room mansion was demolished in 1980, but the columns of its portico and pieces of statuary survive in the neighborhoods of Wyndmoor. The Stotesbury Club House and John Welsh House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Wyndmoor Hose Company Wyndmoor Hose Company No 1 Wyndmoor Hose Company No. 1 was formed in 1906 and chartered in 1907. The seeds of the local fire company grew out of an industrial base at Mermaid Lane and Queen Street. There, the Nelson Valve Company began an in-house fire brigade to meet the needs of the dangerous industrial mechanisms used to make hydraulic valves. Eventually, the local community was solicited for its help in keeping this fire unit viable and expanding its services to the larger community. Residents volunteered, recognizing the communal benefit, and with help from the valve company a two-wheeled hand cart was purchased and 500 feet of hose. By 1909, the shed used at the valve Company was expanded, as were the hose carts to four wheels and two horses. Horse power proved a problem. A monetary reward was granted to the first horse team to arrive at the sound of the alarm and haul the apparatus to the scene. This actually produced a rivalry among horse teams! At the dawn of the Roaring Twenties the fire company got a new home, on Queen Street closer to Willow Grove Ave. It still stands and served as a firehouse for nearly 50 years. In 1927, Wyndmoor purchased two Hale Pumpers and in 1940 a city service ladder truck. As the nations infant automotive industry diversified and began to specialize, communities began purchasing recognizable fire apparatus. A huge property along Willow Grove Ave. was purchased by the fire company, and large fairs were held for a dozen years. The proceeds from these carnivals offset astronomical costs and allowed the continued modernization of the fire service in Wyndmoor. Wyndmoor Hose Company is a 100% volunteer department. The fifty-plus members who make up the working force are notified by digital paging systems, day and night, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Beyond fire suppression activities, WHCo is active in the community in many other ways. Fire prevention programs have always been a primary focus. The company keeps a busy schedule with weekend birthday parties held at the station, sometimes multiple parties each day. The parties often include a 15‚Äì30-minute presentation on fire safety. Throughout the year WHCo presents fire prevention programs to local schools, camps, day- care facilities, and other businesses and organizations. Annual demonstrations are made to The Boy Scouts of America to display not only safety messages, but also drunk-driving warnings. Equally importantly, WHCo has forged a relationship, approaching almost a decade long, with UCP ‚Äì United Cerebral Palsy. UCP is a nearby organization who provides direct services to over 2,400 adults, children and their families with a variety of disabilities including cerebral palsy, head trauma, stroke and spinal cord injury. Groups of Wyndmoor firefighters can be found at any one of UCP's six annual fundraising events. Monday nights are busy nights for Wyndmoor volunteers. Almost fifty weeks a year, Wyndmoor firefighters meet Mondays from 6:45 pm through 9:30 pm to maintain, test, practice, discuss, and plan for fire and rescue-related events. Beyond these evenings, special joint training sessions might be scheduled for weekends or other evenings throughout the year. While all firefighters must engage in no less than eighty hours of academy training before stepping foot on a fireground, the reality holds true that the training never ends. Wyndmoor Fleet ‚Äì 2007 In the late 1990s it was decided that the fire company would add emergency medical services to its already expanded list of rescue operations. The company purchased the QRS (Quick Response Service) unit that houses enough basic life support and first-aid equipment to complement the Springfield Ambulance Association's arrival. Wyndmoor volunteers assist at ground zero. Shortly after WHCo sent a crew to Ground Zero following September 11, 2001's terrorist activities, the Hazardous Materials operation also expanded. Wyndmoor teamed with HazMat 919 as Eastern Montgomery County's primary decontamination service. A larger environmental response trailer was purchased to accommodate the increased quantity of equipment needed. A much more in-depth training program was enforced and all WHCo members were required to complete advanced levels of hazardous materials training. Today Wyndmoor Hose Company, No. 1 is equipped to respond to virtually any emergency. Currently the department responds with a 2007 Pierce Rescue, a Ford F550, has a boat used for rescue, and trailers. A '19 Rosenbauer with a 55' aerial boom was received May 2019 - Snorkel 82. From building fire to vehicle rescue, from hazardous material to emergency medical situations, Wyndmoor has personnel that are well trained and highly skilled prepared to act.

Danville was home to 8,042 people in 1900, 7,517 people in 1910, and 7,122 people in 1940. The population was 4,699 at the 2010 census. Danville is part of the Bloomsburg‚ÄìBerwick Micropolitan Statistical Area. History=Native American history As Europeans explored the coastal regions reachable from ships at the dawn of the 17th Century, the whole valley of the Susquehanna from South-central New York state to the upper Chesapeake Bay was owned by the fierce Iroquois-like Susquehannock people, like the Erie people, an Iroquoian speaking tribe with a similar related culture.see Susquehannock#History main article coverage and citations. As the European wars of religion lulled before the cataclysm of the Thirty Years' War, ca. 1600 AD the protestant Dutch traders first entered the Delaware Valley and began regularly trading firearms for furs, especially highly valued Beaver Pelts with the inland Susquehannock people in the vicinity of greater Philadelphia. Although the Susquehannocks lived well inland their hunting range owned the rich Beaver territory of the entire Susquehanna River drainage basin, since the Susquehannock's range also included hunting the Schuylkill and Lehigh Rivers and their tributaries (which they historically disputed by occasional mutual raiding with the Algonquian Delaware people dwelling along the Atlantic coastal strip extending west from Delaware and southern New Jersey into the Poconos), the Susquehanna had a wealth of coveted Beaver pelts, and so became formidably well armed. The Beaver Wars About the time New Sweden (1638) was founded, the Iroquois Confederacy began a series of escalating wars setting Indian versus Indian called the Beaver Wars--that ultimately would open up the frontier to white settlers--deadly long running territorial wars between Amerindian peoples for fur hunting and trapping territories. Forearmed by their traders knowledge, the Swedes settled both sides of the Delaware, and almost immediately became allies with the Susquehannock, who already well armed, would soon after have a confederacy well armed enough to win a war declared by the colonial Province of Maryland, subjugate several Delaware tribes and would inflict several stinging defeats on Iroquois forces. By the mid-1650s New Netherlands absorbed New Sweden, and in 1666-67, the English took over New Netherlands, but most of the colonial populations in both cases, including traders, merely switched governors and went on with business as usual, where the most lucrative business was for Furs. What little is known of the Susquehannock tribe comes mostly from a few traders and the work of a single Dutch missionary who lived with them for a time about 1640. They were a fierce and powerful people holding off territorial infringements from the tribes on all sides of their range from the Potomac to the Mohawk valley, and the Poconos to the Alleghenies. Danville, located in the southern center of the valley would have been at least a summer hunting camp for these people, who were to become horribly affected by epidemic plagues of disease over multiple years circa 1668-72. This sudden weakness in population ironically occurred shortly after the Susquehannocks gave a serious drubbing about 1665-66 over 2-3 years to two of the Five Nations of the Iroquois in the local Beaver Wars. After the drastic weakening, they were attacked on all sides by subjected tribes, colonists, and the Iroquois, suffering further large losses. By 1678, the Iroquois would agree in a treaty to absorb most of the remaining Iroquoian Susquehannocks whose civilization had collapsed, though several hundred remnants migrated to live south and west of the Wyoming Valley, and would be called the Conestoga by the new English settlers in the colony of Pennsylvania, whilst the Susquehannock confederation would go extinct as an Iroquoian people and its surviving people would be absorbed into other tribes. Hence, Danville was Iroquois land until a 1768 treaty after the French and Indian War. 16th-18th century In November 1773, William Montgomery began acquiring land in Northumberland County from J. Cummings. On November 26, 1774 he acquired 180 acres along Mahoning Creek and Susquehanna River known as \\"Karkaase\\" from J. Simpson. Following his service in the New York and New Jersey Campaign, William re-settled his family from Chester County to Northumberland. Originally referred to as \\"Montgomery's Landing\\", it would become known as Danville after his son, Daniel Montgomery. After developing his farm, William developed the first gristmill, sawmill, and trading post. In 1778, his family fled during the Big Runaway to Fort Augusta and returned following the Battle of Wyoming. In 1792, William constructed the General William Montgomery House. In the same year Daniel plotted the area between Mill Street and Church Street, the historic core of the town which now bears his name. Early 19th century Danville was part of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, when it was founded. In 1813, Columbia County, Pennsylvania was formed from part of Northumberland Co. Danville became the county seat of Columbia Co. until 1845, when an election moved the seat to Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. In 1850, Montour County was formed from part of Columbia. Danville then became the county seat of Montour. Danville became a transportation center in the mid-19th century as the technology of early railroads developed, allowing accelerated development of inland communities. Danville first serviced canal boats plying the navigations on the Susquehanna between the coal docks in Pittston and Wilkes-Barre connecting to the Union Canal, and Harrisburg. Subsequently, it became served by several railroads also running along the banks of the North Branch of the Susquehanna River. Coal and iron mines in the surrounding hills and mountains fueled the local economy, and by mid-century Danville was an important iron mill town. Many of the rails of the nation's expanding railroad system were made in Danville, an important contribution to a network which grew explosively for decades. By the 1890s there were 7-8 major railroads running into the Wyoming Valley for Anthracite. A local marker claims that the first T-rail rolled in the United States was rolled in Danville, on October 8, 1845 at the Montour Iron Company, though this is claimed for Mount Savage, Maryland, as well. Late 19th century Montour and several other enormous iron mills dominated the town for most of the 19th century and the iron industry was the chief employer in the region. The iron mills fell into decline, however, as steel replaced iron in the 20th century. The city celebrates this era with an annual Iron Heritage Festival in July, and the main street is still named \\"Mill Street\\". In 1869 the Danville State Hospital was built as a state institution for the treatment and care of the mentally ill. 20th century and beyond Abigail Geisinger, widow of iron magnate George Geisinger, used his fortune to build a hospital and clinic intended to be a regional medical center modeled after the Mayo Clinic. The Geisinger Hospital was completed in 1915, and has grown over the years. Today, the Geisinger Medical Center is the most important tertiary referral center in northern Pennsylvania. Geisinger and its affiliated institutions are also one of the largest employers in the region. In the early 1960s, local company Susquehanna Danville Airport produced airboats for evaluation by the U.S. Army. Susquehanna was a joint venture between Ken Burrows-owned Danville Airport of Danville and Mari-Mar Industries of Port Trevorton, Pennsylvania. The airboats, called Susquehanna Skimmers, were evaluated in Vietnam between June 1964 and late 1965. The six Skimmers competed with six Hurricane Aircats, made by the Hurricane Fiberglass Products Company of Auburndale, Florida. The Skimmer lost to the Aircat, which was found to be more durable, easier to maneuver, and have greater obstacle crossing capabilities than the Susquehanna Skimmer, although the Skimmer outperformed the Aircat in deep water. The Thomas Beaver Free Library and Danville YMCA, Danville Historic District, Danville West Market Street Historic District, and General William Montgomery House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2014, Republican Bernie Swank replaced Democrat Ed Coleman as Mayor. Coleman was Mayor of Danville for 16 years. Swank defeated Democrat Tom Graham by 50 votes out of 682 votes cast.

The city's population was 26,800 as of the 2010 census. Easton is located at the confluence of the Delaware River and the Lehigh River, roughly north of Philadelphia and west of New York City. Easton is the easternmost city in the Lehigh Valley, a region of 731 square miles (1,893 km2) that is home to more than 800,000 people. Together with Allentown and Bethlehem, the Valley embraces the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton metropolitan area, including Lehigh, Northampton, and Carbon counties within Pennsylvania, and Warren County in the adjacent state of New Jersey. Easton is the smallest of the three Lehigh Valley cities, with approximately one-fourth of the population of the largest Lehigh Valley city, Allentown. In turn, this metropolitan area comprises Pennsylvania's third-largest metropolitan area. The city is split up into four sections: Historic Downtown, which lies directly to the north of the Lehigh River, to the west of the Delaware River, continuing west to Sixth Street; The West Ward, which lies between Sixth and Fifteenth Streets; The South Side, which lies south of the Lehigh River; and College Hill, a neighborhood on the hills to the north of downtown, which is the home of Lafayette College, a liberal arts and engineering institution. The boroughs of Wilson, West Easton, and Glendon are also directly adjacent to the city; the first and largest of which, Wilson, partially aligns in the same North-South Grid as the city of Easton. The greater Easton area consists of the city, three townships (Forks, Palmer, and Williams), and three boroughs (Glendon, West Easton, and Wilson). Centre Square, the town square of the city's Downtown neighborhood, is home to the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument, a memorial for Easton area veterans killed during the American Civil War. In the first half of the 20th century, Centre Square was reportedly referred to by locals as the \\"Circle.\\" The Peace Candle, a candle-like structure, is assembled and disassembled every year atop the Civil War monument for the Christmas season. The Norfolk Southern Railway's Lehigh Line (formerly the main line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad), runs through Easton on its way to Bethlehem and Allentown heading west and to Phillipsburg, New Jersey just across the Delaware River. History=Colonial era The Lenape Native Americans originally referred to the area as \\"Lechauwitank\\", or \\"The Place at the Forks\\". The site of the future city was part of the land obtained from the Delawares by the Walking Purchase. A plaque commemorating this fact is set in the town square. Thomas Penn set aside a tract of land at the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware rivers for a town. Easton was settled by Europeans in 1739 and founded in 1752, and was so named at the request of Penn; he had recently married Juliana Fermor, the daughter of Lord Pomfret whose estate was called Easton Neston, near Towcester, Northamptonshire, England. As Northampton County was being formed at this time, Easton was selected as its county seat. During the French and Indian War, the Treaty of Easton was signed here by the British colonial government of the Province of Pennsylvania and the Native American tribes in the Ohio Country, including the Shawnee and Lenape. Revolutionary War Easton was an important military center during the American Revolutionary War. During the Revolutionary War, Easton had a military hospital.John C. Fitzpatrick, The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745‚Äì1799, 39 vols. (Washington, D.C., 1931-1944), 6: 327‚Äì328. On 18 June 1779, General John Sullivan led 2,500 Continentals from Easton to engage British Indian allies on the frontier.Axelrod, Alan, The Real History of the American Revolution, 2007, p. 264 Easton was one of the first three places the Declaration of Independence was publicly read (along with Philadelphia and Trenton). It is claimed that the Easton flag was flown during that reading, making it one of the first \\"Stars and Stripes\\" to fly over the colonies. This flag was used by a militia company during the War of 1812, and currently serves as Easton's municipal flag. Industrial history Easton, photographed circa 1896 by William H. Rau Sited at the confluence of the rapidly flowing Lehigh River's waters with the more stately waters of the deeper wider Delaware, Easton became a major commercial center during the canal and railroad periods of the 19th century, when it would become a transportation hub for the eastern steel industry. The Delaware Canal, was quickly built soon after the lower Lehigh Canal (1818) became effective in regularly and reliably delivering much needed anthracite coal, into more settled lands along the rivers. And eventually the Morris would also serve to connect the rapidly developing Coal Regions to the north and west, to the fuel starved iron works to the west, the commercial port of Philadelphia to the south, and to the many home owners seeking fuel for heat within Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware and New York. Seeing other ways of exploiting the new fuel source, other entrepreneurs quickly moved to connect across the Delaware River reaching into the New York City area to the east via a connection with the Morris Canal in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, so the town became a canal nexus or hub from which the Coal from Mauch Chunk reached the world. The early railroads were often built to parallel and speed shipping along transportation corridors, and by the late 1860s the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (LH&S;) and Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) were built to augment the bulk traffic through the canals and provide lucrative passenger travel services. The LVRR, known as 'the Black Diamond Line' would boast the twice daily \\"Black Diamond Express\\" daily passenger trains to and from New York City and Buffalo, New York via Easton. The Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ), would lease and operate the LH&S; tracks from the 1870s until the Conrail consolidations absorbed both the Central Railroad of New Jersey and Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1966. Today, the Lehigh Valley Railroad's main line is the only major rail line that goes through Easton and is now known as the Lehigh Line; the Lehigh Line was bought by the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1999. Canal transportation was largely replaced by railroads in the mid-19th century with Easton being a hub for five railroads including the Jersey Central, Lehigh Valley Railroad and others. Easton lost its prominence in passenger transportation with the rise of the automobile in the mid-20th century. The development of improved logistics, transfer and handling methods lead to other regions profiting from freight transportation rather than Easton. Like the Pennsylvania Dutch region to the southwest, Easton has a strong German heritage. The Pennsylvania Argus, a German-language newspaper, was published in Easton until 1917. As part of their heritage, the Germans put up one of the continent's earliest Christmas trees in Easton; Daniel Foley's book states that \\"Another diary reference unearthed recently makes mention of a tree set-up at Easton, Pennsylvania, in 1816.\\" There is a plaque in Scott Park (along the Delaware River) commemorating this event. The Pennsylvania guide, compiled by the Writers' Program of the Works Progress Administration in 1940, colorfully described the rich and cosmopolitan fabric of Easton's society in the first half of the 20th century: Historians of angling believe that Samuel Phillipe, an Easton gunsmith, invented the six-strip split-cane bamboo fly rod. A Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission plaque near Center Square commemorates this event. Government Easton Mayor Sal Panto Easton operates a mayor-in-council city government. Residents elect a city controller, six city councilpersons and a mayor who is also a voting member of the city council. All of these officials are elected to four-year terms. The incumbent mayor, Democrat Sal Panto, Jr., was re-elected to his third consecutive term in 2015; he had previously served two terms as mayor during the 1980s. Easton is part of Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district, represented in the United States House of Representatives by Democrat Susan Wild, first elected to this office in 2018. Geography Civil War memorial in downtown Easton Easton is located at (40.688248, ‚àí75.216458). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and (8.39%) is water, including Bushkill Creek and the Lehigh and Delaware rivers. Downtown Easton lies at the confluence of the Lehigh River and Delaware River and is a low-lying area surrounded by hills to the north, west, and south. North of downtown is College Hill, the home of Lafayette College. South Easton, divided by the Lehigh River from the rest of the city, was a separate borough until 1898; it was settled initially by Native Americans, later by canal workers, and then was later the home of several silk mills. Climate Easton experiences a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfa). Summers are usually hot and very muggy, averaging in the mid-80s during the day, though the high humidity makes it feel much warmer. Fall and spring months are typically mild, offering many days in the mid-60s, as well as stronger winds. Winters are usually very cold and produce about 30 inches of snow. The local hardiness zone is 6b. Demographics As of the 2010 census, the city was 67.2% White, 16.8% Black or African American, 0.4% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian, and 4.9% were two or more races. 19.9% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry. As of the census of 2000, there were 26,263 people, 9,544 households, and 5,735 families residing in the city. The population density was 6,168.4 per square mile (2,380.3/km2).

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 9.79% of the population. The increase in Hispanic/Latinos‚Äîfrom less than 10% of the population in the 2000 census, to nearly 20% in the 2010 census, is a significant change in the city's demographics. The growth in Hispanic residents is similar to increases in Allentown and Bethlehem, the two other major cities in the Lehigh Valley. There were 9,544 households, out of which 30.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.7% were married couples living together, 16.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.9% were non-families. 31.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Before the American Civil War, Easton was the location of Union Law School, which was founded in 1846 and seems to have foundered fairly soon after the 1856 death of its founder, Judge Washington McCartney. (While at least one student, future Wisconsin state senator Robert L. D. Potter, graduated in the spring of 1857, a historian in 2000 dismissed Union in an endnote as \\"a one-man operation that died with him\\" [i.e., McCartney].Knupfer, Peter B.

The film chronicles the life of American mobster Bugsy Siegel and his relationship with Virginia Hill. Bugsy was theatrically released by TriStar Pictures on December 13, 1991. It received generally positive reviews from the critics and was a minor box office hit, grossing $49.1 million on a $30 million budget. It received ten nominations at the 64th Academy Awards, including for the Best Picture and won two; Best Production Design and Best Costume Design. Plot Gangster Bugsy Siegel, who works for Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, goes to Los Angeles and instantly falls in love with Virginia Hill, a tough-talking Hollywood starlet. The two meet for the first time when Bugsy visits actor George Raft on the set of Manpower. He buys a house in Beverly Hills, planning to stay there while his wife and two daughters remain in Scarsdale, New York. Bugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from gangster Jack Dragna. Mickey Cohen robs Dragna's operation one day. He is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed. Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Dragna is forced to admit to a raging Bugsy that he stole $14,000 and is told he now answers to Cohen. After arguments about Virginia's trysts with drummer Gene Krupa and various bullfighters and Siegel's reluctance to get a divorce, Virginia makes a romantic move on Bugsy. On a trip to Nevada to visit a gambling joint, Bugsy comes up with the idea for a hotel and casino in the desert. He obtains $1 million in funding from lifelong friend Lansky and other New York mobsters, reminding them that gambling is legal in Nevada. Virginia wants no part of it until Bugsy puts her in charge of accounting and begins constructing the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino in Las Vegas; however, the budget soon soars to $6 million due to his extravagance. Bugsy tries everything to ensure it gets completed, even selling his share of the casino. Bugsy is visited in Los Angeles by former associate Harry Greenberg. Harry has betrayed his old associates to save himself and run out of money from a combination of his gambling habits and being extorted by prosecutors who want his testimony. Though he is Harry's trusted friend, Bugsy has no choice but to kill him. He is arrested for the murder, but the only witness is a cab driver who dropped Harry off in front of Bugsy's house. The driver is paid to leave town. Lansky is waiting for Bugsy outside the jail. He gives a satchel of money to his friend. \\"Charlie [Luciano] doesn't have to know about it,\\" he tells Bugsy, but warns, \\"I can't protect you anymore.\\" The Flamingo's opening night is a total failure, and $2 million of the budget is unaccounted for, at which point Bugsy discovers that Virginia stole the money. He tells her to \\"keep it and save it for a rainy day.\\" He then tells Lansky never to sell his share of the casino because he will live to thank him someday. Later that night, Bugsy is shot and killed in his home. Virginia is told the news in Las Vegas and knows her own days could be numbered. The end title cards state that one week after Bugsy Siegel's death, Virginia Hill returned all of the missing money to Meyer Lansky. Virginia Hill committed suicide in Austria. By 1991, the $6 million invested in Bugsy's Las Vegas dream had generated $100 billion revenues. CastProduction Beatty's desire to make and star in a film about Bugsy Siegel can be traced all the way back to the late 1970s and early 1980s. After completing Reds, Beatty had several projects that he wanted to do but his two dream projects were to produce, star, and possibly direct the life story of Howard Hughes and the life story of Bugsy. Beatty stated that of all the characters he played in films, such as Clyde Barrow in Bonnie and Clyde and John Reed in Reds, he felt that he was the right actor to play both Bugsy and Hughes. Beatty was fascinated by Siegel, who he thought was a strange emblem of America (an American gangster who was the son of Jewish immigrants who became fascinated with Hollywood and who also envisioned a desert city in which legal gambling is allowed). Several filmmakers attempted to make a film based on Bugsy's life, most famously French director Jean-Luc Godard, who wrote a script entitled The Story and envisioned Robert De Niro as Siegel and Diane Keaton as Virginia Hill. In the late 1970s, Beatty met screenwriter James Toback, with whom he became fast friends when Beatty was preparing Heaven Can Wait. Years later, when Beatty was in pre-production on Ishtar, he asked Toback to write a script on Bugsy. During the course of six years and in between two films that he was involved in, Toback wrote a 400-page document of Bugsy's life. However, under some strange circumstances, Toback lost the entire document. Under pressure from Warner Bros., who Beatty learned also had a Bugsy Siegel script ready to be produced, Beatty pursued Toback to write a script based on his lost document. Toback handed his new script to Beatty. Beatty approved it and went to several studios in hopes of obtaining financing and distribution for the film. Beatty presented Toback's script to Warner Bros. and claimed that it was much better than the one that Warner Bros. was interested in producing. Warner Bros. passed on the project, and Beatty eventually got the backing of TriStar Pictures. Initially, Toback was under the impression that he would be the director. For a while, Beatty could not find a director (he did not know or chose not to know of Toback's desire to direct the film). Beatty feared that he would be stuck in the position of having to direct the film himself. He said, \\"I'm in just about every scene of the picture, and I didn't want to have to do all that other work.\\" However, Beatty announced to Toback that Barry Levinson was on board to direct Bugsy. At first, Toback was disappointed, but he quickly learned that Levinson was the right person for the job. Despite the length of the script (which would have run three and a half to four hours), Beatty, Levinson, and Toback condensed it to a two-and-a- half to three-hour script. The trio worked very closely together during the production of the film. During casting, Beatty wanted Annette Bening to play the role of Virginia Hill. Before Bugsy, Bening was a candidate to play Tess Trueheart in Beatty's Dick Tracy. After seeing her audition, Beatty phoned Levinson and told him, \\"She's terrific. I love her. I'm going to marry her\\". Levinson thought Beatty was just excited at her audition and did not think that Beatty actually meant what he had said. Both Beatty and Bening stated that their relationship started after completing the film. Later that summer, Bening became pregnant with her and Beatty's first child, which resulted in a tabloid/media frenzy at the time. The child was born January 8, 1992, and the couple married on March 12. Originally, Beatty played Bugsy with a heavy New York City accent (which can be heard in the trailer). However, both Levinson and Toback thought that the accent was not right, so Beatty dropped the accent (which he thought was \\"charming\\") and used his normal voice. Principal photography began in January 1991, and filming wrapped in May 1991. Portions of the film were shot in the Coachella Valley, California.http://visitpalmsprings.com/stream/126941?mode=Download  Release  Bugsy had a limited release on December 13, 1991, and was released nationwide on December 20, 1991.

Public education  Lower Saucon Township and Hellertown Borough are served by the Saucon Valley School District.  History  John Wagner Homestead, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Until the mid-17th century, the Lenni Lenape (Delaware) tribes hunted and inhabited the land of Lower Saucon Township. European traders first appeared in the area prior to 1700, and the Native Americans peacefully traded with these outsiders, although some minor skirmishes did occur. William Penn was granted land on March 4, 1681, by King Charles II to repay a debt owed to Penn's father. The land grant included what is now Lower Saucon Township. However, Penn soon realized that he needed to purchase the land from the Native Americans to maintain clear ownership. Penn advertised throughout Europe, offering parcels of land for 40 shillings, subject to a rent of one shilling per annum forever. In 1737, Penn's sons expanded their land holdings to include most of the Lehigh Valley through the ‚ÄúWalking Purchase.‚Äù Although the Lenni Lenape did not think this was a legitimate claim, they eventually moved out of the area, allowing Europeans to settle it. Sometime before 1737, Nathaniel Irish established a farm, built a grist and saw mill, and opened a land office for William Penn. He is considered the first European settler in Lower Saucon Township. His land later became known as Shimersville. Irish was the first justice of the peace in the area, and the first ‚ÄúKing‚Äôs Highway,‚Äù from Philadelphia to the Lehigh Valley, built in 1737, led to his property. Lower Saucon Township was chartered in 1743, when it was still a part of Bucks County. It was established in the rich farmland along the Saucon Creek. The name is of Native American origin, from ', meaning ‚Äúat the mouth of the creek.‚Äù The township also included South Bethlehem until 1865 and Hellertown until 1872. German immigrants, convinced by Penn's favorable description of the New World, settled Lower Saucon Township in large numbers, beginning in the 1730s. Some of the surnames of the early German settlers were Boehm, Wagner, Appel, Riegel, Lerch, Laubach, Oberley, Heller, Shimer, and Lutz. These early settlers were hardworking, and their farms prospered. There were numerous mills built to provide sawed wood, flour, textiles, paper, and gunpowder. Other early industry included lime kilns and the extracting of zinc and iron ore. During the Revolutionary War, many German farmers enlisted in the Continental army to fight the British. At a time when the army's reserves were depleted, they offered to sell wheat and rye on credit. In 1777, soldiers of the Continental army transporting the Liberty Bell to Allentown passed through Lower Saucon, spending a night in Leithsville. The Marquis de Lafayette, according to legend, stopped at Wagner's Tavern in Hellertown on his way to Bethlehem during the war. The first church, Lower Saucon Church, was established in 1734, soon after the early settlers had arrived. It was built by a German Reformed congregation on what is now Easton Road. There were 10 schools in place in the township even before the legislature of Pennsylvania adopted the public school system in 1834. These schools were established by the local church congregations. Northampton County Bridge No. 15, listed on the NRHP When the North Penn Railroad, connecting Philadelphia to Bethlehem, was completed in 1856, this line provided an impetus to building iron smelters in Bingen, Hellertown, and Iron Hill, due to the township's wealth of iron ore and limestone. The railroad brought coal to this industry, transported pig iron to markets, and provided transportation for the township's population. Lower Saucon Township felt the influence of the Bethlehem Steel Company. The executives purchased farmland in the township to build large estates, and the steel company became the largest employer in the area. When it ceased manufacturing in 1995, many residents of Lower Saucon suffered loss of employment.

It is in Northampton County, and is part of Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley region. The population was 5,746 at the 2010 census. History=Origins of name The borough is named for the Biblical town of Nazareth in Israel, where Jesus spent his youth. The names of other places in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania are similarly inspired, including Bethlehem, Emmaus, Egypt, and Allentown's Jordan Creek. Pennsylvania founder William Penn bequeathed the land to his daughter, Letitia, who under colonial law had to pay a single red rose each June 24, if so demanded by the trustees. This led to another early name for Nazareth being the Barony of the Rose. The people of Nazareth continue to celebrate this every year on June 11 and 12, with various organizations selling single red roses throughout the town Moravian history Nazareth was founded in 1740 by Moravian immigrants from Germany. The property was purchased from George Whitefield after the construction of the Whitefield House. Initially, Nazareth was specifically Moravian by charter. Outside faiths were not allowed to purchase property within Nazareth, a basically all German Protestant community. In 1735 a small group of the Moravian missionaries had begun work in the newly settled community of Savannah, Georgia. Their intent was to evangelize the Native American tribes and minister to the settlers. Governor James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and John Wesley and Charles Wesley, founders of the Methodist Church and deeply interested in Moravian ideals, came along on the same boat. The Brethren settled along the Savannah River in Georgia. Like the Quakers, the Brethren refused to take part in the war with the Spanish and, as a result, they were evicted from Georgia in 1739. George Whitefield, a widely known itinerant preacher who had served for a time as chaplain of Savannah, brought the group of evicted Georgia Brethren north to Philadelphia in his sloop. Whitefield had grandiose plans, and one of them was for a school for Negro children to be established on his tract of called the Barony of Nazareth. He invited the Brethren who accompanied him to Philadelphia to settle at this location for the time being and hired them to build his school. By the end of June, 1739, the first log dwelling was erected. The workers struggled, the weather did not cooperate, and winter soon arrived. They quickly erected a second log house. After its completion, word came that Whitefield had returned to Pennsylvania, bristling and angered by theological disputes with certain Moravians, particularly on the issue of predestination. He evicted the Moravian Brethren. While evicted from the Barony, Moravian leaders in England were negotiating to buy the entire Barony. When Whitefield's business manager suddenly died, Whitefield discovered that his finances, shaky on more than one occasion, would not allow him to proceed with his Nazareth plan. He was forced to sell the whole tract. On July 16, 1741, it officially became Moravian property. Nazareth was originally planned as a central English-speaking church village. But in October 1742, its 18 English inhabitants departed for Philadelphia. Meanwhile, the Nazareth tract was largely in the hand of Captain John, a Lenape chieftain who (along with his followers) refused to leave, even though they no longer owned the land. In December 1742, Count Zinzendorf, a Moravian benefactor, made a settlement with Captain John, and whose tribe moved back into the hinterland. During 1743, the still unfinished Whitefield House was put in readiness for 32 young married couples who were to arrive from Europe. On the second day of the new year, 1744, the couples went overland to Nazareth to settle in the nearly completed Whitefield House. The Whitefield House and adjacent Gray Cottage now belong to the Moravian Historical Society. The result was that Nazareth began to increase in population. Enough visitors were attracted to the town that the Rose Inn was built in 1752 on an additional tract to the north. Finally, in 1754, Nazareth Hall was built in hopes that Count Zinzendorf would return from Europe and settle in Nazareth permanently, but he never returned to the Americas. However, in 1759 Nazareth Hall became the central boarding school for sons of Moravian parents. Later it attained wide fame as a \\"classical academy.\\" This eventually led to the founding, in 1807, of Moravian College and Theological Seminary, now located in Bethlehem. The Nazareth Hall Tract was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Pennsylvania Dutch settlements Up until the mid-1900s, a large part of Nazareth's population was of German origin, better known as the Pennsylvania Dutch. \\"Dutch\\" being a corruption of the word \\"Deutsch\\", which is German for \\"German.\\" The Pennsylvania Dutch were spread throughout many counties of southern and central Pennsylvania. In addition to the modern nation of Germany, Pennsylvania Dutch from Germany, many also came from Switzerland and the Alsace, region of France. Religious diversity of 1900s Nazareth's residents' religion reflected a largely German background in evangelical churches of fairly large sizes for such a small town, divided among the Moravian, Lutheran, Reformed (now part of the United Church of Christ), and Roman Catholic worship centers of the town. The town also hosted a fairly sizable Italian and Polish population, which largely attended Holy Family Catholic Church, in the area. Construction boom During a great immigration to the eastern Pennsylvania counties of the late 1900s from New Jersey and New York, the population expanded significantly. Developers from the New Jersey area were responding to tighter controls and regulations on new construction in the state of New Jersey by moving their enterprises to Pennsylvania. This new expansion and housing boom was enabled by the local completion of the interstate system of highways, first begun by former U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s. In the Nazareth area, this was caused by the completion of the nearby Pennsylvania Route 33, which ran north and south, thereby connecting Interstate 78, U.S Route 22, and Interstate 80 (all of which ran east‚Äìwest), and the completion of the Interstate 78 southern Lehigh Valley corridor high speed interstate, which connected the Lehigh Valley to New Jersey and New York to the east, and Harrisburg and Pittsburgh to the west. The Nazareth Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

About 4.2% of families and 8.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 9.3% of those under age 18 and 11.4% of those age 65 or over. In 1900, 2,304 people lived there, and in 1910, 3,978 inhabitants existed; 5,721 people lived in Nazareth in 1940. Its population was 6,023 at the 2000 census. Geography Nazareth is located at (40.739993, -75.311214). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. Nazareth's climate is similar to the rest of the Lehigh Valley, with four distinct seasons, humid summers, cold winters, and very short and mild springs and falls. This climate is hot-summer humid continental (Dfa) and average monthly temperatures range from 28.1 ¬∞F in January to 73.4 ¬∞F in July. The hardiness zone is 6b. Nazareth's topography can best be described as hilly, as the town itself sits atop a local outcropping underground of one of the richest veins of limestone in the U.S. Much of the farmland surrounding Nazareth is being converted into close sitting lots of suburban housing, for predominantly commuter households.  Public education  Nazareth Borough is served by the Nazareth Area School District, which also comprises the surrounding Townships of Bushkill, Upper Nazareth and Lower Nazareth, and the boroughs of Tatamy and Stockertown. The district's schools include: * Lower Nazareth Elementary * Floyd R. Shafer Elementary * Bushkill Elementary * Nazareth Area Intermediate School * Nazareth Area Middle School * Nazareth Area High School Communication and media News about the Nazareth community is reported regularly in regional newspapers The Morning Call and The Express-Times, newspapers. Local shoppers, such as The Nazareth Times, The Home News and The Key newspapers provide Nazareth with a source for local advertising and news on community events. Nazareth Speedway Nazareth was home to the Nazareth Speedway, a one-mile tri-oval paved track of Indy and USAC racing fame. Nazareth is also home to racing champions Mario Andretti and Michael Andretti, and third-generation driver Marco Andretti. The track was closed in 2004, and no announcements have been made about what the land will be used for. Industry=Kraemer Textiles Inc. Kraemer Textiles Inc., which started out as a silk hosiery maker in 1887, is based in Nazareth. Over the years, the company changed to spinning yarns out of manmade and natural fibers for clients to use in the manufacture of upholstery, clothing, and home furnishings. The company creates and markets its own brand of handicraft yarns under the Kraemer Yarns label. The company also spun the Merino wool yarn that was used in creating the end- to-end American-made sweaters produced by the Ralph Lauren Corporation for the athletes of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Martin Guitar Nazareth is the global headquarters for C.F. Martin & Company, which manufactures Martin guitars. Martin guitars are handmade instruments that once were made by artisans who apprenticed for years to learn their trade. Now, Martin Guitars are made largely on an assembly line monitored and assisted by workers, computers, and lasers. Assembly lines at Martin were instituted to lower costs, improve speed of production, and compete with foreign manufacturers, without which efforts it is said that the company would have ceased to survive. Cement manufacturing In the 1960s, at least three large cement companies surrounded the Nazareth borough area, Essroc (formally Coplay Cement), Hercules Cement, and Penn-Dixie Cement Companies. The Coplay plant on the south side has undergone company ownership changes through the years (and was also known as the Nazareth Cement Company, among other names). Hundreds of union laborers of the United Gypsum, Lime and Cement Unions worked in each plant around the town from the early 1900s. Stories of the hard pre-union days at the cement plants are replete with the description of twelve-hour days for survival wages, poor working and health conditions, and many dangerous incidents and accidents causing loss of life and or limb without medical plans or benefits to survivors. Since the 1980s, however, the automation of the plants and eventual reselling of them to foreign firms has brought about the loss of most of the high-paying union cement jobs, presenting a blow to the Lehigh Valley economy. The impact on the local economy of these lost cement jobs was intensified by the ultimate closing of neighboring Bethlehem Steel in 2003. In the case of Bethlehem Steel, it was not automation and modernization that downsized the workforce, but failure to modernize the mills, overloaded management, and a laissez-faire management attitude about foreign competition and cheap foreign steel production.

History In 1907, the citizens of western Allen Township met at the Northampton Hotel, and signed a petition declaring the formation of the Borough of North Catasauqua. This petition was submitted to the county in early June, the final decree of incorporation was made on June 11, and was officially entered into the records on June 17. Shortly after the incorporation was made official, the first borough elections were held, with William H. Thomas becoming the first burgess, an office equivalent to a present-day mayor. Located between the larger boroughs of Catasauqua in Lehigh County, and Northampton in Northampton County, North Catasauqua quickly grew as businesses and residents came into the new borough. Eventually a police department was formed along with the Charotin Fire Department in 1909. A new combined firehouse and municipal building was built in 1911; prior to this, fire-fighting equipment was housed at the Hoffman and Follweiler stables. Church services were held around the borough at various places of worship including St. Lawrence Church (built in 1857), St. Andrew‚Äôs Church (built in 1903), and Holy Trinity Church (built in 1903). On June 14, 1947, the borough celebrated the opening of the North Catasauqua Park and Playground, built on of land purchased from Northampton County. At the time, the park included a war memorial, complete with flagpole and monument (erected in 1945); playground equipment; a baseball diamond; and 95 Sycamore trees. The park and playground quickly became a popular spot for play and recreation, as well as band concerts, picnics, the borough Christmas tree, and carnivals. The Willowbrook Golf Course has played an important role in the borough‚Äôs development. The golf course was originally a private five-hole course built by Colonel James Fuller on the Willowbrook Farm Estate to entertain personal friends and executives visiting the Fuller Company in Catasauqua. In 1932, the golf course opened as a private nine-hole course leased to Dr. Calvin Miller from Mrs. Dorothy Fuller, the Colonel‚Äôs widow. The golf course was open to the public in 1934 as a way to pay for expenses. The golf course has grown over the years and has become a popular course for local residents and area golfers. Today the golf course has been closed so more housing can be built in the borough. In 1913, the North Catasauqua School District razed the four-room Allen Township schoolhouse so that a new one could be built. The new school building housed grade 1-8 and featured, what were at the time, state-of-the- art amenities. After a merger of North Catasauqua and Catasauqua school districts in 1953, the school housed elementary grades 1-6 until June 1972. In 1975, North Catasauqua Borough obtained possession of the building and transferred the municipal offices to the site in 1976. In 1995, extensive renovations took place and a rededication ceremony was held in 1996. The municipal building now houses the borough police department, borough offices, council chambers, a meeting room, fire department administrative headquarters, as well as room for future expansion. The Charotin Fire Department was relocated to the municipal building site in 1980 with the building of a new combined fire station and public works garage. The North Catasauqua Public Works Department moved to its present location at the Main Street complex when the old Charotin fire station and municipal garages were sold in 1986. A public works building was built in 1983 at the Main Street complex. This new building included garages and an office, and allowed all of the public works‚Äô equipment to be housed in one building. In 2004, an additional building was erected. This new facility allows for increased storage and includes bigger garage bays, offices, a break room, and shower facilities for employees. Additionally, a paved pathway leading down to the D&L; Canal towpath and Lehigh River was also created, along with a parking lot, for future public recreation at the river. North Catasauqua Borough celebrated the centennial of its incorporation with a year-long centennial celebration in 2007.

History Northampton and surrounding areas of the Lehigh Valley are rich in limestone, which is commonly used in the production of cement. The Atlas Portland Cement Company, based here from 1895 to 1982, was the world's largest cement company at one time, and one of dozens in the area. It produced some 8 million barrels of cement for construction of the Panama Canal, most of what was used on the project. Atlas was bought by another company in 1980 and ceased operation here in 1982; its last smokestack here was demolished in 1993. Today technology and automation mean that the cement industry can manufacture a great amount of product with 150-200 workers, rather than the thousands who worked in these plants earlier in the 20th century. The Atlas Memorial Cement Museum, which was opened in 1997 here, was founded by Edward Pany, who worked at the company in summers during the 1950s. His father, an immigrant from Austria, worked all his life at Atlas. Immigrant workers from Poland, Ukraine, and other eastern European nations also worked here. The museum commemorates the importance of this industry and Atlas Cement in the area. Geography Northampton is located north of Allentown and west of Easton at (40.683896, -75.491353).

History Northampton was created from the villages of Siegfried, Newport and Stemton, which together were formed into an alliance in 1902. Due to the limestone formations in the region, Northampton became a global center for the manufacturing of cement. Atlas Portland Cement Company, the largest such company in the world at one time, operated here from 1895 to 1982. It supplied most of the cement used in the construction of the Panama Canal. In 1909, Atlas petitioned county courts to change the alliance into a borough, reportedly because the change would make it easier for the company to send and receive mail. The Atlas Portland Cement Company plant closed in 1982. Borough residents, many of them former Atlas employees or their descendants, still identify strongly with the company and its history. For example, the Northampton Area School District mascot is the \\"Konkrete Kid.\\"http://www.nasdschools.org/high-school.cfm?subpage=9 In addition, in 1996 the Atlas Memorial Cement Museum was opened in the borough Historical community events included the Northampton Jack Frost Parade every October before Halloween, celebrating the onset of winter. It includes marching bands and floats. Another event that occurred during the 1940s and 1950s was the Northampton County Fair, which was held every year and was spread out across the Lappawinzo Fish & Game Club property North of Northampton (off Kreidersville Road). There were huge numbers of vendor stands, fair rides, animals, shows/performances, 4-H Club judgings, as well as Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey shows. Visitors came from all over the East Coast during the two-week event and hourly buses ran from downtown Northampton and nearby cities to the Fair. Part of the opening sequence of the 1992 film School Ties was filmed in downtown Northampton due to the town's preservation of older buildings, which fit with the 1950s setting of the film. Public education The borough is served by the Northampton Area School District. There are 4 elementary schools, a middle school and one high school. The Borough is also home to Good Shepherd Catholic School in the 4th Ward. It serves grades Pre-K to 8th grade. It is part of the Diocese of Allentown. There was St. John's school but it closed in 2003.

Palmer Township is located in the Lehigh Valley region of the state. The Township is home to Easton Area High School, a large public high school known for its rivalry with Phillipsburg High School. The population of Palmer Township was 20,691 at the 2010 census. History The first known inhabitants of the area now known as Palmer Township were the Lenape Native Americans in the 17th century. German Moravian settlers built on land in the Palmer area in 1740. At the time, the area was part of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which by the mid-18th century also included land now called Northampton County and Lehigh County. Northampton County separated from Bucks County on March 11, 1752. In 1754, Forks Township, which then also consisted of what is now Palmer Township, was incorporated in 1754 with a total population of about 50 inhabitants. On May 5, 1857, Palmer Township was formed out of the land area of Forks Township south and west of the Bushkill Creek; the original population of the township was about 1,300 people. The township was named after George Palmer, the Pennsylvania Surveyor General who surveyed the original township lines.Anderson, p. 4 At the time that it was incorporated, the township was about and included what are now known as the boroughs of Tatamy (which became incorporated in 1893), West Easton (incorporated in 1898), Stockertown (incorporated in 1901) and Wilson (incorporated in 1920). The main activity of Palmer Township during its earliest years was providing access roads from the neighboring city Easton to surrounding communities, including Bethlehem, Freemansburg and Nazareth.Anderson, p. 5 During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the township included many stone houses near water, for purposes of power and water supply, and roads, to allow for trade. Among them were the Seipsville Hotel, which was built by the settler Peter Seip in 1760 at the crossroads of roads leading from Easton, Nazareth and Hecktown. Seip had purchased land along the west side of Old Nazareth Road; the area later became known as Seipsville in honor of Seip. The Seipsville Hotel was the first public house between Easton and Nazareth, and became a popular stagecoach stop for travelers passing through the Lehigh Valley. In 1977, the building (now known as the Seipsville Inn) was added to the National Register of Historic Places due to the significance of its architecture and engineering. The township started to experience major growth after World War I and World War II as part of a general trend of population movement from nearby cities to the suburbs. In the early 1920s, subdivision activity along inter-city trolley lines led to a building spurt in Palmer Township, which doubled the population within 10 years. As a result, the township became seen as a desirable place to live for people who worked in other areas of the Lehigh Valley. The population saw further growth in the late 1940s and early 1950s due to the expansion of water lines and the development of low-income housing. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 10.7 square miles (27.7 km2), of which, 10.7 square miles (27.7 km2) of it is land and 0.09% is water. It is drained by the Lehigh River and Bushkill Creek into the Delaware River. Its villages include Highland Park, Old Orchard, Palmer Heights, Palmer Park, and Prospect Park (also in Bethlehem Township.) Highway 22 crosses it east-to-west and interchanges in the township just west of Wilson with Route 248, which connects Easton and Nazareth. North-to-south Highway 33 crosses the NW portion of Palmer and interchanges with 22, Hecktown Road, and 248 just beyond its western boundary. Other local roads of note include east-to-west Freemansburg Road, William Penn Highway, Park Avenue/Hecktown Road, Northwood Avenue, and Main Street/Nazareth Road, and north-to-south 25th Street, Bushkill Drive, Greenwood Avenue, Tatamy Road, and Van Buren Road.

In 1969, a special federal census showed a population of 12,252, including 5,982 white males, 6,249 white females, seven non-white males and 14 non-white females. By 1970, the population further grew to 12,601, making it the third largest municipality in Northampton County. Between 1960 and 1970, the assessed value of the township jumped from $24 million to $42 million, and the township budget grew from $93,000 to about $1 million. Also throughout that decade, an average of 125 living units per year were constructed, with the average housing value falling between $23,000 and $25,000. In 1970, about 35 percent of the land was in agriculture, mostly in the northern portion of the township. As of the census of 2000, there were 16,809 people, 6,716 households, and 4,895 families residing in the township. The population density was 1,570.4 people per square mile (606.5/km2). There were 6,865 housing units at an average density of 641.4/sq mi (247.7/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 94.32% White, 2.14% African American, 0.06% Native American, 1.83% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.63% from other races, and 0.99% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.34% of the population. There were 6,716 households, out of which 28.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.5% were married couples living together, 6.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.1% were non-families. 23.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females there were 93.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.1 males. The median income for a household in the township was $55,419, and the median income for a family was $65,017. Males had a median income of $44,014 versus $30,675 for females. The per capita income for the township was $25,722. About 2.6% of families and 3.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.4% of those under age 18 and 6.3% of those age 65 or over. Economy A lack of water during the early days of Palmer Township limited the amount of farming that could be done, and industry was limited mainly to the Bushkill Creek waterways, where some form of power was available. Residents had to get water from hand dug wells because it was too difficult to find a source of water close to the surface of the ground. Other industries began to arise in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including some iron ore excavation in the Fairview Knolls area and cement industry near the Tatamy area; also at this time, the Taylor Wharton and Treadwell Engineering were established in Palmer Township to manufacture equipment mainly for railroad use. Gradually, farming techniques grew more and more in the area, until by the late 1960s almost 50 percent of the township was in farm lands. The township saw new businesses in the mid 1960s, including ITT in 1964 and Acopian Corp., in 1965. Public education The Township is served by the Easton Area School District and has a library branch that is part of the Easton Area Public Library. Infrastructure When Palmer's major roadway system first started to develop in the 18th century, it was dictated largely by the trails leading from Easton to outlying communities. William Penn Highway, the first road built in Palmer in around 1755, led from Easton to Bethlehem. Likewise, Freemansburg Avenue leads from Easton to Freemansburg; Old Nazareth Road leads from Easton to Nazareth; Tatamy Road leads from Easton to Tatamy; and Hecktown Road and the Newburg Pike leads from Seipsville to the Hecktown and Newburg communities. Greenwood Avenue, which runs between Freemansburg Avenue and William Penn Highway, was opened in the 1960s. At the time, township Supervisor President H. Robert Daws said, \\"The opening of this north-south artery in the center of the township benefits not only the township, but the whole area.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Palmer Township website *Easton Area High School Category:Townships in Northampton County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Palmer Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania"},{"id":"133489","text":"Palmer Heights is a census-designated place (CDP) in Palmer Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (8.93%) is water. History Portland was settled because of the logging trade and what buildings were here in the early 19th century came as a result of this industry. It served to increase at least one business ‚Äì that of the taverns and hotels. Records show that the Hibblertown Hotel (present Ackerson house on State Street), the Dill‚Äôs Tavern (oldest tavern, was located on the south side of Emery‚Äôs, now torn down) and the What Cheer Inn (present Duckloe Showroom at the corner of Delaware Avenue and Main Street) all prospered because of loggers. The railroad was a vital force in the development of Portland. It changed the mode of transporting goods, and attracted many new residents. As a result of increased population, the business community expanded to serve the needs of the village. By the time of the incorporation there were three general stores, a hardware store, a drug store, four confectionery shops, two millinery shops, and jewelry store. Portland had a fine newspaper, the ‚ÄúPortland Enterprise.‚Äù This weekly paper, started in 1847 by L.G. Raymond, gave the people on both sides of the river all the news. Coe Finch took over the paper in the 1880s and continued until John Wildrick became editor in 1900. The financial center of Portland and vicinity was the Portland National Bank. It was organized on February 7, 1903, and received its charter as a Federal bank on March 11, 1903. It served the Portland area continuously except for a period during 1932 when it closed its doors under the pressure of the Great Depression. The population of the Portland community has remained stable during most of the past one hundred years. Since the business community exists essentially to serve the townspeople, it too has remained constant. However, it has kept pace with the changing times. The number of businesses has not varied, but the types have changed to keep pace with modern times. Virtually all the businesses are owned by people who live in Portland or nearby communities, therefore these businesspeople not only have a sense of pride in their own stores, but in the community as well. The Delaware River provided easy transport. At first only the Indians skimmed their canoes over its surface, but by the mid-18th century, rafts were in use during spring floods. As late as 1870, the river near Portland would be full of rafts as far was the eye could see. Rafting started to wane in the 1880s because railroads had reached the lumbering country. The Portland Covered Bridge had its beginnings as early as February 5, 1816. Records indicate that Francis Myerhoff, owner of the Columbia Glass Works, received a charter from the State of New Jersey to build a bridge across the river to help in the delivery of the sand he needed for his factory in New Jersey. Early in January, 1869, the bridge was finally completed by the Charles, Kellogg and Maurice Company of Athens, Pennsylvania (later the Union Bridge Company). According to an Easton paper of January 19, 1869, Mrs. Sophia Sandt rode from Pennsylvania to New Jersey and back again in her sleigh ‚Äúamidst the applause of the people.‚Äù The bridge, of the Burr Truss type, was 775 feet long, 18 feet wide, and cost about $40,000 to construct. The Great Flood of August 19, 1955, was too much for the span. Early in the afternoon of that Friday, the center of the bridge gave way to the relentless pounding of the highest water ever recorded on the Delaware, and all but the section closest to the New Jersey side floated down the river. Thus came to an end what was at the time the longest covered wooden bridge in the United States, and the last one spanning the Delaware River. The County Bridge No. 36 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

The breadth and depth of the aquifer generally decrease from north to south. USGS county in 2000. Source: National Atlas The Ogallala Aquifer () is a shallow water table aquifer surrounded by sand, silt, clay, and gravel located beneath the Great Plains in the United States. One of the world's largest aquifers, it underlies an area of approximately in portions of eight states (South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas). It was named in 1898 by geologist N. H. Darton from its type locality near the town of Ogallala, Nebraska. The aquifer is part of the High Plains Aquifer System, and rests on the Ogallala Formation, which is the principal geologic unit underlying 80% of the High Plains.Darton, N.H. 1898. Preliminary report on the geology and water resources of Nebraska west of the one hundred and third meridian. In: Walcott, C.D. (ed), Nineteenth Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey, 1897-1898, Part IV, pp. 719-785. Large scale extraction for agricultural purposes started after World War II due partially to center pivot irrigation and to the adaptation of automotive engines for groundwater wells. Today about 27% of the irrigated land in the entire United States lies over the aquifer, which yields about 30% of the ground water used for irrigation in the United States. The aquifer is at risk for over-extraction and pollution. Since 1950, agricultural irrigation has reduced the saturated volume of the aquifer by an estimated 9%. Once depleted, the aquifer will take over 6,000 years to replenish naturally through rainfall. The aquifer system supplies drinking water to 82% of the 2.3 million people (1990 census) who live within the boundaries of the High Plains study area. General characteristics The deposition of aquifer material dates back two to six million years, from the late Miocene to early Pliocene ages when the southern Rocky Mountains were still tectonically active. From the uplands to the west, rivers and streams cut channels in a generally west to east or southeast direction. Erosion of the Rockies provided alluvial and aeolian sediment that filled the ancient channels and eventually covered the entire area of the present-day aquifer, forming the water-bearing Ogallala Formation.Gustavson, T.

Retrieved from http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context;=natrespapers In that respect, the process is similar to those currently prevailing in other modern rivers of the area, such as the Kansas River and its tributaries. The major differences are time and depth. The depth of the Ogallala varies with the shape of then-prevailing surface, being deepest where it fills ancient valleys and channels. The Ogallala Formation consists mostly of coarse sedimentary rocks in its deeper sections, which transition upward into finer- grained material. The water-saturated thickness of the Ogallala Formation ranges from a few feet to more than 1,000 feet. Its deepest part is 1200 ft. (300 m) and is generally greater in the Northern Plains.High Plains Underground Water Conservation District #1 (Texas) retrieved April 9, 2007. The depth of the water below the surface of the land ranges from almost in parts of the north to between throughout much of the south. Present-day recharge of the aquifer with fresh water occurs at an exceedingly slow rate, suggesting that much of the water in its pore spaces is paleowater, dating back to the most recent ice age and probably earlier. Groundwater within the Ogallala generally flows from west to east at an average rate of a foot per day. Hydraulic conductivity, or the ability for a fluid (water) to move through porous material, ranges from per day.Gutentag, E. D, Heimes, F. J, Krothe, N. C, Luckey, R. R, Weeks, J. B.

Retrieved from http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1337/pdf/C1337.pdf Human and natural processes over the past 60 to 70 years, including irrigation density, climate, and nitrogen applications, have caused higher concentrations of contaminants including nitrates. Nitrate levels generally meet USGS water quality standards, but continue to gradually increase over time. This trend can impact the future groundwater sustainability for portions of the aquifer. Aquifer water balance An aquifer is a groundwater storage reservoir in the water cycle. While groundwater is a renewable source, reserves replenish relatively slowly. The USGS has performed several studies of the aquifer, to determine what is coming in (groundwater recharge from the surface), what is leaving (water pumped out and baseflow to streams), and what the net changes in storage are (rise, fall or no change). Withdrawals from the Ogallala Aquifer for irrigation amounted to in 2000. As of 2005, the total depletion since before development amounted to . Some estimates indicate the remaining volume could be depleted as soon as 2028. Many farmers in the Texas High Plains, which rely particularly on the underground source, are now turning away from irrigated agriculture as they become aware of the hazards of overpumping. Groundwater recharge The rate at which recharge water enters the aquifer is limited by several factors. Much of the plains region is semiarid, with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, the aquifer is overlain, in the vadose zone, with a shallow layer of caliche that is practically impermeable; this limits the amount of water able to recharge the aquifer from the land surface. However, the soil of the playa lakes is different and not lined with caliche, making these some of the few areas where the aquifer can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available recharge area. The prevalence of the caliche is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the aridity increases the amount of evaporation, which in turn increases the amount of caliche in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.

Groundwater discharge ASTER image of a roughly 557 mi2 area of fields (1443 km2) in Kansas watered from the Ogallala Aquifer with center pivot irrigation systems The regions overlying the Ogallala Aquifer are some of the most productive regions in the United States for ranching livestock, and growing corn, wheat, and soybeans. The success of large-scale farming in areas that do not have adequate precipitation and do not always have perennial surface water for diversion has depended heavily on pumping groundwater for irrigation. Early settlers of the semiarid High Plains were plagued by crop failures due to cycles of drought, culminating in the disastrous Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Only after World War II, when center pivot irrigation became available, was the land mass of the High Plains aquifer system transformed into one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world. Change in groundwater storage Ground water levels decline when the rate of extraction by irrigation exceeds the rate of recharge. At places, the water table was measured to drop more than 5 ft (1.5 m) per year at the time of maximum extraction. In extreme cases, the deepening of wells was required to reach the steadily falling water table. In the 21st century, recognition of the significance of the aquifer has led to increased coverage from regional and international journalists.\\"Shrinking aquifer looms as big problem for farms\\" .

This is a decline of about , or 9%, since substantial groundwater irrigation development began in the 1950s. Water conservation practices (terracing and crop rotation), more efficient irrigation methods (center pivot and drip), and reduced area under irrigation have helped to slow depletion of the aquifer, but levels are generally still dropping in areas including southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle. In other areas, such as parts of eastern and central Nebraska and of the region south of Lubbock, Texas, water levels have risen since 1980. The center-pivot irrigator was described as the \\"villain\\" in a New York Times article, \\"Wells Dry, Fertile Plains Turn to Dust\\" recounting the relentless decline of parts of the Ogallala Aquifer. Sixty years of intensive farming using huge center- pivot irrigators has emptied parts of the High Plains Aquifer. Hundreds to thousands of years of rainfall would be needed to replace the groundwater in the depleted aquifer. In 1950, irrigated cropland covered . With the use of center-pivot irrigation, nearly three million acres of land were irrigated. In some places in the Texas Panhandle, the water table has been drained (dewatered). \\"Vast stretches of Texas farmland lying over the aquifer no longer support irrigation. In west-central Kansas, up to a fifth of the irrigated farmland along a of the aquifer has already gone dry.\\" The center- pivot irrigation system is considered to be a highly efficient system which helps conserve water. However, by 2013, as the water consumption efficiency of the center-pivot irrigator improved over the years, farmers chose to plant more intensively, irrigate more land, and grow thirstier crops rather than reduce water consumption. One approach to reducing the amount of groundwater used is to employ treated recycled water for irrigation; another approach is to change to crops that require less water, such as sunflowers.Jeremy P. Meyer, \\"Farmers' tower of power\\", Denver Post, 2 October 2006. Last accessed October 24, 2006 Several rivers, such as the Platte, run below the water level of the aquifer. Because of this, the rivers receive groundwater flow (baseflow), carrying it out of the region rather than recharging the aquifer. The $46.1-million Optima Lake dam in western Oklahoma was rendered useless when the dropping level of the aquifer drastically reduced flow of the Beaver River, the lake's intended source of water.Logan Layden, \\"If you Want to Build a New Lake in Oklahoma, Forget History\\", March 28, 2013, StateImpact Oklahoma Accelerated decline in aquifer storage The depletion between 2001 and 2008, inclusive, is about 32% of the cumulative depletion during the entire 20th century. In the United States, the biggest users of water from aquifers include agricultural irrigation and oil and coal extraction. \\"Cumulative total groundwater depletion in the United States accelerated in the late 1940s and continued at an almost steady linear rate through the end of the century. In addition to widely recognized environmental consequences, groundwater depletion also adversely impacts the long-term sustainability of groundwater supplies to help meet the nation‚Äôs water needs.\\" Since the 1940s, pumping from the Ogallala has drawn the aquifer down by more than in some areas. Producers have taken steps to reduce their reliance on irrigated water. Streamlined operations allow them to produce significantly greater yield using roughly the same amount of water needed four decades ago. Still, losses to the aquifer between 2001 and 2011 equated to a third of its cumulative depletion during the entire 20th century. The Ogallala is recharged primarily by rainwater, but only about one inch of precipitation actually reaches the aquifer annually. Rainfall in most of the Texas High Plains is minimal, evaporation is high, and infiltration rates are slow.Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/10/14. During the 1990s, the aquifer held some three billion acre-feet of groundwater used for crop irrigation as well as drinking water in urban areas. The demand for the water outstrips its replenishment. The water level is particularly on the decline in Texas and New Mexico. Continued long-term use of the aquifer is \\"troublesome and in need of major reevaluation,\\" according to the historian Paul H. Carlson, professor-emeritus from Texas Tech University in Lubbock. It was reported in 2020 that the aquifer would be \\"dry\\" within twenty years.

Early in his presidency, U.S President Donald Trump overturned U.S. President Barrack Obama's decision by signing executive memos in support of the Keystone XL pipeline in January 2017. Conservation Since 2010, the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District, which encompasses eight counties north of Amarillo, including Moore and Dallam Counties, has offered a $300,000 annual demonstration project to conserve water that farmers pump from the Ogallala Aquifer. Participating farmers grow corn with just over half of the water that they would normally require to irrigate the fields, or they plant several weeks later than customary. Pivot sprinklers are used in the project, rather than the more expensive drip irrigation. According to district manager Steve Walthour, conservation is essential considering declining levels of the aquifer. The local non-profit organization Ogallala Commons, named for the aquifer itself, which not only collaborates and supports the local communicates, also works to conserve the Ogallala Aquifer and the surrounding area. Eleven farmers in 2013 participated in the conservation program, with some planting in dry earth, rather than watered soil. They are leaving more space between plants, a technique that retains moisture for a longer period of time. Soil sensors permit farmers to gather accurate information about the moisture level of their crops. The motivation to save water comes from the district's regulations on extracting water from the aquifer. The United States Geological Survey determined the water level in the aquifer has dropped more in Texas than in any other state in the basin. Farmers on their own land may draw water from the aquifer without charge. Pumping costs are low because the fuel used, natural gas, is inexpensive. The North Plains district first established limits on pumping in 2005 and tightened the regulations four years later. Certain wells are now required to have meters. Yet another challenge facing the district is that higher prices for crops have prompted some to plant additional fields and further increase the use of water from the aquifer.

By comparison, a quadrilateral with just one pair of parallel sides is a trapezoid in American English or a trapezium in British English.

Area formula A parallelogram can be rearranged into a rectangle with the same area. Animation for the area formula K = bh. All of the area formulas for general convex quadrilaterals apply to parallelograms. Further formulas are specific to parallelograms: A parallelogram with base b and height h can be divided into a trapezoid and a right triangle, and rearranged into a rectangle, as shown in the figure to the left. This means that the area of a parallelogram is the same as that of a rectangle with the same base and height: :K = bh. The area of the parallelogram is the area of the blue region, which is the interior of the parallelogram The base √ó height area formula can also be derived using the figure to the right. The area K of the parallelogram to the right (the blue area) is the total area of the rectangle less the area of the two orange triangles. The area of the rectangle is :K_\\\\text{rect} = (B+A) \\\\times H\\\\, and the area of a single orange triangle is :K_\\\\text{tri} = \\\\frac{1}{2} A \\\\times H. \\\\, Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is :K = K_\\\\text{rect} - 2 \\\\times K_\\\\text{tri} = ( (B+A) \\\\times H) - ( A \\\\times H) = B \\\\times H. Another area formula, for two sides B and C and angle Œ∏, is :K = B \\\\cdot C \\\\cdot \\\\sin \\\\theta.\\\\, The area of a parallelogram with sides B and C (B ‚â† C) and angle \\\\gamma at the intersection of the diagonals is given byMitchell, Douglas W., \\"The area of a quadrilateral\\", Mathematical Gazette, July 2009. :K = \\\\frac{\\\\tan \\\\gamma}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\left B^2 - C^2 \\\\right. When the parallelogram is specified from the lengths B and C of two adjacent sides together with the length D1 of either diagonal, then the area can be found from Heron's formula. Specifically it is :K=2\\\\sqrt{S(S-B)(S-C)(S-D_1)} where S=(B+C+D_1)/2 and the leading factor 2 comes from the fact that the chosen diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles. Area in terms of Cartesian coordinates of vertices Let vectors \\\\mathbf{a},\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\in\\\\R^2 and let V = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 \\\\ b_1 & b_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\in\\\\R^{2 \\\\times 2} denote the matrix with elements of a and b. Then the area of the parallelogram generated by a and b is equal to \\\\det(V) = a_1b_2 - a_2b_1\\\\,. Let vectors \\\\mathbf{a},\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\in\\\\R^n and let V = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & \\\\dots & a_n \\\\ b_1 & b_2 & \\\\dots & b_n \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\in\\\\R^{2 \\\\times n}. Then the area of the parallelogram generated by a and b is equal to \\\\sqrt{\\\\det(V V^\\\\mathrm{T})}. Let points a,b,c\\\\in\\\\R^2. Then the area of the parallelogram with vertices at a, b and c is equivalent to the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix built using a, b and c as rows with the last column padded using ones as follows: :K = \\\\left \\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & 1 \\\\ b_1 & b_2 & 1 \\\\ c_1 & c_2 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right. Proof that diagonals bisect each other Parallelogram ABCD To prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, we will use congruent triangles: :\\\\angle ABE \\\\cong \\\\angle CDE (alternate interior angles are equal in measure) :\\\\angle BAE \\\\cong \\\\angle DCE (alternate interior angles are equal in measure). (since these are angles that a transversal makes with parallel lines AB and DC). Also, side AB is equal in length to side DC, since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length. Therefore, triangles ABE and CDE are congruent (ASA postulate, two corresponding angles and the included side). Therefore, :AE = CE :BE = DE. Since the diagonals AC and BD divide each other into segments of equal length, the diagonals bisect each other. Separately, since the diagonals AC and BD bisect each other at point E, point E is the midpoint of each diagonal.  Lattice of parallelograms Parallelograms can tile the plane by translation. If edges are equal, or angles are right, the symmetry of the lattice is higher.

An arbitrary quadrilateral and its diagonals. 2\\\\. Bases of similar triangles are parallel to the blue diagonal. 3\\\\. Ditto for the red diagonal. 4\\\\. The base pairs form a parallelogram with half the area of the quadrilateral, Aq, as the sum of the areas of the four large triangles, Al is 2 Aq (each of the two pairs reconstructs the quadrilateral) while that of the small triangles, As is a quarter of Al (half linear dimensions yields quarter area), and the area of the parallelogram is Aq minus As. Automedian triangle An automedian triangle is one whose medians are in the same proportions as its sides (though in a different order). If ABC is an automedian triangle in which vertex A stands opposite the side a, G is the centroid (where the three medians of ABC intersect), and AL is one of the extended medians of ABC with L lying on the circumcircle of ABC, then BGCL is a parallelogram. Varignon parallelogram The midpoints of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral are the vertices of a parallelogram, called its Varignon parallelogram. If the quadrilateral is convex or concave (that is, not self-intersecting), then the area of the Varignon parallelogram is half the area of the quadrilateral. Tangent parallelogram of an ellipse For an ellipse, two diameters are said to be conjugate if and only if the tangent line to the ellipse at an endpoint of one diameter is parallel to the other diameter. Each pair of conjugate diameters of an ellipse has a corresponding tangent parallelogram, sometimes called a bounding parallelogram, formed by the tangent lines to the ellipse at the four endpoints of the conjugate diameters. All tangent parallelograms for a given ellipse have the same area. It is possible to reconstruct an ellipse from any pair of conjugate diameters, or from any tangent parallelogram.

West Easton is located in the Lehigh Valley region of the state, in the greater Easton area. The population of West Easton was 1,257 at the 2010 census. History The Borough of West Easton can trace its origin to the heirs of William Penn. In 1737 the Penns sold 500 acres of land to a James Hamilton, who in turn sold the land to Garrett Moor. In 1772, Mr. Moor sold 200 acres of the land to John Philip Odenwelder, Sr. In 1834 his son, John III laid out the Village of Odenweldertown. Adjoining his acreage was land that eventually became the Village of Mutchlertown in 1872. By 1877, Mutchlertown had 35 frame homes. The Borough of West Easton was incorporated by the Court of Quarter Sessions of Northampton County, PA, on May 30, 1898. However, the Decree of Incorporation was not filed until June 6, 1898, making the June 6 date its official date of incorporation. Its incorporation was strenuously opposed by a large number of property owners and it was a slim majority who signed in favor of it. Only after a heated debate before Judge Schuyler on June 10, 1898, did he deny the minority's objections to incorporation, and a charter granted. Odenweldertown and Mutchlertown were successfully merged and became, The Borough of West Easton. The first Borough officers were elected to office on July 12, 1898. By the 1920s and into the 1930s, West Easton was a hub of manufacturing activity and employment opportunities, with mills producing textiles and small businesses providing services. The population increased to its historical peak in the 1930 census. By then, West Easton had its own school, youth sports teams, a trolley connection, railroad freight and coal lines, a police department, a self-supporting volunteer fire company, and numerous community committees staffed by involved citizens. In the decades following WWII, West Easton felt the same effects of many prosperous towns dependent upon industry that was succumbing to imported goods and production lines that required fewer human workers. Industry in West Easton steadily declined. Population saw a decrease. The Livingston School closed in 1974. West Easton's youth sports programs ended and committees could not retain enough active members. The West Easton Police Department closed in 1965 and police protection was provided by contracting with a neighboring community until contracting was not offered for 2013. West Easton turned to Pennsylvania State Police for protection after failing to find another community who would offer police services. The Safety First Volunteer Fire Company still exists, though it is no longer entirely self-supporting through its social club income, and could use additional volunteers. Despite the challenges West Easton faced it is currently a financially healthy community, having no debt, no bonds floated, obtaining government grants to make infrastructure improvements, and seeing a small increase of businesses taking up residence in the last decade. In 2016, following the installation of new council members, West Easton leadership has concentrated on improving the community by seeking grant awards, and through volunteerism. It created an on-line presence in 2016 with its first working website, WestEastonBorough.com, followed soon after with its own Facebook page to help keep residents informed. In 2017, it began to concentrate on previously neglected infrastructure, including roads and public sidewalks. In November, 2018, West Easton erected its first Public Works Garage for the community that will be completed in multiple phases, as grants are awarded for each phase of the project. In May, 2019, West Easton made improvements to its War Memorial Park with the addition of a War Memorial Fountain and landscaping work, in an ongoing project to be funded with grants. In November, 2019, West Easton swore in a Chief of Police, following years that involved government required paperwork, finding a building and making repairs, purchasing vehicles and equipment, and other needs in re-launching a police department. The roll-out of West Easton's part-time police department is expected in early 2020. Geography West Easton is located at (40.678298, -75.236144).

First formed as a township on February 10, 1913, during the first half of 1920 a number of property owners solicited the courts to change the form of government from a township to that of a borough. Wilson was founded by white supremacists who were opposed to racial integration occurring in the area.Boran, Walt, Editor. (1970).

Historical controversy According to the 1920 book, History of the Northampton County [Pennsylvania] and the Grand Valley of Lehigh, by the American Historical Society, Supervised and Revised by William J. Heller the township was consummated by the courts in 1914, but the court case of Palmer School District v. Wilson School District indicates the township formation occurred on Feb. 10, 1913. The first township supervisors were reported by Mr. Heller as being, William H. Hookway, William A. Moser, and James Martin. The present board at the time of his book was published reports as being David Stout, Harry Transue, John A. Yohe, E.O. Correll, and Floyd Young. This information was later used in the publishing of the Golden Jubilee Souvenir Book published in 1970 compiled and edited by Walt Boran. Walt was the Borough Manager until he died in 2004. But based on page 99 of the Organizational Meeting of the Commissioners dated Monday, January 5, 1914 at 8:15pm of the township records, Jacob S. Stout and Ambrose Jacoby were sworn by Justice of the Peace Samuel W. Ricker as additional commissioners. Present at the meeting were also William A. Moser and James Martin. Jacob S. Stout was elected as President of the Commissioners. William H. Hookway was elected vice president, and that the salary of the Secretary to be established at $150.00.

The first was Palmer School District v. Wilson School District where Wilson owed Palmer for a certain amount of indebtedness caused by the creation of the new township. The other was Township of Wilson v. Easton Transit Co. in 1916 where Wilson leadership sued the transit company for doing work without due consideration to the newly formed township's rights to give permission to do the work. Originally the newly found township lost this case but on appeal to the Supreme Court of PA on May 22, 1917 and Justice Walling ruled \\"The assignments of error are overruled and the decree is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.\\".

It involves topics and development of specialised skills including: navigation and international maritime law; weather, meteorology and forecasting; watchkeeping; ship- handling and small boat handling; operation of deck equipment, anchors and cables; ropework and line handling; communications; sailing; engines; execution of evolutions such as towing; cargo handling equipment, dangerous cargoes and cargo storage; dealing with emergencies; survival at sea and search and rescue; and fire fighting. The degree of knowledge needed within these areas is dependent upon the nature of the work and the type of vessel employed by a mariner.  Navigation  Navigation is the art and science of safely and efficiently directing the movements of a vessel from one point to another. Piloting uses water depth and visible references, while dead reckoning uses courses and distances from the last known position.Chapman Piloting & Seamanship, 64th edition page 48. More than just finding a vessel's present location, safe navigation includes predicting future location, route planning and collision avoidance. Nautical navigation in western nations, like air navigation, is based on the nautical mile. Navigation also includes electronics such as GPS and Loran (Long Range Navigation). Celestial navigation involves taking sights by sextant on the planets, moon, stars, sun and using the data with a nautical almanac and sight reduction tables to determine positions. Accurate time information is also needed. After nautical dusk, navigation at sea referencing the horizon is no longer possible, and after nautical dawn such navigation again becomes possible.Duttons Navigation and Piloting, U.S. Naval Institute Ice navigation involves navigating and operating a ship within sea ice conditions.  Ship-handling  mooring lines. A fundamental skill of professional seamanship is being able to maneuver a vessel with accuracy and precision. Unlike vehicles on land, a ship afloat is subject to the movements of the air around it and the water in which it floats. Another complicating factor is the mass of a ship that has to be accounted for when stopping and starting. Ship-handling is about arriving and departing a berth or buoy, maneuvering in confined channels and harbours and in proximity to other ships, whilst at all times navigating safely. Two other types of operations, berthing alongside another ship and replenishment at sea, are occasionally included. A key ability for a ship-handler is a good understanding of how the wind, tide and swell, the passage of other vessels, as well as the shape of the seabed, will affect a vessel's movement, which, together with an understanding of a specific vessel's performance, should allow that vessel a safe passage. Fundamental to low-speed maneuvering is an understanding of the configuration and handedness of the propeller(s). An effect known as propeller walk will kick the stern of the vessel to port or starboard depending on the configuration and the type of propeller when large variations on propeller rotation speed or changes of propeller rotation direction take place. (In single-screw vessels where the rotation of the propeller is reversed on an astern bell, a standard was established that the propeller would turn clockwise when viewed from astern. This would mean that the propeller would turn counterclockwise when going astern and the stern would walk to port. This aided in docking operations, where \\"port side to\\" was the preferred situation and the vessel would be brought to the dock with a small bow-in angle and backing would flatten the angle, slow or stop the vessel and walk it alongside. An exception to this was the U.S. Sealift class tankers, which used a controllable-pitch propeller, where the pitch and not the direction of rotation was reversed to go astern. These propellers rotated counterclockwise at all times and so the \\"walk\\" was \\"normal\\".) Other variations include what are known as bucket rudders such as the Kortz Nozzle where instead of a conventional rudder a pair of dish-shaped rudders, one either side of the propeller can be swivelled vertically to direct the propeller thrust through 360 degrees. Thus to put the vessel into astern mode the rudder can be rotated through 180 degrees without altering the speed and direction of the engine. Since with the conventional propeller or rudder configuration the propeller is designed to operate at maximum efficiency when going ahead, it produces far less thrust when going astern. But with the Kortz Nozzle, the ahead and astern thrust is the same. Other advantages of the nozzle are the ship can be steered astern which a conventional rudder cannot, and the ship can be steered fully under control to a standstill switching between ahead and astern mode to give complete control over speed. In addition to being fully conversant with the principles of seamanship and ship-handling, a good pilot will have developed his or her sense of 'situational awareness' to a point well beyond that of a member of a ship's crew; his reactions will appear to be instinctive, positive and at all times safe. Most commercial vessels in excess of size limits determined by local authorities are handled in confined areas by a marine (or maritime) pilot. Marine pilots are seafarers with extensive seafaring experience and are usually qualified master mariners who have been trained as expert ship-handlers. These pilots are conversant with all types of vessel and propulsion systems, as well as handling ships of all sizes in all weather and tidal conditions. They are also experts in the geographical areas they work. In most countries, the pilot takes over the 'conduct' of the navigation from the ship master. This means that the master and crew should adhere to the pilot's orders in respect of the safe navigation of the vessel when in a compulsory pilotage area. The master may with good cause resume 'conduct' of the vessel's navigation. However this should never be done lightly. In situations where the pilot is an \\"advisor\\" even though he has the con, the pilot or his \\"Association\\" have no responsibility or liability in the case of an accident. The master, upon realizing there is a dangerous situation developing, must take such action as to avoid an accident or at least to minimize the damage from one that can't be avoided. In some countries and areas (e.g. Scandinavia and the U.S.A.), the pilot's role is as an advisor. However, in practice, they are likely to have the conduct of the vessel, especially on larger ships using tug boats to assist. The general rule of thumb is that a pilot assumes command of a vessel and is not classed as \\"an advisor\\" in the Panama Canal, crossing the sill of a drydock, or in any port in Russia (or, perhaps, all the old Soviet states). This distinction is important because when a pilot is in command, the master can not take any action, but is limited to advising the pilot on any circumstance that creates what he considers a dangerous situation.  Progression in seamanship  An able-bodied seaman climbs a kingpost to perform maintenance aboard a general cargo ship or freighter. In the days before mechanical propulsion, an able seaman was expected to be able to \\"hand, and reef, and steer\\". Training is more formal in modern merchant marines and navies, but still covers the basics. The crew of a large ship will typically be organized into \\"divisions\\" or \\"departments\\", each with its own specialty. For example, the deck division would be responsible for boat handling and general maintenance, while the engineering division would be responsible for propulsion and other mechanical systems. Crew start on the most basic duties and as they gain experience and expertise advance within their area. Crew who have gained proficiency become \\"able seamen\\", \\"petty officers\\", \\"rated\\", or \\"mates\\" depending on the organization to which they belong. On smaller commercial craft, there is little or no specialization. Deck crew perform all boat handling functions. The officers of the ship are responsible for navigation, communication, and watch supervision. Captains must pass formal examinations to demonstrate their knowledge. These examinations have a progression based on the size and complexity of the craft. In the U.S., the progression begins with what is known as \\"the six pack\\", a license that allows fishing guides to operate with up to six passengers.

The population was 5,869 at the 2010 census. It is located 88 miles (141 km) northwest of Philadelphia and 71 miles (114 km) northeast of Harrisburg, in the Anthracite Coal Region. It is completely encompassed by Mount Carmel Township. History Sawmill operator, Albert Bradford, gave Mount Carmel its name because of its elevation and beautiful setting in the mountains. He decided that it deserved a special name and named it after the holy mountain in Israel. Mount Carmel began as a logging town. Coal wasn't discovered until 1790 by Isaac Tomlinson. It took twenty-four years until the first shipment of anthracite was shipped from the borough. Mount Carmel Inn was opened in 1812 by Richard Yarnall and was strategically located on the Centre Turnpike (also known as the Reading-Sunbury Road or Old Reading Road) halfway between Pottsville and Danville. During the latter part of 1854 the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad was completed from Shamokin to Mt. Carmel, which led to the opening and development of a number of collieries in the region. During the same year, the Locust Mountain Coal and Iron Company commenced making extensive openings and improvements upon their valuable coal lands in the vicinity of Mt. Carmel, building coal breakers for two collieries ‚Äì the Coal Ridge and Locust Mountain collieries. The township was erected in 1854, formed from part of Coal Township; by 1862 the borough was incorporated within the township. Mount Carmel was among the first towns in the country to have its streets lit by electricity. Thomas Edison placed one of his first generators plants here in 1883. The Edison Plant in Mount Carmel was the 7th in the world. In the past, there were extensive anthracite mining interests here and in the vicinity. In earlier years, the borough had manufactories of miners' caps, cement blocks, cigars, shirts, stockings, etc., and large silk and planing mills, foundry and machine shops, a knitting mill, lumber yards, a packing plant, and wagon works. Currently that area supports light manufacturing in paper and plastics.

It was named after a Saponi Indian village, Schahamokink. At the 2010 decennial United States Census, the population was 7,374, approximately half what it was in 1950. History The first human settlement of Shamokin was probably Shawnee natives migrants. A large population of Delaware Indians (also known as the Lenapes) were also forcibly resettled there in the early 18th century after they lost rights to their land in the \\"Walking Purchase\\" (also known as the \\"Walking Treaty\\") along the eastern border of the colonial Province of Pennsylvania in the upper northern reaches of the Delaware River in 1737. Canasatego of the Six Nations, enforcing the Walking Purchase on behalf of George Thomas, Deputy Governor of Pennsylvania (1738-1747), ordered the Delaware Indians to go to two places on the Susquehanna River. The city of present-day Shamokin lies along Shamokin Creek. Shamokin was founded in 1835 by the coal speculators John C. Boyd and Ziba Bird, it was early known as Boyd's Stone-coal Quarry, Boydtown, and New Town. The discovery of anthracite coal resources in the region, known as \\"hard coal,\\" became the basis of much industry. Railroad companies, such as Reading Railroad, bought interests in coal and became major employers of the area, building railroads to ship coal to markets and controlling most jobs. Workers gradually organized into unions to develop means of bargaining with these powerful companies. During the nationwide Great Railroad Strike of July 1877, workers in the 1877 Shamokin Uprising at that time marched and demonstrated during the summer period of labor unrest. Shamokin was incorporated earlier as a borough under the Commonwealth constitution on November 9, 1864, and subsequently as a city 85 years later, on February 21, 1949. In addition to anthracite coal-mining, it became an industrial center in the 19th century, with silk and knitting mills, stocking and shirt factories, wagon shops, ironworks, and brickyards. The dominant Eagle Silk Mill became the largest textile manufacturing building under one roof in the United States. Famous inventor, scientist and entrepreneur Thomas A. Edison (1847-1931), briefly a resident of nearby Sunbury, established the Edison Illuminating Company of Shamokin in the fall of 1882. When the Shamokin power generating station on Independence Street started on September 22, 1883, St. Edward's Roman Catholic Church which was connected, became the first church in the world to be lit by electricity. Until 2017, Jones Hardware Company was located at the Independence Street site of the former 1882 Edison electrical station in Shamokin.) In the 1877 Shamokin Uprising, railroad workers and miners angered by unexpected cuts in wages begun by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) joined what developed across the East with the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, which began with strikes in neighboring Martinsburg, West Virginia, then others in Maryland including the headquarters of the B&O; at its Camden Street Station in downtown Baltimore then spread north and west into Pennsylvania and to Pittsburgh and other sites conducted in several major industrial cities in Pennsylvania, as well as more cities in the Northeast and as far west through to St. Louis and Missouri. Mayor William Douty commissioned a citizen manned local militia unit to help during the unrest. They shot into a group of strikers, wounding 12 and killing two bystanders who were not even involved in the protest. Five strikers were convicted of rioting and jailed for up to eight months for their part in the actions. At the turn of the 20th century, resident William A. Conway wrote Murder at Hickory Ridge (1905) as a \\"dime novel\\", hoping to cash in on their popularity. It was a fictionalized account of an unsolved murder in the Shamokin area. His two brothers, Alphonsus E. and John J., printed the book on a press in their garage. They continued their business, starting the Conway Print Shop. With the profits from the sale of the novel, the Conway brothers later started the Black Diamond Publishing Company in 1905 and founded Black Diamond Magazine to disseminate news of the anthracite coal region. The brothers developed a way to print a roll of tickets, planning to market them to the new movie theaters being built in the area. To meet a request by the nearby Hazleton Baseball Club, they partnered with merchant Nicholas R. Ludes to make a big purchase of colored paper. Together the Conway brothers and Ludes founded what became the National Ticket Company, located in Shamokin since 1907. At one time it was the largest ticket manufacturing company in the United States. Their first production facility was built in 1911 at the corner of Pearl and Webster Streets. A 1942 fire gutted the plant, although the brick shell still stands. The replacement building at Pearl Street and Ticket Avenue was completed in 1950 and has since served as company headquarters. The business is still owned by descendants of the Conway and Ludes families. In the 21st century National Ticket has developed international customers as well to grow its business. Edgewood Park, also known as Indian Park, was operated in Shamokin as an increasing popular amusement park from 1905 through the late 1950s, featuring a roller coaster and other rides and entertainments, and attracting regional crowds. Its included a large pond. Faced with different needs in the 1950s, the Shamokin area school district developed this property for new elementary and high schools. The Victoria Theatre in town was listed on the National Register of Historic Places maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1985. It unfortunately was demolished in 2004 and delisted. Decline From the post- World War II period, there has been massive restructuring in the railroad and other industries, causing a massive loss of jobs in areas that had enjoyed industrial prosperity, with good working incomes for union people. In addition, there has been pressure on the coal industry due to changes in law to improve air, water, and land quality and prevent environmental contamination. By the early 21st century, Shamokin was part of an economically depressed area. In June 2014, Shamokin was approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development for Act 47 Distressed City status after several banks refused it loans for outstanding bills. The designation enables loans from the Commonwealth. Shamokin city officials are required to develop a plan to achieve long-term financial stability and eligibility to leave the program. Only one city in Pennsylvania has ever exited Act 47 status by 2015. In February 2015, the city was approved to raise its earned income tax to 2 percent a week. Out of the total revenue generated from the tax, 50 percent would go to the school district. By law, municipalities can tax citizens only 1 percent a week in the earned income tax, but financially distressed cities can petition the courts to increase it to 2 percent a week. In December 2013, Shamokin City Council cut several full- time police officer positions in an effort to reduce budget overruns into compliance. The Shamokin City Council unanimously approved a 2015 budget of $3.7 million setting property taxes at 58.1 mills. Salaries and benefits of city employees cost $1,956,257, which is 69 percent of all general fund spending. The 2014 real estate tax levy is 47.35 mills. The city adopted a $2.3 million budget in 2014. Bartos had received a $9,350 raise approved by city council in 2012. He had successfully applied for several grants including: $3.4 million for a creek channel preservation project, a grant to expand Claude Kehler Community Park, and another to restore the \\"99 steps,\\" a city landmark.

It is located in Central Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River Valley on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, just downstream of the confluence of its main and west branches. It dates to the early 18th century and is the county seat of Northumberland County. Thomas Edison features in the town's history, and the historic Edison Hotel was renamed in his honor. Other historic sites include the Beck House, Northumberland County Courthouse, and Sunbury Historic District, all listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Sunbury is the principal city in the Sunbury, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area and one of three principal cities in the Bloomsburg-Berwick-Sunbury, PA Combined Statistical Area. Sunbury's population was 9,905 at the 2010 census. History Monument to Thomas Edison near Sunbury The first human settlement of Sunbury was probably Shawnee migrants.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 192. A large population of Delaware Indians was also forcibly resettled there in the early 18th century after they lost rights to their land in the Walking Purchase. Canasatego of the Six Nations, enforcing the Walking Purchase of behalf of George Thomas, Deputy Governor of Pennsylvania, ordered the Delaware Indians to go to two places on the Susquehanna River, one of which was present-day Sunbury. From 1727 to 1756, Sunbury was one of the largest and most influential Indian settlements in Pennsylvania. At that time, it was known as Shamokin, not to be confused with the present-day city of Shamokin, Pennsylvania, which is located to the east. In 1745, Presbyterian missionary David Brainerd described the city as being located on both the east and west sides of the river, and on an island. Brainerd reported that the city housed 300 Indians, half of which were Delawares and the other Seneca and Tutelo.Rev. John Edwards, ed., Memoirs of the Rev. David Brainerd, New Haven, 1822, p. 233. In 1754, much of the land west of the Susquehanna was transferred from the Six Nations to Pennsylvania at the Albany Congress. However, Shamokin was not sold and was reserved by the Six Nations, \\"to settle such of our Nations as shall come to us from the Ohio or any others who shall deserve to be in our Alliance.\\"Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 215. According to Weslager, \\"the Pennsylvania authorities had no opposition to the Six Nations reserving Wyoming and Shamokin from the sale, since friendly Delawares, including Teedyuskung (also known as Teedyuscung) and his people living in those settlements--and any other Indians who might be placed there--constituted a buffer against Connecticut.\\" The French and Indian War brought fighting to much of the region. The Delaware Indian residents of Shamokin remained neutral for much of the early part of the war, in part because a drought and unseasonable frost in Shamokin in 1755 left them without provisions.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: New Brunswick, p. 225-227. However, the Delaware Indians at Shamokin joined the war against Pennsylvania and the English after the Gnadenhutten massacre in 1755.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 229. Pennsylvania Fort Augusta was built in 1756 at Shamokin. Read more about early history of Sunbury in Shamokin (village). Bloody Springs is a historic site from the era. On March 21, 1772, Northumberland County was incorporated and subdivided. The settlement of Shamokin was renamed Sunbury that same year, and the present-day city of Sunbury identifies 1772 as the date of its establishment. It was named after Sunbury-on-Thames, a town in the Surrey borough of Spelthorne, England, just outside Greater London. Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist of Mozart and of Salieri, lived in Sunbury for some years after his arrival in America. Thomas Edison installed the first successful three-wire electric lighting system in July 1883 at what was then known as the City Hotel. At the city's 150th anniversary celebration in 1922, it was renamed the Edison Hotel. Geography Walking path in Sunbury Floodwall in Sunbury Sunbury is at (40.863894, -76.789174).

The population was 705 at the 2010 census. Geography Church in Turbotville Turbotville is located at (41.102454, -76.771188). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.4 square mile (1.2 km2), all land. Turbotville is located in the Upper Susquehanna Valley in the north-central part of Pennsylvania. Turbotville is the northernmost town in Northumberland County and is surrounded on all sides by Lewis Township. History A petition from the inhabitants of Turbotville (formerly spelled Tributville) for incorporation as a borough was presented to the Northumberland County Court of Quarter Sessions at the April term in 1858 and favorably considered by the grand jury. Remonstrances having been filed at the following August term, Andrew J. Muffly was appointed as commissioner to take depositions in the matter; his report was considered at November session, 1858 and on January 3, 1859, a decree of court was granted for the incorporation of the borough. The \\"Charter for the Incorporation of Turbutville in to a Borough\\", a handwritten account of the incorporation of Turbotville Borough, is duly noted on three consecutive pages (379-381) in a deed book dated April 6, 1859 located at the Northumberland County Courthouse in Sunbury. No reference has yet been obtained as to when the spelling of the town's name was changed from Tributville to Turbotville. The original name was Snydertown, named for Philip Reifsnyder, who is believed to be one of the first settlers of the area. Reifsnyder, a blacksmith by trade, built a tavern southwest of the intersection of Main and Paradise streets which was operated by his wife. He also operated a blacksmith shop southeast of the intersection of Main and Church Streets. Prior to being incorporated, the town name was changed to Tributville (spelled Turbotville today) because the town then lay within the confines of Turbot Township, then later Lewis Township. The name was derived from Colonel Turbutt Francis. After his service in several wars, Colonel Francis was compensated for his service with a land grant called the \\"Colonel's Reward\\" which encompasses much of the area south of Turbotville including present day Turbot Township. Although Mr. Reifsnyder was one of the earliest known settlers of the town, he was not the first land owner. The greater part of the site of the borough was once owned by Jacob Sechler and wife Catherine who received a land grant from then Governor Thomas Penn, son of William Penn. The land grant afforded Mr. Sechler was named \\"Green Lawn\\" and included present day Main Street, Church Street, the Turbotville Cemetery, and extended into present day Lewis Township. Religion Turbotville, early on, was greatly defined by its townspeople's religious beliefs, so much so, that the town of currently 700+ residents once boasted four churches within the current Borough limits. Those consisting of Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church on Paradise Street, Trinity United Church of Christ (formerly the German Reformed Church) on Church Street, St. James Lutheran Church (later Holy Spirit Lutheran Church) on Church Street, and the Turbotville Baptist Church which formerly stood on the south block of Broadway Street. Zion and Trinity still have strong congregations within the Borough. Holy Spirit moved to a new location south of the Borough in Lewis Township and the former church building is now under private ownership. The Turbotville Baptist Church, formerly on Broadway Street, was razed several decades ago and a newly constructed home, placed in 2009, now stands on the lot where the former church once stood. The Turbotville Baptist Church was last used in 1948 after the passing of the last Pastor for that congregation, Reverend Booth. Years later a new Baptist Church, not affiliated with the Broadway St. church, was erected just east of the Borough on State Route 54 in Lewis Township. The Turbotville Baptist Church (now Bethel Baptist Church) also boasts a strong congregation. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 691 people, 278 households, and 190 families residing in the borough. The population density was 1,546.9 people per square mile (592.9/km2). There were 302 housing units at an average density of 676.1 per square mile (259.1/km2). The racial makeup of the borough was 99.13% White, 0.14% African American, 0.14% Native American, and 0.58% from two or more races. There were 278 households, of which 37.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.2% were married couples living together, 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.3% were non-families; 27.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The Turbotville Community Hall and Turbotville Train Station are also located at the park. Points of interest Notable locations include the Turbotville Auto Museum. Education The borough is part of the Warrior Run School District, which encompasses Watsontown, Dewart, McEwensville, Exchange, Lewis Township, Delaware Township, a small portion of Gregg Township in Union County, and other outlying areas. The Warrior Run School District is unique in Pennsylvania in that it stretches across county boundary lines and services portions of Northumberland, Montour and Union Counties. The Turbotville Elementary School is located in the borough, and the Middle School/High School complex is located in Lewis Township on Susquehanna Trail. The original Turbotville High School was a wood-framed structure erected on present day Church Street on the site of the current Turbotville Community Park pavilion. Having become too costly to heat the two-story structure, a new brick high school was erected on Pine Street in 1937. That building has undergone several renovations and additions, and is today the current Turbotville Elementary School. In 1958, a new high school was built on present day Susquehanna Trail. Then in 1968, yet another new high school building was erected on the same site and the former 1958 high school became the Warrior Run Middle School.

It tells the story of the narrator's struggle to overcome the psychological damage inflicted by his dysfunctional childhood in South Carolina. Conroy and Becky Johnston adapted the screenplay. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but received none. Plot Tom Wingo, a teacher and football coach from South Carolina, is asked by his mother, Lila, to travel to New York City to help his twin sister's psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein, after his sister Savannah's latest suicide attempt. Tom hates New York but reluctantly accepts, largely to take the opportunity to be alone and away from a life that does not satisfy him. During his initial meetings with Lowenstein, Tom is reluctant to disclose many details of their dysfunctional family's secrets. In flashbacks, Tom relates incidents from his childhood to Lowenstein in hopes of discovering how to save Savannah's life. The Wingo parents were an abusive father and a manipulative, status-hungry mother. The father was a shrimp boat operator and, despite being successful at that profession, spent all of his money on frivolous business pursuits, leaving the family in poverty. Tom is also torn with his own problems but hides behind what he calls \\"the Southern way\\"‚Äîlaughing at things instead of crying. For example, his wife Sallie is having an affair, and her lover wants to marry her. Tom and Lowenstein begin to have feelings for each other. After Tom discovers that she is married to Herbert Woodruff, a famous concert violinist, Lowenstein introduces Tom to her son Bernard, who is being groomed to become a musician as well but who secretly wants to play football. Tom starts coaching Bernard along with attending sessions with Lowenstein to help his sister. Tom discovers that Savannah has been in such a dissociated state that she even had a different identity, Renata Halpern. As Halpern, she wrote books to disguise the Savannah side of her troubled life. Tom confronts Lowenstein over not revealing this information before, and they argue, during which she throws a dictionary at him. To apologize, she asks him to dinner, and their relationship becomes closer. Tom has a fateful meeting with his mother and stepfather, bringing up painful memories. Tom reveals that, when he was 13 years old, three escaped convicts invaded his home and raped him, his mother, and his sister. His older brother, Luke, killed two of the aggressors with a shotgun, while his mother stabbed the third with a kitchen knife. They buried the bodies beneath the house and never spoke of it again. Tom bursts into tears, having now let loose a key piece of Savannah's troubled life. After discovering that Tom has been coaching Bernard, Herbert orders Bernard to stop his football pursuits, return to his music lessons, to prepare to leave for Tanglewood, a prestigious music academy. Tom is invited to a dinner at Lowenstein's home, along with poets and intellectuals. Herbert is overtly rude and reveals that Tom's sister is in therapy with his wife. Infuriated, Lowenstein voices her suspicions about her husband's affair. Tom takes Herbert's \\"million dollar\\" violin and threatens to throw it off the high-rise balcony unless Herbert apologizes. Tom throws the violin in the air, Herbert nervously apologizes, and Tom catches the violin before it falls. Tom spends a romantic weekend with Lowenstein at her country house. Savannah recovers and is released from the hospital. This recovery is due to finally learning about things she has repressed from her childhood, most notably the rapes. Her first suicide attempt at age 13 was after the rapes and murders of the three convicts. Tom then receives a call from his wife, who has finally decided she wants him back. He loves both Lowenstein and his wife, and tells Lowenstein he doesn't love his wife more, \\"just longer.‚Äù Tom ends his relationship with Lowenstein and reunites with his wife and family, but wishes that two lives could be given to each man and woman. He is happy in his renewed life, after finally working out the traumatic events in his past with Lowenstein's help. Tom thinks of her daily as he reaches the top of the bridge on his drive home from work. Her name comes to him as a kind of prayer, a blessing.

Other locations in the South Carolina Lowcountry included St. Helena Island and Fripp Island. The Prince of Tides wrapped production in New York in September 1990.  Reception =Critical reception Pat Conroy gave Streisand a copy of his novel The Prince of Tides with the inscription: \\"To Barbra Streisand: The Queen of Tides...you are many things, Barbra, but you're also a great teacher...one of the greatest to come into my life. I honor the great teachers and they live in my work and they dance invisibly in the margins of my prose. You've honored me by taking care of it with such great seriousness and love. Great thanks, and I'll never forget that you gave 'The Prince of Tides' back to me as a gift.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three and 1/2 stars out of four, praising Streisand's directing. Ebert wrote, \\"By directing one good film, you prove that you had a movie inside of you. By directing two, you prove you are a real director\\". He called the film \\"an assured and very serious love story that allows neither humor nor romance to get in the way of its deeper and darker subject\\", adding that \\"Streisand shows herself as a director who likes emotional stories - but doesn't simplify them, and pays attention to the human quirks and strangeness of her characters\\". Variety wrote: \\"A deeply moving exploration of the tangled emotions of a dysfunctional Southern family, this lovingly crafted (though unevenly scripted) film of Pat Conroy‚Äôs novel centers on Nick Nolte‚Äôs performance of a lifetime. Bringing her usual strengths of character to her role as Nolte‚Äôs psychiatrist/lover, Barbra Streisand marks every frame with the intensity and care of a filmmaker committed to heartfelt, unashamed emotional involvement with her characters\\". Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote: \\"The results may seem overripe and dated in spots, but (Streisand) coaxes a fine performance out of Nolte, and the other actors (herself included) acquit themselves honorably\\". As of April 2020, The Prince of Tides holds a rating of 69% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"Although the central romance arguably suffocates the heart of the drama, a moving performance by Nick Nolte and Barbra Streisand's deft direction give The Prince of Tides a soulful edge.\\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prince_of_tides Box office The Prince of Tides was a critical and box office success, opening at number four at the US box office with a weekend gross of $10,035,412, behind Hook, Beauty and the Beast, and Father of the Bride. It remained in the top 10 for seven weeks. Eventually the film grossed $74,787,599 in the United States and Canada with $61 million made overseas, for a worldwide total of $135 million. The film was among the top 20 highest-grossing movies of the year at the box office. Awards Although the film, its cast, and its crew received many nominations for Academy Awards, Best Director was not among these, while Best Picture was. At the following year's Oscar ceremonies, host Billy Crystal sang, to the tune of \\"Don't Rain on My Parade,\\" \\"did this film direct itself? \\"Hal Lipper. \\"Oscars make moves beyond mainstream,\\" St. Petersburg Times, April 1, 1992. The following year, when A Few Good Men joined The Prince of Tides and the previous year's Awakenings in being nominated for the latter award, but not the former, Columbia Pictures president Mark Canton issued a statement, \\"This is unfortunately the third year in a row that Columbia has had a film nominated for Best Picture that seemingly directed itself.\\"Wire reports. \\"Film notes,\\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram, February 20, 1993, page 2D ;Wins * Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama - Nick Nolte * Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor - Nick Nolte * Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor - Nick Nolte ;Nominations * Academy Award for Best Picture * Academy Award for Best Actor - Nick Nolte * Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress - Kate Nelligan * Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay - Becky Johnston and Pat Conroy * Academy Award for Best Art Direction ‚Äì Set Decoration - Paul Sylbert and Caryl Heller * Academy Award for Best Cinematography - Stephen Goldblatt * Academy Award for Original Music Score - James Newton Howard * Golden Globe Award for Best Director - Barbra Streisand * Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama * Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures - Barbra Streisand * WGA Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium - Becky Johnston and Pat Conroy * American Society of Cinematographers Award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Theatrical Releases - Stephen Goldblatt  Differences from novel  While the film was a box office hit and raised Streisand's reputation as a director, its numerous changes from the original novel upset some Conroy purists. Conroy and Johnston eliminated most of the novel's flashback scenes. They describe Tom Wingo's relationship with his siblings in great detail. In the novel, these flashbacks form the main plot and take up more of the novel than the romance between Streisand's character, Dr. Lowenstein, and Tom Wingo. The removal of the flashbacks makes the relationship between Wingo and Lowenstein the central story in the film, whereas in the novel, it is not. Another character in the novel - the second Wingo brother, Luke, who appears only in flashbacks onscreen - is vitally important to the novel, and his death is a major plot point. In fact, the title of the book derives from a poem written by Savannah about Luke and his struggle against the government after the seizure of Colleton. In the film, \\"The Prince of Tides\\" is the title of a book of poetry written by Savannah and dedicated to Tom. Luke only appears intermittently, and his death is only vaguely described. Soundtrack Streisand initially hired English composer John Barry to write a score for the film, but Barry eventually left due to creative differences. In a 7 March 1996 Cinemusic conference interview, Barry explained his exodus from the film, stating, \\"I was asked by Barbra Streisand to do The Prince of Tides - I live in New York, she lives in Los Angeles - and I went and met with her, and she showed me some footage, and she said, 'Why aren't you moving to Los Angeles?' and I said, 'Absolutely not.' And she said, 'Well, I like to know what's going on' - Barbra's an extreme case, by the way - and I said, 'Even if I did move to Los Angeles, I have no desire to meet with you once I know what I'm going to do. I can't work with someone over my shoulder, absolutely no way.'\\"Hoshowsky, Robert. \\"John Barry; The Gstaad Memorandum\\". Industry Central, 7 March 1996. Retrieved 20 November 2011. Barry later retitled his theme for The Prince of Tides \\"Moviola\\" and it was released on his 1992 movie theme album of the same name.\\"The Prince of Tides: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1991)\\". Barbara-Archives.com. Retrieved 20 November 2011. The theme also appeared in Barry's 1995 score for the 3D IMAX film Across the Sea of Time, retitled \\"Flight Over New York\\". The final film score was composed by James Newton Howard and released 12 November 1991. It was well received by critics and garnered Howard his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, though it lost to Alan Menken's music for Beauty and the Beast. The soundtrack contains two songs by Streisand, although they did not appear in the film (one of those songs, \\"Places That Belong To You\\", was at one point intended for the film's end credits, but replaced with new music by Howard in the released version). The film also includes songs and music that do not appear on any soundtracks. Cultural impact * In the 1993 episode of The Simpsons, Selma's Choice, Marge's childhood flashbacks are similar to this, then Marge says \\"Wait a minute, that was Prince of Tides\\". In the 1994 episode, Fear of Flying, Marge thinks her psychiatrist is called Lowenstein (the name of the psychiatrist from this movie) even though it's not her actual name.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102713/movieconnections ReferencesExternal links   * Barbra Archives Prince of Tides page with cut scenes, and laser disc details *The Prince of Tides: The Artist‚Äôs Mirror an essay by Bruce Eder at the Criterion Collection Category:1991 films Category:1991 romantic drama films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Barbra Streisand Category:Films about psychiatry Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on romance novels Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Films with screenplays by Becky Johnston Category:Films featuring a Best Drama Actor Golden Globe winning performance Category:Films shot in South Carolina Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films shot in Washington (state) Category:Films scored by James Newton Howard Category:Barwood Films films Category:Films about child sexual abuse Category:Films about child abuse Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Psychotherapy in fiction Category:Films about rape Category:Films based on works by Pat Conroy Category:Films produced by Barbra Streisand Category:1991 drama films ","title":"The Prince of Tides"},{"id":"133551","text":"Buffalo Township is a township in Perry County, Pennsylvania, United States.

The population was 4,994 at the 2010 census. The Delaware River, which marks the eastern boundary of the township, joins the Lackawaxen River at Lackawaxen Village. The housing communities Fawn Lake Forest and Masthope Mountain are in the township. History The European-American settlement in 1798 adopted the Lenape name Lackawaxen, meaning \\"swift waters,\\" after the river that flows twelve miles through the township. Bands of both Algonquian- speaking Lenape and Iroquoian-speaking Seneca lived in the area through the early 19th century. Neither tribe had any substantial villages in the area, and they used the land as hunting grounds. Their tools, pot shards and bone fragments have been found at Native American rock shelters and camp sites. The first permanent European settlers in the area were Jonathan Conkling and John Barnes, who built in 1770. In the Battle of Minisink in 1779, 40-50 European colonial settlers were killed in an engagement with a band of mostly Iroquois and Loyalists led by Colonel Joseph Brant, a Mohawk who commanded forces for the British. During the early part of the 19th century, logging was the principal commercial activity in the area. It produced as much as 50 million board feet (120,000 m¬≥) of lumber annually. Workers floated logs downriver on the Delaware to markets in Easton or Trenton. In 1829, the Delaware and Hudson Canal began operating between Honesdale, Pennsylvania and Kingston, New York. In its time, the canal company was the largest private commercial enterprise in the nation. It built 28 locks in Lackawaxen Township alone, raising the elevation of the canal . Some of the old locks are still visible and several lock houses are now privately owned. Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct, built by John A. Roebling, famed engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge, was constructed in 1848 as part of the canal. It is now preserved as a National Civil Engineering Landmark and National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service (NPS). The canal linked New York City with the rich coal deposits of the Carbondale, Wilkes-Barre and Scranton areas, providing fuel for both the city's industrial foundries and heating the expanding number of residences. In 1848, the New York and Erie Railroad was built through the area; although the canal continued to operate for another fifty years, railroads eventually made canals obsolete. At the same time, the railroad brought tourism to the area and new sources of revenue; the rugged countryside of the upper Delaware Valley became a popular destination for urban tourists. Stations were built at Lackawaxen, West Colang and Mast Hope, and elaborate resort hotels soon were developed nearby. They often provided guides to visitors for fishing, hiking and riding in the area. Bluestone quarrying became a major enterprise in the area, starting in the mid-19th century. It was used extensively in the construction of the region's buildings and sidewalks. From 1905 to 1918, western author Zane Grey lived in Lackawaxen with his wife and growing family. His early stories related his experiences of fishing along the upper Delaware. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places is the Greys' home from 1914 to 1918, now preserved by the NPS as a house museum, part of the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River area. Grey was buried nearby in the local Union Cemetery. Physician Orvan Hess was born here. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (3.45%) is water. A scenic area within the Upper Delaware River National Park, Lackawaxen is located about a two-hour drive from New York City. It is also located about twenty-two miles north-west of Milford, the County Seat of Government of Pike County.

Its population was 1,021 at the 2010 census. Located on the upper Delaware River, Milford is part of the New York metropolitan area. History The area along the Delaware River had long been settled by the Lenape, an Algonquian-speaking indigenous tribe that lived in the mid-Atlantic coastal areas, including western Long Island, and along this river at the time of European colonization. The English also called the people the Delaware, after the river they named after one of their colonial leaders. Milford was founded in 1796 after the American Revolutionary War as a United States settlement on the Delaware River by Judge John Biddis, one of Pennsylvania's first four circuit judges. He named the settlement after his ancestral home in Wales. Milford has a large number of buildings of historical significance, many constructed in the nineteenth century and early twentieth centuries. Some are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, while numerous others are included in the Milford Historic District, also listed on the NRHP. Of the 655 buildings in the district, 400 of them have been deemed to be historically significant.\\"A Tour of Milford, Pennsylvania\\" Travel and Leisure (March 2009) The district is characterized by a variety of Late Victorian architecture.

The Pike County Historical Society Museum in Milford includes in its collection the \\"Lincoln Flag\\", which was draped on President Abraham Lincoln's booth at Ford's Theatre the night he was assassinated. The flag was bundled up and placed under the President's head, and still bears his blood. It was kept by stage manager Thomas Gourlay. He passed it down to his daughter Jeannie, an actress who had appeared in the play, Our American Cousin, at the theatre that night. She later moved to Milford and the flag was donated to the museum after her death.

Milford is located on the Upper Delaware River, which divides Pennsylvania's Poconos region from the Catskill Mountains in New York, in what was historically a heavily forested area. When Judge Biddis bought up the land of what was then known as Wells Ferry and laid out the lots for the new town, he generally followed the urban plan of Philadelphia: he laid out High Street ‚Äì the equivalent of what is now Market Street in Philadelphia ‚Äì running to the Delaware River, while Broad Street runs perpendicular to High, creating a grid. At the intersection of Broad and High is a public square ‚Äì just as there is at Broad and Market in Philadelphia ‚Äì and most of Milford's official buildings are located there.\\"2001 Guide to Pike County Pennsylvania\\", Pike County Chamber of CommerceHistorical marker on monument in Milford, erected by the Pike County Historical Society in July 1965. Within the grid, East-West streets are numbered, Second through Seventh, with Broad Street falling between Fourth and Fifth Streets, while North-South streets are named after Judge Biddis' children: Ann, Catherine, George, John, Sarah and Elizabeth. In between both the named and numbered streets are alleys, named after berries and fruit. In contemporary Milford, Broad Street is also marked as U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 209. At its intersection with Harford Street, Route 6 continues north on Harford, while Route 209 continues south on the street. Milford is located on an escarpment above the Delaware River. All waterways there which drain into the river fall the difference in height, creating what is known as a fluviarchy, a network of waterfalls, putatively the most notable one east of the Rocky Mountains. These also provided water power to mills, which contributed to Milford's economy in the 19th century.

It tells the story of military lawyers at a court-martial who uncover a high-level conspiracy in the course of defending their clients, two United States Marines accused of murder. It opened on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre in New York on November 15, 1989, in a production directed by Don Scardino, with Tom Hulce as LTJG Kaffee, Megan Gallagher as LCDR Joanne Galloway, and Stephen Lang as Col. Jessep. Michael O'Hare replaced Lang as Jessep later in the run. Sorkin adapted his work into a screenplay for the 1992 film of the same name.  Summary  Author of A Few Good Men Aaron Sorkin The play takes place after the death of US Marine Private Santiago as the result of an ill-advised, and extrajudicial, punishment labeled a \\"Code Red\\" at a US naval base in Guant√°namo Bay. Private Downey and Lance Corporal Dawson are the two Marines put on trial for the murder of Santiago. The two men are assigned a lawyer, US Navy Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee. Kaffee is an unmotivated lawyer who goes into his cases looking for a plea bargain and the shortest sentence. He seems to be following that path until US Navy Lieutenant Commander Jo Galloway makes an appearance in Guantanamo Bay. Kaffee and Galloway do not see eye to eye as she believes this is a serious case of misconduct while Kaffee cannot be bothered to find out anything more than the bare facts. He even goes as far as trying to drop the case. Santiago had reported witnessing a guard illegally fire his gun at night while off the base, and, therefore, the \\"Code Red\\" was nothing more than retaliation for reporting the shooting: it seemed to be a clear-cut case of two men trying to cover up a mistake and eliminate a loose end. In the course of investigating, Galloway and Kaffee learn that Santiago's effort had been substandard for a Marine stationed at Guantanamo. After Galloway finally convinces Kaffee to make an effort, they spend much of the play prodding information from both men‚Äîthey will not give information without a clear question‚Äîrevealing that they had been ordered to discipline Santiago, but it had gone wrong due to an unknown medical condition suffered by Santiago. This all leads up to the climax as Kaffee finally has all the information he needs. Kaffee goes for the two head men at the camp, Col. Jessep and 2nd Lt. Kendrick. Kaffee puts Jessep in a corner, first establishing that all orders must be followed to the letter, then questioning Jesseps' statement that Santiago was in danger: if all orders are followed, and Jessep ordered Santiago not to be touched, then how could he be in danger? Finally, Jessep explodes with rage and yells, \\"You can't handle the truth!\\" This leaves the courtroom stunned and Jessep being charged with the murder of Private Santiago and escorted out of the courtroom. But this was not the end as Dawson and Downey were found not guilty of murder but were dishonorably discharged for conduct unbecoming a Marine.  Characters  LTJG Daniel A. Kaffee - The main lawyer who defends both Dawson and Downey. He starts as a plea-bargain-happy lawyer and, with help from Joanne Galloway, he develops into a lawyer who is willing to fight for his clients. Pfc. Louden Downey - one of the two men accused of the murder of Santiago. He is the quiet member of the two soldiers and lets Cpl. Dawson do the talking for him. LCDR Joanne Galloway - a hardworking and determined lawyer who finds and brings light to the murder case. CAPT Isaac Whitaker - the commanding officer in Washington. He sends Galloway to Guantanamo Bay. Lt. Jack Ross - the lawyer who oversees prosecuting Dawson and Downey. Cpt. Matthew A. Markinson - worked with Jessep and suggested moving Santiago. Lt. Col. Nathan R. Jessep - the commanding officer in Guantanamo Bay. He ordered the \\"Code Red\\" of Private Santiago. LCpl. Harold W. Dawson - one of the two men accused of the murder of Private Santiago. 1Lt Jonathan James Kendrick - Santiago's platoon commander. Play Sorkin got the idea for the play from a phone conversation with his sister Deborah, who had graduated from Boston University Law School and was serving a three-year stint with the Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps.\\"4 Lawyers Claim to be the hero in A Few Good Men,\\" New York Times. 9.16.2011. She was going to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to defend a group of Marines who had come close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins during the first act of the musical La Cage aux Folles while bartending at the Palace Theatre on Broadway.; Several former Navy JAG lawyers have been proposed as the model for the character of Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, USN, JAG Corps. These include Donald Marcari, David Iglesias, and Walter Bansley III. The court martial was Macari's first big court case.Theatre of Dare, North Carolina, \\"A Few Good Men - The Real Story\\" , Accessed July 31, 2008 However, in a statement released by his spokeswoman, Sorkin said, \\"The character of Dan Kaffee in A Few Good Men is entirely fictional and was not inspired by any particular individual.\\" Once Sorkin completed a draft, his theatrical agent sent it to producer David Brown, who wanted the film rights. Sorkin sold Brown the rights, getting Brown to agree to also produce A Few Good Men as a play.Three Days, 15 Seminars, One Great Experience by Valerie Weiss, from imaginenews.com Premieres A Few Good Men had its world premiere at the Heritage Repertory Theatre at the University of Virginia's Department of Drama on September 19, 1989.

Jessup, in the second quarter of 2018, with a teleplay adapted by Sorkin from his original script. The broadcast would be executive produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, and patterned upon NBC's ongoing series of live Broadway musicals.; However, NBC has yet to announce an airdate. Variety reported that the availability of Sorkin, Zadan, and Meron may have had an impact, noting that Sorkin had to represent his 2017 film Molly's Game during awards season, while Zadan and Meron (who have produced all of NBC's live musicals) were committed to other projects (such as Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert in 2018, and a later canceled production of Hair in 2019) being produced by NBC in lieu of Bye Bye Birdie, which had been delayed multiple times in order to accommodate Jennifer Lopez's other projects. Zadan died on August 20, 2018, at the age of 69. Awards and nominations The Broadway production earned Megan Gallagher a 1990 Theatre World Award and a Best Actor nomination for Tom Hulce at the 44th Tony Awards.IBDB Production Awards Source material and legacy The play is based on events that took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in July 1986, though various details were changed for dramatic purposes. Members of Rifle Security Company, Windward Side, 2nd Platoon believed that one of their number, Pfc. William Alvarado, was a malingerer and had informed about a Marine firing across the border into Cuba. In a retaliatory hazing (called a \\"Code Red\\"), ten Marines seized Alvarado, blindfolded him, stuffed a rag in his mouth, beat him, and shaved his head. Alvarado was seriously injured, but did not die. Of the ten Marines, seven accepted other than honorable discharges as part of a plea bargain, but three, including David Cox, refused to accept the plea bargain and went to court. Cox was defended by Don Macari. Cox was found not guilty of aggravated battery but guilty of the misdemeanor charge of simple assault. He was sentenced to time already served in the brig and returned to active duty. Cox was honorably discharged from the Marines in 1989. When he saw the film version of A Few Good Men, he was upset at the liberties taken with the event, most notably that the Marines in the case were dishonorably discharged, and considered suing the filmmakers. Cox disappeared in 1994. He was found murdered, along a riverbank near Medfield, Massachusetts.

Coudersport Area Municipal Authority Fracking Wastewater Plant Controversy In early 2018, the Coudersport Area Municipal Authority (CAMA) became involved in a controversial proposal for a fracking wastewater plant near Coudersport. JKLM Energy proposes trucking \\"produced water\\" (fracking wastewater) to a centralized plant for treatment to be located adjacent to the CAMA plant in Eulalia Township when and if the plant is approved and licensed by governmental authorities. The treated wastewater would then be transferred to CAMA for disposal into the headwaters of the Allegheny River. The entire proposal is opposed by many residents of the borough and the county, as well as by the Seneca Nation of Indians who reside downriver from the proposed plant location. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined JKLM $472,317 in 2016 for groundwater contamination caused by the use of an unapproved surfactant during the drilling of a natural gas well. The contamination impacted six private drinking water wells in Sweden and Eulalia townships (Potter County). The Cattaraugus County, New York legislature as well as New York State Senator Catharine Young (R-NY) have joined the Seneca Nation in opposition to the proposed fracking wastewater plant. The Coudersport Borough Council voted to oppose siting the plant near Coudersport. The Coudersport Borough Council's resolution of opposition was forwarded to the Coudersport Area Municipal Authority (CAMA), who has not yet considered it in a public forum.

He was a principal in the Guaranty Paper Corporation, which specialized in watermarking legal & official documents to prevent counterfeiting. The company moved from Cleveland to Coudersport around 1955 because operating costs were lower. Ness, with his wife and son, were living in the Brocklebank home from 1956-57. Ness died there from a heart attack in May 1957. Located in the northern portion of Coudersport is the Coudersport Area Recreation Park (CARP). This sports and recreation park was established in the 1960s by a group of town leaders including Dr. William L. Mitchell, a local veterinarian. It currently has a football field with track & field capabilities, baseball and softball fields, basketball courts, picnic areas and hiking trails. According to historical books at the Penn State University Park library, Coudersport derived its name from a Dutchman named Couder who was a primary funder for the surveying of the future town as a \\"port\\" on the Allegheny River, thus becoming Couder's Port.

The treated wastewater then will be transferred to CAMA for disposal into the headwaters of the Allegheny River. This plant proposal is opposed by many residents Potter County as well as by the Seneca Nation of Indians who reside downriver from the proposed plant location.

Coudersport Area Municipal Authority Treatment Plant Controversy The Coudersport Area Municipal Authority (CAMA) became involved in a controversial proposal for a fracking wastewater plant in early 2018. CAMA services Sweden Township. JKLM Energy intends to truck \\"produced water\\" (fracking wastewater) to a centralized plant for treatment to be located adjacent to the CAMA plant in Eulalia Township, Pennsylvania, when and if the plant is approved and licensed by governmental authorities. The treated wastewater then will be transferred to CAMA for disposal into the headwaters of the Allegheny River. The plant proposal is opposed by many residents Potter County as well as by the Seneca Nation of Indians who reside downriver from the proposed plant location. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined JKLM $472,317 in 2016 for groundwater contamination caused by the use of an unapproved surfactant during the drilling of a natural gas well. The contamination impacted six private drinking water wells in Sweden and Eulalia townships, Potter County. The Cattaugus County, New York, legislature as well as New York State Senator Catharine Young have joined the Seneca Nation in opposition to the proposed fracking wastewater plant. Additionally, the Coudersport Bourough (PA) Council voted to oppose the siting of the plant near Coudersport. The Coudersport Borough Council's resolution of opposition was forwarded to the Coudersport Area Municipal Authority (CAMA), who has not yet considered it in a public forum.

M. Forster, a story of class relations in turn-of-the-20th- century Britain. The film ‚Äî produced by Merchant Ivory Productions as their third adaptation of a Forster novel (following A Room with a View in 1985 and Maurice in 1987) ‚Äî was the first film to be released by Sony Pictures Classics. The screenplay was written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, directed by James Ivory, and produced by Ismail Merchant. Howards End was entered as an official selection for the Cannes International Film Festival and won the 45th Anniversary Award. In 1993, the film received nine Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. The film won three awards, including for Best Art Direction (Art Direction: Luciana Arrighi; Set Decoration: Ian Whittaker). Ruth Prawer Jhabvala earned her second Academy Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, while Emma Thompson won the 1992 Academy Award for Best Actress. Plot In Edwardian Britain, Helen Schlegel becomes engaged to Paul Wilcox during a moment of passion, while she is staying at the country home of the Wilcox family, Howards End. The Schlegels are an intellectual family of Anglo-German bourgeoisie, while the Wilcoxes are conservative and wealthy, led by hard-headed businessman Henry. Helen and Paul quickly decide against the engagement, but Helen has already sent a telegram informing her sister Margaret, which causes an uproar when the sisters' Aunt Juley arrives and causes a scene. Months later, when the Wilcox family takes a flat across the street from the Schlegels in London, Margaret resumes her acquaintance with Ruth Wilcox, whom she had briefly met before. Ruth is descended from English yeoman stock, and it is through her family that the Wilcoxes have come to own Howards End, a house she loves dearly. Over the course of the next few months, the two women become very good friends, even as Mrs. Wilcox's health declines. Hearing that the lease on the Schlegels' house is due to expire, Ruth on her death bed bequeaths Howards End to Margaret. This causes great consternation to the Wilcoxes, who refuse to believe that Ruth was in her \\"right mind\\" or could possibly have intended her home to go to a relative stranger. The Wilcoxes burn the piece of paper on which Ruth's bequest is written, deciding to ignore it completely. Henry Wilcox, Ruth's widower, begins to develop an attraction to Margaret, and agrees to assist her in finding a new home. Eventually he proposes marriage, which Margaret accepts. Some time before this, the Schlegels had befriended a self improving young clerk, Leonard Bast, who lives with a woman of dubious origins named Jacky. Both sisters find Leonard remarkable, appreciating his intellectual curiosity and desire to improve his lot in life. The sisters pass along advice from Henry to the effect that Leonard must leave his post, because the insurance company he works for is supposedly heading for bankruptcy. Leonard takes the advice and quits, but has to settle for a job paying much less, which he eventually loses altogether due to downsizing of its business. Helen is later enraged to learn that Henry's advice was wrong; Leonard's first employer had been perfectly sound but won't reemploy him. Months later, Henry and Margaret host the wedding of his daughter Evie at his Shropshire estate. Margaret is shocked when Helen arrives with the Basts, whom she has found living in poverty. Considering that Henry is responsible for their plight, Helen demands that he help them. However, Jacky becomes drunk at the reception, and when she sees Henry she recognizes and exposes him as a former lover from years ago. Henry is embarrassed and ashamed to have been revealed as an adulterer in front of Margaret, but she forgives him and agrees to send the Basts away. After the wedding, Helen, upset with Margaret's decision to marry a man she loathes prepares to leave for Germany, but not before giving in to her attraction for Leonard having sex with him while out boating. Fearing that the Basts will be penniless, Helen sends instruction from Germany to her donnish brother Tibby to make over ¬£5000 of her own money to Leonard. Leonard returns the cheque uncashed, refusing to accept the money through pride. Margaret and Henry marry, with the pair arranging to use Howards End as storage for Margaret and her siblings' belongings. After months of only hearing from Helen through postcards, Margaret grows concerned. When Aunt Juley falls ill, Helen returns to England to visit her, but when she receives word that her aunt has recovered, avoids seeing Margaret or any of her family. Fearing that Helen is mentally unstable, Margaret lures her to Howards End to collect her belongings, only to turn up herself with Henry and a doctor. However, on first glance she realizes that Helen is heavily pregnant. Helen insists on returning to Germany to raise her baby alone but asks that she be allowed to stay the night at Howards End before she leaves. When Margaret requests this from Henry, he stubbornly refuses and the couple bicker. The next day, Leonard, still living unhappily in poverty with Jacky, leaves London and travels to Howards End to see the Schlegels. When he arrives he finds the pair, as well as Henry's brutish eldest son Charles. Charles quickly realizes that Leonard is the baby's father and begins assaulting him for \\"dishonoring\\" Helen. In his rage, Charles beats Leonard with the flat of a sword, and Leonard grabs onto a bookcase for support. The bookcase collapses on him, which causes Leonard to have a heart attack and die. Margaret tells Henry that she is leaving him to help Helen raise her baby, and Henry breaks down, telling her the police inquest will charge Charles with manslaughter. A year later, Paul, Evie, and Charles's wife Dolly gather at Howards End. Henry and Margaret are still together, and living with Helen and her young son. Henry tells the others that, upon his death, Margaret will receive Howards Endbut no money, at her own request. Dolly points out the irony of Margaret's inheriting the house, revealing Mrs. Wilcox's dying wish to Margaret for the first time. Henry admits to what happened, and Margaret appears to forgive him.

This was considerably larger than that of Maurice and A Room with a View, which led to trouble in raising capital in the UK and the United States. Orion Pictures, the film's distributor, was on the verge of bankruptcy and only contributed a small amount to the overall budget. A solution presented itself when Merchant Ivory sought funding through an intermediary in Japan, where the previous Forster adaptations, particularly Maurice, had been very successful. Eventually Japanese companies including the Sumitomo Corporation, Japan Satellite Broadcasting, and the Imagica Corporation provided the bulk of the film's financing. The distribution problem would be solved when the heads of Orion Classics departed the company for Sony Pictures, creating the entirely new division of Sony Pictures Classics. Howards End was the first title distributed by this new division. Casting Anthony Hopkins accepted the part of Henry Wilcox after reading the script, passed to him by a young woman who was helping edit Slaves of New York and The Silence of the Lambs simultaneously in the same building. Phoebe Nicholls, Joely Richardson, Miranda Richardson, and Tilda Swinton were all considered for the part of Margaret Schlegel before Emma Thompson accepted the role. James Ivory was unaware of Emma Thompson before she was recommended to him by Simon Callow, who made a small cameo as the music lecturer in the concert scene.Jemma Redgrave (Evie Wilcox), who played the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave's character (Ruth Wilcox), is her niece off-screen. Samuel West, who played Leonard Bast, is the son of Prunella Scales, who played Aunt Juley. According to James Ivory, although Vanessa Redgrave was his preferred choice for the role of Ruth Wilcox, her participation was uncertain until the last moment, because she was committed to other projects and it took some time to negotiate an acceptable salary. When she did agree to play the role of Mrs. Wilcox, she mistakenly believed she would be playing Margaret; only when she showed up on set to begin filming her scenes did the person in Hair and Makeup explain that she would be playing the elder Mrs. Wilcox. Music * \\"Bridal Lullaby\\" by Percy Grainger Courtesy of Bardie Edition * \\"Mock Morris\\" by Percy Grainger Courtesy of Schott & Co., Ltd. * 5th Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven (uncredited) The score was composed by Richard Robbins, with elements of the score based on Percy Grainger's works \\"Bridal Lullaby\\" and \\"Mock Morris\\". The piano pieces were performed by the English concert pianist Martin Jones. Filming locations Peppard Cottage in Rotherfield Peppard was used as filming location for \\"Howards End\\" Filming locations in London included a house in Victoria Square, which stood in for the Schlegel home, Fortnum & Mason in Piccadilly, Simpson's-in-the-Strand restaurant, and St. Pancras Station. Areas around the Admiralty Arch and in front of the Royal Exchange in the City of London were dressed to film traffic scenes of 1910 London. The scene where Margaret and Helen stroll with Henry in the evening was filmed on Chiswick Mall in Chiswick, London. The bank where Leonard encounters Helen is the lobby of the Baltic Exchange, 30 St. Mary Axe, London. Soon after filming the building was bombed and destroyed by the IRA. The Rosewood London on High Holborn, which was then the Pearl Assurance Building, represented the Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company. The quadrangle of the Founder's Building at Royal Holloway, University of London stood in for the hospital where Margaret visits Mrs. Wilcox. The \\"Howards End\\" house in the countryside is Peppard Cottage in Rotherfield Peppard, Oxfordshire. At the time it was owned by an antique silver dealer with whom production designer Luciana Arrighi was acquainted. The bluebell wood where Leonard strolls in his dream, as well as Dolly and Charles' house, were filmed nearby. Henry's country house, Honiton, was actually Brampton Bryan Hall in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border. Bewdley railway station on the historic Severn Valley Railway featured as Hilton station.

History When it was first settled in 1831, Ulysses was named Lewisville after Orange Lewis, an early settler and prominent farmer who later became justice of the peace and county treasurer. But the post office and newspaper had always called the town Ulysses, and eventually, in 1968, the town itself was officially renamed Ulysses. Geography Ulysses is located at (41.902838, -77.761017).

Controversy  In the early 20th century, the Ku Klux Klan arrived, giving the town its continuing presence of white supremacists and national significance. The borough has caught media attention in recent years for a local group's involvement in white supremacy and its practice of Odinism. In the 1990s, August Kreis III moved to town and established the national headquarters of the Aryan Nations. He organized the \\"World Aryan Congress\\" meeting of neo-Nazis, skinheads and Klan members held in the borough in the 2000s. A local neo-Nazi and member of the National Socialist Movement, Daniel Burnside, has a Hitler-themed house in the town and has held meetings and demonstrations locally. Speaking in 2019 about Burnside, the president of the Borough Council said \\"There are some people here that are genuinely scared. I think he thrives on that because that gives him a sense of power and control over something in his life. But most of us, I don't want to say we are scared.\\" Six members of an Aryan Strike Force cell arrested for plotting a suicide bombing of an anti-racism protest had held weapons training in Ulysses in 2018. Local authorities and citizens have resisted and opposed any involvement in the group's activities.

Initially settled in 1827, it was incorporated in 1906 from part of the former Rahn Township; it is named for the coal industry--wherein, it was one of the principal early mining centers. Coaldale is in the southern Anthracite Coal region in the Panther Creek valley, a tributary of the Little Schuylkill River, along which U.S. Route 209 was eventually built between the steep climb up Pisgah Mountain from Nesquehoning (easterly) and its outlet in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania about five miles to the west. The town is virtually joined at the hip to nearby Lansford, to its immediate east--as both were founded as company towns on lands owned by and mined by the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company (LC&N;) while technically on opposite sides of the county lines. In truth, the history, business situation, and fortunes of not just the two, but of three towns, the third being the nearby Summit Hill, PA located a few thousand feet upslope were tied in decades of co-development because the LC&N; had built the western terminus of the nation's second railroad, the Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Gravity Railway to ship coal out, and opened multiple mines throughout Coaldale and Lansford and the rest of the Panther Creek Valley in the days when railroads were coming into their own. The town has a bus stop with sign on one side reading \\"Everybody's Goal Is Mine More Coal\\". The area on the western border of the borough is known as Seek. There is a historical marker for \\"Mother\\" Mary Jones located in Coaldale as she organized many strikes and protest on behalf of coal miners around the country for improved pay, safer work environment and child labor laws. She organized a march for child workers that started in Coaldale and proceeded to Mcadoo, PA. At one trial for Mary Jones a prosecution lawyer famously said \\"there sits the most dangerous woman in America... to put down their tools and walk out\\". Herbert Whilden was elected mayor at2content workers 017 History down The origins of today's Coaldale have its beginning in West Penn and Rahn Township. Rahn Township was formed from West Penn Township in 1860. Initially the land was developed for its timber tracts, with only a few farms to indicate an attempt at agriculture.Munsell, W.W., HISTORY OF SCHUYLKILL COUNTY, PA, New York, McNamara Press (1881) The beginnings of present-day Coaldale date from 1827, when John Moser and his wife settled there. Moser was born on May 24, 1805, in Tamaqua and was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Burkardt Moser, the original settlers of Tamaqua. Upon arriving at a site that is present day Coaldale, John Moser built a log cabin on the north side of what was known as the Manila Grove Park. Today, the St. Luke's Hospital is located on this site. Coaldale (alternatively known in the 19th century as Coal Dale) developed from scattered villages. The first dwelling houses (other than Moser's) were erected nearby in 1846 in what was known as Bugtown, located along then main road directly below the current St. Luke's Hospital. Houses were then erected in 1848 at old Coal Dale on the Summit Hill road.Munsell History Gearytown was established in 1866. That village was named in honor of the then Pennsylvania Governor, John W. Geary. Houses in Bull Run were erected in 1864 by the Greenwood Coal Co. run by Charles F. Shoener and William Carter (who purchased the nearby breaker of the same name). Shortly after the mines began working, the population increased, and many new dwellings were built, practically all by the company.History of Coaldale, Pa. 1827 New Wales, or New Coal Dale, began later in 1868 or 1869. Housing on the line of Schuylkill and Carbon counties were erected beginning in 1870. Centerville was located on the south side of Coaldale but was abandoned because of mines located beneath the surface. Coal Dale received a post office in 1871, thereby formalizing the name. The Greenwood breaker burned down in 1874 and in 1878 the Lehigh Navigation and Coal Co. purchased this property. Coaldale was in the midst of the following LC&N; mines - Nos. 4-6, Lansford; Nos. 8, 9, 12, Coaldale; Nos. 10 and 15, Greenwood; No. 11, Rahn; and No. 14, Tamaqua. Coaldale was historically a coal-mining town where the entire region was effectively the property of the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company. This, the railroads the LC&N; put in and a small shirt factory were the main historic industries in Coaldale. Because of the adverse topology, the LC&N; took several decades to survey and drive a railbed with a negotiable grade from Mauch Chunk through Nesquehoning, along the Nesquehoning ridge to Hometown, and then up the Panther Creek Valley from Tamaqua. Coaldale also became the site of a State Hospital that was established to take care of coal miners. During the early years of mining in the Panther Valley, badly injured miners were taken to Ashland or Pottsville. This took a great deal of time. In 1909, the miners of the valley volunteered a pay day for the construction of a hospital, while the LC&N; donated a site for the building and matched every dollar donated. The area chosen for the hospital was Manila Grove, a park near where John Moser had built his first home. The hospital was completed on July 11, 1910. and exists today as St. Luke's Miners Memorial Medical Center.

The film is a remake of Dino Risi's 1974 Italian film Profumo di donna, adapted by Bo Goldman from the novel ' () by Giovanni Arpino and from the 1974 screenplay by Ruggero Maccari and Dino Risi. The film stars Al Pacino and Chris O'Donnell, with James Rebhorn, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Gabrielle Anwar. Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance and the film was nominated for Best Director, Best Picture and Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. The film won three major awards at the Golden Globe Awards: Best Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama. The film was shot primarily around New York state, and also on location at Princeton University, at the Emma Willard School, an all-girls school in Troy, New York, and at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in New York City. Plot Charlie Simms is a student at the Baird School, an exclusive New England prep school. Unlike most of his peers, Charlie was not born into a wealthy family, and attends the school on a scholarship. Charlie accepts a temporary job over Thanksgiving weekend in order to afford a plane ticket home to Oregon for Christmas. The woman who hires him asks Charlie to watch over her uncle, retired Army Officer Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, whom Charlie discovers to be a cantankerous, blind alcoholic. Charlie and George Willis, Jr., another student at the Baird School, witness three students setting up a prank that publicly humiliates the headmaster, Mr. Trask. Incensed over the prank, Trask quickly learns of the two student witnesses and presses Charlie and George to divulge the names of the perpetrators. Once George has left the office, Trask offers Charlie a bribe: a letter of recommendation that would virtually guarantee his acceptance to Harvard. Charlie remains silent, but is conflicted about what to do. Shortly after Charlie arrives, Frank unexpectedly whisks Charlie off on a trip to New York City. Frank reserves a room at the Waldorf-Astoria. During dinner at the Oak Room, Frank glibly states the goals of the trip, which involve enjoying luxurious accommodations in New York before committing suicide. Charlie is taken aback and does not know if Frank is serious. They pay an uninvited visit to Frank's brother's home in White Plains for Thanksgiving dinner. Frank is an unpleasant surprise for the family, as he deliberately provokes everyone and the night ends in acrimony. During this time, the cause of Frank's blindness is also revealed: While drunk, he was juggling live hand grenades, showing off for a group of second lieutenants, when one of the grenades exploded. As they return to New York City, Charlie tells Frank about his complications at school. Frank advises Charlie to inform on his classmates and go to Harvard, warning him that George will probably give in to the pressure to talk, and Charlie had better cash in before George does. Later at a restaurant, Frank is aware of Donna, a young woman waiting for her date. Although blind, Frank leads Donna in a spectacular tango (\\"Por una Cabeza\\") on the dance floor. That night, he hires a female escort. Deeply despondent the next morning, Frank is initially uninterested in Charlie's proposals for something to do until he suggests they go for a drive in a 1989 Ferrari Mondial t Cabriolet. Frank smooth-talks the initially reluctant Ferrari dealership salesman into letting Charlie, who Frank says is his son, take the vehicle out for a test drive. Once on the road, Frank is unenthusiastic until Charlie allows him to drive, quickly arousing the attention of a police officer. Once again being calm and charming in a potentially difficult situation, Frank talks the officer into letting them go without giving away his blindness. After returning the Ferrari and waiting to cross the street, Frank grows impatient and walks into the middle of traffic on Park Avenue, where he narrowly avoids being struck by multiple cars. He then attempts to publicly urinate before being stopped by Charlie out of fear of Frank being arrested. When they return to the hotel, Frank sends Charlie out on a list of errands. Charlie initially leaves the room but quickly becomes suspicious. Charlie returns to find Frank in uniform and preparing to commit suicide with his service pistol. Charlie intervenes and they enter a tense fight, with both grappling for the gun; however, Frank backs down after Charlie bravely calms him. The two return to New England. At school, Charlie and George are subjected to a formal inquiry in front of the entire student body and the student/faculty disciplinary committee. As Headmaster Trask is opening the proceedings, Frank unexpectedly returns to the school, joining Charlie on the auditorium stage for support. For his defense, George has enlisted the help of his wealthy father, using his poor vision as an excuse before naming all three of the perpetrators. When pressed for more details, George passes the burden to Charlie. Although struggling with his decision, Charlie gives no information, so Trask recommends Charlie's expulsion. Frank cannot contain himself and launches into a passionate speech defending Charlie and reminding the country's future elite and its trainers of the value of integrity. After brief deliberations, the disciplinary committee decide to place the students named by George on probation, deny George of any accolades for his testimony and excuse Charlie from punishment, allowing him to have no further involvement in the proceedings. As Charlie escorts Frank to his limo, Frank flirts with a young political science professor, and is returned home by Charlie, where Frank happily greets his niece's young children.

To understand what it feels like to be blind, he met with clients of New York's Associated Blind, being particularly interested in seeing from those who had lost their sight due to trauma. Clients traced the entire progression for him‚Äîfrom the moment they knew they would never see again to the depression and through to acceptance and adjustment. The Lighthouse, also in New York, schooled him in techniques a blind person might use to find a chair and seat themselves, pour liquid from a bottle and light a cigar. Screenplay writer for Scent of a Woman, Bo Goldman, said, \\"If there is a moral to the film, it is that if we leave ourselves open and available to the surprising contradictions in life, we will find the strength to go on.\\" Reception Scent of a Woman holds an 89% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from 44 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"It might soar on Al Pacino's performance more than the drama itself, but what a performance it is -- big, bold, occasionally over-the-top, and finally giving the Academy pause to award the star his first Oscar.\\" The film holds a score of 59 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 14 critic reviews, indicating \\"mixed reviews\\". Pacino won an Academy Award for Best Actor, the first of his career after four previous nominations for Best Actor, and his eighth overall nomination. Some criticized the film for its length. Varietys Todd McCarthy said it \\"goes on nearly an hour too long\\". Newsweeks David Ansen writes that the \\"two-character conceit doesn't warrant a two-and-a-half-hour running time\\".

Frackville is a borough in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States. Frackville is located near the intersection of Interstate 81 and Pennsylvania State Route 61, approximately northwest of Philadelphia and southwest of Wilkes-Barre. Frackville is named for Daniel Frack, an early settler. History Frackville was settled in 1861 and incorporated in 1876, when the villages of Frackville and Mountain City merged to form the borough of Frackville. The name \\"Mountain City\\", however, is still a common nickname for the borough. A past diner and beer distributor were both named after it. Early in the twentieth century, anthracite coal mining was the chief industry of the region, although Frackville remained a predominantly residential community. The Mahanoy Plane, which operated from 1862 to 1931 on Broad Mountain just to the north of the borough, was able to hoist 50,000 tons of coal daily. There is a small patch- town owning the name \\"Mahanoy Plane\\" at the northern foot of Frackville's Broad Mountain. Industrial relics and infrastructure remain in the thick forest north of the borough's youth baseball complex but historical preservation or restoration has yet to take place. In 1922, Frackville had its own independent brewery that was short lived due to Prohibition. Frackville celebrated its centennial in 1976 while James Nahas was mayor. It was a weeklong event from August 22 to 28 which hosted parades each night and brought the community closer together. The borough's 125th anniversary celebration was held in 2001 and had similar events and effects. It culminated with a Frackville Cruise Night that had routes running throughout the borough. 1889 bird's-eye view Frackville sits in the middle of Northeastern Pennsylvania's historic Coal Region, about 4 miles south of Shenandoah. Coal mining has largely ceased in the area. Coal mining was never actually done in Frackville itself; it was, however, a source of transporting the coal through the now-defunct railroad companies. Many of Frackville's residents are employed at local factories, retail outlets, and the numerous Pennsylvania State Prisons in the immediate area. Many more commute daily to the cities of Pottsville, Hazleton, Allentown, Reading or Harrisburg to work. Frackville is indeed surrounded by many prisons. In 1900, the population was 2,595; in 1910, 3,118; and in 1940, 8,035. The population was 4,361 at the 2000 census. Located at Interstate 81 Exit 124, Frackville is a popular stop for travelers. It is home of the Dutch Kitchen, a well publicized restaurant that is a renovated diner. The Schuylkill Mall, a former Crown American shopping mall, resided in the south end of the borough but closed on January 15, 2018 after an official announcement on May 9, 2017 that the mall would close in sixty to ninety days. Frackville Records (later Frackville Multi-Media, \\"Still 55\\") was the home of recording artists Vladimir's Universe and the J Gochis Band in the 1980s; its current status is unknown.

Cody (Buffalo Bill), was postmaster and had a small general store in Girardville in 1869‚àí1874, leaving town to go out west to find Gold. His poem \\"Only a Miner Killed\\" about his experiences as a miner in the region was said to be used by Bob Dylan as the basis for his song \\"Only a Hobo.\\" Another famous citizen was John \\"Black Jack\\" Kehoe, the high constable of Girardville during the 1870s, whose charismatic leadership in the fight for labor rights by the coal miners of the period earned him a place in local, state, national and world history. Jack Kehoe was a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and several divisions of the AOH now bear his name. Kehoe has gone down in history as a member of the Molly Maguires, a group of Irish immigrants who committed acts against the mine and railroad owners and was hanged along with 19 other alleged Molly Maguires in a series of trials. These hangings are popularly known as \\"The Day of the Rope\\". Today, Black Jack's tavern in Girardville, The Hibernian House, continues to be operated by his great grandson, Joseph Wayne and is a popular destination for historians, genealogists, and tourists searching for information on the Molly Maguires, the coal region culture, and their Irish roots. Wayne's exhaustive efforts in the 1970s obtained a posthumous pardon for his great grandfather through then Pennsylvania governor Milton Shapp. John Kehoe, a native of County Wicklow, Ireland, was buried in old St. Jerome's Cemetery in Tamaqua. His gravesite is a historical site maintained by the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Colonel Patrick H.

History Coal mining near Heckscherville Stone along Valley Rd. near Heckscherville The earliest available history shows that in 1831 the entire Heckscherville valley contained only two villages. At this time the valley was called ‚ÄúChapmanville‚Äù after the owners of the coal mines. In 1843 the Chapmanville interests were taken over by George and William Payne. Subsequently, the valley‚Äôs name was changed to ‚ÄúPayne‚Äôs Patch‚Äù. With coal sales increasing, the Payne brothers found it necessary to secure additional laborers. Taking advantage of the famine in Ireland in 1845, they traveled to Ireland to persuade hundreds of families and individuals to move to America. The Payne brothers focused on the Queens and Kilkenny counties, and provided transportation, employment and homes to those who agreed to move. Before the brothers returned to Payne‚Äôs Patch, the valley was populated almost entirely by Welsh with only a few scattered Irish families. However, when they did return with the Irish immigrants, the Welsh started to migrate elsewhere and the population changed to mostly Irish. This influx of immigrants continued until almost the entire population was either Irish or of Irish descent. Because of this, the small valley then became known as the ‚ÄúIrish Valley‚Äù.Irish Valley The August Heckscher family from New York acquired the Payne brothers holding, and changed the name to Heckscherville. Years later the population began to undergo another change. The coal companies, due to a manpower shortage, began to bring into the region laborers from various countries in Europe. Nationalities included: Polish, Lithuanians, Slavs, and Greeks. Today nearly every nationality is represented in the eight miles of the Heckscherville Valley.The Sons and Daughters of the Valley, The Valley We Loved So Well. Print. Irish Festival Heckscherville hosted an annual \\"Irish Festival\\", beginning in 1987 until 2010. This festival celebrated the settlement's Irish heritage, and was the main fundraiser for the village's Clover Fire Company. The members of the volunteer fire company and village residents were the main coordinators of the event. Before his death in 2001, Joseph Callaghan was the main coordinator and chairman of the Irish Festival. During this time, it was considered one of the best Irish Festivals on the east coast. Local hotels would often be completely booked during the weekend of the festival, with people coming from as far as Chicago, Illinois. The festival was also known as \\"Irish Weekend\\"; it featured aspects of Irish culture from food to family. A wide assortment of food vendors provided Irish comfort foods, including Irish stew, potato pancakes, soda bread, scones, and colcannon (a mixture of cabbage, onions, turnips, mashed potatoes). Irish music was also an integral part of the festival. It has been the launching pad for one Philadelphia based band Blackthorne. Other acts who have performed during the festival include The Molly Wogs, Ceann, The Martin Family, The Irish Lads and Irishtown Road. In addition to the stage bands, other entertainment includes storytelling, Irish plays and Irish dancing.Friends of St Kierans Saint Kierans Church Saint Keirans is a Roman Catholic church in Heckscherville. It is the sole church in the town and was built by Irish miners in the 1850s under the direction of John Neumann. Neumann was the first United States Bishop to be made a saint. St. Kieran's is the only church whose construction the Bishop personally oversaw, traveling to the valley on three occasions to oversee the work. Architecturally designed after the tiny country church at Knock, Ireland (which became famous in 1879 due to an apparition of Our Lady of Knock), St. Kieran's was rumored to be one of Bishop Neumann's favored parishes. The little church was named after a parish in Kilkenny, Ireland, the home country of several of the congregation's parishioners. St. Kieran's Church was closed in June 2008, a casualty in the widespread restructuring and consolidation of Roman Catholic churches currently underway in America. Currently there is a group of individuals working to preserve the Church. This group is known as \\"The Friends of St. Kierans\\".

With Don Raye, Mitchum co-wrote the theme song, \\"The Ballad of Thunder Road.\\" The film features Gene Barry and Jacques Aubuchon. The film's plot concerns running moonshine in the mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee in the late 1950s. Thunder Road became a cult film and continued to play at drive-in movie theaters in some southeastern states through the 1970s and 1980s. Plot Korean War veteran Lucas Doolin (Robert Mitchum) works in the family moonshine business, delivering the illegal liquor his father distills to clandestine distribution points throughout the South in his souped-up hot rod. However, Lucas has more problems than evading the U.S. Treasury agents (\\"revenuers\\"), led by determined newcomer Troy Barrett (Gene Barry). Lucas is concerned that his younger brother Robin (James Mitchum), who is also his mechanic, will be tempted into following in his footsteps and becoming a moonshine runner. A well-funded outside gangster, Carl Kogan (Jacques Aubuchon), tries to gain control of the independent local moonshine producers and their distribution points and is willing to kill anyone who stands in his way. The stakes rise when an attempt by Kogan to kill Lucas results in the death of a government agent as well as another moonshine driver (Mitchell Ryan). In a romantic subplot, Lucas becomes involved with nightclub singer Francie Wymore (Keely Smith). He is unaware one of the neighbor girls, Roxanna Ledbetter (Sandra Knight), has a crush on him and fears for his life. When a series of government raids destroy their hidden stills, Lucas's father and the other local moonshiners shut down production \\"for a spell\\" to let the government deal with Kogan in its own time, but Lucas is forced by circumstances and his own code of honor to make a final run. Factual background The film was based loosely on an incident in which a driver transporting moonshine was said to have crashed to his death on Kingston Pike in Knoxville, Tennessee, between Bearden Hill and Morrell Road. Per Metro Pulse writer Jack Renfro, the incident occurred in 1952 and may have been witnessed by James Agee, who passed the story on to Mitchum. Cast * Robert Mitchum as Lucas Doolin * Gene Barry as Troy Barrett * Jacques Aubuchon as Carl Kogan * Keely Smith as Francie Wymore * Trevor Bardette as Vernon Doolin * Sandra Knight as Roxanna Ledbetter * James Mitchum as Robin Doolin * Peter Breck as Stacey Gouge, a rival driver * Mitchell Ryan as Jed Moultrie, a decoy driver * Nicholas Mann Konrad as Robert Mitchum's stunt driver Cast notes *The role of Robin Doolin, Lucas's younger brother, was originally written for Elvis Presley per Mitchum's request. Mitchum personally submitted the script to Elvis in Los Angeles. The singer was eager to play the role, but his manager Colonel Tom Parker demanded Elvis be paid an enormous sum of money, more than the entire budget for the movie, which ended negotiations. Mitchum's son James got the part, which worked well owing to his close physical resemblance to his father. Production In the film Mitchum drove a souped- up black 1950 Ford two-door sedan,(which was later repainted gray) with a custom tank in the back for moonshine liquor and a Ford V8 with three two barrel carburetors, but after it was blown up by Kogan's men, it was replaced with a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500 two-door sedan with the same alterations excluding the carburetors. The 1951 Ford ended up getting blown up by Kogan whose henchmen had planted a bomb which activated when a Federal agent put the key in the ignition to start the car. In the film, there was a closeup of the key being inserted in the ignition - a 1951 Ford was used for that interior shot and earlier interior shots. Most of the scenes were filmed in Woodfin, North Carolina, along U.S. Route 19 and others at Lake Lure. Some scenes were filmed in Beech, east of Weaverville. Scenes include Reems Creek Road, Sugar Creek Road, and the Beech Community Center. Some scenes were actual local moonshine drivers shot with a camera mounted on a pickup tailgate. Many city scenes were filmed in Asheville, North Carolina, including the explosion of Doolin's car.https://mountainx.com/movies/thunder-road-remembering-the-making- of-a-cult-classic-in-asheville/ The stunt coordinator was Carey Loftin. The stunt team included Ray Austin, Neil Castes Sr., Robert Hoy, and Dale Van Sickel. The film's theme song, \\"The Whippoorwill,\\" was sung by Keely Smith in her role as a nightclub singer, and a different studio rendition by her was released as a 45 RPM single on Capitol Records. The film's opening song is \\"The Ballad of Thunder Road,\\" sung by Randy Sparks, a different arrangement of which was recorded by Mitchum and released as a popular 45 RPM single, also on Capitol. Both songs were co-written by Mitchum. In popular culture Bruce Springsteen said at a 1978 concert that the name of his song \\"Thunder Road\\" had been inspired by seeing a poster of the movie, though he didn't see the movie itself. In the episode of Cheers entitled And Coachie Makes Three, Sam and Coach watch the movie - as part of a long-running tradition they have concerning Robert Mitchum movies.

It is located entirely within but is not part of Mahanoy Township. The name \\"Mahanoy\\" is believed to be a variation of the Native American word 'Maghonioy', or \\"the bath salt deposits\\". History Mahanoy City, originally a part of Mahanoy township, was settled in 1859 and incorporated as a borough by decree of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Schuylkill County on December 16, 1863. It was served by branches of the Lehigh Valley and the Philadelphia & Reading railways. Mahanoy City lies in a valley in the Pennsylvania Coal Region and was a major center of anthracite production; the area was embroiled in the Molly Maguires incidents. In 2010, the borough erected the Molly Maguire Historic Park, which features a Zenos Frudakis statue of a hooded miner on a gallows, about to be hanged. Sean Connery, the star of the 1970 historical drama film The Molly Maguires, served as chairman of the advisory board for the park project. The borough's principal industries remain the mining and shipping of coal, although the demand for it has steadily declined since its peak in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1930 the St. Nicholas Coal Breaker was built and went into operation in 1932. A controlled explosion destroyed the breaker in March 2018. Fire clay abounds locally.

Anthracite coal deposits are plentiful in the region. The population was 4,397 at the 2010 census. History In the year 1783, a settler by the name of Thomas Reed traveled through the valley between the Thomaston Mountains and the Gap Rocks. At this junction, several mountain streams converged where this settler built a log cabin and a sawmill on the west Branch of the Schuylkill River, just below the mouth of Wolf Creek.Norwegian Township Administration, The History of Norwegian Township, 2016 Shortly thereafter, he built a tavern on the South Side of the Sunbury Trail on the present site of the Saint Michael the Archangel Church. This tavern was referred to as the \\"Half Way House\\", because it was half-way between Reading and Sunbury.W W Munsell, History of Schuylkill County, PA with illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Some of its Prominent Pioneers, New York 1881 The Sunbury Trail was the first road through Schuylkill County and was known as the Kings Highway which was authorized by the Crown of England, King George III in 1770.The early settlers engaged in timbering as their first livelihood, but experienced difficulty in transporting the heavy logs out of the valley. The rough timber was floated by raft to Schuylkill Haven to the Schuylkill Canal and on to Reading where it was sold or traded for other products. Necho Allen discovered coal in 1799, but it was not until 1814 that any actual mining took place. Dr. McFarland, a scientist, opened a vein at York Farm near Pottsville. Later, in 1818, Jacob Reed, son of the original founder, opened another vein in the Minersville Area.Minersville Borough, Minersville Borough History web site, 2016 English Baptist Church. The completion of the Schuylkill Haven and Mine Hill Railroad provided the means to transport the coal produced in the region. The development of the coal industry grew rapidly and attracted many immigrants. Experienced English and Welsh miners arrived first from their home lands. Next arrivals were the Germans and Irishman, soon to be followed by many other ethnic groups that make up the community. The influx of inhabitants to the community promoted the need to begin municipal planning. Titus Bennett laid out the town in 1830 on parts of two tracts of land patented to Lawrence Lewis and Robert M. Lewis on July 20, 1829, at that time part of Branch Township. On May 2, 1830, Minersville citizens held an election at the home of David Buckwater for the purpose of electing a Burgess. Samuel Richert was elected to this position, as well as the following men who served on the first Council: John Provst, John Patrick, Dr. Anthony Steinberger, John L. Swaine, John B. Hahn, David Buckwater and Daniel R. Bennet. The first president of the Town Council was Daniel R. Bennet; first treasurer, Thomas J. Harman, Clerk, and Milligan G. Gable, High Constable. Minersville was incorporated as a borough on April 1, 1831 by Act of the legislature approved by Governor George Wolf. Minersville School District was involved in a national court case gaining much attention; Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 1940.Minersville School District v. Gobitis This case dealt with a family whose children would not salute the flag or recite the Pledge of Allegiance because of their religious beliefs (they were Jehovah's Witnesses). This case would put Minersville \\"on the map,\\" as it reached all the way to the Supreme Court. The final verdict was that the school district could, in fact, make students stand, salute, and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. This decision came under much scrutiny and would not stay long, as it would be overturned shortly thereafter by West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. 400px Geography Minersville is located at (40.690455, -76.260242). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land.

The merger was shot down by the residents, and the borough has been making financial progress since a new council took the helm. In 2019, the borough had no functioning government after the borough secretary resigned and three borough council members quit. That year, John Raess was elected mayor by two write-in votes and borough council member by five write-in votes. Raess was the only person to show up to the borough council reorganization meeting, meaning there would be no functioning government in 2020. As a result, Mount Carbon may have to merge with Pottsville, which would need to be approved by voters in both municipalities. Another option would be to merge with North Manheim Township, though that would force the borough to change school districts. Transportation Mount Carbon was the end of the original Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, opened in 1842. Mount Carbon was a very active location along the Canal.

History Souls Harvest Baptist Church. New Philadelphia had historically been an anthracite mining town. Because of the high number of Lithuanians and Irish in the area, there was much separation of the two nationalities. This tension ultimately resulted in the forming of two separate Catholic churches; Sacred Heart (Lithuanian) and Holy Family (Irish). There was also a town-wide brawl that occurred as a result of this tension. The dispute was settled by the priests from Sacred Heart and Holy Family calling their respective patrons to stop fighting and buying each other a beer. In 2008, the two Catholic parishes were merged to create Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church. In 2012, the Souls Harvest Baptist Church relocated to New Philadelphia from Port Carbon, Pennsylvania. They are now located at the corner of Kimber and Clay streets in the building that once housed a Methodist church. This building is the oldest building in town.
